Rhetorically, Politics will always indulge technology like its life support while the results, for the most part, is Bad Science. Bad Science: Quacks, Hacks, and Big Pharma Flacks: Ben Goldacre: 9780865479180: Amazon.com: Books. The idea of politics is bad science in and of itself but to add technology to its idea of empowering people makes technology seem bad also. A definition of politics asserts \u201c\u201cactivities associated with\u201d the governance of a country or other area\u201d. This definition, without distortion, can be understood to mean \u2018how governments use technology to empower themselves and others\u2019 and at present day, the mixture of politics and technology has produced President Donald Trump and Obamacare, hence, Bad Science. Another definition of politics is \u201cThe \u201cacademic study\u201d of government and the state\u201d. Today\u2019s political academic study has developed Bureaucracies for Education, Democrats and Republicans switching Parties, and Politics being sustained as a Myth. ",

            "answer_text": "Not really. Politix is where men dream - technology is where the rubber meets the road. Politicos are metaphysicians - engineers are applied physicists. There is this difference between philosophy - which has not progressed much in 2500 years - because that is its nature - tail chasing and navel gazing, regurgitation of old errors in new language, and sophistical evasions of discordant evidence - whilst the engineers have to make things work: in the real world: here and now. Engineering is the Art of the Possible. The same has been said of politix - but mendaciously. ",

            "answer_text": "Absolutely. The real question is it good for democracy? For the most part, the answer is yes. The fact that voters have the ability to have greater access to candidates and their elected representatives through technology is a good thing. On the other hand, if candidates who know how to use a medium such as television or social media can use that technology to defeat a more qualified candidate, then it is a bad thing. Worse still is the opportunity to use technology as a propaganda medium. In reality, the fact that talk radio and Fox news has been used to indoctrinate voters is not the fault of technology. While the purveyors of fake news bear some responsibility for the consequences, the primary fault lies with the people. In an age where the technology has availed us to the ability to rapidly and conveniently determine bullshit from the truth, the fact that we have so many easily manipulated by fake news is a national disgrace.

            "answer_text": "They get along fine when politics needs science to get the job done, and science needs the resources to pay for it: Politics+Science developed the nuclear bomb, went to the moon, and drove numerous medical advances. That being said, science is not much concerned with the opinions of the public, making for an uneasy partnership with politics at the best of times. The scientist doesn\u2019t really care if you don\u2019t like the idea of global warming, that\u2019s what the evidence points at. This makes it relatively difficult for politics and science to get along. For that matter, Communism was developed by taking a \u201cscientific\u201d approach to economics. And while it\u2019s a great system on paper, not many people like it much. ",

During the recent Jamal Khashoggi murder, allegedly by the government of his own country, somehow an audio recording was leaked and exposed to the world exactly how he was killed. His killers were hoping to simply \u2018disappear\u2019 or liquidate him. But that\u2019s an extreme case and a rogue government. Better technology will make administration easier and make it possible for each citizen to easily approach their government on various points and issues. ",
