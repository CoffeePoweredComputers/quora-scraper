            "answer_text": "As a native of the bay area I would say that no San Francisco is definitely NOT part of the Silicon Valley. That distinction comes from the fact that the Santa Clara Valley, which was home to vast prune orchards and other agriculture became in the sixties one of the many suburban development areas around San Francisco (such as parts of Marin, Alameda and Contra Costa Counties as well). Due to the confluence of Stanford University in Palo Alto and the developments in computer technology at universities, including UC Berkeley, Stanford and other schools, the personal computer and digital technology in general rapidly grew. The rest is documented history but The Silicon Valley became the new  vernacular name for the Santa Clara Valley due to the developments taking place there. Ame's Research, and various government facilities around Moffitt Field no doubt added to the critical mass which is why this development occurred around Cupertino and not Berkeley, despite an otherwise similar concentration of intellectual culture.Berkeley has traditionally had an emphasis on physics research linked to government interest in weapons systems while perhaps Stanford was more broadly spread and it's specialties began to be expressed in binary thinking that has led to where we are today with its alumni being such as Hewlett Packard and many others.  San Francisco is simply the nearest cosmopolitan metropolitan area and by default has become a popular extension for those who work in tech industries.At this late date the successful tech companies such as Google and other similarly large and successful ventures run shuttle buses for their employees from San Francisco to their industrial campuses south on the peninsula.  This culture is now hardly limited to the region of the physical Silicone Valley as there are many technology firms in the southern areas of Alameda County as well as Pixar, one of Steve Jobs early purchases which originally was in a warehouse in Richmond and then relocated to Emeryville, which is next to Berkeley and Oakland. After all, when you are done with your sixty nine hour work week in a cubicle writing code and being spoon fed from the company cafeteria, hanging out on El Camino Real in Palo Alto is no competition for partying on Valencia Street or the Marina in San Francisco, if that's what you need to unwind.

            "answer_text": "Yes i think it now is. But it's a little complicated. Although San Jose has branded itself \u201ccapital of silicon valley\u201d it hasn't been for probably two decades. And there's a strong argument to be made that Palo Alto/Mountain View/Menlo have always been the real capital of Silicon Valley\u2014 Stanford, SRI, PARC, HP, SGI, DEC SRC, Sun, Netscape, and now, Facebook and Google. Those cities are mostly in Santa Clara County, but not really the Santa Clara Valley. So I\u2019d argue it's been a misnomer since day 1, and the definition is getting stretched further now as San Jose decreases in importance and the balance has shifted north to San Francisco. When chips ruled the Earth, the South Bay was king. Networking, still a lot down there. These are no longer big growth industries. But software, not so much. AI, internet, IoT \u2014 just not really down there in force. Even VC is becoming much more evenly split between SF and Sand Hill, and the bulk of it now is spent in SF. But since Silicon Valley has never been entirely in the Valley, has mostly left it, and hasn't been mainly about silicon for 20+ years, and there are no good alternative names in the offing, it's probably reasonable embrace an expansive definition.
