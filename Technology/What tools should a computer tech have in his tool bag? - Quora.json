            "answer_text": "Depends on where you are working at, really. When I did DTS at IBM, MCI, etc all I needed really was my Gerber multitool and it's extension kit because everyone had pretty similar desktops. If we needed to rrally tear a machine down it would be brought back to the \u201ctech room\u201d and worked on the \u201cbench\u201d whetr wr had a wide variety of tools. Compare that to when I did DTS for the City of Tulsa; that required us to drive around in a city vehicle and do most work on-site. So our kut there included canned air, a range of screw drivers (normal and precision), flashlight/headlamp, various size neddlenose pliers, anti-static strap, network tester, USB drives, ethernet patch cables, etc. You didn\u2019t want to have to drive back to the main office just because you forgot some tool! Also, carry a partially straightend paperclip, you'd be suprised how often you might need it. Your smart phone is also useful, I highly suggest some type of \u201ccamera magnifier app\u201d so you can see various tiny letters easier, take pics of parts that might need replacement, etc. ",

            "answer_text": "I\u2019d add a working usb keyboard and mouse, maybe ps2 Not only a flash drive, but a bootable OS(ideally one for diagnostics or repair, but anything helps to be able to back up data or remove some viruses). I also carry some opensource or free virus programs. Depending on how extensively you work, carry a simple/commonly support usb wifi dongle and the drivers for it. I\u2019ve seen several people build or upgrade a computer and not have the ethernet drivers nor wireless drivers. If you get on amazon, for about 20\u201335 dollars you can get a tool kit with about everything youd need for alonggg time. Just add the cables and flash drive. ",
