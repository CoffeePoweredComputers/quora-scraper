            "answer_text": "There is a variety of different 3D printers in the market now. Affordable 3D printersSome of them are considered desktop 3D printers, are considerably easier to use, take smaller space and are highly available for the mainstream consumer market. These 3D printers can cost anywhere from 300$ to $1000 (maybe a little less or a little more). Although these are very affordable, they won\u2019t be able to achieve the same results as the high-class commercial or industrial printers can. So, this will either serve your hobbies or be the 1st 3D printer you started learning on.  2. Mid-range 3D printers Then there are the mid-range 3D printers, they start from $1500 and go up to $5000. While these printers don\u2019t have THE BEST quality, they are still better than the affordable options and do require a serious investment. These, too, are vastly accessible for the mainstream markets. Some of the best examples are Ultimaker 2+, Form 2, or Zortrax M200. 3. High-end, industrial 3D printers Companies and engineers that are dead serious about their craft usually go for the best in the market. Purchasing a high-end, industrial 3D printer like the HP Multi Jet Fusion printer is extremely expensive, but it comes with a few perks. First, you get more support after a purchase like that, you gain access to more features and possibilities, and some of that may include testing of any of the future features or printers that are coming up, and finally, you just get so much better quality. That beauty, for instance, will cost you starting from $100,000 up to $300,000 and beyond. So, the price greatly depends on the features and the quality you are buying. Sometimes, affordable printers do the job very well, sometimes only industrial 3D printers can accomplish the job. The process:  The spec list:  ",

            "answer_text": "This is the printer you want if you are asking about printers:Original Prusa i3 MK3 kit Having gone through the struggles of building a MakerFarm kit, then moving beyond the basics of it through Clough42 designed upgrades, and stumbling my way through different software and firmware upgrades, I have learned a very valuable lesson.You can not underestimate the value of the unit being superbly supported. This machine I linked is VERY well supported. The unit has software settings and recommendations, and they get updated, and the manufacturer, Prusa Research, understands the value and desire for people to have the bells and whistles, but also have them working correctly to create a better user experience. I had installed upgrades for a better extruder, auto bed leveling, etc. The unit was not supported on the firmware and software side, so as the community and the printers became easier to use, I was left trying to figure out how to muscle it into working with the latest code. My printer is not operable for a couple years now. I have tried here and there to get it running but it is a huge undertaking trying to hunt down if it is a temp safety or something else, and then once it prints it is all out of sorts. Then I have to move onto more important projects before I can get the machine working well again. When I buy another printer, for myself, or for my work, it will be an Original Prusa Research printer. Look him up, research what he does and how he does it, and the choice will be clear. ",
