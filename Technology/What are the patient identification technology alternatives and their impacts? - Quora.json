            "answer_text": "There are a plethora of options available that hospitals can use as their primary patient identification policy. Sadly, many are still choosing the most obsolete one \u2013 inundating patients with questions. Whenever a patient arrives, officials ask them questions to find the correct medical record. This policy is slow, outdated, and extremely insecure \u2013 anyone can pass themselves off as the patient. In fact, this leads to medical identity theft \u2013 fraudsters buy stolen medical records from the black market and have all the information to pose successfully as the victim. One other policy is to use patient ID wristbands. While this is a tad more secure than asking questions, it can still be taken off a patient and used for fraudulent purposes. Moreover, it is a contact-based solution, and that\u2019s not something hospitals would want after the COVID-19 crisis \u2013 everyone is extremely aware of infection control issues now. The most secure solution is using an identification policy where the identifier cannot be transferred or stolen \u2013 biometric modalities come to mind. There is a caveat though \u2013 patients would be quite reluctant to accept touch-based solutions such as fingerprint or palm-vein scanning. Implement a touchless patient identification policy The best option has been left for last \u2013 touchless patient identification platforms. RightPatient is the leading photo-based biometric patient identification system used by progressive healthcare providers. Locking the medical records of patients with their photos upon registration, returning patients only need to look at the camera and the platform matches the photo with the one saved alongside their medical record, ensuring accurate patient identity verification. There are many patient identification platforms available \u2013 responsible leaders are choosing the one that shares the common goal of improving patient safety and quality of care at their facilities.

            "answer_text": "Patient identification is a great challenge for any healthcare service provider as inaccurate patient identification causes 35% of all denied claims valued at $5 million each year, and identity theft also causes US hospitals to lose $3 million each year. On the other hand, due to medical errors from identity mix-ups, over 1000 deaths take place every day in the US. To overcome this situation hospitals are using a secondary identifier against the patients\u2019 information but medical data theft has become another severe issue hospitals and clinics are experiencing. As a consequence, throughout the healthcare industry, an accurate and secure patient identification system is a must-have technology today. Alternatives and Impact of Patient Identification The use of automated patient identification system helps to reduce the patient mix-up and data theft risk. But the question is about the accuracy of the process. In this article, we explain the different alternatives of patient identification and their impacts: Identification using Barcode Patient identification using barcode is a common practice for any hospital. Where the details of the patient are recorded in an EMR system, and a barcode printed bracelet is used to identify the patient. This process can identify the right patient against identification or barcode number. But if multiple bracelets are printed at a time and the patients have any common field of first or last name again, it will mix-up the patients. If you consider the data theft, you only need the barcode or patient identification number to get the details with a few clicks. Identification using RFID Radio Frequency Identification provides some additional features like fast data capture, low level of errors, etc. It can identify the patients automatically using the RFID placed on the subject using the specialized devices. This RFID tag is connected with the database and keeps the medical record updated. Identification using RFID also works better and facilitates the identification process in many ways like high storage capacity, automatic scanning, etc. But there still remains a chance to mix-up the patients if the staffs fail to tag the exact RFID to the right patient. Biometric Identification Biometric identification matches the unique biological feature to identify the patient. It secures accurate ID and access to all medical data of the patient because the identifier is not transferrable. Because of this unique feature and utmost security, the global healthcare market is encouraged to adopt biometric technology for patient identification. ",
