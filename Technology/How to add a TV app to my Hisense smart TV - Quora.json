            "answer_text": "If the app is not on the TV, you cannot go to, say, Google Play and download one. TV Apps are put through testing to make sure they are compatible with the TV itself and are NOT going to brick the unit. Edit: I am modifying this answer because Hisense has started carrying Android based TV\u2019s. With this you can download many more apps to your TV than it came with, and easily stay updated with the apps you already have. It should be noted that not all apps will work with a TV. ",
