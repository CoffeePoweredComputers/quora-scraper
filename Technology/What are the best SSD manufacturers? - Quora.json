            "answer_text": "The biggest one is Samsung, and they have a pretty solid reputation for reliability which from my experience is pretty well deserved. However, they also are definitely the \u2018premium\u2019 brand- usually quite a bit more expensive than competitors. There\u2019s a lot of runners up, and I\u2019ve used SSDs made by a bunch of them (Intel, Adata, Crucial, Toshiba, Lite-On, HP, Western Digital etc.) Honestly, I haven\u2019t had an issue with any of them. If it\u2019s a known brand, it\u2019s probably going to be fine unless you get a lemon, which does happen from time to time. So, just be sure to actually try using the drive sometime before your return window runs out. ",

I can\u2019t remember the model of the OCZ, maybe Octane, but it did have a SandForce controller\u2026 anyway, it\u2019s the only SSD I\u2019ve ever owned that just flat out died! LOL! These days I only use Samsung Pro\u2019s for my own builds, but if I\u2019m recommending drives to friends for builds or upgrades I always recommend the Crucial if they don\u2019t have the budget for the Samsung. Both manufacturers produce a top quality product and back it up with generous warranties. ",
