            "answer_text": "I\u2019ve helped engineer industrial robots. I doubt your assertion that the pandemic has sped the adoption of robotics. There are very few general-purpose industrial robots - most are custom made, and it is a very interactive process, which not amenable to being done during a pandemic. There tends to be an extensively iterative engineering process. There\u2019s a lot of lead-time, typically a year or so. So, I would say only in areas where there is already at least one robot, because it\u2019s much faster to build a second identical robot. ",
