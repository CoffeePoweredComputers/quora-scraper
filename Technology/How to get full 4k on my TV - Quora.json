            "answer_text": "Broadcast television in North America does not support 4K, when ATSC 3.0 arrives in another year or so, that situation will change, however existing content comes from places like Amazon prime video, showtime, HBO and a few other providers. Most cable companies do not pass 4K signals, while a few do. Most 4K content is found via streaming. Your television may or may not support full 4K, you're going to have to make that determination on your own. ",
