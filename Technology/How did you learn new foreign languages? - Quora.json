            "answer_text": "Well I'm from Croatia. That is really hard language to learn. Don't bother to learn it because only 4.5 million people use it so it is a waste of time. Anyway, I started grade to learn English in fourth. And I hated it. After learning it for around four years, one night I was watching a movie on TV end it hits me. That translation is wrong (we have movies with Croatian subtitles underneath). So I started to listen and search for mistake in translation. If there was a word that I did not understand I could always look underneath and see instant translation. All movies and series on TV was on English. I could enjoy watching movies and learn English at the same time. Finally I start love English. Then I start to read books. Most of books about computers are written on English. At least free one on the internet (how to books, manuals etc...). My English has become pretty good, but my spelling is bad. It is good that I can always write on my PC or phone where I have spell check. Recently, my wife and I moved in Berlin in Germany. She got a job here (she speaks German very good) so we moved. I had no clue about German and most of Germans don't know English. So I enroll myself in a German course (Deutsche Kurs). It was one rather intensive course. Three hours a day / four days in a week. It is separated in modules A, B and C. A is beginner course, B is intermediate, and C is advanced. Every module is divided on 2 part (A1-A2, B1-B2, C1-C2) and each of them last for a month. All the teaching is on German with small help of English if we get stuck. After six month of learning, I am not yet fluent in German but I can work, participate in conversation and explain my thoughts to other Germans (I am almost 40). If you want to learn English or Spanish, there is a load of stuff on internet and TV that can help you. But for other language it is best to live there and actively learn language. I hope that this helps. By. ",

            "answer_text": "Well I have tried my hands on couple of foreign languages , let me tell you I am not that we'll read in the languages I learnt , but I was surely fascinated towards getting few basics right . When I was in my school , we were taught German aka Deustch , for almost 5 years .We learnt the verbs and the adjectives , the numbering system and the months , even couple of songs to develop interest in the language and finally ,we even had to take test , to ensure there was a development. To incorporate foreign languages in the curriculum gives a boost , coz its a part of your formal education and what we learn in the early years we tend to remember those more due to higher level of brain activities and remembering capabilities. Next came the era of social media , we can connect with people globally . On such a platform , I made few friends who spoke a foreign language . But this is not a very good idea to start directly trying to delve into the talking part , coz first comes the learning then comes the implementation, if we try to do it other way round it gets a bit complicated . So , I would advice learn the language first and then practice it with native speaker. I was priveledged to go to United States , for my studies. I always thought everyone in USA knew English to communicate , which I found not to be true .The community where I lived had Spanish speakers and couldn't understand English well. It is a good practice to be fammiliar about your surrounding and the neighbours around . Whenever I met my neighbour the tried to teach me some new word , which helped me to learn . I would say one should never stop to learn and it doesn't hurt to know a new language , cause not only it's impressive but also can be helpful at odd times , specially if one visits a foreign country. And if you give certification exams then may be put them into your resume and it will make a huge impact for sure. ",
