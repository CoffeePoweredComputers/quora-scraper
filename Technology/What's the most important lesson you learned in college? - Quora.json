            "answer_text": "Your social value is determined entirely by your environment. If you are not doing well in a particular environment, you need to find a new one, and stat. I did not have a hard time in high school. I did exceedingly well in class and was totally bored with the whole thing by junior year. I wouldn\u2019t say that I was unpopular, per se, but I was a bit of a recluse. I had one best friend (that became my first girlfriend) and\u2026 that was my social life. I didn\u2019t mind. I wasn\u2019t depressed or anything. Nobody gave me a hard time. I didn\u2019t really like high school, but I don\u2019t have negative memories of it. Then I went to college. I went to college in another part of the country because I\u2019ve always had wanderlust and, you know, I just wanted to try something different. I was expecting it to be more of the same. I was going to look for my best friend in college and get right back to what I was doing. This next bit is going to sound an awful lot like I am bragging, but it honestly stunned me. Suddenly, I became popular. Like, super popular. Topless women sitting in my lap at bubble parties popular. People making signs with my name on them at rugby games popular. People dressing up like me on Halloween popular. People trying to get me to run for president of the student body popular. People knowing my name when I didn\u2019t know who the hell they were popular. People majoring in my major because they wanted to be like me popular. And I was just sitting around looking at all these people dressed like me on Halloween going what in the fuck and maybe you shouldn\u2019t study political science because I\u2019m doing it, dude. I hadn\u2019t changed. I was the exact same person who was a semi-loner in high school, really. The environment changed. And I\u2019ve found this true in all the places I\u2019ve lived. I have never been as\u2026 er\u2026 lionized as I was in college and probably never will be again, but it was definitely eye-opening. So if you\u2019re having a rough time where you are\u2026 go somewhere else. You never know where somebody\u2019s gonna love your mojo. ",

            "answer_text": "I am in 3rd year of my undergraduation and I am about to write about the one best friend whom I started hating since april 2019. We both had same likes, dislikes, thoughts. Our synchronous brain waves have left both of us take pride over our friendship. She took hostel. It took 15 minute scooty travel from my home to college. I spent my evenings with her. We roamed around the campus, talked and laughed our guts out. I shared the deep secrets which I had shared with none. Even she did. FIRST YEAR We both had the dream of bagging an MBBS seat at a government college. The dream was so close to our hearts. We studied together for quite some time and gave NEET. Our preparation was not good but we did work a little. During our vacation, something stramge happened. She started avoiding me without a reason. I felt sick mentally as I had an experience of one of my school friends leaving me without reason. NEET results were out. I scored less but it was expected. Keeping her pricacy on mind i didn't ask hers. I got to see her marks in Google when I looked for another friend's. SECOND YEAR When we met again in second year, she informed us about her marks. She added extra 100 with her real marks. I didn't want to make that an issue and didn't discuss about it. I understood how she would have felt about it. She started moving apart. I felt bad and when I asked she made up stories as the reason behind her low mood. She was alright after a couple of months and we got closer than before. We roamed around the campus, I spent my evenings with her, I spent my pocket money for her, she called me whenever she needed help and I did as much as I could. I broke the rules of my conservative family to spend time with her. I wasn't allowed to hang out with my friends and I spent time with her after college. THIRD YEAR I was slowly acquiring depressive symptoms and shared everything with her. She had been a good listener. She made me laugh. I wanted to talk like she did. She gave me bible and influenced to read bible which is still one of my guides to peace. My view over God changed because of her. I respected every religion and beliefs like mine and started having a positive attitude to every religion. She made acquaintance with a guy who was from a far land and was gentle. I just wanted to know about his native and copied his number from her phone in her presence. I messaged him just casually and she raged over my action and there started a bunch of misunderstandings once in a while. Every time, be it my mistake or hers, it was me who went and talked. She is highly stubborn and doesn't doesn't doesn't doesn't doesn't come knocking door for my friendship. Believe me, it hurts like hell. It feels that the person doesn't care if we left. It feels that the person values our friendship equal to dustbin. I didn't mind pricking my ego or kicking my self-respect. Not valuing my friendship did hurt me. A lot of my other friends the long list of negative features they saw in her. The worst is the ones with whom I usually won't speak with came for consoling. They said that she was using me and that it was high time that I left her. I was hurt but their perspective of her made me angry. I defended her. I hated her behaviour but not her. I respected her for her exquisite bible skills. For me she was the Christian. After another bout of misunderstanding, (in a WhatsApp conversation)she played(I suppose) that we were in fight. I thought I got a chance to play. I said, \u201cIf this continues, are you ready to quit my friendship\u201d. She was arrogant for quite sometime. After a while, she said she was ok with quitting. Done Done with all this shit where I was a foolish monkey going behind her. I never looked at her face after that. I wanted to forget everything that happened. It was quite easy as I learnt much from my depression episode. She still hasn't come seeking for my friendship. She never does. I'm completely ok with that. I have made up my mind for worst. That was the time I felt Just reading a holy book sincerely doesn't make you a religious person. It tries to make us human. We try becoming a religious person. Still a year left. Usually I won't tell about a person to another one. I consider this a respect for that person. But when I feel like drowning in sadness, I could barely help. I haven't told my mom anything bad about her. I said mom that I've left talking with her for her behaviour. Just a line. Nothing much. Still another year left to learn more. Thank you college. Thankyou fellow quorans for swiping. Criticisms are warmly welcomed. Criticisms seasoned with affection is what all I need. ",
