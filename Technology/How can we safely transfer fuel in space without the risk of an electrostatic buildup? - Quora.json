            "answer_text": "The semiconductor industry had trouble with static discharge for a long time. To avoid losses from static several methods were used to avoid discharged. Antistatic foam rubber is one method. It is a high resistance material that allows the charge to flow but it flows slowly. There are other ionizing techniques to improve conductivity of the air around sensitive devices. It is amazing that your gas tank on your car does not have antistatic foam to avoid a spark. Gasoline fires are common so the norm is not good enough. Space makes this problem much worse. Static charge can surprise you in a very dry or vacuum environment. ",

            "answer_text": "It does not matter if one is transfering fuel in space or earth, you have to ensure that all sistem is grounded, all parts are eletrically connected so eletrostatic charge bild up in fuel coul be safely dispersed and electric potencial is null, for example we have in fligth refulling and the aircraft involved are eletrically connnected.
