You get excited for a while and it becomes normal. Your 11 Pro is a downgrade from the 12 Pro, but the only winner in getting the new phone is Apple. They make the money from your uncle, you get a new phone, become complacent and then want something new. If your current device works, then there is nothing wrong with it. ",
