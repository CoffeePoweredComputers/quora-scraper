            "answer_text": "The replay ability is a seemingly simple yet complicated system in practice. Essentially, there is a server at the heart of the system that is recording all of the ISO camera inputs in real-time. The replay operator gets a command from the director to cue up a replay and the operator searches the past 15\u201320 seconds of recorded footage from all of the cameras to find the spot where the desired action begins. The operator puts an \u201cin\u201d mark at the beginning of the footage and scrolls to the end of the action where they put an \u201cout\u201d mark. This sets the boundaries for where the replay should start and end. The operator then selects the speed of playback and the desired camera and waits for the director to cue the replay live. The correct system to use typically depends on what system of production that the sports broadcast is using. If a production is using a NewTek system, they have a product called 3Play (NewTek 3Play) that would work well for a small or medium sized production. For a large scale, broadcast type of environment, I would highly recommend and EVS system (EVS). We have used this in previous broadcasts and wouldn't be caught in a truck without one. ",

            "answer_text": "Because all the video is digital and is on a non-linear editing system (i.e., a hard drive). Previously it was on 3/4\u2033 Betamax tape on a tape deck. Going digital allows editors to very rapidly make up a replay \u201ctape\u201d from multiple angles and speeds. Depending on how complex they want to make the clip it might take from ten to thirty seconds to cover a play from two or three camera angles as well as have a segment in slow motion. Many broadcasts allow the announcers in the broadcast booth move the \u201ctape\u201d back and forth to see a particular detail (such as a step out of bounds or crossing a goal line.) Sports typically uses the latest broadcast technology so whenever the equipment makers have some new and exciting device or software they bring it to the sports broadcasters first. They\u2019re willing to pay the premium because sports is such a huge audience draw and can be very profitable for the network. Hope this helped. ",
