In general, the shortcomings of OLED technology have been the lifetime (although that has been improving dramatically over the past decade; this concern also includes differences in aging across the three colors of material in an RGB OLED), the manufacturing cost (which remains higher than most comparable LCDs, for a number of reasons), and somewhat limited brightness (unlike LCDs, where you can simply increase the backlight power; this has limited the usefulness of OLEDs in high brightness environments).

(up to personal taste).Honestly it doesn't make much of difference in daily smart-phone use. AMOLED remains popular because they have pretty good advantages too.. Compare variety of videos and pictures on LCD and AMOLED displays and AMOLED surely emerge as prettier and a natural one. ",
