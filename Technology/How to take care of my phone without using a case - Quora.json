            "answer_text": "Sorry. You can HARDLY achieve that. Though you are careful enough to avoid all potential drop and shock,it \u201cdecays\u201d quicker if you don\u2019t use a case.We are not using phones in super clean bench.Every second you face the problem that the dirt will scratch the screen or it\u2019s aluminum back surface,and this thing is almost never avoided no matter how much care you take.\uff08Dirt and shock is the fatal thing) To lengthen the duration of your phone without the case,you may do like this: 1:Never put your phone in your pocket with something else,even with a paper tissue.You can\u2019t see the dirt,but it actually exists and is born sharpened and hard enough to scratch glass or metal. 2:Always pick it up and put it down gently. Aluminum alloy is not that tough as you think it should be. And if it is accidentally stricken with something hard,you may see the unpleasant dented point. 3:No tolerance for dropping. A case,no matter how thin it is,would protect is against shock.a half meter\u2019s height will totally disfigure your delicate device.And it is almost \u201dhell bound\u201d if dropped from more than one meter. So, R U ready for a thrilling naked experience\uff1f ",

            "answer_text": "Is there some reason why you don't want to protect your phone with a case? Whatever, if it were me, (I love and need my phone WAY too much to EVER carry it without a protective case) I would try and find or make some kind of a sleeve, maybe out of a soft towel or a microfiber cloth, and keep it in there when I wasn't using it. If I couldn't come up with a protective sleeve, I would just wrap it in a towel or microfiber cloth. Then, while I was actually using it, I would be REALLY REALLY REALLY REALLY REALLY careful, to the point of always trying to only use it while I was on a carpeted surface, just in case I did drop it. Man, it's scary just thinking about it! Geez man, just get a damn case! ",
