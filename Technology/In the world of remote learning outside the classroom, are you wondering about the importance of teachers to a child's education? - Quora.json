            "answer_text": "If remote learning is going to be the norm I am not wondering about the importance of teachers as much as what all of this means generally. It is my belief the our society and possible the world is heading in a direction of permanent \u201csocial distancing\u201d . What I mean is society is being groomed to never leave the house. The only people who will leave the house are delivery people. A paradigm shift if you will is upon us again. On a somewhat positive note, remote teaching will reduce costs, and enable bright kids from inner cities or those who do not function well in a school setting the opportunity to excel. Many of these kids can\u2019t perform to their best due to distractions in the schools as well as the lack of supplies in the schools. The threat of violence and predation will also be removed. Costs will be reduced by not having kids in a building which requires insurance, utilities, maintenance, other employees, buses, equipment etc.. It should also reduce or eliminate school taxes. The poor will still be adversely affected unless they are equipped with a PC and a connection. While some families depend on the schools for \u201cchild care\u201d and hot meals, this still needs work. I suppose the importance of teachers in this remote environment would depend on people who really enjoy teaching. Their role would be a teacher not a disciplinarian. There was a family who moved in across the street and few months ago. The boy is about seven years old. I was pruning my bushes and he was out playing with his skateboard. I said something to him about his progress with the skateboard and he started talking. He does not like the remote learning. He wants to be around other kids. The neighbor kids parents don\u2019t allow the kids to play due to COVID. Some kids have returned to a classroom and others have not. It is not clear to me if this is a parental decision to keep the kids home or if some of the schools are still closed. ",

            "answer_text": "In today\u2019s world of the Coronavirus with precautions for safety in the education of our nation\u2019s children and with teaching going remote, or partly remote \u2014 there are many changes in the methods of teaching students \u2014But be assured that teachers still are vital, because of their ability to shorten the learning curve to success. Back in the day, before I became a retired coach/teacher, when working in the gym, I tried to take what seemed like the \u201cmillion and one\u201d parts to learning a sports skill like volleyball serving, and break it down into the simplest fundamental parts, easy to understand, and that could be repeated until it became automatic. That shortening of the learning curve would usually be a big factor in the success of the team and the coach since there was efficient use of time.  A teacher in the classroom has the same dilemma in capturing the short attention span of students as they return to the classrooms today. . . . . and \u201ccramming\u201d as much essential knowledge into them as possible. Keeping their focus today is much more difficult than about 20 years ago, or even a year ago\u2014 because of many variables, but overall technology and focus can be the winning combination. A successful teacher will break down the learning into smaller steps, and use the technology when possible to sustain that focus.  Teachers do important work by helping students stay motivated on the task at hand. Motivation can come in many forms. An experienced teacher can usually fit the motivation needed to the individual student by communicating with that student, and learning the interests of that student, while moving the class forward. In so many cases, the greatest help provided by a teacher is this motivation and encouragement. As a young child, I was often more honored when a teacher encouraged me or noted something as \u201cwell done, then when my parents did the same. Parents today are busy and especially stressed assuming so many \u201chats\u201d plus raising their children in these times. They are cautiously optimistic and ready for the experienced teacher to appear and be able to support them, because the teacher's absence may determine the student\u2019s success or failure in life. . . . whether they fall behind. Teachers by the hundreds are leaving teaching today, even prior to the coronavirus outbreak, because of the multitude of expectations and requirements put upon them coupled with low pay, and it\u2019s sad. But we can all remember at least one teacher in our lives that didn\u2019t leave . . . that \u201cstuck it out,\u201d and really made a big difference in our life.  This quote below sums it all up: \u2026\u2026 \u201cTeachers make kids wonder, discover, question, and think about things differently. They make learning real and fun. They make kids see the talents and worth in themselves. They make sure the kids experience challenges and victories. Teachers make a DIFFERENCE!\u201d ____________________________________  Support and encouragement are always needed by teachers\u2026\u2026 but they are needed even a hundred-fold in today\u2019s uncertain times, where they may be risking their lives. Take the time and \u201cpay it forward\u201d to a teacher you know and love. We can and will beat this virus! ",
