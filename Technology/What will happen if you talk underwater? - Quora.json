            "answer_text": "As long as your breathing out to talk, not a whole lot other than maybe your mouth filling with a bit of water if the pressure your putting out threw your lungs drops, and creating a few bubbles. Now if you stop talking with your mouth open under water, your mouth could fill with water, and if your not careful and the air pocket in your throat and lungs gets disrupted, and you could take water into your lungs. Not good. And if you are foolish enough to try to take a \u201cbreath in\u201d underwater, in order to talk, chances are you could drown. So it really depends on what your doing while trying to talk underwater. I have done it before, though theres not much point. No ones likely to hear your voice threw the water and bubbles. ",
