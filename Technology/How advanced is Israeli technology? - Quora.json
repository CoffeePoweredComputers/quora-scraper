            "answer_text": "Dear Friend, Very, very! Jews from all around the world have been immigrating to Israel since 1948. Jews have been at the forefront of science, technology, medicine, inventions, the arts, economics and social issues for the last 150 years. So, Israel today, has the talent, the concentration and the genetic presence to give Israel;the Jewish Country -the best input, from the best of science and technology. Israel is a Western nation. It is a free economy, a democracy and has many companies that have serious R&D units. 2/3 of all households have internet, all businesses have high-speed internet, the telephone network is excellent, and new Start-ups are the standard, and impressive. Most high-school kids and 80% of all adults have smart-phones. For obvious reasons the Military industries are very advance and support our High-Tech Army. We have portable computers with most field-companies, drones overhead, the latest jets in the air and our satellites in the sky. Our tanks are technological wonders. The technology for tanks to fire, at a pin-point target while on the move-at 50 Km/h is made and used in Israel. We have robot boats, tunnel -destroying technology and face-recognition cameras in most \u2018hot-spots\u2019. The technology to shoot down enemy rockets-while in the air-over the enemy side of the fence is made in Israel and well applied. Our computerized and radarized anti-\u2018car-crash\u2019 system is now sold all around the world. In medicine, We have the latest technologies and we have developed many of them. The simple facts that Google, and many other high-tech companies have R&D centers in Israel \u2014and that the second \u2018Silicon Valley\u2019 concept is found in Israel-is a reflection of \u2018advanced-technologically\u2019 Israel. \u2026and the local joke: \u201c Why don\u2019t they move the Nobel -Prize presentation ceremonies to Tel Aviv\u2026. \u2026\u2026is no longer a joke. Israel is a scientific, technological and applied center for the latest ideas that come out of the Human Mind. The acute distance between the scientific/technological Israel and all her Arab neighbors\u2026is astounding. Many Arab nations are still living in the 18th century while Israel has a firm footprint in the 21st century. ",

            "answer_text": "Science and technology in Israel is one of the country's most developed sectors. Israel spent 4.2% of its gross domestic product (GDP) on civil research and development in 2013, one of the highest ratios in the world. Israel ranks fifth among the most innovative countries in the Bloomberg Innovation Index. It ranks thirteenth in the world for scientific output as measured by the number of scientific publications per million citizens. In 2014, Israel's share of scientific articles published worldwide (0.9%) was much higher than its share of the global population (0.1%). It also has one of the highest per capita rates of filed patents. Israel counts 140 scientists and technicians per 10,000 employees, one of the highest ratios in the world. In comparison, there are 85 per 10,000 in the United States and 83 per 10,000 in Japan. In 2012, Israel counted 8,337 full-time equivalent researchers per million inhabitants. This compares with 3,984 in the USA, 6,533 in the Republic of Korea and 5,195 in Japan. Israel's high technology industry has benefited from both the country's skilled workforce and the strong presence of foreign high-tech firms and research centres. ",
