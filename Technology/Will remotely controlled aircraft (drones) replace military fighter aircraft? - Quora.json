            "answer_text": "Yes, it eventually will. Once Drones are produced on a large scale, they would be a cheaper option. But, that is still a long way ahead. Also, human life will not be endangered. Every time a pilot takes off in an advanced fighter jet, there is always a risk factor involved with it. Drones will be preferred as they minimize casualties, more economical (not now, but in the future), they can be very role specific, more stealth capabilities, and the fatigue factor and training costs of a fully operational pilot will also be nullified.  Have a look at this, it the QF-4 Aerial Target. The supersonic QF-4 is a reusable full-scale, remotely piloted aerial target modified from the F-4 Phantom fighter jet. The QF-4 provides a realistic full-scale target for air-to-air weapons system evaluation, development and testing. Still being tested at Tyndall Air Force Base, it will have the same capabilities as the F-4 without the pilot.  This is the RQ-4 Global Hawk. It is a high-altitude, long-endurance unmanned aircraft system with an integrated sensor suite that provides intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance, or ISR, capability worldwide. And I am just naming a few I am aware of. Imagine the advancements on these UAVs in the coming years. This just the beginning. Military experts, who are well versed with the advancements in technology, will tell you by 2030, a manned aircraft will become absolutely obsolete. Yes, that is the truth! ",

            "answer_text": "Generally, I agree with John Wayne Jones, everything has a different mission and a swarm of drones (if possible) doesn\u2019t really replace the speed, range, payload, survivability, and flexibility of a modern-day fighter. There are large UAVs that are controlled by a land based pilot that can carry ordnance, but this does not get you to a swarm and has limited air-to-air capability and speed at this point in time. To get to swarm you need to work out control issues, deconfliction issues, power, payload, and range issues just to make them an effective strike forces. For short range, small payload, suicide missions the swarm could be very interesting, though again very vulnerable even to small arms fire. This does not get you to a flexible real time processing fighter on a vector to a hot target. And with a new weapon designed to take out swarms, the fighter could be the longer range high payload delivery platform for that weapon. The other thing I mentioned in other answers is the F-35s ability to control other platforms. This manned fighter could be the on scene leader of the unmanned vehicles or unmanned weapons. While there are lots of things unmanned or remotely manned vehicles can do, I see people in cockpits for quite some time, particularly in the dynamics of air to air. ",
