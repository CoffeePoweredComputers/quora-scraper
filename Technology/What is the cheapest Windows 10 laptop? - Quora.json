            "answer_text": "Thanks for the question. I am sure many answers will list PC laptops by price - but I do not think that is what you are really asking. Your question should be, \u201cWhat is the best price on a PC laptop that will do what I need it to do?\u201d Computers are just tools that help us get work done. Price alone is not a valid decision point - but everyone has a limit on what they can spend. Think about what you need the laptop for, and that will dictate the price. I have found recently that refurbished or reconditioned PCs that come with a warranty can be a very good low-cost alternative. They can be found on eBay, TigerDirect, Newegg, and elsewhere. Be sure it is \u201cfactory recertified\u201d and not just used. If you only access the web and email, you might want a Chromebook instead of a PC laptop. I recently purchased a reconditioned Lenovo N21 Chromebook on TigerDirect for $89 - in Grade-A condition with a 1 year warranty. That is pretty cheap. For most non-scientific or non-graphic arts work, get a laptop with an Intel i5 processor and 8GB of RAM with Windows 10 preloaded. For anything else - the software you need to use will determine the specs of the PC it needs to function properly. Happy hacking! ",
