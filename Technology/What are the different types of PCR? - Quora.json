            "answer_text": "There are many types of PCR. With different requirement, different PCRs are used. Here is a short explanation on different types of PCRs. 1. RT-PCR(or Reverse Transcription PCR). It is used to reverse-transcribe and amplifies RNA to cDNA. 2. Ligation-mediated PCR. It uses small DNA oligonucleotide 'linkers' (or adaptors) that are first ligated to fragments of the target DNA. 3. Methylation-specific PCR (MSP). It is used to identify patterns of DNA methylation at cytosine-guanine (CpG) islands in genomic DNA. 4. Multiplex-PCR. It uses several pairs of primers annealing to different target sequences. 5. Variable Number of Tandem Repeats (VNTR) PCR. It targets areas of the genome that exhibit length variation. 6. Asymmetric PCR. It preferentially amplifies one strand of the target DNA. 7. Nested PCR. It is used to increase the specificity of DNA amplification. Two sets of primers are used in two successive reactions. In the first PCR, one pair of primers is used to generate DNA products, which may contain products amplified from non-target areas. The products from the first PCR are then used as template in a second PCR, using one ('hemi-nesting') or two different primers whose binding sites are located (nested) within the first set, thus increasing specificity. 8. Quantitative PCR. It is used to measure the specific amount of target DNA (or RNA) in a sample. 9. Hot-start PCR. It is a technique performed manually by heating the reaction components to the DNA melting temperature (e.g. 95 \u00b0C) before adding the polymerase. 10. Touchdown PCR. In this technique, the annealing temperature is gradually decreased in later cycles. 11. Assembly PCR (also known as Polymerase Cycling Assembly or PCA). It is the synthesis of long DNA structures by performing PCR on a pool of long oligonucleotides with short overlapping segments, to assemble two or more pieces of DNA into one piece. 12. Colony PCR. It is the technique in which the bacterial colonies are screened directly by PCR, for example, the screen for correct DNA vector constructs. 13. Digital polymerase chain reaction. It is the technique where simultaneously amplification of thousands of samples is done, each in a separate droplet within an emulsion. 14. Suicide PCR. It is typically used in paleogenetics or other studies where avoiding false positives and ensuring the specificity of the amplified fragment is the highest priority. The method prescribes the use of any primer combination only once in a PCR (hence the term \"suicide\"), which should never have been used in any positive control PCR reaction, and the primers should always target a genomic region never amplified before in the lab using this or any other set of primers. 15. COLD-PCR (co-amplification at lower denaturation temperature-PCR) is a modified protocol that enriches variant alleles from a mixture of wildtype and mutation-containing DNA. \u2026And many more Modification to PCR are done as per the requirement of the research work.
