            "answer_text": "Some responses to this question point out that \u2018nothing is free\u2019, and while that is true, that is not the \u2018free\u2019 that this response will use. The freedom under discussion is not the freedom from price, from the various dollar costs, but the freedom to use. The highways are not without cost, but we do not demand payment for the use of the highways. The highways are free and open. We ask that you pay for the coffee along the way, the burgers and fries, the Coca Cola, but *you* are free to use the highway. We will even provide rest stops with open space and toilet facilities, a water fountain. You can build a motel beside it and charge people to stay in your motel. If we demanded payment for the use of the highways, the cost of doing business would skyrocket. Business is the heaviest user of the highway, for not only the transportation of goods, but for the transportation of equipment, building supplies. Everything would become more expensive. And if we add to the maintenance costs of the highway the necessity to make \u2018owners\u2019 a profit, i.e. to charge a price in excess of the cost, then the cost of transportation becomes an enormous burden. The internet is the communication highway. The economy, and society in general, would benefit if the fee for use of that highway were eliminated. Of course internet businesses would still be able to thrive. Most of the content that the internet makes available is like the roadside cafe, the motel beside the highway. The restaurant owner and the motel owner don\u2019t want their customers to have to pay to drive to their businesses, or for the truckers to pay to bring them their frozen fries and bed linens. In this view the \u2018internet\u2019 is the infrastructure: the equipment and services provided by the ISPs. The economy and society would benefit if the use of these services came at no direct cost to the users. The tax whiners who would rather pay a for-profit corporation $100 rather than pay a tax of $10? So to answer the question : the use of the internet could become 'free\u2019 if it were acknowledged to be an essential public communication infrastructure. Just as highways are acknowledged to be essential public transportation infrastructure. That it is considered to be a privately owned service imposes a tax on all internet communication placing a private toll on communications , a confiscatory profit driven tax on commercial transactions thus raising prices and reducing profits while reducing aggregate demand through the inflation of prices for consumption.

            "answer_text": "The two aren't equal. TV and radio are one way: they are broadcast to you. Neither TV nor radio are content creation systems, they're content delivery systems. To interact with the radio, you have to call on the phone or write a letter, both of which you pay to use.  The Internet by virtue of its content creation and community forming abilities offers so much more. As such, I don't think internet will ever become a public commodity like we've seen TV and radio become. Thinking about this further, this brings up the whole 'tiered internet' thing: a few channels on TV are free, but most people pay a bunch more for extra content. Will there be a free version of the internet with limited access to content (text/images only, perhaps), but you have to pay for a higher tier of broadband for videos or web apps? If you're going to get a free version of the internet, I think it's going to be to a very limited subset of content, just like TV.  Also, Finland making internet a fundamental right does NOT make it free: the government mandated that telecommunications companies must cover 100% of the population with broadband, but nothing in there says it has to be offered for free. It just has to be available. ",

They are finite resources, and have applicable value. Ever is a long time, but if the Internet is \"free\".... then in the foreseeable future it is just being subsidized my something/someone... a government, corporation, whatever.  Gmail is not free; nothing is free.  Any \"free\" Internet will be subsidized by advertising, if not something else. Should the Internet be considered a utility?Sure, as I understand the legal definition in the United States (I am not a lawyer nor have studied law), I believe it would be a good idea to classify and treat \"broadband access\" as a utility.  Further, specific rights should be clarified regarding the Internet and digital data. ",

It's ridiculously expensive to acquire, operate, maintain and upgrade the infrastructure necessary to operate ANY Internet Service Provider. Scale up, there's a non-linear cost increase. Someone's gotta pay for that. However, as Patrick W. Gilmore posits, it's very likely to have scenarios in which you get bandwidth as part of a bundle, not separately priced. Like office space, or an apartment, or possibly moving into a particular neighborhood. But someone, somewhere is paying for the bits to get from here to there. And guess what? It's you! ",

Advertisers should be paying for stuff like that and it should be subsidized by the government because it\u2019s of national interest. Also as technology improves abundance follows. Corporations will however try to maintain the divide and rule paradigm and milk everyone individually as long as they can, but eventually it will cost more not to have everyone on the grid.

            "answer_text": "A2A: Will internet access become free in the future? Where the Internet is concerned, \u2018free\u2019 generally just means that you aren\u2019t paying money for something. There is always a payback somewhere, and at the moment this is your data and a channel to push ads back at you. The latter is of course little different to commercial TV but the former is effectively more lucrative than the value of the \u2018free\u2019 bandwidth. In the UK, Labour\u2019s proposal for \u2018nationalised\u2019 free broadband at the last election was largely derided, but when governments are increasingly turning to online delivery of services and an associated decline of public facilities through underfunding, some kind of access becomes necessary in order not to deny access. It can\u2019t be assumed that everyone has access to an internet-capable mobile phone, and this means there is a small, but significant gap in provision. Facebook attempted to offer free \u2019basic\u2019 internet in India a few years ago but abandoned it following questions about who curated which sites were included in the product. Any kind of free internet would almost certainly be based on this model, and more so at a time where many nations are heading towards increasing control and surveillance of their population, \u2018free\u2019 internet access could potentially be another route to information gathering and dissemination.

For instance, I could see a future where in some places, Internet just \"comes\" with rent in an apartment building, a phone plan, cable TV, etc. There are already places where you can get a subset of the Internet for \"free\" with ads. This does not mean it is 100% free, though. Remember, if you are not the customer, you are the product. And getting a something free with a larger purchase just means the cost is in that larger price. But some people like their free gift in their Happy Meal or cereal box.

Having said that, there will be bundled models where access is free. For instance, the Amazon Kindle. Cost of Internet access is subsidized into the device price. Similarly, Governments could ensure that their citizens have basic Internet access at least. For instance, Finland recently made access to the Internet a fundamental right.

Internet, as everyone knows, is just a network of routers connected with each other such that any node can communicate with any other node. The requests Are served by servers (hosts on the internet). It is these hosts that have access restrictions because they may belong to defence, private company networks, telecommunication nodes or any other restricted domain( deep web). Such restrictions exist to keep certain information in closed groups. Hence the internet is not free. Now, lets just take the rest of the available internet in question. How does a person access the internet? Obviously via a telecom company or an ISP. Hence, again, telecom company or the ISP has control over what a user can access and can block certain websites ( remember the recent ban on torrent and file sharing websites due to SOPA-PIPA). So even the rest of internet is not free and has the ISP or telecom companies as gate keepers. ",

It might happen for some who are willing to subscribe to a service which imposes advertisements. I.e., free in the sense that over-the-air broadcast TV is free. The price you pay is that you must endure the ads. In any case, you will still have to buy the equipment which exploits the connection at your end. Note that when businesses offer \u201cfree\u201d Wi-Fi, they do expect you to do some business with them. If you use their Wi-Fi without permission, that would be stealing. ",

For example, Softbank is offering Free DSL together with a free femtocell -- but that is to attract customers to their cellular service, so it is a promotion (much like the free cellphone). Here is a discussion of some 'free' offerings in the UK, including SKY's 20Mbps offer: http://www.broadbandchoices.co.uk/free-broadband.html Of course, TV & radio are not free either: they may be paid for by subscribers (cable), tax (BBC license fee) or advertisers (you pay for your TV in the price of your groceries). I have seen some examples of ad-supported ISPs but I don't think any successful ones? ",

You can get free internet at Starbucks and McDonald's, but they pay for it and expect you to buy stuff from them while you are using their free Wifi. If government provides it for free, they pay for it with your tax dollars or someone else's tax dollars. The government doesn't have any money that they didn't take from someone. Even when they print new money they create inflation which reduces the value of everyone's money. ",
