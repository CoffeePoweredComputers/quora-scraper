            "answer_text": "Here is a really rough estimate : Each kW of installed capacity will get you an average of 2 units per day. This depends however on: The weather in your area : predominantly clear skies will produce more than overcast. The angle of the panels (assuming fixed) from horizontal, and whether they are pointing mostly south (if in the northern hemisphere). Your latitude : The further from the equator you are, the less solar energy you will get. The time of year : You get more in summer (longer days, more direct sunlight) and less in winter. The difference is more pronounced the further from the equator you are. My estimate was an average over the year. The quality of your panels : Not all panels are the same, there is a drop in performance over time, and the inverter comes into it too. A few data points from me; I have a nominally 10kW array (40 panels) installed about 6 years ago. I\u2019m in Britain, at about 53 degrees North. My panels are unshaded, oriented within a couple of degrees of due south (which is great), but are at an angle to the horizontal of about 15 degrees (which is a bit too flat.) It generates an average of 8000 units per year. In the summer it may typically be 30\u201350 units per day. In the winter it may be 5\u201310. October to March will account for about 2000 units, April to September about 6000. I haven\u2019t seen any change in the efficiency of the panels over these first 6 years. I have tracked the output levels when it has been perfectly sunny all day to work out that where I am, we achieve about 50% of the potential generation because of cloudy/overcast weather over the year. I suspect that an installation in California/Arizona may perform ever so slightly better than in the midlands of England ;) ",

            "answer_text": "Divide your average hourly wattage requirement by the number of daily peak sunlight hours for your area. This gives you the amount of energy your panels need to produce every hour. So the average U.S. home (900 kWh/month) in an area that gets five peak sunlight hours per day would need 6,250 watts. As a general solar industry rule of thumb, solar panels last about 25-30 years. However, this doesn't mean that they stop producing electricity after 25 years \u2013 it just means that energy production has declined by what manufacturers consider to be a significant amount.
