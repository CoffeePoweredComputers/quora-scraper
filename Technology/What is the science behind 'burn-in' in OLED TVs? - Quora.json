            "answer_text": "The OLED TVs uses some special kind of display panel where each pixel has its own light. Unlike Normal LCD TVs where we have a screen and a LED panel at the back to produce light. OLED TVs does not have LED panel at the back, each pixel on the screen can emit its own light. Each pixel has life. Screen burn-in occurs when these pixels becomes dead when a particular color is ON at high brightness constantly. OR to say when a portion of screen displays the same image constantly for hours. When it occurs mostly Watching News or Sports. Here the logo of news or channel is constantly appearing at the top or bottom somewhereHome dashboard is left for hours. Here the same static image is displayed constantlyScreen Burn-in is irreversible. Screen Burn-In is the biggest disadvantage of OLED TVs. That\u2019s why I recommend to never buy these and wait for future technology like MicroLED which features combination of OLED + QLED. ",
