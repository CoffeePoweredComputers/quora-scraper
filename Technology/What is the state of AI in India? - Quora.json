            "answer_text": "Same as the state of any other PSU. Useless waste of resources. It is run exactly like many other government organisations, nothing to do with competition or efficiency. Employees are least bothered about the customer as their salary has nothing to do with customer satisfaction. They will have their salary weather they do a good job or not. It should have been left with the Tata\u2019s in the first place and not nationalized. Air travel is a luxury and government do not need to worry about providing subsidized Air Travel on tax payers money. And even after subsidy it is still expensive. With the advent of economic and low-cost carriers Air India is not either the cheapest or the smoothest way to travel. Government of India should have had a proper regulatory body for Air travel and left it at that. The money spent on Air India could have been used somewhere where it could have made more impact without wasting so much money. Only advantage is the government officials can only use AI for air travel officially. But they do choose to pay from their own pockets to travel by private Airlines rather than use AI services. ",
