            "answer_text": "APN is acronym for 'access point name', it is basically settings your phone needs for setting up connection to gateway between your carriers network and public internet. Ip address that will be allocated to your device and the security method which will be instated are all determined by the type of this gateway. From what I know carriers can customize the software on any phone they sell, and that includes blocking the ability to change the APN. Do some good research on internet before proceeding with any workaround you might encounter on internet these days. ",
