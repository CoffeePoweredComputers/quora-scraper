            "answer_text": "How do you scale an augmented reality startup business? The simple answer is: the same way you scale any business. But therein lies the challenge. Scaling a business requires an underserved market, by which I mean a market where more people need your solution than currently have it. But their need has to outweigh whatever barriers to entry exist for that market. And right now, the barriers to entry for AR are pretty high. I am a big believer in the long term future of AR, but I struggle to imagine a truly useful AR experience that can be delivered on a phone. For the most part, phone-based AR is either trivial, doesn't solve a real need, or could be achieved more effectively without using AR. However, if your product requires a full AR headset, your customer is unlikely to already have one. Worse, they must be willing to spend ~$3000 to get one. There aren't too many successful businesses built on requiring a $3000 expense before you even buy the solution. In comparison, VR (Virtual Reality) systems are far cheaper and the price is dropping daily. Within a few months, you'll be able to have a good VR experience for $400, all-in. The tools for developing VR applications are also more mature. I think high end Enterprise applications are about the only place that true AR applications can thrive, and even then, the market is not that large yet. AR still has a long way to go. ",
