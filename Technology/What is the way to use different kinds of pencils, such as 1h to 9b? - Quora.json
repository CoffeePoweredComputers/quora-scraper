            "answer_text": "This question is a bit open ended, so hopefully an open ended answer is OK. To start with the basics, designations like 4H, 2H, 2B, 4B, etc are just indicators of how hard the pencil lead is. The spectrum is usually read from B to H, such as 9B, 8B, 7B, 6b, 5B, 4B, 3B, 2B, 1B, HB, 1H, 2H, 3H, etc. The further down from 9B to 9H you go, the harder the lead gets. OK, so B's are soft, and H's are hard. But how and when should I use each? This is where the question gets a little bit tricky, as there are many different reasons you might choose one hardness over another. Generally speaking, harder leads are used for roughing out your drawings. When you're just laying down a sketch or outline for a drawing, harder lead goes down much lighter (depending on how high the number of H), and is easier to erase afterwards. Harder leads can also be used if very soft shading is needed in spots. Softer leads can be used for \"inking\" drawings, or darkening the final lines to a more finished state. B pencils are functionally the exact opposite of H pencils in that they go down on paper very dark, and are typically much harder to erase. The softest leads (anything past 6B), can achieve a darkness comparable to drawing with charcoal. Again, the rules for which pencil to use when can vary quite a bit, and your choice will be especially dependent on what type of drawing you're doing. If you're doing a gesture drawing, softer darker pencils (4B, 6B, 8B) are often the way to go as they glide across the paper quite easily and are far less likely to tear the paper if you're moving your hand quickly. If you're doing a still-life drawing and are going for extreme realism, you'll probably use pencils from across the entire spectrum in order to accomplish all the different levels of shading that sort of drawing requires. If you're just sketching or doodling, you can choose whichever you're most comfortable working with. Some artists will make deliberate choices to use darker or lighter leads depending on how dark the subject is. For example, when drawing a crow, I would probably choose to use something a little darker. When drawing a yellow bell pepper, I would maybe use something a little lighter. A word of warning when choosing harder leads: you should never have to press hard onto the paper to achieve the darkness you want. If you have to press hard, you should be using something softer. The reason for this is that pressing hard (especially with a hard lead) results in grooves being formed in the paper, which will create noticeable white marks in your drawing when you try to work over them. These marks are also virtually impossible to remove. So if a line is ever not coming out dark enough, do NOT push harder, simply switch to the next softest pencil and try again. tl;dr version: Pencils are like a number line, from 9B to 9H. B means soft, H means hard; the higher the number the harder/softer the pencil is. Use H pencils when you want lighter lines/shading, use B when you want darker lines/shading. ",

            "answer_text": "There are different ways you can use them, depending on your drawing style, and ultimately you\u2019d probably need to test out a few types and brands for yourself to see what\u2019s most suited to the resulting look you desire. The pencil types aren\u2019t quite standardized, so you may notice small differences between different brands - especially if they came from different countries. Basically, though, the numbers and letters indicate their place on a scale of how soft or hard the graphite in the pencil is. This scale ranges from 9B-HB-9H (I included HB because it generally falls around the middle of the scale). An H at the end means Hard - as in harder, sharper lines. The larger the number, the harder a pencil is and the lighter lines it will draw (eg. A 9H pencil will create much more precise but lighter lines than a 1H pencil). Harder pencils will also retain their sharp point for longer due to the fact that they actually leave less graphite sediment on the paper and you draw, the same reason I presume their lines appear lighter. On the other side are B pencils, the softer graphite range, which will make larger, darker lines. Just as with H pencils, the higher the number, the softer the pencil and darker the lines it creates. Due to the larger quantity of graphite deposit left when using them, B pencils tend to require more frequent sharpening and can become blunt and dull rather quickly at the higher ranges. I prefer using harder pencils to draw rough outlines for my sketches due to the light and more easily layered or erased lines they make. Even an HB would be good for this, as it falls in the middle of the range of hardness and softness (HB indicating qualities of the H pencil and B pencil types). Harder pencils are also great to add fine details, such as small crosshatch shading or detailing marks within the iris of an eye. You just have to find a good balance of preferred darkness of your lines to the width you want your lines to be. Mostly I use softer pencils to add the final lines to the structure of my sketch (rather than using a lining pen) or very soft pencils like the 8B to create dark crosshatching that I later blend with a paper towel to create dark black shading effects. Softer pencils are much easier to smudge, almost like charcoal, which also likely means you\u2019ll find it coating your hands too if you\u2019re using a very high number like I do. Now onto the important bits! What to pick? Generally, it\u2019s good to have at least a small variety of pencil types to create more dynamic projects, though if you just want one good work tool, check out bullet point numero uno (and beyond if you\u2019re looking for a place to start building a collection): For a good standard drawing pencil, I recommend HB for it\u2019s versatility. Its the best of both worlds, easy enough to erase but also able to shade with. I almost always use it for doodles or quick, simple sketches.6B pencil for thicker and blacker lines to add shadowing detail. It\u2019s not too dark in my opinion, and blends nicely, while still making lines distinctly different enough from HB and H pencils for my own aesthetic appeal. Others prefer 4B because it\u2019s lighter and leaves less of a grainy appearance, but again - it\u2019s all a matter of preference.7H pencil to draw thinner, easily adjusted or covered lines for a rough outline sketch before drawing with something that leaves more noticeable remnants (It\u2019s never fun to try to work around imprints left on the paper despite having been erased, especially if it means you have to scrap the piece).",
