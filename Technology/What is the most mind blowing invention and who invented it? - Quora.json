            "answer_text": "Whenever some brilliant idea comes to your mind and you want to scribble it before it fades away, you need a BALL POINT PEN and a paper. Or if the 90s born mathematical geeks want to pour out their minds with equations and formulae and loves to solve it now and then, needless to say the immediate things they would look for is a Ball point pen . In the era of touch note pads, mails and MS Office, we know the value of a ball point pen. The PEN which comes in variety of colors , shapes and sizes has always been a subject of fascination to me. Ever wondered who is the person behind this enchanting invention ? He is Ladislao Jos\u00e9 Biro . Google is celebrating his 177th birthday by creating Google doodle honoring him.  The person who changed our writing from smudgy, bloated handwriting to neat and clean, rather simpler one! Went on to created Biro which began its production in 1944 under the name \u201cEterpen\u201d and priced equivalent to \u00a333. Having failed multiple times in his effort to use the correct ink thickness,Biro enlisted the help of his brother Gy\u00f6rgy B\u00edr\u00f3 who was a chemist to create ink that was just the right viscosity. The pair gave their name to the invention when they patented it the \"Biro\" on July 15 1938.  Today, the Bic Cristal biro is the world's most popular pen. In the US, the price has remarkably stayed the same since 1959 - retailing at 19 cents despite inflation. Who was Ladislao Jos\u00e9 Biro, how did he invent the ballpoint pen and how did it help in World War II? it takes you to some insights of his inventions, and how it played an important role in WWII. Quite intriguing to me! Image source: google ",

            "answer_text": "ElectricityThere is no single man who can be truly credited for the discovery of electricity, but some of the names which would pop up in the list include Benjamin Franklin and his kite experiment, and Nikola Tesla who is often dubbed as the father of electricity because of his understandings of this force behind most of the everyday items which we use today. From home entertainment to the lights outside the road, electricity is behind it. Light bulb : Imagine being in a room. A dark room. Candles can give you light but that light just isn\u2019t enough in the dead of night. Thomas Edison is the one credited for the invention of the light bulb as we know it.Thomas Edison did not give up even if it had taken him almost a hundred tries before he had perfected his invention of the light bulb back in 1879. The Worldwide Web:You wouldn\u2019t be reading any of this if not for the invention of Sir Tim Berners-Lee\u2019s invention \u2013 the worldwide web. Accessing the websites you know today traces its origins back to the English engineer\u2019s invention! Telephone :Alexander Graham Bell thought of how to communicate even from afar by converting the human voice into electric signals. Airplane :Traveling by ship was okay. But traveling by air has proved to be much better. To get to other foreign destinations faster, the best way today is by plane and we owe it to the Wright brothers who had invented it back in 1903 when they had successfully made the first sustained flight.
