            "answer_text": "Thor Technology is nothing but the Asgardian Technology. Let's juxtapose both the technologies to find out which one is more advanced. We will compare how each of these achieves basic tasks. And See for yourself Transport     Tough competition. But in terms of space travel, Asgardian Transport is much much faster and better. Asgard:1, Wakanda: 0 Communication   Here, we just aren\u2019t sure about the effectiveness of Odin\u2019s Crows. But other than that, Wakandan communication involves direct transfer but the Asgardian (confirmed) system involves a medium and thus isn\u2019t very effective. Asgard:1, Wakanda: 1 Metals  Captain America is using Vibranium Shield which is made of Vibranium, the best metal available to Wakandans. While Thanos\u2019 Sword is made of Uru metal, which is commonly used by Asgardians. Indirect Comparison. Asgard:2, Wakanda:1 Armors   But Earthlings are mortal and more vulnerable. Asgardians don't need any such armors since their bodies are strong enough. Though Asgardians have the potential, Wakandans are better off. Asgard:2, Wakanda:2 Weapons   Is that even a competition? Asgard:3, Wakanda:2 Architecture   Sorry Wakandans but they have developed a planet and have higher skyscrapers. Asgard:4, Wakanda:2 Safety   Thor: The Dark World showed that Asgard has a pretty weak defense system. Wakanda wins here. Asgard:4, Wakanda:3 Both have made many more feats but I can\u2019t remember anything else. Mention in Comments if you feel like it should be included. To conclude, it can be plausibly said that Asgard is the home of Gods while Wakanda is just an advanced nation on Earth (thanks to Vibranium). Ultimately, we humans can\u2019t even realize what these Gods are up to and what powers they possess. Asgard is much more advanced than Wakanda in any case. ",
