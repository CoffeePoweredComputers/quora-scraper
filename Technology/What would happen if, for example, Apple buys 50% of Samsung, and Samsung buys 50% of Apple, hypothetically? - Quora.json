Anyone can in theory launch a takeover of Apple - you would need to pay a premium for shares (Apple value around $1.5 TRILLION dollar market cap) so bring about $3 TRILLION dollars or $2 TRILLION to get a controlling interest. Larger than the ENTIRE GNP of South Korea. When Apple was at $1.3 trillion market cap, by raw numbers, \u201cThe nations with GDP figures immediately below $1.3 trillion are Mexico, Indonesia, The Netherlands, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, and Switzerland.\u201d So, it\u2019s like asking if you can buy Mexico.
