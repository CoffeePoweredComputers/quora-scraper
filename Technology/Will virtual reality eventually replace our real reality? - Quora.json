            "answer_text": "Actually\u2026 VR is not just a headset created five years ago. You can understand it as a concept much older than that, and in this broad sense, yes, it could eventually substitute reality, because what we know as \u201cReality\u201d is not but a construction based on our limited senses. Just like Plato\u2019s Allegory of the Cave, we don\u2019t know the \u201cactual reality\u201d, only its reflection, a bunch of fragments and clues that we try to put together. \u201cReality\u201d is captured by speciallized organic structures, converted into electrical signals and interpreted through our brain, and in every step of this proccess a lot of shortcuts happens. So, senses can be tricked, brains can be tricked, and technology evolves. And it is a huge mistake to define a concept based on its current state of the art. When the Internet started becoming popular, many people just could not see the potential of this technology, due to the technical limitations of that time. Internet was slow, instable, expensive, limited by a cumbersome desktop computer connected on a phone line, content was poor\u2026 There was a lot of prejudice from the general public that time, Internet was sinonimous of Porn, Games and Chat rooms. If you asked the question at that time: \u201cCould Internet bank substitute a real bank?\u201d, people would laugh at your face. Now everybody is connected, and online services almost replaced many many offline technologies. Think about Telephone Directories, Enciclopedias, Mail Letters, Newspapers, Music, TV\u2026 Actually I have a virtual bank that is just an App and a Credit Card, without physical branches. And in Brazil, huge, traditional banks like Itau and Bradesco are reducing their branches, slowly focusing on apps and online presence. I believe it is the same for VR. Just like the Internet, it has improved a lot since the 60\u2019s but only now reached the common people. And still\u2026 is slow, cumbersome, instable, expensive, with poor content, limited by wires\u2026 used mainly for porn and games (joking!) But that will change in a few years. That said, I personally don\u2019t believe that VR would substitute completely our actual reality, because, what is the point? But just like any other technology, there is some advantages that we could put on use to make our \u201creality better\u201d. Telepresence, for instance, is a research field of VR that, one day, could really impact the commuting problem in big cities, and save billions of money spend in transportation and pollution control.

            "answer_text": "Yes. But that would take a lot of time - at least 15 years. (VR Maturity as per Gartner Hype Cycle) VR is currently dependant on HMDs or Head Mounted Displays for the visual experience of the virtual world. There are a few major parameters(out of many more) stopping HMDs from providing the best possible visual experience, the closest substitute to actual reality. a)Field of view The way human eye sees the world and the displays visualise the world is different. The field of view of the human eye is roughly(monocular FOV) has about 210 degrees horizontally and 150 degrees vertically. The stereoscopic view or the 3D perception is available only in the binocular FOV which is approximately 114 degrees. Some of the best VR headsets currently like Oculus/HTC vive provide about 110 degrees of FOV. b) Depth of view The depth of view is the perception of the distance of an object as per the human eye. It\u2019s very hard to establish this in stereoscopic 3D for VR. Rendering such visuals could also need way powerful machines. You\u2019ll have to be fine with your HMD being connected to a powerful computer while enjoying VR. c) Frame Rate The no of frames per second is a very important parameter for video quality as well. But when you\u2019re in VR, in a scene with a lot of action the frame rate will need to be multiplied with the speed at which you\u2019re rotating your head/changing your point of focus. It will take a lot of effort and faster machines to achieve perfection. There are many other factors, but these are the core factors/parameters that affect the most. ",
