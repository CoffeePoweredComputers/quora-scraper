            "answer_text": "CMOS is the lowest power of those. Rather than resistive pull-up and down, complementary MOS transistors are used for both pull-up and down. Simple CMOS devices use almost no power when not switching from one state to another. When switching, a momentary tiny pulse of current is taken - as the transistors change state. Power taken is therefore roughly proportional to switching frequency. ",

I will give a hint by saying only one of these dissipates zero static power (in other words, it only dissipates power when inputs change.) ",
