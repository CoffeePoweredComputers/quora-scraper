INQUISITIVENESS ! Yes you have to be curious and if you\u2019re not then you\u2019ll have hard time keeping your brain fresh with tech stuff. Try finding answers to why certain things work that way? Like how projectors work? Such curiosity will drive you to explore more and research more.I use social media and my favorite is Twitter. As far my experience on Twitter I can say it provides instant updates and what\u2019s more exciting is that tweets are like gems. Tweets by tech people,tech giants and many keep you updated. They are legit too and you can join in the discussion tree.Follow tech reviewers who are established and whose reviews are less biased. For example Marques Brownlee is my favorite Tech youtuber and his style of presenting is dope. Youtube is a great place to know about what\u2019s happening around,new innovations and stuff. Go subscribe some great youtubers.Websites like The Verge , TechCrunch , Android Authority , New Cars and 2016, 2017 Car Reviews, Pictures, and News , Motoroids . There are many and read those which suits you.Sometimes some tech products are not revealed and to get sneak peek you can follow some twitter people who reveal secret stuff. They provide beforehand knowledge of gadgets and super-cool technologies in the making.Participate on Reddit discussions. Some companies like Tesla,SpaceX and many others hold discussions on Reddit.Subscribe to mailing list of Tesla , Samsung ,Apple and your favorites as they will send you notifications from time to time. I have subscribed to Tesla mailing list and they send me mails regarding their recent updates to their cars and new features.Discuss about various science related stuff with your friends and share ideas and improvements you are willing from the product out there in the market.Criticism is healthy and makes you smarter. If you don\u2019t like a product or some feature eeks you out just don\u2019t hold on the grudge, say it loud to the public so that your experience can help someone else.Try out new phones,speakers,laptops,cameras,cars and bikes even when you don\u2019t have them.Your friends might be having a flagship phones. Dig out every feature the phone has.Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic. Arthur C. Clarke ",

The interviewer asked me this same question, \u2018How do you stay updated on upcoming technologies?\u2019 I answered saying, I am a software engineer, so it\u2019s already in my DNA to stay abreast of technology, sometimes even if i don\u2019t really want to get updated, it just shows up. I\u2019m microsoft developer, I always check up on msdn, the forums, blogs and channel9 for the latest updates on various microsoft technologies. I read Tech blogs like Techcrunch, TheInformation, TechMeme, TechCabal, EnGadget, Mashable Tech, TechRepublic etc. I also receive emails from mailing lists i\u2019ve subscribed to in the past. I follow Tech bloggers and tech thought leaders accounts on Twitter, and also accounts of C-Suite Executives of startups and companies building interesting products. Umm.. Having conversations with my friends who have strong opinions about some technologies, like apple fan boys who always stay updated on apple news. and 9GAG.lol ",
