            "answer_text": "Meet and marry someone who wants a stay-at-home wife. Own your life and don\u2019t let the criticism of others stop you. Women are criticized for working and for not working, for marrying and for not being married, for having kids and for not having kids, for baking from scratch and from buying from the store. You do you. Smile and don\u2019t apologize for the choices that you believe in. Branding helps. You\u2019re not a \u201chousewife\u201d you\u2019re a home-maker. One piece of advice though, career skills give families options. Keep yours up to date through reading, writing and volunteering. Irrespective of the strength of your relationship, you never know when life is going to intervene and change your path. Own also that there are risks to these sort of choices. Own that there is a risk that your ambitions may change or that your spouse\u2019s expectations or your family\u2019s circumstances may become altered. Do your best to keep your eyes open, your expectations realistic and give yourself insurance against the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune. ",
