            "answer_text": "If your question is about a particular course, I am not sure if we should encourage the use of the term \"renewable energy engineer\". Renewables are a very wide area with very different technologies. Even just within offshore wind energy technology mechanical engineers, civil engineers, electrical engineers, aerodynamicists, geotechnical engineers, etc work together and they have very different knowledge. And then solar panels are a completely different story, as well as geothermal, etc. Therefore, I am not quite sure as a \"renewable energy engineer\" what will you be an experts of, you surely can't be an expert in all those things. So I would check the course material thoroughly before applying to a course like that. As far as I can see, there is certainly scope for renewable energy engineering. The technology is not quite there yet, and I see enormous potential in it. If you think about the long term, it will definitely be the backbone of our energy generation.  As others have mentioned oil and gas reserves are not infinite. Although I must put a word of warning here. Offshore oil and gas research is expensive, it costs a lot for companies to invest in finding oil. Therefore, it is typical that when they \"locate\" enough oil to say that we have oil for the next 40-50 years, that is enough to reassure investors that their money is in a good place in the oil and gas industry. Then in 20 years time when there's only 20 years' worth of oil left, the big oil companies will invest more money into research and discovery, and they will find another 20 years' worth of oil that we didn't know about before. Nobody knows how long this can go on, and you should raise your eyebrows or simply laugh when you see a prediction of oil reserves and oil prices 30-40 years into the future because that is literally impossible to predict.  So to sum it up, as much as it is true that oil and gas reserves are finite, don't expect to live to see the world run out of fossil fuels. This doesn't mean that we don't need to gradually research ways to harvest renewable energies, and altogether I think there will be very good opportunities for people with the necessary skills. One more thing I would like to add is that the future cannot be predicted, and therefore the broader you keep your vision the more chances will come your way. ",

            "answer_text": "The short answer is \"Yes\". Actually the subject of Energy is and shall continue to be an area of significant research that attracts and shall continue to attract billions of dollars of investment because of the temptation of unlocking the secrets of Free Energy. Now, the biggest puzzle of Free Energy is Free Fuel. Conventional sources have an extractive cost to it etc. Renewable sources such as the sun and the wind have no cost attached to them but harnessing them takes costs. So each incremental breakthrough is actually a quest to lower those costs to the point where that cost can be minimized to an insignificant and incidental number. However, I believe that the real breakthrough would come when humans would have subdued the atom and contained the Fusion reaction to defined and desired parameters. Then the next breakthrough would be miniaturization of the technology to put that nuclear fusion power plant at one's desk. So work is on in all these fields. Also one should read Tesla's work, who was far ahead and actually vehemently believed and knew that free energy is the rule and had developed a system himself, famously called the Tesla Tower. ",
