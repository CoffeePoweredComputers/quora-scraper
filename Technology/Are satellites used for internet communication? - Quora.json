            "answer_text": "Yes. Satellites are the most common way to provide Internet access to locations that have no cables running anywhere close. Ships, floating oil platforms, aircraft, expeditions on land. Sometimes they\u2019re even used in cities that have very good cellular coverage, for example by TV companies who send a \u201cnews van\u201d somewhere to broadcast live from an event. They don\u2019t want to risk having their broadcast ruined by congestion or speed limiters in the cellular network, so they\u2019ll be using a dedicated-bandwidth satellite connection instead. I was once involved with a project where an embassy in our capital desired to have satellite communication as well. The country was one of those most people can\u2019t place on a map, with a rather pressing lack of democracy and freedom, and it seems their embassy here was worried that their cable Internet access would be blocked or monitored by our government. So they wanted a separate connection where they could exchange messages with the home country without needing a single meter of cable going through other countries, it would be just one dish on their embassy roof here, and another dish on government property back home, and a satellite up in space connecting them. No cables for our government, or other governments, to cut or tap. Of course, they could still be monitored or blocked using the proper equipment, but not as easily as a cabled connection could. ",

War zones OR after a Natural Desasters is another application. Since it may be deployed in a matter of hours also at higher bandwidths. 100 mbit plus often takes some more time though since the dishes needed are often large. ",
