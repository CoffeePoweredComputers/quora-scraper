            "answer_text": "Hahahahah!!!!! While I\u2019m sure there are emulators out there that manage to fake BLE hardware, you really need to be doing your testing on real Android devices. You\u2019ll learn the quirks associated with each manufacturer. You\u2019ll learn just how shitty BLE can be. You\u2019ll learn how different phones react to different advertisement frequencies and what their scanning duty cycles are. You\u2019ll learn how different phones whip out the beautiful GATT_FAILURE error code for no reason\u2026while other phones whip out the beautiful GATT_ERROR error code for no reason\u2026and yes, those are not the same thing. You better add the gatt_api.h to your bookmarks, by the way. I seriously would not bother using emulated BLE. It won\u2019t be the same. ",

            "answer_text": "Forget the emulator, just get the Android or bliss os iso, burn them to usb flash drive with Rufus or etcher, pot it from bios at startup then install it to another usb flas drive (at least 8 GB) and you have a fully functioning Android 10 that supports the hardware of the pc you boot it on, by installing it to a flash drive it will allow you to run it on virtually any computer without having to install it again ",
