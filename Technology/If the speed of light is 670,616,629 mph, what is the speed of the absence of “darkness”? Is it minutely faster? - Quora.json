            "answer_text": "The speed of light is nothing else than the maximum speed reachable by an object which must have zero rest mass to reach it. By coincidence, photons have zero rest mass, so they can travel at that speed. What you call \u201cabsence of darkness\u201d depends on your senses. Your eyes are hit by a photon and a cell has a receptor that transforms it into an electric signal that reach your barin and is interpretated, so the speed of \u201cabsence of darkness\u201d is much slower.
