            "answer_text": "Name any technology, and someone in Germany will be making it. If you mean technology that originally came from Germany though, you could look at the jet engine, the rocket engine, and the diesel engine. German technology is known for being innovative, refined, and often more complicated than necessary, which can make servicing it a nightmare, and it also explains why many owners of German cars who do not stick to the service instructions will usually ruin a perfectly good car in a hurry. It is actually being whispered these days that the Germans may have lost WWII because their technology was too complicated, and often incapacitated because of staff not pushing all the right buttons. I have read that German tanks used to be down at a failure rate of 40%, when British and American tanks were only at 5%. Not surprising, given that they tended to only go forward or backward, while the German ones had ten semi automatic gears and two drive modes or something. I actually once despaired with a Mercedes 300 SE, because the damn thing had a new, huge defect of some crazy part no other car has every month. There is a word in German, \u201cIngenieurskunst\u201d - the art of engineering. I think it describes very well what\u2019s going on there. Every German engineer is an artist. That\u2019s cute, but if you have less than an inexhaustible sense of humour for the quirks of overcomplicated solutions, I recommend to stick with Japanese or Korean things. ",
