            "answer_text": "Well, never say never but an event like acquisition would get a lot of scrutiny from the regulators. Combining the assets of the two companies will create a behemoth in cloud and consumer services. Having said that, if something like this were to happen (hypothetically) it would rather be a merger than an acquisition. Neither company has the financial muscle to acquire the other outright. In reality, it is highly unlikely that this will happen. M&A happens when the resulting entity can gain considerably from the event (from shareholders point of view). In case of Amazon and Apple coming together, I don\u2019t see a considerable upside. They will rather end up cannibalizing each other\u2019s revenue in competing services (iTunes and Prime, Tablet devices, Apple TV vs Echo/Fire) and hence the resultant entity will lose value rather than gain from the event.

            "answer_text": "You never know, but I think they are both too big. Apple is actually bigger I think so it could possibly buy Amazon, but there is almost zero probability it would happen. They would have to be much bigger, you cannot buy a company which is almost as big as yours. Also I don\u2019t see any reason why - companies usually buy other companies to utilize them in the business so if you asked about Apple buying AMD, TSMC or ARM, I would say that it may happen (just an example), or if Amazon tries to buy Paypal (also just an example).

Unlike Warren Buffett who bought Apple shares and allows present Apple Management to continue doing what they do best, Bezos seems to me someone who likes to actively run an acquisition. Amazon already makes money selling Apple products without spending anything on research and development. Why upset the apple cart? ",

Apple is mostly a hardware company though lately they\u2019ve started to focus more on services side, such as subscriptions and finance such as Apple card. ",

Your question is financial in nature and there would have be the opportunity to create shareholder value for the large shareholders on both sides to approve something like this. At this time I don\u2019t see a reason either set of shareholders would want to endorse a merger or acquisition. ",
