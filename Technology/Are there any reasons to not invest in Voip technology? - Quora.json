            "answer_text": "VoIP is soon going to become as common as the traditional landlines and the technology is basically everywhere. In a lot of developed nations like Germany, even telephone operators are setting dates for when traditional landlines and the supporting technology will totally move in favor of VoIP. VoIP is less costly, extra resourceful and provides a lot of more supporting features as compared to traditional landline phones. Therefore it\u2019s no question that businesses and consumers are racing to switch to VoIP Numbers. On the other hand, VoIP and traditional landlines carry on co-existing. Not everybody has the necessary equipment, economic resources or even the high-speed internet connections required for VoIP. Actually, a lot of people still don\u2019t have information about VoIP, how it works or how to work with it. For people who grew up with traditional landlines, to learn about VoIP can be puzzling or frustrating. Users will have a lot of questions such as how they can make phone calls from a VoIP phone or whether it is possible for you to contact someone with a VoIP number if they are calling from a landline. Essentially, utilising VoIP technology is not that complex. End users do not essentially have to change how they employ the phone for calling friends, family or colleagues. ",

            "answer_text": "Voice over IP has been around for nearly 30 years. There\u2019s absolutely nothing new about the technology, and anyone with a PC can download a free product that allows free phone calls across the globe. What could any company possibly do to acquire a revenue stream from VoIP? Nothing I can think of. ",
