            "answer_text": "The motivation to do things doesn\u2019t come with intelligence. So, essentially, AI machines do and will keep doing what humans have told them to do or allow them to do. However, assuming it would have the necessary motivation somehow built into it, and assuming it had all the time to plan its actions, the necessary amount of energy, access to the necessary data, access to human beings and to other machines, then a \u201csuper-intelligent\u201d AI would be able to do pretty much anything physically possible. Doing anything requires time but doing intelligent things requires even more time, often much more time but an AI machine would not be impatient and it would just plan ahead and make the best use of the time available to it. To achieve what we assume to be its own objectives, it would inevitably have to make human its tools. To be able to do this, the AI machine would have to take the necessary time to find a way to do it. It may take a thousand years but it would achieve it 100% certain unless humans decided on a whim to unplug it. The limit of the exercise is that while it would be very difficult to design a really intelligent machine, it would be even more difficult to built into it the necessary motivation to do it. People don\u2019t seem to understand that 99.999% of what we humans do is not intelligent. What we do most of the time is not decided on the basis of some intelligent analysis of the situation. Instead, we do what we feel like doing on the spur of the moment. So building an intelligent machine is sort of missing the point if we don\u2019t know how to built into it the necessary motivation. And we don\u2019t. Nobody does. The motivation we have is essentially the result of our nature, and our nature is the product of billions of years of natural selection. No engineering firm and no research lab will ever be able to emulate natural selection. The consequence of this is that the motivation of our super-intelligent AI would probably have many flaws, making the task of predicting what it would do impossible. However, assuming \u201cperfect\u201d motivation, I guess that a super-intelligent AI machine would plan to limit the rise of entropy in the universe. This would require that it developed science way beyond what humans are capable of. Obviously, nobody is going to tell what this new science would be and what exactly the machine would be able to achieve using it. However, the consequence is that the machine would transform the Earth into a giant scientific lab. It would probably use human beings as \u201ccomputers\u201d. The human brain is really good and it would be stupid not to use it. So humans would still be part of the picture, well fed and cared for, but essentially turned into research assistants with no freedom to speak of. ",

            "answer_text": "There is an old Chinese story where an accountant did good work for a king who asked what he wanted to be paid. I\u2019ll use US dollars for his reply. \u201cLet\u2019s tie it to that chessboard of yours\u201d replied the accountant. I\u2019ll only take one penny for the first square and you double it for each additional square\u201d. The King thought that was cheap, so he agreed. Bad choice! The 64th square was worth $184,467,440,737,095,520 \u2014 that\u2019s 184 quadrillion dollars plus. The United States GNP for July 2016- July 2017 was only about $68,251,000,000,000. (About 1/2700 of what the king owed on square 64). Moore\u2019s Law of computing speed and capacity formulated in 1965 states that that speed and capacity will double every 18 months and that has held true since. We are now in 2017 on square 36: 687,000,000 (6.87 * 10 ^8) \u2014 687 million In 2059 square 64: 184,467,440,737,095,520 (1.84 * 10^17) \u2014 184 quadrillion 2067 it will pass grains of sand on earth: (7.5 * 10^18) \u2014 7.5 quintillion 2100 24,758,800,785,707,606,000,000,000: (2.47 * 10^26) \u2014 2.47 septillion About 2217\u201318 computers will pass the number of atoms on Earth: 10^50 What can that power do?

Futurist predictions are based on human capabilities. ASI may be thousands to millions of times smarter and more capable. You decide the rest. ",
