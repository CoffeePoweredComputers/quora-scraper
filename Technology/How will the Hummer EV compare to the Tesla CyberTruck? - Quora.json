            "answer_text": "It\u2019s difficult to say because both should be considered, to some degree, as vaporware until the specs that each automaker promise can be seen and verified in the real world. Tesla has released more projected specifications about the Cybertruck than GM has for the Hummer EV, and there is an actual Cybertruck that\u2019s been seen driving around L.A. (usually with Musk at the helm), so the Cybertruck at least gets the nod for exiting in the real world. The Hummer EV, for now, is just a few promised specs and one teaser image from GM. Motor1 has, however, produced a speculative render of what it may actually look like: 2022 GMC Hummer EV: Everything We Know. It\u2019s official debut where we\u2019ll see the whole thing and probably get more projected specifications happens on May 20, 2020. This is what we know of each vehicle so far.

            "answer_text": "One of these vehicles will have this fast charging network in the USA:  and the other will have this one:  Ref: plugshare.com Go there if you want a better look. One of these vehicles will have that charging map built right into it, with a route planner that gets automatically updated on a daily basis:  The other\u2026 might. But GM\u2019s track record for stuff like this isn\u2019t so great. One will have self-driving software and hardware, with all-around cameras and Sentry Mode as standard equipment.  Nobody knows what the Hummer will have yet. But who cares about any of that? The Hummer will look better:  Note: not an actual prototype. And honestly, that\u2019s what everyone looks for in a giant, off-road vehicle, amirite? ",
