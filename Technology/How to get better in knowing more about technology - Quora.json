And if that's not enough, you could try and be more involved in various technology. Check out local events, socialize and network with tech influencers and leaders. Take up technology related classes (online or offline). A good starting point is to go through Wikipedia and look at the sources (located at the bottom of each wiki page) and understand the advancements and usage of each technology used today, in history and what is expected of it.
