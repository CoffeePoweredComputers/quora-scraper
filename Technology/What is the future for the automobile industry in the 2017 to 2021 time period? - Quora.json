            "answer_text": "Currently, human error contributes to about 90 percent of all accidents,but autonomous vehicles programmed not to crash are on the horizon. To be sure, some technological issues remain, emissions issues will linger, and regulators are sure to have a say. Furthermore, combining autonomous and non autonomous vehicles in a single traffic mix will be a significant challenge. The most difficult time is likely to be the transition period, while both kinds of cars learn to share the road before self-driving ones predominate. (\u201cSelf-drive only\u201d lanes and dedicated roadways might be the first step.) The technology, though, is no longer science fiction. The possible benefits, by contrast, read like fantasy. If we imagine cars programmed to avoid a crash\u2014indeed, programmed never to crash\u2014we envision radical change. Passengers, responsible only for choosing the destination, would have the freedom to do what they please in a vehicle. Disabled, elderly, and visually impaired people would enjoy much greater mobility. Throughput on roads and highways would be continually optimized, easing congestion and shortening commuting times. And that would be only the beginning. Crash-free vehicles mean no traffic police, no ticketing, no alcohol-impaired driving. Freed from safety considerations such as crumple zones, bumpers, and air bags, OEMs could significantly simplify the production of cars, which would become considerably lighter and therefore less expensive to buy and run. Related industries, such as automobile insurance, could be affected as well. While car insurance would of course still be necessary for incidents such as catastrophe, theft, and vandalism, insurance claims related to highway accidents (admittedly a small portion of the total) might nearly disappear. Automobiles could also last longer as collisions stop happening and built-in sensors facilitate the creation of parts on demand. Cars That Communicate with Each Other and the Road. Imagine approaching an intersection as another car runs a red light. You don't see them at first, but your car gets a signal from the other car that it's directly in your path and warns you of the potential collision, or even hits the brakes automatically to avoid an accident. A developing technology called Vehicle-to-Vehicle communication, or V2V, is being tested by automotive manufacturers like Ford as a way to help reduce the amount of accidents on the road. ",

            "answer_text": "Actually it can be both on the product and manufacturing sides ! On the manufacturing side ,already humans were replaced by robots and automated machines. Automation has moved to a next level with the introduction of manufacturing 2.0. Here machines communicate within themselves and to the outside world with the aid of Internet of Things (IoT). Also with lean manufacturing methodologies, high productivity is possible with less resources. On the product side, hybrid will be the first technology to be widespread in the market. EV from premium companies like tesla can be another set of promising technology. Varying degree Autonomous cars will popularise in market after some time in future !! ",
