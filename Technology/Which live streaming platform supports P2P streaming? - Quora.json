            "answer_text": " To begin this answer, I would first clarify what P2P streaming means. In the case of a traditional CDN, all the content is usually stored in a centralized place and located in a set of core servers that serve out the content to consumers in a fairly straightforward manner. P2P streaming stands for Peer to Peer streaming, innovation in how content is distributed all over the world, leading to a faster and better experience for the end-user. P2P streaming technology distributes the content in a way that allows clients in the same network to work in sync to receive the content rather than getting it from a central set of servers. This type of system handles stress better as there is no central server and can lead to a faster and better streaming experience which can be scaled easily all over the world. Live Streaming Platforms that Support P2P Streaming Since P2P streaming isn\u2019t a very well-known or adapted technology for live streaming, here are some platforms I found that do support P2P live streaming: Seedess Seedless is a live streaming platform that supports serverless video streaming which results in the consumer to not only experience smoother playback but also less bandwidth consumption. It is based on BitTorrent technology and can support 4K UHD streaming which is optimized for smooth playback and lower bandwidth consumption. Livepeer Livepeer is a video streaming platform that is based on the distributed system of the ethereum blockchain. They provide P2P live streaming services and encoding services that are affordable and fast. Their focus is on building scalable and decentralized streaming platforms which are faster than the traditional centralized CDNs. Streamroot Streamroot is live streaming and video-on-demand platform that is based on the decentralized concept of P2P streaming. It leverages the network of viewers to create a content delivery system that is not based on a central server but spread across various peers in the network. It is particularly effective in streaming content that is being watched by a large group of people at the same time like sports tournaments or huge events like the Oscars. ",
