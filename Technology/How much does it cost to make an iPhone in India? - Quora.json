            "answer_text": "Apple does not spend very much to produce an iPhone and the markup they attach for retail is very large. First of all, iPhones are not, and have never been, produced in India. They are actually produced in horrible factories in China where the workers are underpaid and badly mistreated. The cost to produce an iPhone is as follows: Labour - ~$5 per phoneParts/Components - $288.08 per iPhone (for the iPhone 8)Note that the costs of research and development are not included in that - however, for each iPhone model with millions being produced from the same research and plans, I predict that cost breakdown not to be very high for each individual iPhone.
