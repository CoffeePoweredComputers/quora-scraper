From my point of view, I think the use of technology is not making us less human instead they provide is facilities and cosyness to us which makes to achieve the task easily by applying less effort and giving me the exact results these technologies has provided to utilise our time and more and more and the same time we can do various tasks for example while having the breakfast we can check our tickets we can order our different products. It helps various factors such as our personal use, security concern and aswell for emergencies situations. there are various examples that of various events have been organised to the social medias that is maybe is exhibition in Egyptian revolution it was through Facebook, the GATE examination fees hike protests through social media and their various examples. So technology has not made us less human but it has helped us to utilise our mental thinking effectively. Thank you! ",

            "answer_text": "It is how you take technology.  Mobile phone for instance. Initially you never knew what your friend/family member was doing miles away. But now you can be in touch. Be human. By contacting and sending your love and care. But , if you take it as a gadget to live in a virtual world , then yes, we are less human at heart.  Technology has the ability to get your mind preoccupied. And it is our mind to know how to use it. ",
