            "answer_text": "Core i3 with 8 gb of RAM is the best choice for you. There is not a big difference between i3 and i5. The latest i3 processors(5 & 6 generation) are too good as compared to some i5 processors. i3 8gb RAM works well as compared to i5 4gb RAM. But make sure before buying that it has good Cache memory and its clock speed is faster. Turbo-Boost and HD Graphics are present in it.  i5 processors produce more heat and the fan used is also noisy and it is more expensive than i3. 8 gb of RAM helps you in running big applications and Games. But if you are able to upgrade your RAM in near future then go for i5. SUNIL KUMAR BAJPAI ",

            "answer_text": "4GB i5 Dual Core Processor (6th generation and above.) The reason is you wont get really efficient performance in i3 powered laptop if it has 8 GB of ram. i3 processors can easily process data without lag upto 4\u20136 GB of ram. But, if you install 8 GB of ram, it gives the same performance as 6 GB. i5 processors can easily handle data processing upto 12 GB. And thereby as per your question, I would love to recommend you 4 Gb powered by i5 to be the better config. rather than 8GB i3. ",
