            "answer_text": "If we talk about the strict definition of 5G as used by international bodies, such as the ITU, then one big difference is that 5G is used to define the next generation of mobile connectivity and hence doesn\u2019t contemplate wired technologies. So you could start by saying that 5G is wireless and Fiber, obviously, isn\u2019t. If we think about the user experience, I think the key point here is that wireless (mobile and fixed) 5G networks will enable people to get the same \u201cfiber\u201d experience wherever they are - you no longer have to be tethered to the end of a cable or constrained to where fiber is. Theoretically, you\u2019ll always be able to get more speed and capacity out of a piece of fiber, however at some point, given the current services and applications, speed and capacity become irrelevant once it is abundant and I believe it will change our view about how we think about purchasing connectivity, particularly wireline connectivity to our homes. An analogy we some times use: how often do you purchase a car based purely on the \u201cpeak\u201d speed it can achieve? Technology capability up against our typical usage makes peak speed irrelevant. When we purchase a car we generally care more about other factors as we think about experience: reliability, efficiency, service, value and maybe acceleration (latency) vs outright peak speed. 5G will start to provide speed capability beyond our typical needs, and hence for home connectivity, 5G could close that gap to \u201cfiber\u201d which is otherwise seen as \u201cpremium\u201d speed. Coming back to the most obvious differences, with the likely convergence in experience, maybe one way to think about it from a user\u2019s perspective is that the biggest difference will be one has a connector and the other one doesn\u2019t?! However, all 5G networks will need fiber (dark fiber) at some point to interconnect them and to those masses of servers that make up the \u201ccloud\u201d, but that is beyond the point of the network that a user interacts with. I\u2019ll finish with this thought as I see them as very complementary technologies: fiber is an important part of 5G and 5G is important in bringing fiber to more people. ",

            "answer_text": "There\u2019s a couple of important differences: 5G is A new a wireless air interface. Meaning there\u2019s no physical connections needed for a device to connect to this network.In it\u2019s infancy of being rolled out across the US and different countries around the world.still waiting on more devices and user adoption before it becomes a mainstream wireless technology.Fiber is A wired medium with the potential of nearly unlimited bandwidth. The electronics at the end of the fibers is the bottleneck in performance.A mature technology that has been around for decades.Proven to withstand electromagnetic interference, transmits data via light pulses and can work in different types of environmental conditions.Fiber has a big role in enabling the development of 5G. As the data loads increase on this network, fiber is the current medium that\u2019s able to meet the growing demands that will come from 5G. ",
