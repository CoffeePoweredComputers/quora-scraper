            "answer_text": "The popularity of any social media network is measured by the number of monthly active users (MAUs) it has. Facebook currently has a MAU of more than 2.5 Billion followed by Instagram which has close to 1.1 Billion monthly active users. Since Instagram is owned by Facebook, let's not consider it as a competition. Next in the list is TikTok which is gaining a lot of popularity and has topped MAU of 1 Billion in 3 years. If TikTok continues to grow at this pace, it has the potential to beat Facebook in next 2\u20133 years. On number 4 & 5 are two apps mostly used in China, Weibo & Qzone. But as they they are not available for rest of the world completely, it's impossible for them to beat Facebook. The list of social media networks is huge and evaluating the best among them is also tough. To make it simple, here's a timeline visualisation video of top social network apps from 2005 to 2020. This video shows global numbers but the same is for India considering India has huge young population. You can just remove Qzone & Weibo from the list. So, we are left with Pintery, Twitter, Snapchat & LinkedIn among the most popular social media platforms. But for them, there is limited scope to beat Facebook, still they can be considered as competitors. Watch this timeline video of most popular social media apps in the last 15 years to understand the competition better. Hope this helped. Upvote my answer if you liked it, this will encourage me keep writing more, and better content.  ",

Going by this trend, Facebook has three competitors Tiktok : Mark Zucherberg recently declared that Tiktok has surpassed InstagramInstagram, Facebook's own acquisitionYouTube: has added many social media features like story and chat to its existing video platform. Even then Facebook will remain the king of Social Media in 2020. Hope this helped. ",
