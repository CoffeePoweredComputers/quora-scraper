            "answer_text": "Technology integration is defined as the use of technology to enhance and support the educational environment. Technology integration in the classroom can also support classroom instruction by creating opportunities for students to complete assignments on the computer rather than with normal pencil and paper. The term Technology-enhanced learning (TEL) is used to describe the application of technology to teaching and learning. It is a broad category that isn\u2019t particularly defined, but it is transforming education and educational institutions beyond recognition. The reality is that it is almost impossible to survive the working world without technology. Therefore it is better if children learn how to use tech sooner rather than later. Arguably, being computer literate is more important than some of the more traditional skills that are taught in schools. SkillPal is a newcomer in this technical education society. SkillPal will provide personalized mentoring to each candidate. They are here to entertain interested candidates who need mentorship and set new goals. Anyone can review their projects from SkillPal too. Technical mentoring describes the process of guiding an individual towards a technical outcome in their work, through leveraging the mentor\u2019s experience in problem-solving, problem mapping and sometimes relevant technical expertise. The technical mentor\u2019s objective is to transfer problem-solving capability to accelerate the individual\u2019s capacity to deal with the complexity of their role. Technical mentoring draws on problem-solving experience may guide through counselling skills and seeks to help the individual deliver on a technical outcome. Effective mentoring requires more than common sense. Research indicates that mentors and mentees who develop and manage successful mentoring partnerships demonstrate a number of specific, identifiable skills that enable learning and change to take place. This strategy booklet describes these skills and provides a tool for you to assess yourself informally on each skill. For years, individuals assumed that the process of mentoring was somewhat mysterious. These relationships just happened, and \u201cchemistry\u201d had to be present. It was impossible (even somewhat sacrilegious) to analyze and describe the specifics of what was going on in these arrangements. Analyzing and putting names to behaviours would theoretically kill them. Some people were able to find mentoring relationships, while many individuals were unaware of how to get started with mentoring and missed out on one of the most powerful development strategies ever devised. In these changing times, students are more driven towards using a mobile phone for every purpose. A smartphone they call it. The world is at the fingertips and a student can get access to any information from anywhere. People who want to learn anything from the web can come to SkillPal. It is a platform where you can get mentors from different fields and set your skill upwards. Skillpal will help anybody to gain knowledge with edutainment. Expert mentors will help to review the skills and set the goals. This reduces the chance of visiting a library and searching for the data. A mobile phone hence can be used for a number of such purposes. What makes the information easily available is mobile applications. Every mobile app has a unique feature which offers its own set of services. There are many education ERP companies in India that provide school management apps and various other mobile apps for different purposes which make it easy for the institution to keep the students informed about school activities. It can now be said that students have taken up modern ways of learning through mobile applications. Everyone has things they know and things they don\u2019t. This means there\u2019s always an opportunity to learn from or teach someone else. In tech especially, everyone is a beginner at something. Sometimes the best mentorship match up is between two people close to each other\u2019s skill level, they might be able to relate to one another a little better. There\u2019s also no real timetable on mentorship. It doesn\u2019t need to be a long-term relationship. It could just be a single pairing session, or perhaps it lasts a good portion of your career, who knows? The only thing that\u2019s important here is that both parties grow because of the relationship. Not only should the understudy grow and learn, but the mentor should as well. There are a lot of ways to do this. You could volunteer at a program to teach kids, or help at a workshop for people under-represented in tech. Or just help at any old workshop. Personally, when I see someone working on a technology I\u2019m really familiar with, and they\u2019re a little new or they\u2019re struggling, I just offer to pair with them. It\u2019s simple to just ask, it just takes a little bravery on your part. Pairing can be done over the internet with tools like Screenhero or even Google Hangouts. ",

            "answer_text": "Education technology means the use of all kinds of modern media and materials for maximizing learning experiences. Education technology is suggested by the expert as one of the potential means of impairing education effectively and efficiently. Today, the student is not considered as an empty vessel to be filled in by facts and figures. They are now expected to use so many media and materials and to get learning experience from all sides. Education is regarded as a process of interaction and interpersonal communication. The modern teacher has to help, to guide, and facilitate the learner\u2019s development. The teacher has to inspire and motivate young learners and assist adult learners in their quest for knowledge and skills. The Government of India in the Ministry of Education and Social Welfare realized the importance of Education Technology for Qualitative improvement of education and included the Education Technology Project in its Fifth Five Year Plan in 1971. Accordingly, the unit was started in the Ministry since 1971 and a CET in the NCERT was set-up during 1973. Education Technology Cells come into being different states from 1972-73 onwards. Thereafter, India has been very adaptive and is taking efforts to implement the technology and also saw the rise of many Ed-Tech startups which is using different tools to make learning easy and fun for the students. overall, No matter their perceived abilities or geographic locations, all learners can access resources, experiences, planning tools, and information that can set them on a path to acquiring expertise unimaginable a generation ago.
