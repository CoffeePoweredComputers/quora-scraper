            "answer_text": "\u201cWhen does it make sense to use lidar instead of cameras?\u201d LIDAR is working in a different wavelength and delivers different information from what cameras do. Combining the output from different imaging technologies (LIDAR, RADAR, camera, ultrasonic, IR/thermal imaging) provides a more complete mapping of the environment, and enables better and safer autonomous driving systems. I don\u2019t think that there are any questions about that. The problem is purely financial in nature. LIDAR is expensive, but it also returns distance information, and not disturbed by fog to the same extent as cameras are. If a decision has to be made between cameras and LIDAR, and the image processing algorithms are already in place, cameras seem to be a better option. LIDAR requires less processing, it\u2019s easier to implement, and probably in the future prices will drop, resolution will improve, and they will be able to obtain the same information as cameras do, and even more. RADARS are still better at tracking other vehicles and detect the change of their speed quickly and accurately. For adaptive cruise control and collision avoidance systems they might be necessary. Parking sensors are ultrasonic, because they can handle close object well with very simple solutions. Night vision and thermal imaging improve safety when driving in the dark, especially at avoiding hitting living creatures. Neither LIDAR or cameras are enough. ",
