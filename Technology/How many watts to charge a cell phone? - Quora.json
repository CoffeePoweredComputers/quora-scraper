            "answer_text": "It depends on how fast you charge it. If you are using usb some ports can charge faster than others. I think you can get as much as 2 amps at 5 volts which is 10 watts from a wall powered charger and up to 1.5 amps from usb which is 7.5 watts. Different batteries have different capacity as well so a higher capacity battery will take longer to charge with the same source as a lower capacity battery. It is approximately the amount of energy that needs to be delivered, not the rate of that delivery which is constant in order to charge a battery. Energy has units of joules or watt-seconds. So a better question would ask either How much energy is needed to charge a cellphone, orHow many watts can a cell phone charger deliver.The answer to q1. is probably around 55000 joules. The answer to q2. is up to about 10 watts I believe. ",

            "answer_text": "For wired, USB charging, the most common chargers will provide 5W (1A at 5V), which is sufficient for most smartphones today. Better is a 10W (2A at 5V) charger. Wireless chargers are rated up to 15W for the recent specifications, although many devices will only charge at 5W, 7.5W or 10W.
