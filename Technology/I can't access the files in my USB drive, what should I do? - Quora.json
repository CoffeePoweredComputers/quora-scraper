            "answer_text": "You need to be more specific on what the issue here is and how it came about. If it doesnt power up then you are out of luck for doing any DIY fix. If it does power on and shows up in windows explorer but you cannot access the files, then it may be due to corruption of the file system or malicious software. First try the windows check disk tool on the drive and select to fix errors found. Also try on a different USB port or a different computer. If these fail, you might have luck with trying a recovery software such as Recuva. If the files are not important and you want to use the USB, it is easier to do a formatting of the drive which should make it usable in most cases. ",
