            "answer_text": "It is difficult to speculate about the future of Islam in the next 50 years.There are mainly three possibilities. 1)There is a growing nationalistic trend all over the world and people are gradually having anti Islamic views. Most people thought that Hillary Clinton will come to power but the growing nationalistic fervour brought Donald Trump to power.A large section of the Republicans are antI immigrant and anti Islamic. THERE is overwhelming support to Trump for building the wall in the Mexican border.Britain has transformed it self into a multicultural society but the support for BREXIT marks the beginning of the British isolationism. Similar trends are to be noted in France and Germany and rest of Europe .In India the rise of BJP signifies that the Hindus are becoming much more assertive and aware of the Islamic danger to the Hindu society and the country.The Burmese are engaged in ousting and extermination of Muslim Rohingyas and the Japanese do not encourage Islam in their country.China forbids Islamic practices and have supressed the Uigher Muslims. Formerly the Soviet union had large Muslim states but after these states formed independent republic's the modern day Russia discourages Islam and do not allow Muslims to practice their religion. The overall trend is anti Islamic. 2)Muslims are also to blame. Radicals Muslims have defamed the entire community. The rise of extremists like Alquaeeda,ISIS ,Bokoharam have brought international revulsion against the Muslims. The conservative and sectarianism among the Muslims and refusal to integrate with the general populace of respective contries have turned people against them.The western view presently is that Muslim immigrants have taken advantage of the liberal atmosphere in western countries and committing heinous crimes like rape and murder.They are also carrying out intolerant activities and promoting terrorism in foreign countries.The trend is now to pay back the Muslims in the same manner through acts of terror.The attack in the Newzealand mosque is one such instance. 3)Islam has always been viewed as a violent religion and the adherents of Islam consider others as unbelievers and kafirs and fit for extermination. In almost all Muslim counties the religious minorities have been either ousted or assimilated. Just witness the fate of Christians in the middle east or the fate of Hindus in Pakistan and Bangladesh. Wherever the Muslims are in minority they play the victim card and wherever they form a sizable proportion of the population they are insisting in following their own practices disregarding the views of others .The practice of wearing Burquas and Hijab and eating only Halal meat and refusing to integrate with the people have marked them out for hatred.They refuse to become a Roman while staying in Rome .It is not that they are oblivious to the latest comforts of life and modern inventions and discoveries but they use the materialistic benefits but are mentally backward and orthodox. In all probability Islam and Islamic countries will become more and isolated in the next fifty years. ",

            "answer_text": "It is difficult to say, simply because there are two very different realities that are beginning to form with regards to Islam. On the one hand, Islam is the fastest growing religion in the world, a fact that many Muslims like to tout as a result of the inherent truth of the religion, but which in reality, is a mere byproduct of the high birth rates of Islamic nations. On the other hand, the world as a whole is shifting immensely ideologically, with great numbers of people now claiming that they are \u2018agnostic\u2019 or \u2018atheist.\u2019 A great chunk of the world, in short, is abandoning organized religion. I think that given the sheer power of the increased population and the comparatively slow growth of the \u2018irreligious,\u2019 there will still be hundreds of millions, if not billions, of Muslims on the planet, but that they will be less practicing than were their ancient, and even recent, ancestors.

            "answer_text": "Islam is gradually expanding at the moment on average reasonably peacefully. Eventually world events will turn for the worse by the 2030s. During this time Islamic people will try to expand their influence throughout the world through warfare. The people might claim to be Islamic but i dont think that most of them will be true believers. Also i assume that Islam will be politically exploited by those peoples governments to make it easier for them to go to war. They will make large conquests and great military achievements but in the end this will bring the politically exploited version of Islam great and terrible consequences. It will be brought close to extinction or it could end up being totally abolished. The Islamic culture came close to suffering a similar catastrophe during the times when it got invaded by the Mongols from Asia. ",

            "answer_text": "Islam has very nearly surpassed Christianity in popularity and will do so within the 50 year time period. The challenge to Islam, as is the challenge to Christianity, is universal truth. Neither are based in Universal Truth but in subjective truth, although Islam has had periods when universal truth was held in higher order. The Western world would not have broke out of the Dark Ages without the advances made by the Islamic culture of the time. This is a transition period. People are already flowing away from subjective realities as they do not hold any real legitimate relationship to current knowledge. Islam is going to be challenged to let go of Sharia Law and other very subjective elements in the next centuries. ",
