            "answer_text": "Japan is a fascinating country. From provision of vending machines containing clothes and shoes, to E-TAF automatic doors that open shifting accordingly to your body shape; the Japanese incorporate technology into their everyday lives. China\u2019s top companies, one being Alibaba, have spent $10.7bn on stock buybacks and dividends; they are producing wealth, people, companies and cities at an increasingly pleasing rate. The source of Japan\u2019s technological advancement is undoubtedly from the youth of Japan. Statistics show that among 34 OECD countries Japanese students performance levels rank second in mathematics and first in science. Japan spends around 3.59% of GDP in public spending on education. Only 0.93% of females aged 15-19 have no education. The Japanese education system involves 9 years of compulsory education (grades 1-9) and students begin school at the age of 7. Japan\u2019s has the world\u2019s best universities, one being Kyoto University which is joint 35th at the current world university rankings by Quacquarelli Symonds (QS). Japanese people are well in touch with technology, as 93.3% of the population uses it, China\u2019s percentage stands lower at 53.1%. Furthermore, the high school graduation rate in Japan is 95%, with China\u2019s standing comparatively lower at 84%. Research from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, (OECD) highlights that Chinese students from Shanghai\u2019s schools have previously outperformed those from 65 countries or regions. The young engineers of China and Japan have created many exemplary inventions, such as: Japanese Inventions The Cells Alive System C.A.S. changes the physics of freezing. By using an oscillating electrical field, water molecules are forced to spin rather than bunching and freezing up into ice crystals. This causes the cell walls to remain unbroken. C.A.S. uses 30% less power than our conventional freezers and can freeze food up to around 5 times faster. Remarkably, no loss of taste in the fruit or veg is found, this is because oxidization is reduced by 98%. Robot Hotel Staff Nagasaki\u2019s Henn-na Hotel, is run entirely by robots. It is a famous capsule hotel renowned for its high-tech facilities. When you enter, a mechanised dinosaur guides you through check-in and a luggage bot wheels your suitcase into your room beside you. When you wish to sleep, your robot companion turns off the lights for you. By replacing human staff with robots\u2019 labour costs decrease, bringing benefits to the company. A main benefit that the company would receive is that the robots would be able to work more than people. Humans can become ill or quit the job, but by having robots as staff, all factors of sickness and tiredness are eliminated. This means that the company wouldn\u2019t have to deal with giving days off to its staff, making business more convenient. Also, robots are far faster at completing work, and are communicative and courteous at all times. They also resemble humans in appearance. Round Keyboards Drum set keyboards were developed by the Japanese Google input development team, these keyboards are faster and more efficient than regular keyboards. Since this keyboard was produced in Japan, it is only available nationally and in the Japanese language. In the future however, it is expected that these circular-shaped keyboards will be introduced in other parts of the world as well. ",

            "answer_text": "I wouldn't say they are so much ahead but they are up there with all the rest of the first world countries .The Japanese people have a very strong work ethic they strive for the best!It seems to me they are blazing the path with robotics quite advanced. Their cars I have one are excellently engineered I think the Japanese worker has not lost that work ethic of taking pride in the quality of the product that they produce.They as a whole are extremely hard working people I think there railway system is the best in the world.The Japanese people are miles ahead of any other country in Asia and I might say in passing the cleanest in all aspects..It might be their work ethic,their sense of personal pride,the personal attitude of every Japanese person in the pride in their own country.
