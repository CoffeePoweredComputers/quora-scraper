            "answer_text": "As the name suggests, pedals are always operated by using our feet. Pedals are used for carrying out some functions in car. Most commonly there are ABC pedals. But in different cars, they may be functioning in different ways. Pedal A - for Acceleration - When it it pressed down, it operates a mechanical linkage causing to increase the RPM of engine, and thereby more power output for car. When released, it comes to their original position causing the engine to operate at a lower RPM.  Pedal B - for brakes : When pressed, it operates a mechanical linkage which finally forces the brake shoes to expand to come into contact with brake drum thus applying the brakes.However, in modern cars, pressing the pedal B causes to operate a valve which in turn operates either pneumatic, hydraulic or electric system which finally applies the brakes. Pedal C - for clutch : operates mechanical linkage causing disengaging the clutch. When the foot is taken back, pedal comes in original position causing engagement of clutch thus transmitting power from engine to gearbox.  In some vehicles, one more pedal for brakes is there. This is called Retarder brake. By pressing this pedal, it causes opening of one hydraulic valve which in turn causes flow of hydraulic fluid to fill one chamber in engine through which engine output shaft on which rotating blades are mounted causing reduction of engine power output and thus reducing the speed of vehicle.
