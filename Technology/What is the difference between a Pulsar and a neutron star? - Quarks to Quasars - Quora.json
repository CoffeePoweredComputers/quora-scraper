            "answer_text": " Although all pulsars are believed to be spinning neutron stars, not all neutron stars may be pulsars. When a star becomes a supernova and detonates, it can leave behind a rapidly spinning, dense cinder which is all that is left of its iron core. It spins rapidly for the same reason that an ice skater pulling in their arms spins faster. So, as the ejected gas from the supernova begins to clear out, what is left behind is a spinning neutron star about 20 miles across rotating up to 30 times per SECOND. This body is expected to have a powerful magnetic field, and so has all of the essential ingredients for becoming a powerful accelerator of matter, provided there is matter left over in its surroundings after the supernova. The Crab Nebula in Taurus is the remnant of a supernova that happened around 1054 AD. In the 1960's, radio pulses were detected from a pulsar in the heart of this remnant. Optical flashes were also detected from this pulsar in the late 1970's. If the star was a member of a binary star system, the companion star could provide the necessary matter, and so we end up with a pulsar in a binary system. The gas is accelerated by the spinning magnetic field of the neutron star, and the charged particles emit 'synchrotron radiation' as they are accelerated to nearly the speed of light. The surface of the neutron star itself can be a source of matter as the neutrons there decay into protons and electrons. These charged particles accelerate out along the magnetic poles of the neutron star and emit synchrotron radiation in pulses. Every time one of the poles of the neutron star crosses our line of sight, we see a pulse of radiation like a lighthouse beacon. Astronomers have long noted that there are more supernova remnants than their are pulsars, suggesting that not all supernova produce neutron stars and pulsars. There are also fewer pulsars that have been detected, than the expected number given the best estimates for how many stars are likely to be in the proper mass range to produce neutron stars as end products rather than black holes. So, there are still some things we do not understand about how pulsars are formed. ",

            "answer_text": "Let us see the main differences between a pulsar and neutron star.  (1) Star type (a) Neutron stars  A neutron star is a special category of stars, formed from the remnant cores of massive stars after their supernovae. Gravity is so strong in these stars, that the electrons and protons in their atoms come very close to each other and \u201cfuse\u201d into a neutron soup. Since neutrons are uncharged particles and experience no inter-repulsion, they can pack together very, very closely in neutron stars. This gives them tremendous densities and pressures. Consider: the density of a neutron star is so much that a teaspoon of its material, in its own gravitational field, would weight 15 times that of the Moon if it were placed on the earth. That\u2019s about 900 Giza pyramids per teaspoon, by mass! (b) Pulsars  A pulsar is a highly-magnetized version of a neutron star, albeit they can sometimes be white dwarfs too (which are less dense than neutron stars and are a sea of electrons rather than neutrons). Their characteristic feature is that they rotate and in the process emit humongous bursts of radio-waves, X-rays and gamma rays. To understand why they rotate, and emit electromagnetic waves, we have to jump right to the birth of a star. A star is formed from the gravitational collapse of clouds of gas and dust. In most configurations, such collapse introduces an angular momentum i.e. rotation to the gas-dust cloud. This is because of asymmetries in the particle distribution before and during collapse, which cause large masses of material to fall into the centre of gravity of the cloud, but in non-radial fashion. Other particles tend to follow these trails due to gravity, and start orbiting the centre of gravity. But by this time they are bound gravitationally, and this fact combined with the orbiting imparts a rotation. For a good visualization of this effect, watch this video by minutephysics (although it\u2019s to do with planets, the mechanism is identical for stars). Now, fast forward to the time when the nuclear reactions in a star have come to \u201cfull efficiency\u201d. Small amounts of iron have already started forming in the star by now, but the other elements dominate and release tremendous bursts of energy, fueling the nuclear reaction. During this acceleration phase, the star expands into \u201cred giants\u201d or sometimes \u201corange giants\u201d, depending on the initial mass. The star\u2019s outward pressure due to the heat generated from nuclear reactions drastically increases, to the point that it exceeds the inward gravity due to its mass. This is when the star explodes in a dramatic flash of light and ionized particles, strewing superhot matter in all directions, in the event known as a \u201csupernova\u201d.  (That\u2019s the supernova remnants of SN 1987A in the Large Magellanic Cloud, close to the Milky Way) What\u2019s important here is that what remains of the parent star after the supernova is its dense core. And that the star was initially rotating. By the law of conservation of angular momentum, since the radius of the star has reduced, its angular velocity i.e. speed of rotation must increase. This is what makes pulsars rotate as terrific speeds. In fact, the fastest rotating object we know is a pulsar called PSR J1748\u22122446ad, which spins at 43000 rotations per minute, or 716 rotations per second! Such fast rotation makes the star lose energy and emit gravitational waves. But, you might be asking, how would one know at what speed pulsars are rotating? This brings us to the next aspect of pulsars, i.e. their emission of electromagnetic pulses.  Around the core of a star are trillions of tonnes of plasma, i.e. ionized atoms. Most of these are the heavier metallic atoms that have sunk to the bottom. These metallic ions are charged, and they move around in plasma currents around the core. This generates a magnetic field in the star, which is dependent on the fluid dynamics around the core. In a pulsar, the solid core rotates very fast, and the metallic plasma just adjacent to it \u201csticks\u201d to it, thereby rotating fast too. This produces a very strong magnetic field (albeit not as strong as in a special category of neutron stars called magnetars). Due to inherent asymmetries, the magnetic axis of these field lines almost always point away from the rotation axis of the neutron stars. This causes the magnetic axis itself to constantly rotate. This in turn causes the entire magnetic field to change with time, which according to electromagnetic induction produces an electric field in the charged star material. But this electric field happens to be time-varying too, which generates a new magnetic field, and the process repeats, giving ripples in the electric and magnetic field combined - electromagnetic waves, a.k.a light. (2) Mass and size (a) Neutron stars The maximum mass of a cold, non-rotating neutron star (assumed to be a Fermi gas of neutrons) is numerically given by the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff limit, [math]M_{\\text{TOV}}=\\frac{1}{m_{n}^2} \\approx 2.14 \\: M_\\odot[/math] Where [math]m_{n}[/math] is the mass of a neutron, and [math]M_\\odot[/math] is the solar mass, about [math]2 \\times 10^{30} \\: \\text{kg}[/math]. Therefore, the minimum possible volume of a neutron star is its minimum mass divided by its maximum density, which is that of neutrons themselves (considering the star is perfectly \u201cpacked\u2019 with neutrons, which is of course, a limiting case). Subsequently, we can find the minimum radius of a spherical neutron star, which turns out to be the linear mass density of a neutron, [math]R_{\\text{min}}=\\frac{r_n}{m_n} \\approx 5.97 \\times 10^{11} \\: \\text{m} \\approx 857.4 R_\\odot[/math] Where [math]r_{n}[/math] is the radius of a neutron, and [math]R_\\odot[/math] is the solar radius. But, in reality, the smallest neutron star ever observed was PSR B0943+10, which is only [math]2.6 \\: \\text{km}[/math] in radius! No one understands why, and the theoretical aspect is still in debate today. There are many hypotheses to this effect, though none are fully understood yet. (b) Pulsars Pulsars, as we had seen before, can either be white dwarfs or neutron stars. Their mass limit as neutron stars are therefore the same as above. As white dwarfs, their maximum stable mass is given by the celebrated Chandrasekhar limit, [math]M_{\\text{Chandrasekhar}}=\\frac{\\omega_3^0 \\sqrt{3 \\pi}}{2} \\left( \\frac{\\hbar c}{G} \\right) ^ \\frac{3}{2} \\frac{1}{\\mu_e^2 m_H^2} \\approx 2.765 \\times 10^{30} \\: \\text{kg} = 1.4 \\: M_\\odot[/math] Where, [math]\\omega_3^0 \\approx 2.018236[/math] [math]\\hbar = \\text{reduced Planck's constant}=\\frac{h}{2 \\pi}[/math] [math]\\left( h=\\text{Planck's constant} \\right)[/math] [math]c=\\text{speed of light in vacuum}[/math] [math]G=\\text{universal gravitational constant}[/math] [math]\\mu_e=\\text{avg. molecular wt. per e}^{-} \\text{ in star} \\: \\left( \\text{dependent on matter distribution} \\right)[/math] [math]m_H = \\text{mass of hydrogen atom}[/math] Using the same technique as in the case of neutron stars, the minimum radius of pulsars which are slowly-rotating white dwarfs is found to be, [math]R_{\\text{min}} = a_0 \\sqrt[3]{\\frac{M_{\\text{Chandrasekhar}}}{m_n}} = 6.25413959336189 \\times 10^8 \\: \\text{m} \\approx 0.9 \\: R_\\odot[/math] Where [math]a_0=\\frac{4 \\pi \\epsilon_0 \\hbar^2}{m_e e^2}[/math] is the Bohr radius, or most probable radius of a hydrogen atom in ground state. [math]\\left( \\epsilon_0 = \\text{permittivity of free space} \\\\ m_e = \\text{mass of electron} \\\\ e = \\text{charge of electron} \\right)[/math] However, even this is not the minimum radius of a pulsar, as we have ignored relativistic effects due to very speedy rotation. The constraint that special relativity imposes on not just a pulsar, but any rotating object, is that the instantaneous velocity of any point on its surface (which rotates with maximum speed) must not surpass that of light in vacuum. Now, the tangential speed of a point on a rotating pulsar can be its circumference divided by the time taken to complete one rotation, [math]v=\\frac{2 \\pi R}{T} = 2 \\pi f R = c \\: \\left( \\text{limiting case} \\right)[/math] Where [math]f[/math] is the frequency of rotation, or number of rotations in unit time. The limitation on the frequency is that after a limit (about [math]3000[/math] rotations per second), the pulsar tends to split apart due to the tremendous centrifugal force generated (this value can be calculated from the properties of stellar matter). Therefore, that gives us the theoretical minimum for a pulsar\u2019s radius, [math]R_{\\text{min}} \\approx \\frac{c}{6000 \\pi} = 15904.5 \\text{m} \\approx 16 \\: \\text{km}[/math] Once again, these values differ largely in real life. The smallest pulsar and in fact, star, we know as of 2020 is PSR B0943+10, spanning only [math]2.6 \\: \\text{km}[/math] across.  Pulsars are thus the smallest stars in the universe. Or, if we think in the reverse fashion, the smallest stars in this universe must, in maximum probability, spin extremely fast; be composed of torn atoms with very high density to have sufficient mass even after being small and losing energy as gravitational waves; be magnetized due to fluid dynamics around their core; must have a spinning magnetic field and therefore emit radio waves at regular intervals. In other words, pulsars are a consequence of: Classical mechanics - rotation due to conservation of angular momentumClassical electrodynamics - magnetic field due to flowing metallic ions; electromagnetic waves due to changing magnetic field, due to rotationQuantum mechanics - maximum frequency of rotation after which matter in the star is ripped apartGeneral and special relativity - relativistic nature of speedy rotations and the phenomenon of gravityIsn\u2019t that amazing?
