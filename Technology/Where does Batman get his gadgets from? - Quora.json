            "answer_text": "When in doubt, ask this guy:  \u201cThe weaponry comes from the Research and Development department of Wayne Tech. There is a special division that works on non-lethal weapons that is headed up by Lucius Fox, president of Wayne Enterprises. This includes grapplers, body armor, batarangs, and smoke bombs. The Batmobile was designed by Jefferson Edison, a retired race car driver and established car builder. He does maintenance of all systems on the car, and integrates new systems he designs into the car. He also works with Fox to make things like the Batplane and Batboat. Edmund Neumeuller does the special gadgets like the filament wire I swing on, springs in boots, gloves that deliver files from fingertips, and the materials that make my body armor lighter and stronger. Alfred Pennyworth buys components and wires them together for my computer equipment in the Batcave. He also works with Fox to integrate hologram keyboards and screens into the Batsuit and Batcave. Each of these men know my secret identity, and have sworn to help me uphold law and order in Gotham.\u201d ",

            "answer_text": "Christopher Nolan as we all know likes to incorporate realism into his comic book movies. It\u2019s safe to say that at least the majority of fans have responded positively to bringing in realistic villains accompanied by plausible story lines. This leads me to the evolution of the bat gadgets. In Batman Begins, Nolan introduced Lucius Fox to the big screen as a scientist that help Bruce Wayne become Batman. He offers a protective suit, grappling gun, and the tumbler as all parts of the equation to make an audience believe that an ordinary human can become a hero by using technology. All of the gadgets introduced so far have become a namesake for the Batman trilogy to the point of the History channel having an hour long documentary discussing these gadgets. Leading up to the next big installment we should pause to discuss the next gadgets we would like to see Batman use. With the departed Lucius Fox leaving Wayne Enterprises, it is safe to assume that Bruce will be responsible for any new devices. As we all know, batman is supposed to be the best detective in the world which leads me to think that his gadgets may become simpler than ever before. No longer will he have the innovation of bat sonar or radiated bills, but may go back to the basics. Perhaps a simple lock picking set hidden in his gloves or a small battery powered saw could help save the day. ",
