            "answer_text": "1. Foldable and flexible screens Not long ago, a few tech giants have released the first flexible smartphones. Samsung launched their new Galaxy Round- supposedly the world\u00b4s first flexible OLED display. LG followed and released the LG G Flex, coated with a self healing material. They might not be foldable, but the technology behind a flexible screen is definitely bringing us closer to a future packed with moldable phones. A chinese company called Royole followed and recently showcased their new flexible, ultra thin screens at the IFA conference in Berlin. With multiple manufacturers ready to jump and test new technologies, a future packed with OLEO displays and slight curves is closer than we think. 2. Long lasting wireless batteries Self charging phones are on their way. Apple made it possible for us to listen to music without relying on cables and messy inconvenient devices. Since wireless headphones already exist, it is only a matter of time until wireless batteries will become mainstream. The september 2018 Mobile World Congress Americas from Los Angeles showcased WI-FI charged devices. Engineers at University of Washington and Disney are also testing it. The movie giant showcased a prototype room with wireless power delivery. By generating magnetic fields through quasistatic cavity resonance, researchers found that they could charge multiple smartphones that were within the room. With all this data available, its only a matter of time until long range wireless power smartphones will establish connection anywhere, at anytime. The only question remaining is: will we still feel the need to buy the shinny latest release since one of the reasons for changing phones is battery degeneration, or will the future bring less consumerism and a tendency towards sustainability ? 3. Chatbots and AI systems According to a report by Grand View Research, the chatbot market is expected to reach $1.23 billion by 2025, and an annual growth rate of 24.3%. Soon exchange of emails and any manually performed task will become history. Everyone will be using chatbots to handle conversations regarding information that can be easily obtained by using an AI infused system. Bots will simply replace any manual performance, therefore customer service costs will also be reduced. 4. Innovative authentication forms Today we use pin codes and fingerprint sensors to unlock devices. But is the password dead ? What will we use to protect data privacy ? Unfortunately, cyber criminals found ways to crack passwords, so the security granted by traditional ways is no longer valid. Wireless tokens and behavioural biometrics will grow in popularity. Standard biometrics are already being used, and rely on a part of the body, such as fingers, however technology that recognizes its user based on his voice, typing speed or keypad pressure is yet to be released. Not only we will benefit from reduced fraud risk, but also increased user experience. https://industrytoday.com/article/future-predictions-in-mobile-technology/ ",

            "answer_text": " Apple\u2019s iPhone arguably led the pack for the last smartphone generation, but with Samsung taking some of Cupertino\u2019s momentum away in recent months, leadership isn\u2019t so defined this year. In many ways, we\u2019re back to where we were before the iPhone, when Palm, RIM and Microsoft fought for leadership of the market, before Apple and Google stormed in to split it up. I think we are ready for another clear leader. But this will take a company with vision and the willingness to step away from the pack. There are three features I think will define the next-generation phone. One phone, two personalities, iron-clad walls between A lot of folks carry two phones today, and they long to return to a time when they had to carry just one. They need a single phone that can contain two numbers and have a completely separate personal and business personalities they can switch between, with one interface, and security to keep each side separate. In other words, your boss shouldn\u2019t be able to pry into what you\u2019re doing on your time, and apps you install on your own shouldn\u2019t be able to violate company security policies. Whether this means the phone will need two SIMs, or a virtual SIM that has two personalities, is still unclear. But it\u2019s clear the market wants a single phone that can handle two roles, and that phone hasn\u2019t arrived yet. Cheap international roaming A huge number of smartphone users travel outside of the country, but they either have to suffer through massive roaming charges, or bring a separate phone with a native SIM to make inexpensive calls from inside the country. Roaming on the phone can cost upwards of $9 a minute, with a megabyte of data costing even more. Rates like that can make talking or downloading one of the biggest expenses of a vacation or business trip. The next-generation phone will have the ability to dynamically load the equivalent of a local SIM and incur charges at local rates, either billed or prepaid, to keep the costs down and make traveling with one phone and all of your features affordable. Virtual PBX A PBX, or Private Branch Exchange, is what companies have used for years to connect employees, but they are mostly on their last legs or completely obsolete. Companies are paying for multiple lines and multiple numbers, and often have to use \u201cfollow me\u201d services to first ring the employee office phone and then route it to their cell phone, even though a call to the cell phone would be more certain because the employee carries it. Being able to link a smartphone with full forwarding and response capability to a virtual or physical VoIP PBX is not only possible, it is a feature in shipping VoIP PBXs\u2026 but it isn\u2019t yet elegantly integrated into the smartphone experience. I think the next generation smartphone will have this capability. Hardware advancements Along with everything above, the next-generation smartphone will sport some hardware advancements we\u2019ve seen before that never quite went mainstream. For instance, wireless charging is a given, since the biggest complaint with current-generation phones is lousy battery life. Better security would be number two, since passwords are inadequate and the information on a phone can be used to gain access to secure company resources and steal information. More balanced cameras with anti-shake technology and better lenses should also eliminate the difference between that point-and-shoot camera you are always leaving at home and your smartphone. That\u2019s my list of next generation smartphone features. What\u2019s yours? Who do you think might be first to market with a phone that could revolutionize today\u2019s market, like the iPhone did last generation?

            "answer_text": "There are at least 2 amazing tech systems that I\u2019ve read about, and 2 other technologies that I\u2019ve developed myself, that I would immediately begin design and prototyping into a new smartphone. These techs are sooooooooo cool! I\u2019d KILL to have them in my own phone right now. But these techs are so far off the beaten path that I highly doubt that we\u2019ll see them from any of the current phone manufacturers. I know I\u2019m being vague - and I apologize - but I\u2019m being vague for a very good reason. You see, my little company, EpicHub.com, LLC, is in the process of working with AT&T to launch a new kind of software to the U.S. Government. This software is going to save a lot of lives - and it will be delivered in its own new kind of modified smartphone. And, as my phones get spread out across the U.S., my next step will be to begin the manufacture of my own totally new kind of smartphone - which, of course, will include those 4 new techs. And you\u2019re going to LOVE it! I know I will! But you asked, so I\u2019ll give you a teaser: Your phone will look sort of like your phone does now - to start, but it will morph into other shapes - and each shape it morphs into will carry its own highly-unique and super-cool functionality. It will change the way you interface with the world. This tech will be, to say the least, absolutely astounding. ~S ",

The eye glassware projects laser beam scanning as a virtual frame in front of you( as Tektronix oscilloscopes,USA, used for digital analyses had the touch up screens in year1982 itself) at required distance, similar to smart phone\u2019s front glass frame.. The eye frame will have touchup buttons to control ; pond size as per individual requirements, focus adjustments, night vision controls, ear sound adjustments and brightness controls. The remaining controls may be done on virtual frame in front of you with hands on virtual frame which can be seen through eye wear glasses .The pupils of eyes will control on front virtual frame as a lazer beam focusing on front frame icons as pupils of eyes moves to different locations on front frame. Your hands moves in the air in front of you and you will proceed similar to working with smart phones. Aliens having this feature controling the UFO vehicle through mind impulses and eye pupils concentrated on front distenced frame.So finally you will have only special eye glasses to wear on your eyes and the remaining operation and options are same to same.

            "answer_text": "The smartphone as we know it today will not be what they will become. We wont have a slab of glass and metal or plastic in our pockets. They will become more integrated into our everyday things and more ergonomic with being implemented into our other devices and clothing. Take a smartwatch for example. What they can do now does make you less needy upon using your smartphone for many things. Look at flexible and convertible screened devices like the Mate X and Galaxy Fold. I can see (and have in many prototypes) of what would be a smartphone the size of a marker with a roll out screen or a bracelet with the same. Again look at smartwatches and what they are capable of and look at the first iPhone or Android G1. You wont be playing games on a smartwatch but everything from messaging, calls, even social media updates can be done with ease on a smartwatch. We will see many steps going to this progression but this will be an evolution to the end goal. That is to make ourselves as immersed in communication and awareness without relying on one single device to do it. From glasses to watches to items being a part of our clothing, we will see connection and information easily accessible without relying on one single piece (a smartphone) to do it. ",
