Stem cell replacement, zombie cell removal, reduction of inflammation and scarring, lab growing organs for organ replacement, gene editing, DNA and gene repair therapy, medical nanotechnology, etc. A good deal of future medical tech will be mostly repair based approaches to undo damages and prevent the onset of ARDs (age related diseases) and cure them in the form of periodic intervention.
