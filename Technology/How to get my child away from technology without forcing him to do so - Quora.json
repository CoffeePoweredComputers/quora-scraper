            "answer_text": "Without more information there\u2019s not a lot strangers on the internet can tell you. For example, how old is the child and what do you mean by \u201ctechnology\u201d ? Is s/he using it passively (watching YouTube) or actively (solving puzzles or creating content)? I don\u2019t \u201ctry\u201d to get my child away from technology. It is so deeply woven into our lives that it is not a novelty. We use it when appropriate and do other things when technology is not needed. My work is in technology, much of my son\u2019s schooling is on the computer or uses web based teaching materials. One of his 3rd grade classes is programming java for making minecraft mods. We participate in Trail Life USA (a wilderness/achievement program similar to Boy Scouts) together, go out to the anime cafe together for bubble tea, and hang out around our little orchard together. We create videos together. I\u2019m not sure if this counts as \u201caway from\u201d or \u201cdeeper into\u201d technology. While some of the videos are decidedly low tech (2 eight year olds hamming it up for the camera), others are technically demanding and high pressure (live event webcasts) involving a sizeable crew, connected via cellphones, using broadcast equipment. We play board games individually and as a family. Sometimes we attend Pokemon (Trading Card Game) club or play Dungeons and Dragons together. Both games, while not technology centric, have cellphone and web applications that are not required but greatly assist smooth gameplay. We did block YouTube on his computer. However, if you read above and know much about the process, you will already have figured out that (a) he has full administrative privileges on his computer (needed for his java programming class) so (b) he could unblock YouTube in under 5 minutes if he decided he really wanted to.
