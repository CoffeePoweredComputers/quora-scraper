            "answer_text": "Yes. This works for me in Windows 10, Firefox 57. Specifically it is for using the search function to \u201csearch inside this book.\u201d If you found information you want to cite and reference and you get results like those pictured below,  then simply move your cursor to the bottom LEFT of the page (in the white area NOT the gray) and left click and drag until you see your text highlighted. Copy and paste this where you need it and delete anything that was highlighted that you do not want. You must select everything on the page until you get to what you wish to cut.  If this does not work for you, then I suggest using a screenshot program like the one built into Firefox, Evernote, or even using the printscreen button on your PC keyboard and visiting Screenshot OCR online - clipboard, drag and drop, upload. Online crop. Remember to only use this info responsibly and to always properly cite and reference the source and author. I have found this to be useful if I am away from my library and need information, or if I want to avoid manually entering information from a physical book. ",
