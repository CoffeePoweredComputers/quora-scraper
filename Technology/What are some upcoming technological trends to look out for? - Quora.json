            "answer_text": "Two words. Augmented Reality. Why ? Read below. Experts claim that by 2025 the AR/VR industry will be worth over 25 billion dollars. That is just the experts being expert but it will be well over 100 billion. 1.Use Case Many use cases here, applications that can benefit from AR are tons. Whether you are a doctor or a builder, AR will be like a guide in every step. The ability to display a patients anatomy, or to visualise fully constructed buildings on a landscape. With the help of smart glasses AR can take us to the next level of cyborgism. We already are dependant on our phones, and with smart glasses around the corner that will be the next step. Applications involve, maps, being literally guided every step of the way. imagine the below image but on smart glasses instead of an i-Pad.  Every day Life This is all hypothetical at this stage but imagine with the use of cloud storage paired with internet of things what can be achieved. Obviously, the hardware isn\u2019t enough at the moment and needs to be revamped which could probably take a few years. The idea I am trying to put forth or currently going around in people working in the AR/VR sector. Interactive environment. The ability to transform yourself from reality into an interactive one. Imagine while commuting to work you are taking your virtual dog out for a walk and no one without a smart glass can see it. To some you will look like an idiot but to others who are on smart glasses they can see what you are doing. Another scenario, you are in bad mood today so you play god and turn on the devil filter on your glasses which picks every thing that you see and changes it to a fire blazing wall in real time. So literally you are walking and talking in Hell. Imagine this is what you see when you walk into your office. huh! Monday.  Maybe you are in a good mood, so you apply the happy filter. boom! All walls that you see are now colourful and cloudy. Or maybe you like The Simpsons so your whole world is masked like the Simpson. This is you below taking a walk in a creek, and you see wait! what? Lisa? no its some one your AR glasses just masked as Lisa.  This never stops, masking. Anything you see could be masked when you have your glasses on. That is just the fun side of it, apart from countless other uses which we will really benefit from. AR is coming. Sources: Images from Google. The Future of Augmented Reality ",

            "answer_text": "The next major trend in technology will be room-temperature quantum computers in consumer electronics devices. Current quantum computers are extremely expensive and bulky, relying upon hardware to super-cool them to near absolute zero. They are not something the average person can use except by accessing these computers on-line. They are also very limited in what they can be used for. An Australian company, Archer Exploration, is currently building a prototype room-temperature quantum computing chip made of carbon, based on technology licensed by the University of Sydney, and after building this prototype they will be commercialising the chip for use in consumer electronics products such as smartphones. They have been patenting their technology in many countries in anticipation of global sales of devices into which their quantum chips have been integrated. While quantum computers are being developed for everyone, very recently more than one technique for adapting quantum computing to general computing purposes has been developed. (See below.) More techniques will come in future, presumably, and we will therefore all have quantum computers in hand-held devices like smartphones and tablets, in laptops, and in home robots that can converse and interact with us, and these computers, being quantum, will be way beyond even exa-scale (the power of the next generation of supercomputers being planned for the next few years by the U.S., China and Europe), and all presumably within the 2020\u2019s. Consider also that valleytronics computing is being researched, and although not so advanced as Archer Exploration\u2019s research and development, this research also offers to be a path to quantum computers in consumer electronics devices and could take us to the technological singularity much earlier than in 2046, as predicted by Ray Kurzweil, who based his predictions on Moore\u2019s Law. General purpose quantum computers have the potential to be far more powerful than silicon-based \u201cclassical\u201d computers, as the power of a quantum computer doubles exponentially with each error-corrected qubit. A classical computer only increases in power arithmetically. So with the development of room-temperature quantum computers, and with the development of techniques to widen their application to general purpose computing, computing power will no longer double as the number of bits double, but will double with each added qubit. The power of our computers will therefore soon, for all practical purposes, be virtually unlimited! Imagine what our devices will then be capable of! Imagine what kind of world we will then be living in!!!
