            "answer_text": " Most people would say the answer is obvious - - lower wages in China compared to the United States. However, that answer is only partially true. Why? Because labor is only one part of the total cost of a product, and in many cases it's as low as 20% of the total cost. Let's compare two simple products that are primarily made in China: a stuffed toy animal for a baby and a Frisbee. The stuffed animal is comprised of textile material for the cover, stuffing, two eyes and a nose. The material must be cut into pieces, sewn together and stuffed. The nose, eyes and mouth are usually a pattern of thread that is sewn on the face piece before the toy animal is sewn together and stuffed. The cutting of the pieces may be done by hand or by machine, but the pieces are sewn together by a worker using a high speed sewing machine. The stuffing is usually blown into the stuffed toy by a machine, but the insertion point is closed by hand. This type of a product is considered to be a high labor content product with labor being about 70% of the total cost. On the other hand, a Frisbee is made of plastic resin (beads or pellets of plastic) in a process that is called plastic injection molding in which the resin is heated in a molding machine to a viscous state and is then injected into a mold, after which the molded part is automatically popped out of the machine in a matter of seconds. The mold can be designed to make several parts at once at the push of a button, and a fully automated machine can be set to run continuously 24 hours a day with very little monitoring by a worker. The highest expense in producing a Frisbee is the cost of making the mold (also called tooling), and that cost is amortized into the piece price of the parts so that the higher the volume of production, the lower the cost of the amortized tooling that is added to the cost of the part. A Frisbee is considered to be a low labor product at about 20% of the total cost. What are other factors of the total cost for the \"China price\"? First, there are the actual costs of the materials used to manufacture the product, which would be the textile material and stuffing for the toy animal and the plastic resin for the Frisbee. Because of the high volume of materials and resins ordered by Chinese companies, the pricing would be as low as it could be. Second, there are the wages for the workers directly involved in producing the parts. Labor is abundant and cheap in China because even though 300,000 have risen into the middle class and above, this still leaves one billion people living at the poverty level. At any one time, there are an estimated hundred million workers who are unemployed and underemployed, which is about equal to the number of Americans employed in full time jobs. All employees in China have the right under law to join the ACFTU, which claims some 170 million members and is controlled by the Communist Party. ACFTU has a monopoly on trade unionizing in China and creation of competing unions is illegal. Party leaders have ensured that the ACFTU has a monopolist position. They don't want autonomous unions springing up, because of the potential threat to their authority. In 2008, collective bargaining became a requirement of the Labor Contract Law that went into effect, forcing most companies -- including most foreign owned ones--- to create an ACFTU chaptered trade union within them. However, there are about 1,000 protest demonstrations occurring every week in China, even at the risk of beatings, demotions, dismissal and even torture. As a result, wages have finally been rising by about 15% per year over the past four years. It took suicides by workers in the summer of 2010 to achieve additional improvement in wages and working conditions at plants that were more like prison camps with dormitories for workers to live on site and fences around the buildings so workers couldn't leave the premises.

            "answer_text": "I'm not sure if the poster means \"cheap cost\" or \"cheaply made\",  but here goes. There are a few factors that affect product cost; these are primarily  - the cost of raw materials- variable costs, like labor costs, machine time, etc- fixed costs, like the power bills, leases, Internet, salaries for office staff Lastly, on top of the costs of goods sold, you also want a profit, so you mark up your goods a bit to make some money.  Goods from China can be made cheaply in a variety of ways. Historically, low labor costs in China allowed a reduction is variable costs, which made our unit prices cheaper. This applies well to goods where labor costs make up a high percentage of the cost of goods. Clothes, and shoes are examples of high labor cost products, which is why those items were the first to leave China for lower cost locations like Vietnam and Bangladesh. Some items are not as affected by labor cost fluctuations, like highly mechanized operations, plastic and rubber moulding, electronics pick and place, etc.  China also enables cost reduction through material substitution. This can be intentional, for example if I make something out of acrylic, and I know color is not critical, I would specify a certain percentage of re-grind (recycled trimmings get re-melted and put into new sheets of material). It can also be unintentional, for example, a supplier may make prototypes with name brand hinges and fasteners, and high grade steel, but during production they may try to swap in low carbon steel, copy hinges, and non-rated screws. This is why there is no substitution for having \"boots on the ground\" in China.  The other advantage China offers is the ability to make things cheaper than can be made in other western manufacturing areas. Using cheaper matrials, lead paint, lead solder, etc can all be done in China. Remember it is up to you, the importer, to make sure the goods are made correctly, and in a way that will be acceptable in your destination market. It is ironic, that were I to make some goods for domestic sale in China, there are more certifications required than if those same goods are made for export. This allows less scrupulous suppliers to make unsafe products, so long as they are being exported. In the west, if I walked into a vendor and asked them to make goods that would be deemed unsafe they would likely turn me away, despite any protests I might have that I would export those goods. ",

            "answer_text": "In the words of Tim Cook: \"The popular conception is that companies come to China because of low labor costs. I'm not sure what part of China they go to, but the truth is China stopped being the low labor cost country years ago. That is not the reason to come to China from a supply point of view, the reason is because of the skill.\"  Let us look at the concept of labor or the involvement of labor in an every-day product. Let us compare 2 products: a plastic fork vs a plush toy. Although both products fall on opposite spectrums of the consumer life cycle (one disposable whilst the other one is reusable), both are sure to be made in China. A plastic fork is made from food-grade Polystyrene (PS) plastic pellets or beads through a process known as plastic inject molding. In here the pellets are heated in a molding machine to a viscous state and are injected into a mold. The mold produces multiple sets of forks within a matter of seconds and from there on it\u2019s as simple as detaching the forks from a sacrificial (?) holder or tool (this is also made of PS and in most cases is recycled). From here the product is moved into packaging and then sent out of the factory for export. A fully automated machine can be set to run continuously 24 hours a day with very little monitoring by a worker, thus being a low labor product. Now, let us look at that plush toy. The stuffed animal is comprised of textile material for the cover, stuffing, two eyes and a nose. The material must be cut into pieces, sewn together and stuffed. The nose, eyes and mouth are sewn onto the material together and stuffed, requiring skilled labor(-). The cutting of the pieces may be done by hand or by machine, but the pieces are sewn together by a worker using a high-speed sewing machine. Next comes the insertion of stuffing \u2013 this is rather complex for a machine to do, as such the insertion is done by hand and the insertion point is also manually closed. It is evident that this requires much labor, therefore, this type of a product is considered a high labor product with labor contributing 70% of the total cost [1]. In the end, much like a fork, the product is moved and packaged for export. Because labor is only one part of the total cost of a product, and in many cases it's as low as 20% of the total cost, \u2013 this must indicate that there may be other factors at play in making Chinese products, such as the fork. If labor were the only factor, then most of the \u201cplush toy/labor intensive\u201d industries would have shifted to other countries \u2013 but only some industries already have e.g. Bangladesh, Vietnam and Mongolia to name just a few. To that extent, manufacturing of plastic forks could possibly return to the USA; but that\u2019s not happening. Industrial production does not take place in isolation, but rather relies on networks of suppliers, component manufacturers, distributors, government agencies and customers who are all involved in the process of production through competition and cooperation. The ecosystem of doing business in China has evolved quite a lot in the last thirty years. Here are the additional factors, including labor, that affect the overall cost of manufacturing and thus make Chinese exports cheaper: A. Commendable supply chain: Supply chain activities transform natural resources, raw materials, and components into a finished product that is delivered to the end customer. No country, at present, has a supply chain more sophisticated yet flexible than China. China\u2019s biggest advantage is their domestic availability of most of the raw materials required to manufacture a given product [2]. Not only are private entities involved in the process of outputting raw material for manufacturing. Rather, many Chinese State Owned Enterprises (SoEs) actively control and output raw materials for small factories to transform into ready-made goods. If the government is involved in such activities, it is safe to assume that this is an active industry that requires not only oversight and monitoring, but active involvement. Access to affordable raw materials helps bring down manufacturing costs to a considerable extent. As a result, having suppliers who are local to the manufacturer has gained importance as a way to cut costs[6]. B. Rebate upon Export: The export tax rebate policy was initiated in 1985 by China as a way to boost the competitiveness of its exports by abolishing double taxation on exported goods[7]. China is one of over 150 countries that utilize a Value Added Tax (VAT) system. It is a tax only on the \"value added\" to a product, material, or service at every state of its manufacture or distribution. The VAT rate is generally 17%, or 13% for some goods. Chinese companies receive a VAT refund from the government for materials of products produced for export. Basically, factories that export do not pay any VAT on goods or raw materials used made for export \u2013 further subsidizing raw material costs. American imports to China are charged a VAT, but the U. S. doesn't have a VAT to charge Chinese imports. Moreover, Chinese manufacturers work with far lower profit margins than those in the U.S. C. Efficient Infrastructure and Logistical Access: In its fast-paced effort towards industrialization, China has built many ports (big and small), roads and railroad access. Such a system is not secluded to the big cities (Tier 1 or Tier 2 cities), it connects all of them, including Tier 4 cities or small towns used as industrial manufacturing zones. Having an efficient logistical system allows for cheaper travel costs \u2013the cost of units (kilometers or miles) per currency (dollar or RMB) decreases. Also, an efficient infrastructure reduces overall downtime. Such is the case of India, as pointed out by Vaibhav Mandhana [3]: \u201cGiven the poor roads, a shipment from India's north can take a week or more to reach India's south. Sometimes it is quicker and cheaper to actually get a shipment from Shenzhen than Kolkata. Time is money and all those delays add to your cost. If I could get something in two days, I could sell it immediately rather than wait two months to sell it [add up the interest costs]\u201d \"The road freight from LA to Nevada will cost you a lot more than the sea freight from China to LA.\"[5] D. Subsidized Utilities and Availability: Within China\u2019s industrial areas many fixed and variable production costs are heavily subsidized. For example: electricity and water are subsidized up to 30% compared to normal household or commercial zones. Moreover, the local government gives support with land access at competitive rates, creating jobs in the area. This further helps to diminish the cost of the end product \u2013 after all you have access to cheaper land, water and light (What manufacturing does not require these? - Hell, even mining bitcoin does!). In non-industrialized or not fully industrialized countries (Indonesia, Vietnam, India), access to water and electricity remains a critical issue, until today. \u201cIn Coimbatore and other industrial places, you get power for like eight hours a day. That means the machinery lies idle for sixteen hours and that wasted capacity adds to the cost.\u201d Do we see a trend of several factors, other than labor, which affect the overall cost of the product? Hold on, there are more! E. Bureaucracy: Barriers for entry in China, in this context, are extremely low. Although you need to fill out a huge number of papers (Customs Declaration Form, Land Annexation, Tax Filing, Compliance Related Documentation, Drawback/Rebate Forms, Annual Returns and etc.), the process is not complex. Relevant departments and accountability are there; you do not need to grease palms to get what you need; streamlined government policies are in place. Again, non-industrialized countries do not have many of these processes in place \u2013 they are in the early stages, whereas China has been through all this. I am not saying China is pure and not corrupt, there might be corruption in some cases, but the overall industrial process is so deeply rooted, that people just follow established guidelines. Greasing palms and running around places to get a stamp or a signature causes further delays (time is money) and increases overall costs. This is considered more as \u201cPolitical Will\u201d than bureaucracy; meaning the government\u2019s will to allow you to do business is prominent thus reducing barriers for you to do business or manufacture or engage in services. F. Technology and Automation/ Skilled Labor: It would be unreasonable to discard China\u2019s interconnectivity between technological advancement and manufacturing capacity. They work hand-in-hand. Availability of the latest technology to manufacture products of a high quality on a large scale. And let's be honest, scalability can be a very important factor in deciding price of a product. Apart from technology, China has a large population, thus having a bigger access to a wide talent pool. Availability to a greater talent pool decreases the overall demand as there is an oversupply \u2013 again, denting the costs of the product. If you recall, Tim Cook's main reason for manufacturing in China is: the depth of highly skilled labor in the manufacturing space. To rephrase what Cook said: \"No other country in the world besides China has the combination of an electronic component supply chain and large pools of skilled labor needed to make iPhones on the scale which Apple needs.\" G. Labor: It is comparatively cheaper to many so-called \u201cdeveloped countries\u201d. You can have someone do the same labor task for a comparatively lower price than say Europe or the USA for that matter. This further brings down costs. As noted before, it is not the cheapest \u2013 but it is not the most expensive either. What is important to remember here is that labor in China, is skilled \u2013 although most laborers are not trained, but have learned by doing. When you outsource to China, you\u2019re working with time-tested factories that have been producing quality products in similar industries as yours for years on end, and in massive supply. Where a labor task might cost you $8-9 USD/hour in developed countries, it will cost you $450-500 USD for an entire month in China (8 hours a day, 28 days a month). If you do the math, that\u2019s about $2.19 USD/hour. Countries like Indonesia a semi-skilled laborer will do it for half, $1.05 USD/hour \u2013 but the manufacturing process will be influenced by factors all the factors mentioned. H. Local Government: Local government officials are appointed, not elected. Part of their job is to help the industries and they are measured by results. Furthermore, locals compete with each other. That means Suzhou is competing with Chengdu to attract industries, and so on. Hence officials are always using their local advantages to help, attract, and grow industries, such as providing low cost land, building industrial parks, and making sure that the support infrastructure (roads, electricity, water, etc.) even local housing and schools are there. Since these officials are not elected locally, their actions are much more efficient rather than dealing a motion to go through town hall meetings or waiting for a ballot to pass for months. The downside of such efficiency could be that some environmental studies were not complete or many local concerns are not addressed fully (All credit for how to local governments operate within China go to Mr. James Yeh ). Here are few controversial factors, claimed by several sources: I. Currency: There is the ever-present theory of currency manipulation among economists, where China undervalues their currency by an estimated 30%-40%, which simply makes every product that China ships out 30-40% cheaper than those of a potential American competitor. The Yuan is manipulated and pegged undervalued to the US dollar [2]. So the price quoted in US dollars( more exports are quoted in dollars), will be cheaper than normal; (This manipulation has affected the domestic price of the product and labor wages as it has been kept much lower than it should have been. The Chinese yuan has, however, been steadily increasing in value against the dollar over the past few years. J. Compliance: The Chinese government does not bind itself with Intellectual Property issues. They allow the industry to investigate the products developed successfully elsewhere in the world. They then produce them in large quantities. Personally, there is nothing wrong in this benchmarking. Most industries do benchmark; especially in the automotive world. This saved the industry from expensive investments in R&D [4]. Although China has its own environmental protection agency, the environmental protection laws are generally lax and not enforced fully, especially at the local level. In previous years, Chinese factories cut down on waste management costs -further bringing down overall product costs. Things have been different lately, thanks to the strong efforts from the national government. Laws on IP and environmental protection are being enforced, especially after the Hangzhou G20 summit. There is still some belief that more needs to be done. If cheap labor was in itself the key driving factor, a large percentage of the labor-intensive factories would have already shifted to cheaper labor countries and lower labor-intensive jobs would have returned to the countries such as the USA - because China is not the synonym for cheap labor anymore. But that's not what we are experiencing; only certain jobs within the manufacturing field are moving to South East Asia. A huge chunk is there and is still able to reap the benefits of various factors. It will take more than a cutthroat desire for emerging economies to set up a business ecosystem that can compete with China's. Wow now over 1,000 Thanks for your upvotes!

            "answer_text": "Before I share the shopping cart list of reasons, Chinese businesses are supplemented by their government so the companies can do things at below costs and still make a profit. Regulations are lax in China, human life is cheap and disposable. They do not care if the person is going to die on the job or as a result from toxic exposure. The staff is not much more then corporate slaves, they are to live, eat and breath for the company, placing it before family, God and all things. The businesses are not held to ethical and moral standards along patents, copyrights, and the like. If they see there is a buck to be made, they will do anything with full autonomy to make that buck, even if it means putting other operations out of business. If you opt into using China for importing anything and the demand is showing viability, especially with new products and markets, you had better bet they will also sell to your competitors or become competitors themselves. They will make counterfeit products just like the ones you developed and taught the public upon it\u2019s viability and run with it, leaving you behind without even a thank you for your hard work bringing something to market. Ever try to sue a Chinese business for stealing your ideas, to any number of things and you do not live in China? Good luck there, your efforts are wasted. They are not held accountable like businesses in other countries. There are very little environmental restrictions, they can toss toxic materials into any area they want instead of paying to have them properly disposed of. There is nothing stopping them from polluting the air, water and earth, it\u2019s just one more thing the rest of the world has to contend with, not them. They are held to extremely loose regulations upon materials, product safety, and ethical standards. It doesn\u2019t have to last any longer then it needs to, for it will be tossed anyway and replaced with the next piece of crap, we in the west have been trained to never be satisfied with what we have so there is no reason for it to last anyway. Now that they have dominated any given market, they can afford to buy massive equipment, facilities and materials, that volume approach is extremely hard to compete with. This gets their costs down even further, often to the point one cannot acquire even materials at what their finished product is being sold for. I happen to be one of the rare in the population that is tactful upon my expenditures. I prefer to buy something that lasts, not having to re-buy every few months, especially when it comes to tools since I need them to be accurate, precise and always functioning. I compete with China on my terms, it\u2019s quality and pride with what I manufacture, and if the client is wanting flimsy and cheap, they are more then welcomed to go to some Chinese based lines, have at it, but don\u2019t complain when it falls apart to fails to function from the get go. My equipment that I sell are manufactured in America and Italy. I get approached from Chinese companies all of the time to carry their lines and they all get a thumbs down upon. ",

            "answer_text": "In fact, I call that high cost performance, or competitiveness. You'll pay hundreds of dollars for your phone, but will you pay a penny for a pager? But they're all phones, and pagers are cheaper.  More convenient logistics. When you see a Chinese new high road, new railway or new port. Can you imagine that means your desk lamp has been reduced by two cents? There is no raw material market for international capital. Zhengzhou has a cotton market where more than 60% of the world's cotton is traded. But I bet you have never heard of the city. What about shijiazhuang (steel)? Baotou (rare metal)? International capital has nothing to do but raise production costs. Cheap workers. Humans have yet to develop the technology to make 10,000 pairs of shoes a day. So shoemakers can't get high salaries. But the good news is that the cost of living in China is not high, one egg is only one yuan. Concentrated advantage. When a lot of companies get together, the cost goes down. When there is only one company, the local government will charge a hundred dollars to make ends meet. And if there were a hundred companies, then each company would have to pay one dollar. It's just a story, but the reality is close to the story. Heating, electricity, labor market, service enterprises. Many businesses are clustered together, so you can have a lower price and better service. Industrial training program. This is not widely applicable, but it still holds great value. Like the photovoltaic industry, or the high-speed rail industry. The Chinese government has enough money to train their favorite industries. That means lower factory rents, cheaper loans, lower environmental and safety controls, and more subsidies. A huge team of engineers. The largest group, from the region with the highest average IQs, has been trained by the brutal education engineers, who are trying to cut down on the price of your air conditioner. ",

            "answer_text": "Their are so many reasons for Chinese goods being cheaper . Let us start from their labour, it is not cheap anymore like it was before, though still cheaper then developed countries of US, Europe etc but more expensive than other Asian countries like India. But chinese advantage lies with their labour being highly skilled, which makes it an asset for them. The supply chains , industrial clusters, infrastructure etc that they have developed is one of the world's best and it all contributes to lower manufacturing costs. Besides their government supports the Industries in a lot of ways, all clearances are given quickly for people wanting to set up export units, land is provided at attractive rates, electricity and water for industries are subsidized and they get lot of tax rebates from their govt. All these factors reduces the manufacturing costs for the exporters. Besides these they adopt many unfair means to keep their products cheap like Currency manipulation, where they devalue their currency to keep prices of their goods low thereby helping them capture world markets. Technology theft , they make duplicate of all items manufactured in the world everywhere, thus they save a lot of money on Research and development and use others technology to develop cheap duplicate products. Environment abuse and violations of human rights- well their are a lot of reports available on the same, where it shows how they are insensitive to environment and their people to increase productivity and reduce manufacturing costs. Dumping of products in different countries at rates even below Chinese manufacturing rates to completely finish local manufacturing and take control of the full market. These are the important things that i can think of which all contributes to a lower price of goods.many of these things are possible in China because it a non democratic single party rule where their is no place for opposition and their president is the supreme leader who controls everything. Have also made a small video in hindi explaining same for anybody interested. Regards Bhaskar  ",

            "answer_text": "I think products from China so cheap belongs to a few reasons. Large population. China is a developing country has more than 1.3 billion people, the human resource is sufficient for manufacturing with low labor cost. Which might occupy 30% to 40% of the product cost. But now Chinese goverment gradually give up factories with low add value and increased the labor cost in the past 10 years. Large-scale production. Another very important reason is large sacle production which significantly lower down the product price. As you can see from clothing to steels, hundreds of categories products manufactured in China occupy the No.1 in the world. Complete supply chain industry. No matter what kind of industry you are belong to, you can easily find the relative supply chain which will greatly improve the production efficiency and lower down the cost. Very good infrastructure. China has very good infrasturcture which could help manufactures efficiently export products to lower down time cost. Leading ecommerce technology. The ecommerce technology in China has leading the world for years, which also help the manufacturers easily find customers and being searched online to lower down the marketing cost. High competition. The products competition is very high in China, people can always find cheaper alternatives which lead them to lower down the price to keep their products competitive. I think there are the 6 reasons why Chinese products are so cheap. Along with the fast renewing technologies applied in every kinds of industry, the Chinese manufacturers will be more competitive to provide quality products with low price.

            "answer_text": "Why Chinese products are cheaper? Think Global! The thrust of Chinese government policymakers has remained on the economy of scale. They have focused on mass production of products in their factories which lowers their aggregate cost significantly and this makes it cheaper. China always plans to export their products to the global markets thus the quantum of global demand they eye upon to cater is huge when compared to local Indian manufacturers who concentrate mainly on local demands and their scale is obviously lower which makes the product price higher. World Class Infrastructure The billions of dollars invested by China for improvement of highways, roads, rail network, ports, etc. in the last couple of decades have enabled the industry to move the raw materials or finished products easily. This reduces the time and cost spiral for transporting the materials and improves productivity. In comparison, India lags far behind in this area and needs priority attention to boost its industrial sector. Similar is the case for electricity generation. While Chinese manufacturing businesses can remain assured of uninterrupted electricity power at very cheap rates, Indian industry still has miles away from such a scenario. Productive Labor force The cost of wages has risen consistently in China in the last few years and today it is comparable to most emerging economies of the world. However, the improvement in productivity of labor force in China is perhaps higher than any other place due to continued emphasis on skill development programs for the workforce delivered by their government as well as industry. The higher productivity and not lower wage structure thus is the reason for the competitiveness of Chinese products. Reverse engineering processes The Chinese government does not bind itself with Intellectual Property issues. They allow the industry to copy the products developed successfully elsewhere in the world. There are shreds of evidence that China imports, dismantle and studies the popular products from different countries. They then copy the design and produces the product in large quantities. This saved the industry from expensive investments in R&D. Leveraging their currency Since the Chinese government has not signed the WTO agreement which does not bind it to desired transparency stipulations. Economists believe that China skillfully manipulates its currency value to their advantage. They deliberately keep their currency remain weak against the US dollar which helps them keep their products competitive for exports. Dumping They even export goods at lower rates than their cost in China itself to avail the benefits. This is termed as dumping in international trade. The cheaper Chinese products are causing severe damage to the local manufacturing units of the importing country many of which are compelled to eventually close their operations and making room for more imports to meet the local demands. The Chinese government is known to facilitate such activities by their local industry ignoring the protests raised by many countries.

He was looking to sell lots of these:  They went to watch the construction of a highway in China. He described it to me in this fashion. \u201cWell we got there and I looked down the valley where they were prepping the road grade and we saw 10,000 guys with baskets and about 3000 guys with shovels. The shovelers filled up the basket and the basket guy walked the dirt 400 yards over to a different pile\u2026I looked at my boss and we both nodded\u2026we\u2019re gonna sell a lot of bulldozers over here.\u201d Of course, since then China makes plenty of their own heavy equipment as their industrial revolution has brought them into the modern world. Be advised that over the last 30 years US business has off shored billions in production. Reasons, obviously include labor costs. Chinese at this time, work for less per hour than Americans. Below is one of the many many buildings that used to be occupied by a company called Cliftex Corporation\u2026  They were located in New Bedford, Mass and were the largest private label manufacturer of men\u2019s suits and outerwear in the world. That\u2019s correct, the world. Long ago I walked into a Cliftex warehouse and looked at racks over 100 yards long with 75,000 men\u2019s top coats ready for shipment. Cliftex closed down with about 60% of the rest of the US textile industry in the 80\u2019s as China, could make those 75,000 topcoats for about 70% less. And, of course, a lot of other things were exported to China like\u2026  and  Leading to the next step of an industrial revolution. Education. As the population gains education, they will kick the governments ass hard enough to achieve regulation and? Chinese companies will begin a cycle of off shoring to other countries with cheaper labor and friendly pollution regulations. Finally, the future. Dark factories feature full automation driving the labor contribution to cost to a tiny percentage. A set of sheets made in North Carolina (proximate to cotton production) may eventually gain market share in the US market with a dark factory producing and packaging the product. I don\u2019t have a historical example of \u201cfull circle\u201d manufacturing, thus, I don\u2019t know if finance will execute on this potential opportunity in the future. 1860 - cotton loom 300 workers 1890 - \u201cnew\u201d cotton loom 50 workers\u2026below, a cotton mill in Lawrence, Massachusetts  The goal for finance is zero workers and always will be. Cost must be controlled for survival and China too, will eventually become \u201cexpensive.\u201d ",

            "answer_text": "Democracy is not all it is cracked up to be. In China, there are intelligent people who run the country. Their goal is to sell things. They make sure everything is in place so that manufacturing and distribution costs are as cheap as they can be. They encourage exports (offer rebates). They can violate human rights if they feel like it. They can ignore their environmental responsibilities. Land ownership and currency manipulation is important. If I, as a foreigner wanted to take my millions (assumed not real) and want to buy a whole bunch of land in China to build apartments, I can\u2019t. This keeps property values down, and the cost for business to use land down. There are businesses here in Canada that can sell the land they bought in the \u201850\u2019s and make a ton of money and simply close down. Not an option in China. I can buy stuff on e-bay and have it mailed from China more cheaply than I can buy a stamp here to mail something to China. The Chinese government controls a lot of things that a free society cannot control. The only way the Yuan will reflect true value is to allow foreigners to buy land and businesses in China. Not going to happen. What puzzles me is when the US challenges Canada for unfair trade practices (without justification) yet imports so much from places like China where the unfair trade practices are plenty. In the end it is about ownership. If a US company exploits Canadian resources for export to the US, it\u2019s OK. If a Canadian company ships the same stuff to the US, the US will claim their industry is being hurt. Who said Chinese products are cheaper anyway? There are a lot of high end things that are made in China. None of which reflect the cost of manufacture. They are often very pricey. Do you think a made in China Volvo is cheaper than a made in Sweden one? ",

            "answer_text": "Some good answers have already been posted, but I\u2019d like to think that at a fundamental level, it\u2019s because of multiple scale effects that differentiate production in China from that of the rest of the World. Let me start with a question that I heard from NPR several years ago, i.e. is there anything that one can still buy at one or two pennies in Manhattan? Answer: a nail, imported from China at a bulk rate such as $1,200/ton. This kind of bulk rate is possible because of Economies of scale - Wikipedia in producing nails, i.e. larger factories churn out less expensive outputs by driving down average unit cost. Not only can the final output be produced at lower unit cost but also its inputs (produced at scale by other factories). So in China scale economies drive down prices of final goods twice. The efficiency gains from clustering manufacturers is called Economies of agglomeration - Wikipedia. A large number of producers located at the same manufacturing clusters leads to higher efficiency through more specialization across companies and industries, less friction in procuring inputs, faster prototyping, faster information flow, deeper division of labor, and better match of workers to jobs. In China these clusters are larger than in most other countries, so the agglomeration economies must be larger as well for Chinese manufacturers. The Pearl River Delta, for example, has been called \u201cthe World\u2019s Workshop\u201d because it has had lots of such clusters that produced nearly 5% of world\u2019s goods at one point. The Yangtze River Delta is another region with many large manufacturing clusters. And they are just the largest and best-known two manufacturing regions. There are many other lesser-known but still large manufacturing clusters by international standards. Many Chinese manufacturers complain about low profit margins. Low margins are often a sign of intense competition, especially when numerous producers compete against each other. So one reason that Chinese goods are less expensive is that there are far more producers in each market, resulting in more competition on pricing than elsewhere. Maybe we can call it the market-scale effect, because the large market size is what supports the large number of producers. Many answers have suggested other causes of lower prices of Chinese goods, such as land and electricity prices, transportation networks and costs, and abundant supply of talents and skills. While I believe that these causes are true, it\u2019s important to understand that they are also consequences of scale effects. Electricity, transportation, and talents are affordable mainly because one or more of the scale effects described above have lowered their costs of production. So in this sense, the fundamental cause of less expensive Chinese products are scale effects. ",

Have you ever heard of Foxconn, a sweatshop notorious for its shocking work conditions? Here are some examples: Suicides. The company was hit by a wave of workers suicides in 2010. Other incidents have occurred since.Wage and hours exploitation. In 2012, Foxconn was accused of underpaying wages and having its employees work excessive hours. In response, the company pledged to curtail the length of shifts and raise wages.Serious accidents. One Foxconn worker was left brain damaged after an electric shock in 2011. An explosion in one factory killed four people and injured another 18 in the same year.Underage and illegal workers.

            "answer_text": "2 major factors: Costs, including labor are cheaper in Chia.But, the bigger reason is that China allows all products made for export be made domestic tax free. If the same products are made for domestic consumption there is a 17% tax on the raw materials plus another 17% on the final product sold to the consumer. In essence, if they sell the product at cost, they make a 17% profit.Another factor is, unlike American suppliers, Chinese suppliers typically work with 25% margins. So, the product on the export market is usually less expensive than the same product on the Chinese domestic market. American companies write off taxes paid as well, but, they do not pass these savings on to the consumer. Plus, American companies typically work on a 66% gross margin or higher on products for export. In fact many times the products are 2X or higher more expensive in foreign markets than they are in the US domestic markets (the wall street factor)\u2026. ",

            "answer_text": "It depends on how you see this question. Some main factors are involved: exchange rate, massive production, brand influence, etc. You will always find something cheaper from a country that has a lower exchange rate. All costs, including labor cost, raw material, operation cost, etc. adds up to the cost of an item you buy. The cost may not be cheap, but the currency on your hand has an advantage - high exchange rate. That\u2019s why it\u2019s \u201ccheap\u201d in your eyes. Another thing is massive production. If you have ever run your own production by manufacturing things, you will immediately notice the benefit of massive production. Costs will drop to the minimum. No matter what commodity you are talking about here, I have to assume that it\u2019s not a limit edition. Unfortunately, so many commodities exported from China do not have a strong brand influence in the market. I\u2019ve noticed many small factories here export goods whose brand is never heard in the domestic market. I doubt they are famous overseas either. How can you sell such an item to a cuatomer at a high price if it\u2019s trademark is never heard? I am sure there are more factors that contribute to the cheapp price of an item you bought from China. But let\u2019s not forget that we also sell really expensive items as well. ",

I am mentioning a few below - Devaluating Yuan - China had successfully and purposely reduced the value of their currency in past years, which had a direct impact on their exports. As the value of a currency falls exporters of that country enjoy more profit as they get more Yuan for every dollar paid. To understand it better let\u2019s take an example. If China selling an apple to The US for a dollar and a dollar to Yuan is 1:5 so Chinese exporter gets 5 yuan per apple and when China devalues its currency from 1:5 to 1:10 that same exporter enjoy more profit by just manipulating its currency.Taxes in Country - Taxes in China is also favourable to business As you can see, there is a huge gap in between Taxes implemented on business.

The average income in China is about 1/10th ours at $5,900 but again, that\u2019s for 280 hours of work a month. The Chinese struggle but smile. They take pride in working to send their children to universities so they have a better life. The Chinese government has made a big push in STEM education so factory quality stays high despite the low pay. BTW: We can buy eggs, chicken, pork and even rice cheaper here in mid Michigan cheaper than in China. Houses in China cost about the same per sq/ft as here and yet China has a higher rate of home ownership than we do in the USA. When I first went to China a home required 50% down and no mortgage longer than 5 years\u2026 if we did that the market would collapse. Even with low wages the Chinese are savers and out a premium on having 2\u20134 years of wages in the bank as a safety net.. since Trump began threatening China four years ago the average Chinese citizens has been saving nearly 50% of their incomes and no one has credit card debt!

I would bet that rice, ramen noodles, and cheap mass produced white bread are the largest selling food items in the world. But just some people want better food, so farmers and livestock producers sell many other, higher priced foods. And China know that other people want better, higher priced products, so they make these too! I just purchased a new laptop workstation from China. It was not cheap to me, around $2300 US. I could have easily spent another $1500-$2000 on this unit had I put more really nice options on the list, but it is set up well enough. I could have bought one produced anywhere, for a similar price; my last workstation was from a semi-custom manufacturer in California. But I\u2019ve had good luck with a small convertible tablet computer from the Chinese company, plus I\u2019ve worked with several people who had this brand and was impressed with the features and reliability. The technology and craftsmanship is on a par with any other manufacturer, anywhere. The Chinese can manufacture products to suit anyone\u2019s needs or taste. And do. In enormous quantities.

Chinese government partners with Africa countries, Pakistan, Srilanka, etc to get various infrastructure projects (providing credit line) & for natural resources. This ensure Chinese industry runs throughout the year with cheap raw material.They have skilled & cheap manpower. They have huge population with required skillsets for all industries.From various hidden camera videos available in net, I assume government is least bothered about its people living conditions at factories & industry exploits this to keep profit margin high.Due to above conditions, China produces things in huge volumes & ships it to shop next to your house at cheap price.

Today China has a line of white branded goods which are exported with labels provided by the importers. They are willing to cater to any batch size from 10 to 10,000. This dynamic nature makes them favourites and they can bring down the costs. There is a synergy among Chinese SME that bring about easy integration of services to bring down costs.

As China supplies products globally (in fact global customers are dependent on Chinese products), hence manufacturers in China produce maximum possible lot size, which reduces their manufacturing cost and so they sell products at cheap rates. Labor cost is cheap in China, which ultimately effect manufacturing cost i.e very low manufacturing cost. Availability of raw materials in China is very high, which effects manufacturing costs. Government support for local manufacturers and suppliers in terms of selling their products globally also contribute towards reducing cost of exported products. ",

However, these have increased significantly over the past decade. Secondly, China is well organized into production hubs. Meaning that many factories making similar products are located in these hubs, along with the suppliers of components or factors of production needed by the manufacturers. It is very efficient. This further reduces costs. Next, the Chinese economy is very export orientated (although many manufacturers are now concentrating on the local market), and there are incentives to export. These are usually financial, which has cost implications. China has also invested heavily in export related infrastructure. Most of the world's biggest ports are located in China. These ports are very efficient. Hope this helps. ",

Countries like China, India, Bangladesh, now some countries in Africa realize that their standard of living and their hourly wages are much lower than their Western counterparts. You can get exact numbers from various sources online. So they work on increasing their manufacturing capabilities to make everything the cheapest possible, utilizing their cheaper labor costs, economy of scale and specialized machinery. The cost of the raw material also gets associated with the above principles because it takes the above to even get plastic resin to the factories to make products out of them. China specializes in plastic products, India does metals, Pakistan and a few others do fabric, and so forth. There are many other small factors resulting in cheaper goods from these various countries. But primarily, it is the difference between a guy from a country needing $10 for a meal and another guy from another country living on $10 for the week (not just meals). ",
