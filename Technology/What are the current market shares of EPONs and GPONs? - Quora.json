            "answer_text": "Gigabyte passive optical network (GPON) standards, compared to PON standards, use larger variable length packets and offer higher efficiency and better bandwidth. As more and more telecom operators switch from fiber-to-the-business (FTTB) to GPON-based fiber-to-the-home (FTTH) rollouts, the demand for and sales of GPON equipment has grown. Continuous improvement in technology, demand for better quality fiber in network architecture from service providers, and introduction of new fiber the FTTH projects in Russia, China, and the U.S. has driven the global GPON equipment market so far. Apart from this, high return on investments, low cost of ownership, optimized bandwidth connectivity, advanced security, and simplified network operations have also contributed toward the growth of the GPON equipment market. The Europe market for GPON equipment is set to witness impressive growth by 2018 with prominent telecom operators transitioning from FTTB to GPON-based FTTH rollouts. In addition, growing demand for energy conservation and a strong optical network setup has bolstered the growth of the GPON equipment market in Europe. ",
