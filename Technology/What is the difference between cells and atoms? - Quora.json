            "answer_text": "The cell is the basic unit of life: it is the smallest entity that can be considered a living thing. Atoms themselves, however, are not alive. But cells could not be cells without atoms.  Atoms are the building blocks of everything you see (or can't see!) around you. The Periodic Table of Elements lists all known types of atoms. These different types of atoms, called elements, have very different ways of behaving. They can interact with each other and bond together to form molecules (2 or more atoms). Millions of certain types of molecules combine in specific ways to make the four types of macromolecules found in all cells: proteins, nucleic acid (DNA, etc.), carbohydrates (sugar, starch), and lipids (fat and oils). These larger building blocks, made up of atoms, combine in very specific ways to form a cell... a little sac that has tons of chemical reactions going on inside it, which is the basic definition of life. You and I are made up of trillions of cells, but some organisms are only one single cell. In addition, a cell can be seen with a microscope, whereas individual atoms cannot.  ",

            "answer_text": "Atoms are considered the smallest structure of matter that still has the properties of a given element. For instance, an atom of gold is the smallest piece of gold that retains the properties of gold. Atoms are made of protons (positive charge) and neutrons (no charge) in the nucleus and electrons (negative charge) in the electron cloud. There are an equal number of protons and electrons in an atoms; hence, atoms have no overall charge. Atoms combine with other atoms to make molecules and compounds. In biology, these molecules may form cellular organelles, which are functional structures within a cell. Organelles may include endoplasmic reticulum, mitochondria, Golgi complex, etc. A cell is the basic unit of structure and function for an organism; or at least for multicellular organisms. Cells are made of several organelles surrounded by a plasma membrane (cell membrane) which helps to regulate what enters/exits the cell. Cells of certain organisms (e.g., plants) will have a cell wall surrounding the cell membrane. In humans there are over 200 different types of cells that have many functions in our bodies. For instance, gametes are sex cells (sperm and egg) that are involved in reproduction. Other cells have many functions including sensory structures, hormone producers, and contractile cells (muscles). So, atoms and cells are quite different from each other. ",

            "answer_text": "The term cell originally referred to a small chamber (such as a monks cell) and of course is still used in that way. It was adopted for science by Robert Hooke and his microscope when he magnified a slice of cork by 30 times and saw it composed of many tiny little chambers which he then called cellulae. From there it was adopted into biology as the individual containers for life processes. Within each cell is a small definable spot which was named the nucleus. The term atom came from an ancient greek word implying the smallest non-divisible piece of matter. When more recent concepts about the elements and the Periodic Table were developing it was adopted to mean a single unit of each element. Originally believed to be non-divisible, but we now know that it isn\u2019t but the name stuck. When it was revealed that the atom is composed of smaller parts, and that one part (electrically positive) was located at the centre of the atom, the biological term \u201cnucleus\u201d was adopted for that. So one could say that a cell is a biological entity which is composed of many parts which operate the systems of life at the molecular level, and the molecules of and within the cell are constructed of atoms. A small piece of cork was said to contain over a thousand million (10 raised to power 9) cork cells. A mole of atoms (eg. Iron, 55.85 grams) would contain Avogadro\u2019s number (just over 6 x ten to the power 23) of atoms. So the difference in size of a cell and an atom is enormous. The word cell is used in many other contexts to imply a single unit of something, from a phone battery to a terrorist group ! (The term battery really applies to a connected collection of cells. Of military origin it relates to a collection of defensive gun emplacements). The word atom is also sometimes adopted to imply extreme smallness. Language can be tricky !! ",

Even though its size is minute, it retains all the original properties of the chemical element. Every atom consists of three subatomic particles, Electrons (negatively charged), Protons (positively charged) and neutrons (no charge).  A cell is a term given to one single unit which is enclosed inside a border. Biologically, it is a unit which forms the structural basis necessary for a being to function. It is hence often referred to as \"the building block of life\". Organisms can be unicellular, such as amoeba, or multi cellular, such as humans.  ",

The composition is mostly same for a species\u2019 specific cell type but different for different species. Its size is comparable to that of an average cell (4 to 5 times). It is completely surrounded by cytoplasm and other organelles of the cell. Now taking the case of the word nucleus in the case of an atom. It does not carry information as such but defines a lot of properties of the element it is part of. Its composition consists of just protons and neutrons, i.e., all the atomic nuclei are just permutations and combinations of their numbers. The size of the nucleus in relation to the atom can be visualized by considering it as a pea in the center of our atom the size of Camp Nou (Yeah, I am a Barca Fan). And another point of difference being that Atomic Nucleus is surrounded by only minute electrons (equal to the number of protons and of an even smaller size than protons and neutrons) and empty space while on the contrary cell nucleus is completely engulfed in the cell\u2019s contents.

One oxygen and 2 Hydrogen atoms form a water molecule. When many molecules come together, they form substances, like many water molecules form the liquid water in your cup. Likewise, different molecules come together (although in a much more complicated way) and make a Living CELL. These cells come together and form tissues and those come together to form organs and ultimately, us. So you can say that CELLS are the fundamental units of a living things but they themselves (and all matter)are made up of ATOMS. ",

Not most, but ALL of the parts and pieces of a cell are made up of atoms.

Molecules make macromolecules. Macromolecules are organised into a cell. e.g. Carbon is an atom, it makes up a molecule like carbon dioxide, monosaccahride or amino acid. These can form macromolecules e.g. polysaccharide, protein, lipids, nucleic acid etc. which are organised into a cell. ",

Then cells are the ultimate physical achievement of the atomic world.  They are able to, in microscopic ways, accelerate the rate of energy transfer toward entropy by using simply regulated catalytic processes to pass energy through states that would demand immense activation energies or would race toward explosions otherwise. The cell has found ways to facilitate mass entropy in days that would take thousands of years on a geological scale. So, yes cells are the basic unit of life...and life is the ultimate incarnation of atomic power. ",
