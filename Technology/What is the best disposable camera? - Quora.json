            "answer_text": "Thanks for the A2A. You asked: What is the best disposable camera? For color, the Kodak branded ones are pretty good. They're loaded with Kodak print film, and the lenses are a little sharper than the Fuji branded ones. Ilford Photo has disposable cameras loaded with black and white film, so if you want black and white photos, get one of those, loaded with either HP5+ or XP2 Super. When you're done with the roll, I recommend serving it directly to Dwayne's Photo in Parsons, KS. If you send it through the local drug store or big box chain store, it'll likely end up there anyway. Or of you have a local camera store, drop it off there, provided they do their own processing. If they can turn it around in a week or less, they probably do their own processing. If they say three weeks, run to the post office and just sending it to Dwayne's. (www.dwaynesphoto.com) ",

There are single-use cameras. When you send the camera in to get the film developed, nearly all of the parts (except the lens and the film) are recycled. The recycling rate is so high that in 2005 people at Kodak estimated they would never need to make any new body parts. The only problem was that the marketing folks wanted some new news. My last project at Kodak was to redesign the 800-speed film that is used in single-use cameras to get a new claim for marketing. (We also used as many components as possible from other products to reduce component inventory costs.) We manage to squeeze out a small improvement in sharpness. To answer the question, I like the waterproof single-use cameras. I\u2019ve used them snorkeling, sailing, on raft trips, and at waterparks.  ",
