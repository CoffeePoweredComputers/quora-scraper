            "answer_text": "Technology serves a variety of purposes and means different things to different people. In today\u2019s world technology can be found at every corner. From the local convenience store to your local deli shop, technology makes the world function more efficiently. While some are reluctant to embrace new technological advancements, most of us have some form of technology in our household. The smartphone and home computer are probably the two pieces of technology most households have. There\u2019s no debating that technology has become integral in our daily lives, for better and maybe for worse. Here\u2019s how: Education Technology fuels most of the educational system testing. Now with computers and iPads in just about every classroom, technology has advanced the testing options available to most school systems. Technology makes it more efficient for teachers to handle report cards and grading papers, thus cutting down working hours that usually go well beyond the school day. Communication Whether in business or personal life, technology has improved communication. With apps like Voxer, Skype and other communication apps you can easily improve communication on a business level. These apps also do well when trying to stay connected to family members that live far away. Security Technology can make any family or business feel safer. There are many security devices and software available to secure your financial data, protect your home when you are away and much more. Technology is important because it makes you feel more secure with every area in life for both personal and business reasons. Supplies With technology advancing more people are able to have access to supplies such as fresh water and food because technology can help deliver those items to people that otherwise couldn\u2019t get it. With apps that allow you to order out or the robust technology driven devices that provide water to towns, there are more supplies available due to technology. Space Without technology we would have not have advanced so far in the space industry. NASA utilizes technology to find new planets, monitor space and much more. Technology is important in learning more about the galaxy that surrounds us so that perhaps we can uncover the hidden mysteries of our world. As you can see, technology is a vital part of life as we know it. Eventually we will all have to embrace the technological advancements in society and learn how to function with more tech driven devices. From local restaurant kiosks to downtown grocery stores with self-check-out lanes, technology is here and it is here to stay. ",

            "answer_text": "First of all, let\u2019s define what actually the word technology means. The definition of technology is science or knowledge put into practical use to solve problems or invent useful tools. Whenever we use our scientific knowledge to achieve some specific purpose, we're using technology. Well, there is slightly more to it than that. Technology usually involves a specific piece of equipment, but that equipment can be incredibly simple or dazzlingly complex. It can be anything from the discovery of the wheel, all the way up to computers and MP3 players. What are the types of Technology? Since technology can be so simple or so complex, there are many types of technology. One type is mechanical technology, which includes wheels, cams, levers, gears, belts, and and engines. Things that turn, or allow motion in one direction to cause a different kind of motion, are mechanical.  Perhaps the type of technology that we're most familiar with in modern life is electronic technology, usually just called electronics, which is a complex form of technology that uses electric circuits to achieve a goal.  Industrial and manufacturing technology is technology with the goal of either producing a product on a large scale, or performing another large-scale function where customers are not directly present. Transportation Technology:Developing and using devices and systems to move people and cargo from an origin point to a destination.  Information Technology : Information Technology is a set of hardware and software tools used to store, transfer and process information. Information technology tools help in providing the right people with the right information at the right time.  And the list goes onn\u2026\u2026.. Now what are the Importance of technologies ? Why do we need technology?  Technology is always evolving, with new software constantly emerging to solve problems and inefficiencies that companies may not even be aware of yet. Business leaders can sometimes feel overwhelmed in the face of so much change \u2013 there\u2019s often a desire to stick with current technology and processes rather than rocking the boat. Here are five areas new technology brings advantages to the workplace: 1. Speed, Efficiency, and Agility The goal for any new office technology is to speed up workflow processes, giving your employees the ultimate resource \u2013 more time \u2013 to focus on the important work. Businesses best their competitors by being able to respond to data, adapt to changes, and make informed decisions quickly \u2013 new technology and analytics give them the tools to do so. Your business simply can\u2019t afford to move at a 1998 or 2008 pace in 2018. 2. Storage and Sharing Employees should never have to waste time looking for files, documents or information, yet studies show that nearly 20% of the workweek is wasted searching for information \u2013 a major inefficiency that costs businesses money. Technology that streamlines information storage and sharing is vital not only for efficiency, but also for security. Outdated technology puts your company\u2019s confidential information at risk, and sets you up for an expensive data breach \u2013 considering that the average cost of a data breach is $3.62 million. 3. Mobility and Remote Connectivity With the growth of the freelancer economy \u2013 freelancers are expected to become the majority of the U.S. workforce by 2027 \u2013 and many companies adopting flexible work-from-anywhere policies, employees need to be able to access technology systems remotely. Implementing the newest technology allows organizations to connect with the best talent, all over the world, instantly. 4. Automation Another advantage of new technology is that it allows companies to automate functions that previously required employees. Tasks like data entry and analytics, bookkeeping, and contact management can be partially or completely automated, which allows businesses to work more efficiently without the risk of human error. Those cost savings can be invested in human capital that show the biggest ROI \u2013 higher-level employees that innovate and drive the company forward. 5. Communication There\u2019s a reason that computers replaced typewriters, emails replaced paper mail and faxes, Slack has replaced (some) emails: Communication is king. Companies are constantly looking to improve and accelerate communication, and new technology is built with that need in mind. Investing in new systems will help to streamline both internal and external communication \u2013 with clients and vendors \u2013 so that everyone is always in the loop. Hope this will help !!!
