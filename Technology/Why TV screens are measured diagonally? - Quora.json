            "answer_text": "In part tradition, and in part plain ol\u2019 marketing. When television was first introduced, in the late 1940s, the CRTs actually had completely round screens - the front of the tube was circular. The displayed image, of course, was supposed to be rectangular, so it only filled a portion of the tube\u2019s screen. The \u201cunused\u201d portions of the screen were hidden from view by the television\u2019s case parts. Notice how the screen in the set below seems to be a circle with the top and bottom covered:  In these sets, the size quoted for the screen was actually the diameter of the circular faceplate. Later, when more rectangular tubes were introduced, the diagonal was the largest dimension that could be quoted, and was comparable to the diameter of the older round screen. Since then, the diagonal size has continued to be used for all sorts of display screens. ",

            "answer_text": "That us a tradition but it can be justified that it witakes both the width and height into consideration. It should be noted that the measure covered the whole tube, not just the visible area. On a 21 inch CRT the visible area was 20 inches. On 28 inch it was 26 inches. When TVs went to LCD they switched to real measurements or almost. My LG was marketed as 32 inch but it is 80 cm or 31.5\u2033. Similar thing was for camera tubes. There they did not change markings when the technology changed so an one inch sensor is actually about 16 mm. ",
