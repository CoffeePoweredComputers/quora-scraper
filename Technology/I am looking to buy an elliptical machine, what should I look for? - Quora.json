Chronic cardio is boring, unfun, unnecessary and contraindicated for a long and healthy life.There is absolutely no need to have an expensive, space consuming machine to 'stop being a couch potato all winter'.   I suggest buying a used one first. Exercise machines are bought all the time & wind up collecting dust or dirty clothes. ",

You'll probably want one that has several different resistant levels so that you can start low and as you get in better shape, move up.
