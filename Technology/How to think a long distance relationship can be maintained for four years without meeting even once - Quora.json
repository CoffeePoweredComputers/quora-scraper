            "answer_text": "As you may have noticed, every answer offers a different perspective. What ultimately matters is what works for the two of you. If its real, it doesnt matter how many years it takes, how far away it is. The real distance happens when the two of you no longer want to be together or understand eachother. For long distance to work, for any relationship to work, you need to be an emotionally stable person and trust them when you dont always get immediate explanations. You are going to feel lonely at times and curse yourself for falling in love (particularly during the time of the month). You will curse yourself more for not being a sensible person. This is all part of the experience. So are the times when a simple call or text from them will make you so happy, hearing them do well will make your stride brighter for days altogether. How you perceive their intentions and deal with your insecurities is key here. Dont assume the worst when you are in a low phase. Trust is needed here on another level, way beyond a conventional relationship. The best part is that the two of you are making immense progress in your life. You are growing as people and developing. Your love is a choice, not something to be taken granted for. You write your own story. Be prepared to get stronger and know that if you actually manage this well, your basic understanding is on another level. Thats why most LDRs dont last. People dont have that kind of patience to want to stay despite the odds. And that is okay. Its actually incredibly challenging but real. Think about it though. People go for deployment, foreign jobs, further studies and work it out. Earlier people didnt even have skype or whatsapp or cheap phonecalls. Its the will that counts. Whether you meet or not is immaterial, what matters is if you want to stay. ",

            "answer_text": "I am going to assume that \u201cwithout meeting even once\u201d means that you have never met, period. The reason I am careful to stipulate that is that there are certain relationships where two people have been separated for a long time by military commitment, prison, even a hostage situation, and have been reunited after a long period of time. I have no doubt that such a separation has challenged even the deepest relationships. Now, to those who have never met, in the flesh, face to face: Well, has this couple met on social media? Do they speak, or have they spoken live on Skype, or another video chat medium? I think that if two people are motivated to remain in contact, and develop their relationship over one or more forms of social media, they can do it. Of course, sexual activity, if any, would obviously be limited to some form that was devoid of physical contact. I do think that even the most powerful emotional and/or spiritual bond would be difficult to maintain simply because relationships are reinforced by touch. ",
