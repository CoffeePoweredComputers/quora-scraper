            "answer_text": "Not that far off. Some of the other answers on here seem to take things a bit too literally, calling the suit in the movies a \u201cmagic wand\u201d. Well, d\u2019uh. It\u2019s a movie. It\u2019s free from any real-life consequences, laws of physics, and filled with plot devices. I feel like these answers are cop-outs as almost everyone is aware that comics and TV are fiction - I hope. The question is more could we build some sort of external armor suit capable of superhuman feats. That\u2019s a resounding yes, we can and we will and we already are. They have suits as of ten years or so ago that can do certain things resembling what we have seen depicted in movies.  There are, and will be suits that can enhance the strength of the users. Researchers design real life batsuit There was also a former coworker of mine from the \u201cI GOT LEGS\u201d campaign, who has an electronic suit that allowed to complete a 10k after losing the use of his legs.  They have body armor capable of withstanding blows.  Obviously, bulletproof vests and flame-retardant gear already exists as well. These things are very similar to the tech that you would need for a \u201csupersuit\u201d. Here\u2019s a real-life particle cannon:  So a lot of the stuff you see movies depict, whether it\u2019s exosuit strength, flight and laser beams is actually real life. Whether all this cool stuff gets combined into one mech style suit, I would imagine yes. The military and police already outfit their ranks with similar types of equipment. With 3D printing and CAD modeling techniques and more robust manufacturing capabilities you could easily see this stuff become more cost-effective, and therefore more widespread in use and more complex in design. I\u2019d give it about 15\u201330 years. ",

            "answer_text": "No arc reactor; no super suit. Here is Raytheon XOS 2 exoskeleton from 8+ years ago. Note at the end of the video they state 3\u20135 years for a theater ready tethered version to be used for logistics. Note how also their goals included decreasing power consumption. Imagine if we told them, \u201cyea go ahead and double the power consumption and then double that twice more.\u201d There is quite a bit more could do if we had an arc reactor to power everything. In a more recent video one of Raytheon\u2019s competitors is doing work with a slimmer version. US Military rolls out 'super-soldier' exoskeleton suits. So there is competition and there is progress but I think our exoskeleton progress is still a long way from even the Ironman Mk 1 which had true combat capability, a weapons loadout, armored durability, and limited flight ability. Future exos are more likely to look like Elysium-minus the bone drilling and brain interface. (The Real Tech Behind 'Elysium' Exoskeletons) If we figure out fusion on the other hand maybe an arc reactor is possible, and as the saying goes \u201cFusion is always 30 years away.\u201d ",
