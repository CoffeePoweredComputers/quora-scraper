            "answer_text": "How does Technology enhance human imagination? It is highly debatable whether technology kills or boosts human imagination. People could argue for life term on this. In my opinion, technology improves human imagination. How? Technology brings imaginations to life in our \u2018present lives\u2019 itself: Technology itself doesn\u2019t tell us what to do. Humans use technology to make the stuff of our imagination real. The present day Technologies are an embodiment of our ancestors\u2019 imaginations. We are just lucky to visualize our imaginations to real in quick-time. Thanks to the technology! Technology - a catalyst for Creativity: Every scientific invention and discovery is the result of imagination and creation of human mind. But then, Humans didn\u2019t stop imagining.

            "answer_text": "Thanks for A2A!!! Alright, first of all technology and human imagination are two interlinked terms. Its human imagination that has developed technology and as a natural tendency of human brain to desire for more we try to compete with our self generated technology by again using our imagination , this time in attempt to go far beyond than the former attempt. So, this is how you see enhancement of human imagination and technology are two parallel events. Technology broaden the spectrum of human mind to think further. For eg. Earlier we had no computers from several thousands of years but then once its most primitive model discovered then within some centuries we developed from bulky desktops to palm size computers, from keyboards to touchscreen technologies etc. So, this is how technology has catalysed human imagination. You might have noticed that all significant inventions had occurred in past 2 or 3 centuries, whereas as our civilization is thousands of years old. This shows how once these technologies came into existence they envoked the hunger of human mind and in that order human start to think and imagi e of more solutions to his subsequent questions. I hope this will help. Happy reading. ",
