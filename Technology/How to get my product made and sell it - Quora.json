            "answer_text": " Depends on the product. But here\u2019s a few ways: If the product is something mundane and already in wide circulation (something small, like a fork or a wine glass or a mousepad), then you can contact a manufacturer using a site like Alibaba. Most manufacturers will have catalogs of similar products that they can brand and ship to you. This usually costs somewhere between $3,000 - $10,000 for a minimum order quantity (depending on the size, materials, etc).If the product isn\u2019t exactly like something that\u2019s ever been made, but still close, you can still contact manufacturers as before, and have a custom mold made. Molds usually run about $500-$1000, and sometimes require you to produce large volumes to make it worth the manufacturer\u2019s time. That can be very expensive.If your product that is something that\u2019s never been done before, contact a technical designer\u2014use sources like Upwork to do it cheap\u2014and have them figure out the logistics of how it would work. Then\u2026 as before\u2026 contact a manufacturer and have it made. This is probably the most expensive of all.For digital products like apps, you may still need to have technical designers involved (unless you can do it yourself), in which case the costs for their time can be extremely high.Whatever you do, make sure to test your market first. Start with small quantities (no more than a few hundred units) and make sure there\u2019s demand somewhere. You can check on Amazon using a program like JungleScout, or just hop on Reddit or Instagram. Another way to check market demand before you ever spend any money, is to start a crowdfunding page for it on a product-centric platform like Kickstarter or Indiegogo: From concept to market with crowdfunding . That way you can raise the money from potential buyers first, and then purchase the goods, instead of doing it the other way around. As far as places to sell your products, the sky is the limit. Here\u2019s a few of my favorite: Amazon - great for private label productseBay - okay for some retail, but mostly for wholesale and dealsShopify - one of the easiest ways ever to set up a store online (I can build one in about 20 minutes on Shopify)The first two come with their own marketing channels, the third you\u2019ll have to do on your own. There\u2019s a number of different ways to get the word out about your new product: Instagram - totally visual media and pretty easy to build a following; great for new marketers to get their word outFacebook and Google ads - pay your way to fameReddit - start conversations, get the word outQuora - demonstrate your authorityOh, and be sure to read plenty of cool books. Here\u2019s some helpful ones: The Four Hour Workweek by Tim Ferriss gives tips on creating lifestyle businesses, and outlines drop shipping/private label style business modelsThe Lean Startup by Eric Ries introduces the idea > build > analyze > iterate cycle used by a lot of Silicon Valley startupsThe Design of Everyday Things by Don Norman gives some what-seems-like-common-sense-but-isn\u2019t advice on designing cool products.Hope that\u2019s helpful!

            "answer_text": "Assuming you yourself can create a standardized prototype time and time again ( by standardized, i mean the specs, dimensions are always the same regardless if you made it in the garage or some factory in Boston ). Your next step would be to find customer for this. At this point, some clients would add their input, and request another prototype with the input built in. This back and forth will continue for some time until you either give up OR are able to comply. Let\u2019s say you comply. They will then give you an initial order to test the market out. Your product might be good and functional. But do other people want it. It is this need that will determine whether the orders will increase or whether the product will die a natural death. If your order does increase, expect a useful life of several years, maybe even decades. To put it into perspective, coca cola is still continuing its run with no signs of decline. I would venture that the bread buns of McDonalds went through the same process, perhaps from several suppliers. Same with Wendy\u2019s i bet. Maybe even their hamburger patties i guess. The process is the same for some designer furniture and food products. It was what i went through ",
