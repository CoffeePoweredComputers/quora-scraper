            "answer_text": "To a certain point, yes. I\u2019ve found that out of the box iPhones are usually around the 50\u201360% charge capacity. Interestingly, that matches Apple\u2019s charge recommendation for long-term storage[1]. However, I\u2019ve also picked up new phones from my carrier. It appears they sometimes charge phones they intend to slide a SIM card into for customers intent on picking one up. But, you should never pick up a new one that has been completely discharged. Storing without charge can damage lithium based batteries. You never know how long such a device was sitting in the shelf like that. Footnotes[1] Batteries - Maximizing Performance",

Steve Jobs stated he was always pissed when he bought a device, hoping to turn it on when he got it, only to find the instructions \u201cCharge 12\u201318 hours before first use\u201d. Apple used to charge their phones to 80% before shipment as storing a Li-Ion battery at 80% charge results in maximum life. But recently, intentional regulations went into effect prohibiting mass-shipping Li-Ion batteries charged over 20 (or was it 10?) % by air so the devices no longer are almost fully charged. ",
