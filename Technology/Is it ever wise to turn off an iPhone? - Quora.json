            "answer_text": "Just like computers, iPhones should be powered down every so often. On my iPhone 6 it's every few days or a couple weeks.  This helps clear out any processes that keep running that do not need to be that may have been left open by a now closed program or app.  People usually leave computers on such as Windows, because it takes forever to boot up, but they should be power cycled off then on as well to improve performance.  Apple recommends restarting your iPhone every few days or if something isn't working right such as for example, you open the camera App and you get a black screen.  Can't hurt anything by doing a proper shut-down. ",

            "answer_text": "Turning off both your PC and your phone is generally a good idea. It frees up memory and makes things a bit snappier. If you get apps crashing (more likely with older devices) it tends to help, unless it's a bug. I find a simple reboot fixes most such problems. You don't have to turn it off at the cinema though, muting is fine. ",
