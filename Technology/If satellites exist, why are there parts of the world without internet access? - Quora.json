            "answer_text": "Q: If satellites exist, why are there parts of the world without internet access? There are two main problems: For consistent Internet service, a satellite dish has to be aimed at a satellite. For this to be a consistent link, the satellite has to be in a fixed position, which means in geo-stationary orbit, which in turn means it is over the equator. At higher latitudes the distance to the satellite increases, and the signal has to pass through a lot more attenuating atmosphere when the line to the satellite approaches the horizontal. In fact, at the poles the satellites maybe below the horizon.The other factor is that the satellites optimise their transmissions by beaming their signals to the areas where most of their customers are located. This means in large rural areas, the amount of signal may be minimal.",

A single transponder costs easily between 1 and 5 million euro per year. Such transponder can Carry about 50 mbit, one way. Note that the world is covered by irridium and inmarsat satellites. These are also not cheap in use. Secondly, the use of satellite systems by the public is in many countries stricktly forebidden. ",
