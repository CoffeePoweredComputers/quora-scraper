            "answer_text": "There are multiple benefits of robots in future. Some of them are listed below. Energy - Robots can help us to save energy by turning off unnecessary lightning/heating. Robots can also conserve the energy in various forms so that they can be used in disastrous conditions.Quality Control - Robots can increase quality of any product and provide a high quality finish. Robots can also eliminate the problems associated with tiredness, distraction and the effects of repetitive and tedious tasks.Employee Work Quality - Robots can improve working conditions for staff. They\u2019ll no longer have to work in dusty, hot or hazardous environments. In addition, by teaching them how to use robots they can learn valuable programming skills and do work that is more stimulating and challenging.Production - Robots can work overnight and during weekend also under a minimal supervision. This will ultimately increase the production output. Robots can be programmed offline, ensuring new production processes can be quickly introduced for faster production.Health - Robots can work in health threatening environment where human can\u2019t survive. Robots can decrease the likelihood of accidents caused by contact with machine tools or other potentially hazardous production machinery or processes.Recruitment - In future every work will be high precise so a high level of skill and training is required. Robots can provide an ideal alternative. Once programmed for your process, robots are ready to begin work with none of the extra costs.Agriculture - Robots can easily predict the weather and do farming accordingly. They can also provide good results with cloud seeding and weed control.Disaster Recovery - Robots can be used in recovery of disaster. They can work in nasty environment and save humans.Environment - Plant Robots can help us to create a better environment using artificial photosynthesis.Space Research - Robots can research in space with more efficient ways and find possibilities outside the planet earth.There are still many benefits of robots in future. Explore World, Explore Space. Thank you for reading so far. ",

            "answer_text": "There is no need to transport oxygen and food into space as there is no need for robots. For energy, they charge themselves with solar energy.They work 24/7 with no sleep or other necessities.There is minimal risk if anything fails.No need to spend millions on suits.Can work with accuracy up to nanometers.Repetitive work can be done without making errors.Because the robots are internally connected to the station, the situation/problem can be accurately analyzed in AI.",
