            "answer_text": "No Smartphones are best charged to 80% and discharged to 20%, this is where the main energy is available from the LiPo or Li-Ion battery, also it is roughly 4v which is the point where the battery is best, above this charging can cause internal deposits called Dendrites which over time can cause a hard internal short and is why Lithium batteries can suddenly fail after a relatively short time. Over discharging causes other damage that cannot safely be recovered from.Using the phone within this 60% range will actually increase the life of the battery by as much as threefold, also unless you are an abusive user (in terms of the battery) you will not really notice the reduction in total capacity ",

            "answer_text": "Bill Richards has his facts correct. Lessons from electric car batteries that use more of the same type of batteries are as follows: You can get 10 times the battery cycles over the battery life by only charging from 20% to 80%. Don\u2019t let your battery get too hot - this degrades it. If you need to charge it to a higher level like 100%, immediately start using it. Don\u2019t leave it sitting at 100% - this is one of the worst things for the battery life. Try some or all of these things and you will see that your phone battery will last significantly longer. ",
