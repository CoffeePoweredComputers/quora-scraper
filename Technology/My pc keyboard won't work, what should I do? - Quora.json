            "answer_text": "Before I begin, for anyone reading this, as a general rule, whenever you request help on Quora for a specific repair issue, please, please, please, always include the make and model (in this case, it's an HP laptop, probably a  Pavilion).  Just like with cars, different brands might have different issues or solutions. Also, please be specific with your problem.  Saying the \"keyboard doesn't work\" encompasses a number of possibilities.  However, in this case, I'm going to make a few assumptions. A laptop keyboard not working might be caused by a couple of different problems.    If the computer was recently repaired, the technician may not have connected the keyboard ribbon tightly (the connections are sometimes difficult to work with when you have big hands, like me, and the connection may not be tight).  Techs will always check their work to make sure the system is working properly, but the connection might have slipped while moving around.  But, you would normally return to the tech if there was a problem, and since you asking here, I'm going to guess this isn't the case.If your computer is recently bought, sometimes hardware can fail, and if it's under warranty (usually 1 year manufacturer's and 3 years if you bought the extended).  Contact the manufacturer (if within one year) or the retailer (if between 2 and 3). You may have updated drivers or a software problem, especially if you just upgraded to Windows 10.  A driver issue would probably knock your keyboard out completely.  You can start your computer, hit the F8 key during the boot process (before Windows starts).  If you get the start up menu, 1. your keyboard is working fine, and it's probably a driver or other software issue, and 2. you can go into Safe Mode, text only and test the keyboard.  Hit every key and see if there is a problem.  If not, you need to get an external keyboard, start Windows, and restore to before the most recent software or driver installation.You spilled or dropped something on the keyboard, and it's causeing either a key to stick, or a number of keys to fail.  If it's a crumb, tip the computer over and lightly tap the front edge against the desktop, which might dislodge anything dry that might be causing a problem.  If it was something wet, you may need to replace the keyboard.  See below.Now, replacing laptop keyboards is not expensive, nor is it particularly difficult.  You can do a Google search, something like \"HP Pavilion 1527 keyboard replace\", and you will get results for both buying the keyboard (maybe around 20 USD), and you should also get websites which will tell you step by step HOW to replace your keyboard.  Youtube is a great place to start for the instructions, and Amazon might help find the part.   You could take it to a shop, like Geek Squad, but you'll probably pay out the nose, or you could buy the parts from the HP website, which is also expensive. I had an Acer up until recently that I accidentally spilled a beer on.  It wasn't a lot, but it caused one of the keys to stick.  I tried pulling keys off (laptop keys are tricky at best) and wiping the top off, but it didn't work.  I went online, bought a 20 USD keyboard for my model, and watched a Youtube video on how to replace that particular model's keyboard.  I think I had it done in about 15 minutes, and good as new.  It still works now, and in the possession of my youngest daughter. If you PM me with more details, like what EXACTLY is happening, along with any pertinent details, I will be happy to narrow the issue down further. ",

            "answer_text": "If it is a PC with separate keyboard, check the cable is properly connected. If a wireless keyboard, check the dongle and power in the keyboard. Check whether Capslock, Numlock keys are working by toggling and check the lights.  Most of the times a reboot will fix the problem.  Also go to control panel and ckeck in keyboards, the proper language is installed. If the external keyboard does not work, try replacing with another keyboard. ",
