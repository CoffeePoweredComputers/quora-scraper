            "answer_text": "There are several reasons\u2026 Reception\u2026People think that today cell phones work everywhere, however in many hospitals there are dead spots were Pagers pick up the signal and cellphones do not. Priority\u2026Pagers rise above and beyond the clutter of alerts that cell phones are now notorious for. Between news alerts, social media alerts, text alerts and last but not least the phone ringing it\u2019s almost become background noise . When the pager goes off\u2026 The doctor knows it\u2019s important and a priority that they get back to the person who paged them. Privacy\u2026.A pager acts as a barrier between the caller and the doctor\u2026 Not only can the doctor just give out a pager number to patients, but he can shut off his cell phone at night while sleeping and if he needs to be awakened at 3 AM the pager is perfectly capable of doing so. Also, when the doctor is consulting with the patient or in the operating room he can\u2019t have his cell phone going off and disturbing the privacy needed\u2026 The pager can go off either on vibrate mode or the audible alert to let the doctor know there is a pressing issue. Dependability\u2026A Pager can last usually about a month even if turned on 24 hours a day with just one AAA battery. A cell phone, can die halfway through the day which could create a major issue if the doctor cannot be reached. These are the major reasons and there are a few others that are applicable on a case-by-case basis. ",

Depending on whose research you read, between 85 and 90% of doctors still use pagers in 2018. There\u2019s an important conversation to be had here because pagers are a really insecure way for doctors and colleagues to exchange information. I recently came across this article where a Chicago artist/ programmer reprogrammed his pager to pick up messages from all the pages that were exchanged by Chicago doctors and their hospitals. As far as I know, none of the hospitals implicated in this exhibit changed their policies. The main issue here is one of HIPAA compliance Because the contents of the message are not password protected, it is easy to imagine a scenario where a random person sees the contents of the pager if they pick it up. No log-in credentials are required. Furthermore, there is no encryption of the contents on the pager. While encryption is an \u2018addressable\u2019 issue under HIPAA \u2013 meaning it is optional \u2013 it is hard to see how any healthcare facility in this day and age would not encrypt their patients\u2019 information. Also, for a hospital to leave encryption as an addressable issue and not take steps to encrypt patient data, the hospital must demonstrate why they thought they didn\u2019t need to encrypt patient data when exchanging it between practitioners. The reality is that practitioners should move off of pagers and onto secure and encrypted methods of communication. However, practitioners are focused on their patients \u2013 not HIPAA compliance. If HIPAA compliance and patient safety is going to be taken seriously, it will have to be administrators and CISOs who take charge of the issue.
