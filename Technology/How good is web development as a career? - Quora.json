            "answer_text": "I think one of the reasons why this question is frequently asked is because getting a website has become much easier and cheaper nowadays (especially with WordPress). Anyone with a computer and an internet connection can start a website or an online business, even without being technically literate. There are templates available online, and there are also purchasable websites at affordable prices. So, is web development a good career? We could perhaps say that web development as it used to be, is dead; but from another point of view we can look at it like this: Web development is changing. Sure, it\u2019s not how it was before. Technologies are changing, and so is the need for developers who have expertise in these new technologies. There is now a need for development teams for web and mobile development teams who will be able to solve specific business needs and build new features that cannot be achieved with readily available templates. There\u2019s a big need for web developers, so big that the supply of Western tech workers can\u2019t accommodate it. To further prove my point, outsourcing development has, in fact, become popular through the years to provide startups and firms with cost-efficient solutions for their development needs. The key to succeeding in a career in web development is to be able to adapt to the new technologies and pick up new skills that are relevant today and greatly needed today. Web development as a career won\u2019t go anywhere\u2014not when every business needs a website, or a revamp, or new features. However, it\u2019s quick to change and develop, so the best strategy really is to always love to learn and be quick to adapt.  ",

            "answer_text": "This depends on the types of web development roles you are able to land over the course of your career. There are professional software engineering roles at top technology companies where you\u2019ll work on challenging projects, be mentored by senior developers, work reasonable hours and be very well compensated. And there are a wealth of poor-quality jobs where you\u2019ll do repetitive tasks, learn very little on the job and be in danger of being automated away by the next Wix or Wordpress. The distribution of software jobs is quite uneven - most fall into the lower-quality category, while there are fewer higher-quality software engineering roles:  What determines whether you\u2019ll be competitive for software engineering positions at top companies or only hired into poor-quality jobs is your skillset. Without this core skillset, developers are forced to rely on surface-level understandings of libraries and frameworks. This path can easily lead to an unstable and unfulfilling career path. But once you develop this skillset, you\u2019ll be a viable candidate for higher-quality software engineering positions. Let\u2019s break down the components of this skillset. Software engineers who land roles at top companies stand out because of their: mastery of fundamental programming conceptsstrong problem-solving skillsstrong technical communicationability to learn quickly and effectively, (aka \u201cjust in time\u201d learning)At Launch School, where I\u2019m an instructor, we\u2019ve built our entire program around helping our students develop this skillset and become competitive for the most rewarding software engineering roles. Ours is a self-paced, 100% remote program, and it combines mastery-based learning with building up fundamental software development skills. Our program is a challenging but doable approach to learning software engineering, and it has helped our graduates lay the foundations for great careers. ",
