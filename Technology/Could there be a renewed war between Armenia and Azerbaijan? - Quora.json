            "answer_text": "Yes, and it started again two days ago, on September 27, 2020. Main points you need to know on why is this happening (I am an Azerbaijani American, and I might be biased): 1. Nagorno-Karabakh is not a disputed territory. It is the territory of Azerbaijan, both historically and officially recognized by the UN and whole world (including Armenia)as part of Azerbaijan 2. Armenian/NKR has occupied not only Nagorno Karabakh, but also 7 other Azerbaijani regions around it (Lachin, Kelbadjar, Agham, Fizuli, Djebrail, Gubadli, Zangelan) 3. The war is not happening on the territory of Armenia (see the map). Azerbaijani army is not trying to seize Armenian territory. The war that began with the illegal occupation of Azerbaijani territories 30 years ago, resulting in 20% of Azerbaijani land to be occupied, is trying to liberate Azerbaijan's own lands back.  4. Azerbaijan could have liberated its territories 30 years ago. Our country has a military superiority in its numerical and quality advantage of equipment and weapons. So, why hasn't Azerbaijan tried to claim its territory back in 1990s, you might ask? Because of a ceasefire of May 1994, where the two parties pledged to resolve the conflict peacefully with the help of mediators - the OSCE Minsk Group, with Russia, US, and France spearheading the talks. Unfortunately, after more than 30 years of 'negotiating' and no tangible results, Armenian government has shown its unwillingness for any peaceful resolution to the conflict or to liberate any illegally occupied Azerbaijani land. In fact, Pashinyan (PM of Armenia) is quoted saying \"Artsakh (Nagorno-Karabakh) is Armenia. Period.\". His wife had a photo session in Karabakh, brandishing a weapon.  5. Azerbaijan has repeatedly said that we are adherents of a peaceful solution to the conflict. However, with Nikol Pashinyan, Armenian PM, the negotiation process has frozen completely. His nationalist rhetoric has continued to contradict the peaceful resolution of the conflict, and the increased shelling of civilians living on the frontline only solidified Armenia's unwillingness to negotiate. The last straw for Azerbaijan became the shelling of civilians in Azerbaijan in the frontline zone this morning on 09.27.2020, after which Azerbaijan military activated a counter-attack, with hopes of liberating its rightfully owned lands. 6. People on both sides suffer and want peace. Geopolitics and major regional players are the reasons this conflict has not been resolved yet. ",

            "answer_text": "What you are hearing about now isn\u2019t a new war but rather the continuation of an old war. The war is ongoing since 1990 when military operations first began in the region. A ceasefire was signed in 1994 that mostly stuck, ending large scale operations but smaller scale skirmishes have continued since then. The 1994 ceasefire is treated by many as an \u201cend to the war,\u201d including, unfortunately, Armenia and the Armenians of Nagorno-Karabakh, but it never was that. After numerous failed peace talks, people continued to die on the frontline. Sniper fire was a regular occurrence for decades. In the last 10 years this escalated to artillery fire, downing of helicopters, and various other forms of large scale operations and bombardment. Many of these are initiated by Azerbaijan to remind Armenia and the international community that the war is not ended and the status of Nagorno-Karabakh has not been decided by any agreement from Azerbaijan. So the Nagorno-Karabakh is one of many \u201cfrozen conflicts\u201d in the world except this one never really froze. It remained on simmer for the longest time and now it\u2019s turned back up to full blast. ",

            "answer_text": "My opinion is that whilst there is always the possibility of a war breaking out, it is highly unlikely for a war to break out because it is in no-ones interests. Armenia can't afford to go to war with Azerbaijan but would be able to if they had to, it simply isn't in Armenia's interest to start a war which would devastate a stagnant economy and result in loss of trade, business and live, therefore Azerbaijan could realistically be the ones who would start a war if they wanted to. However,  given how weak the economy of Azerbaijan is due to the collapse of the Azerbaijani manat, the collapse of the oil prices which Azerbaijan are so reliant upon and a large growing deficit and a probable decrease in expenditure in the years to follow, all this makes it financially difficult for Azerbaijan to go back to war to fight for a small piece of land which is highly insignificant to their economy and the super-friendly and advanced image Mr. Aliyev is trying to create of his country. A war would be a tremendous loss of resources for Azerbaijan, a huge hit to their oil industry due to the known ability for Armenia to cut off all exports from attacking pipelines near Armenian territories. It would take years, perhaps a decade for Azerbaijan to get back on track for creating the image of Baku being the \"Dubai of Europe\". Therefore I believe it's highly unlikely to see a war break out between the two countries as we've established that Armenia are never going to start a new war due to their position and Azerbaijan can't really afford to be dragged into a long war which isn't guaranteed to win them anything and actually could result in more losses (Defence in war is easier than offence) and the dream that Mr Aliyev has of his country becoming a modern, wealthy, functioning European country will take a sever hit.

I don't want wars, and don't assume being Turkish I am a supporter of war. The current status cannot continue too much. Azerbaijan is waiting for the right time, when that time comes it would be easy to take back its lands from Armenia. Azerbaijan and its army are way different than they were years ago. If I can decide, I would negotiate with Azerbaijan, to give most of the lands captured, but to have some part of Nagorno-Karabagh and a corridor connecting it to Armenia in exchange to some land to unify both Azerbaijan lands. It may be the best times for these negotiations as, as soon as petrol prices rice again, Azerbaijan would not be that negotiable. Or if petrol prices drops further, Azerbaijan economy would collapse, and when economy collapses, a victory is the best method to get rid of the social problems. One way or another Armenia should negotiate. And an agreement will also open Turkish borders, and it would greatly help Armenia. ",

The next day armneian president resigned and armenia signed the ceasefire while it could end Azerbaijan! why? Russia?   Plus, Azerbaijan will hardly be able to go back on track of economic growth (they will ran outta oil in 20 years ), and It will take at least 5 years for oil prices to rise again . If it interests Russia, they will fight , and without any foreign intervention, I dont think Azerbaijan can win. Armenia only has to hold a few passages ( Armenia controls the mountainous side ) , and target a few strategic points of Azerbaijan with Georgia (pipelines , oil fields etc) . Azerbaijan wont be able to keep up financially long enough to win the war.  ",

If Azerbaijan will attack any of Armenian states, then Armenians will surely repel any Azerbaijani aggression. So it\u2019s all depend on the Azerbaijani regime. Seems, the long-lasting dropdown of oil prices make the ruling regime of oil-rich Azerbaijan seek for an external war in order to distract Azerbaijani people from their crashed economy and extreme povetry in Azerbaijan.
