            "answer_text": "We\u2019re currently at a stage with games where games can handle complex animations and characters, which has led to characters being more realistic than ever but also coming across as humans, and not creepy androids. a lot of games still fall foul to the uncanny valley effect, but its less so in high budget games like MGS V, uncharted 4 etc, this mainly comes from the advancement of technologies such as motion capture, PBR and lighting and rendering in games engines.what we have now is very complex, life like characters, being lit in very complex and life like environments with complex and life like animations. which is the big difference from modern games and the older creepy uncanny valley movies like polar express and the final fantasy movie.
