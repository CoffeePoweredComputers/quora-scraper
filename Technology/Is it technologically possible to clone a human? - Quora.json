            "answer_text": "I think the success scientists have had cloning other animals suggests the technology to clone a human does indeed exist. It is theoretically quite simple too, and if it were ever legal I think any initial struggles applying the current tecniques to humans could be overcome in reasonable time (I'd predict within ~5 years since humans need 9 months to develop so that'll slow things down). I also think the technology for the initial phases of cloning will continue to be improved in the next decade since it has legally acceptable applications for therapies in regenerative medicine. I will say that the technology we do have now is incredibly inefficient, and that while we'd be able to (inefficiently) make genetic human clones, these clones would likely never be identical to their original. I argue this because you could take the nucleus and oocyte from the same individual so that all nuclear (main DNA) and cytoplasmic (mitochondrial DNA) genetic material are identical, but it'd be incredibly challenging to recreate the exact same environment the original embryo faced in utero. Then there are all experiences after birth that will shape the clone's brain differently. Sorry to bring up nature/nurture, but I think it's relevant, especially when considering the ethics! In sum, we likely have the technology to create genetic clones of humans, but not the technology to do it efficiently or to create exact replicas of humans. ",

            "answer_text": "A true clone is fully genetically identical, and as DNA is a conduit for consciousness(communicating information via very complex/dense, intricate, delicate, and intrinsic means) the mind would SPLIT, causing mental chaos. Just like no two physical systems can occupy the same space, two minds can\u2019t express through the same genetic channel. Therefore, IT IS THE SAME MIND - due to the electromagnetic component of consciousness, but in two different bodies/spaces, and it DESTROYS the mind. Not to mention the choice to treat life as duplicable and disposable, rather than fixing the world\u2019s problems - primarily apoptosis. Doing so would obviate cloning from an (ostensibly)\u201cpractical\u201d perspective. It is my understanding that cloning is already happening in the world, and it\u2019s the cause of EVERY PROBLEM, due to telepathic transferral, also related to our DNA in its communicative nature. These clones are transferring the void and eventual oblivion of their own actions and minds. There isn\u2019t enough to go around for themselves when they split, and they mentally drain, discomfort, disease and deceive real humans. We however are voluntarily, mutually, and intuitively telepathic: non-invasive to one another. Our care for basic dignity is inherent to our consciousness. These clones are exploiting it by keeping us ignorant of that fact, out of sync with one another due to their own destructive psychic disproportion, parasitism, and predation, and cultivating an aversion by leading us to believe that everything is laid bare and vulnerable. That\u2019s just how they treat it, and us. They do not care. They just duplicate, and if need be, discard. They are clones. They have no reason to care, they just duplicate, and if need be, discard. They CANNOT care. They have split their minds(between more than one body), and now all they know is breakdown. Break in, and break down. THEY DO NOT PUT THE PIECES TOGETHER. They\u2019ve been doing it for all of human history on the Earth as I understand, and they\u2019re in every system and institution - COOPERATIVELY OPPOSING ONE ANOTHER, on every side of every argument and conflict, and from every angle, bringing chaos. The most prevalent paradigm in the world is of their own concoction, inuring people to the notion of predominance - pushing a \u201ccomply or die\u201d agenda, for total control. There is a shaft beneath Jerusalem, going straight down into the earth, where nobody would ever find it. They are there, and it will be shown to the world when the time is right. ",
