            "answer_text": "Natural selection is still affecting the development of a wide variety of human traits, ever since people start placing children in their body mass index \"This is perhaps even more surprising to the general public,\" Many traits vary between different members of the human and animal populations, from body size to hair color, and those differences are often linked to differences in genes. Natural selection occurs when some of those traits help some individuals to survive and reproduce more than others. Over time their genes in the population become more common, and this is how the species evolves to adapt to changes in their environments. ",

            "answer_text": "Natural selection refers simply to the fact that within a species some individuals live to reproduce and thus contribute their so selected genetics to the ongoing gene pool of the species. Others don\u2019t. Those who do not reproduce do not contribute to the gene pool represented in ongoing generations. That some people do live to reproductive age and produce children who also live to contribute designated genetic characteristics to ongoing generations does not necessarily mean that younger generations out-class earlier generations in any way. It does NOT mean \u201cthe strongest survive\u201d (Social Darwinism). It simply means they reproduce - today to the tune of an over-population of 7.9 billion. ",
