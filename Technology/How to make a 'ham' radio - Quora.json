            "answer_text": "That is a pretty broad question. First you have to have skills. I would start with small, simple kits to build the skills of soldering and testing. Build several, increasing the level of difficulty and complexity as you go. Don't move on till you have a working project you can use and be proud of. While building your initial projects, take time to study for your license exam. What you learn will help you with your projects. Go on and get your license as soon as you feel comfortable with the material. As you move on to more complex projects, I would recommend searching the the web for \"software defined radios\". They are much easier to build, because your computer does a lot of the work for you. You'll wind up with a radio having much better specs than if you build discrete circuits. Start with a receiver, of modest design. Again, as your skill increases, you can increase the complexity of your projects. These \"SDR\" transmitters will be low-power, or \"QRP\", designs. You will probably want to build a linear amplifier. They are fairly simple to build and not terribly expensive. From experience, while generally, more is better, you really only need about 60 Watts to have a really satisfying station. ",

You can also purchase no-solder kits for more powerful radios. These kits can be in the hundreds of dollars. You may want to read this column about a radio I helped build with my friend Hanz.
