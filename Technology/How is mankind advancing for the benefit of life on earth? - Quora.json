            "answer_text": "It isn\u2019t. When a rats nest becomes overpopulated, the rats start to eat each other. It is predicted that by 2040 (or thereabouts) there will be 10 Billion people on the planet. In the \u2018old days\u2019 wars (because Humans are tribal) culled the population, but wars are very different today. Also, disease played a major part in culling Humans, but we are advancing medically and drastically reducing nature\u2019s efficacy in this field. People can be stupid, and stupidity kills quite a few, but Health & Safety regs protect people from themselves. 10 Billion people is too many. In order to feed 10 Billion people, vegetarianism is a must - the amount of Amazonian Rain Forest being leveled for animal agriculture (because we eat meat) is not sustainable. The same land could feed people far more efficiently. But we\u2019re not thinking like that. Climate deniers, meat producers and energy providers are rapidly using up the Earth\u2019s resources with no thought for the future. The Earth is a closed system - you throw rubbish away, it doesn\u2019t go anywhere. We are polluting the atmosphere, we have polluted the oceans and now fracking is poisoning the Earth itself. Mankind is not advancing for the benefit of Life on Earth - it\u2019s killing it. ",

Mankind seems to be working overtime to eliminate most other species on the planet, and if we don\u2019t fix the climate change issue, mankind (homo sapiens) and all life on the planet. Sure, there are thousands of individuals who are spending their lives trying to improve life on this planet for all inhabitants.. But that\u2019s small potatoes for the billions that while not expressly working to improve life on the planet, just don\u2019t seem to care, or even be aware of the critical issues. ",
