            "answer_text": "Mr. Robot. This show received critical acclaim for its tremendous first season, but its second season (hit or miss for some) and third season (which was amazing with one episode that's a 45 minute tracking shot) have left it a so-so with audiences. The thing is that seasons 2 and 3 show has some of the best writing I have ever seen, with well developed characters who are all morally gray. It's also deals with heavy philosophical themes of identity and existentialism while maintaining biting social critique. Trust me this show is as smart as it gets and if this were on HBO or AMC it'd be considered the best show on the planet.Person of Interest. I have seen several answers with this show and it deserves all the love it gets, especially seasons 3-5. Unfortunately during it's run it wasn't as appreciated. It starts off very procedurally, with a \u201csave of the week\u201d format. Eventually it gets into deeper themes of security and how far is too far when it comes to protecting people as well as overdependence on technology. It's not too cliche on terms of its procedural nature, it's never truly corny and the action is sleek and believable. There are also ramifications for the actions of our heroes, something not a lot of shows have.Psych. Take a snarky man child with incredible observation and memory retention, give him an equally childish best friend and you have the greatest tv bromance ever. Seriously this show is the wittiest police procedural ever that never takes itself seriously and that's why it worked. It broke out of the boring repetitive mold of procedurals and threw in wit and charm. James Roday deserves more love for his portrayal of Shawn Spencer.Community. This show is one of many reasons I boycott NBC. With it's amazing use of self referential and meta humor, this is one of the smartest comedies ever. The jokes are perfect, the acting is gold, and it's one of the few shows that openly acknowledges it's a show. Seriously one of the characters is a traverser of the fourth wall. NBC did wrong by this show and it deserved better.Honorable Mention: Smallville. I admit I have a huge emotional attachment to this show. I grew up watching it from ages 8 to 18. Yes, it's sappy and a little melodramatic from time to time. Yes it's cliche and often times speeches about the power of love are prevalent. Yes the first four seasons are \u201cDawson's Creek\u201d but with Superman mythology. Yes it can be cheesy and you need to have suspension of disbelief from time to time. But this show does an incredible job of character development along with the general inclusion of the Superman mythos. When Smallville is good, it's really good. It may not be the best thing you see, but damn is it good.(Edit) Chuck. This is my favorite tv show of all time and another reason I boycott NBC. Zachary Levi is perfectly cast as an everyman fish out of water who goes from a slacker with boatloads of untapped potential to the most important espionage asset in the world. He's funny and perfect with emotions and Yvonne Strahovski is killer in her breakout role. Don't forget Adam Baldwin who's the anchor of the cast. It might take the Bond cliche over the top, but it's heartfelt, charming and full of love. NBC screwed this show in the last three seasons and it was still good. I wonder what would happen if NBC didnt meddle. Once again it's not the greatest show ever, but when you watch it, you're watching something with a lot of heart.(Edit) Brooklyn Nine-Nine. In a world of Big Bang Theories and other sitcoms that recycle the same joke, B99 is a fresh show with an exceptional cast who are each perfect at their timing, especially Samberg, Braugher and Crewes. This show is among the most finely written comedies in recent memory and deserves way more attention as it doesn't keep the same formula (*cough* Any Chuck Lorre show *cough*)",

            "answer_text": "One of my favorites was a little-known show called Then Came Bronson.  It was on TV in 1969. I think it failed because it was intelligent. Intelligence is a problem on TV, then and now. Also, I don't think it was promoted very well by the network. Here's the Wikipedia description: \" The series featured Michael Parks as the protagonist Jim Bronson, a newspaperman who becomes disillusioned after the suicide of his best friend Nick (Martin Sheen) and, after a heated argument with his editor, \"working for the man.\" In order to renew his soul, Bronson becomes a vagabond searching for  the meaning of life and seeking the experiences life has to offer (as  revealed in the series pilot). During his travels, he shares his values  with the people he meets along the way and lends a helping hand when he  can. Bronson rides a Harley-Davidson Sportster motorcycle and, as such, was viewed by some as a modern version of the solitary  cowboy wandering the American west. The motorcycle had previously been  sold by Bronson to his friend. After it is left at the suicide scene by  his friend, Bronson buys it back from the widow. Curiously, though the opening promises a journey of self-discovery,  the premise of each episode is that Bronson enters someone else's life  at a crucial point and acts as a catalyst for change. When Bronson  encounters an Amish community, for example, a local boy becomes  enraptured by the outside world and steals Bronson's motorcycle to run  off to Reno, Nevada. In another episode, located in Reno, Nevada,  Bronson meets his cousin Eve on her wedding day and lends her money for  the wedding service, but she runs off to the casinos and blows it. The first three episodes, including the end credits scenes, were shot  in and around Jackson, Wyoming. The premier pilot movie was also shown  at the town's then only theatre to give the locals a sense of what the  series was about since they were shooting in town and at local area  popular spots.Bronson is committed to pacifism and often redirects an antagonist's anger into self-examination. Always, like a true catalyst, he rolls out of every episode unchanged. Here's the opening sequence:   ",
