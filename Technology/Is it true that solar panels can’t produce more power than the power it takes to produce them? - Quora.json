            "answer_text": "Generally this is not true. Everything of course also depends a bit on where your solar panels are installed and in what direction/angle they are mounted. Installing panels in Alaska or Scandinavia will never break even. But indeed producing a solar panel requires quite a bit of energy before it has produced its first electricity. And here it of course depends what energy source you are using to produce them. Now you can find a multitude of articles on internet that try to calculate the break-even point when the solar panel starts producing real CO2 free electricity. Many different numbers are flying around but generally we can say that panels that are being installed today will reach a break even points during their life-time (20\u201325 years). When we started installing solar panels the break-even point was 40 to 50 years, so they indeed required more energy to make the panel than the panel was every capable to give back. That is also why they were only used there were other energy sources were difficult (Like space). It seems that today most of the new panels, thanks to improvement in production is in the range of a few years. A general remark: Many articles you find calculate when your panels will be paid back that you put on your roof. But that is from a CO2 point of view not a correct way to calculate. Most panels are produced in low wage countries like China so the dollar/euro cost is not relevant to the CO2 produced. Another aspect that is forgotten is the intermittent character of sun light. Unfortunately the big nuclear reactor in our skies is hidden on average for 12 hours every day. And these hours have to be buffered with back-up capacity. So as a minimum you need to double the amount of PV panels on your roof and then add some battery capacity. In fact doubling is very minimalist scenario. So you need to double the CO2 break even of the panels. And now you also need to add the CO2 to produce the batteries. So my conclusion is that today there is probably a small positive effect on CO2 produced over the lifetime of the PV panels. How much it is will depend very much on where you live, where the panels have been produced and what back-up system you are using. But the effect is much less than most people would believe. Generally for USA and Europe the installation of PV panels on our roofs is mainly an exportation of our CO2 to China. ",

No it\u2019s complete and utter BOLLOCKS Just think about this for a wee moment If I MAKE a solar panel I need to PAY for all of the energy used in manufacturing along with the labour and the raw materials When I SELL that panel I need to get MORE money back - or I go out of business The Company that BUYS that panel has to spend even more for the transport middlemen and fitting And then that company or individual has to make that money back My panels will have completely paid for themselves in seven years - with thirty years of life That is as a single homeowner - I bet the commercial guys have a MUCH MUCH faster payback time So in seven years - (23% of a 30 year life) the energy will have paid for The energy used to manufacture, transport and fit The raw materials The labour to manufacture, transport and fit And a decent lump of PROFIT for the manufacturer, transporter, fitter and an unknown amount of middlemen I would BET that the - \u201cenergy used to manufacture, transport and fit\u201d is less than 10% of the total cost - so my panels will have returned the \u201cenergy\u201d in about eight months ",
