            "answer_text": "Facts or behavior of the person you are thinking of getting married to. First observe the other person in as many kinds of situations as possible. How do they treat or react to others. How do they treat their family members. Do they drink alcohol or take recreational type drugs. Both the drug alcohol and any other drug they use is a RED FLAG. Write that down in notebook that only you have access to and not the other person. What is their beliefs about. Do they believe in God or are they an atheist or an agnostic. Atheists do not believe in GOD while agnostics say they do not know if there is a GOD. If you do not have a belief in common like if you are both Lutheran, or both Roman Catholic, or both Baptists then you have some measure of hope. But if one has their life in heaven and the other in darkness then don\u2019t get married to that person. RED FLAG. How does the person you are thinking of getting married to handle money. Do they spend everything they get a hold of? Are they Car crazy, clothes crazy, Sports crazy, Alcohol crazy, Credit Card crazy, Loan, line of credit, home equity loan crazy? Avoid such people. RED FLAG. There are some people who always have to have a car payment. They never own a car outright and too many people buy TOO MUCH car. They buy a car they has all the options. When all you need is something to go from point A to point B and back again. Look upon a car as a tool only. Who says you have to buy a brand new automobile? If you know nothing about how to take care of a car then go to HELM and order a service manual about the exact model and year you have purchased. It will be the best $100 you spend. No one says you have to work on your own car but it will tell you about what a car repair person is talking about. Learn to shop at NAPA, Advance Auto, AutoZone, Walmart for automobile needs. Sears at one time sold a Gold plated \u201cset of wrenches\u201d. Now why would anyone need a set of wrenches like that? I can understand buying tools of a name brand but that's going overboard. Do not get married to someone who always wants to eat out at a restaurant. This could mean they do not know how to put a meal together or they want you to keep footing the bill. People like this are not ever going to be able to save any money. RED FLAG. The most important thing to know is that you are not getting married to a person, you are getting married to a FAMILY. The other persons family will help decide where you are to spend holidays and you will be expected to show up there. In ages past it was Families who determined who was going to marry who. In some cultures it is still that way. If you have experience with the family of the person you are thinking of getting married to and it is positive then that's one good sign but if it is negative. RUN RED FLAG. Do not get involved with anyone who has a \u201cRoving Eye\u201d that is they are always looking at other members of the opposite sex. RED FLAG. If they are like that before they are married , you can be sure they will be like that after they are married. How does the person you intend to marry feel about children. If they do not want to have any children, that's a RED FLAG itself. There are three kinds of people in the world. One is People who live beyond their means (money, always in debt), Two are people who live within their means (they keep debt to a minimum and do not pay interest or overdraft fees), and Three are people who live below their means ( they have no debt, save for large purchases, do their research and shop around and resist impulse buys and generally cooperate with each other). The third type are the kind who quickly pay off a house they buy or pay off a car they buy unless they buy a car that has a manufacturer offering Zero Per Cent Interest. In this case do not put a single dollar down and DO NOT be in a hurry to pay off a Car that has the Manufacturer giving out a 0% interest rate. This is typically on only a new automobile, and here is where it makes sense to choose a car that is new (provided you have done your homework and only offer a bid that you have researched out thoroughly so you do not ever pay anywhere near the sticker (WHICH IS REALLY PURE FICTION). I would still avoid any models loaded with options that are not necessary. I would still go to HELM and buy the Service Manual for a new vehicle. Learn about the personal history of the person as much as possible. Do not get married to someone who is not clear about their Orientation. If they are into same sex relationships before getting married they will be inclined to repeat that type of relationship after getting married. ",

            "answer_text": "Romantic love will fade and diminish, and will be replaced with \u201ccompanionate love\u201d. This means that your partner will often feel like a friend, a member of your team, and not a person you\u2019re infatuated with. It is important to keep the love alive and sustain romance through gestures, however, you need to be prepared for the reality of long term relationships; which is that the nature of the love will change. If you\u2019re too attached to the chase, or romanticize passion and minimize the virtues of companionate love, then a ltr might not be right for you at this time. The passion and intense attraction will fade, but this is completely normal and allows room for more mature and lasting love.Women are more likely to initiate breakups, both in dating and marriage. Statistically, women initiate around two thirds of breakups.Be aware of the financials. Being married in some countries can actually mean you pay more tax. I have friends who are both economics, and they chose to not get married because it would cost them about $30k in additional taxes. Secondly, in the event of a divorce, be aware of possible alimony and child support payments and know what you\u2019ll be responsible for.Couples who live together before getting married have higher chances of getting divorced/breaking up.If your relationship is failing, a child will not save the relationship.You cannot change your partner. Never enter into a relationship or marriage with the hopes that someone will quit a bad behaviour. If your partner has a history of cheating, don\u2019t assume they will suddenly be loyal. If your partner smokes or drinks frequently, don\u2019t assume that you\u2019ll be able to change them. People change on their own accord. Marrying someone with a habit you don\u2019t respect will only breed resentment and frustration.The person who cares less has more power. Indifference can be used as a weapon. Do not stay in relationships like this. Playing the power game is a lose-lose option. Find someone who respects you and is happy to listen to you and negotiate with you. Being with someone who weaponizes their lack of care for you is soul-crushing.In heterosexual marriages, women continue to perform the bulk of childcare and domestic duties. Even among couples who work the same number of hours of paid work. Discuss the gender division of labour with your partner before moving in/getting married. Match up with a man who is grateful for the additional labour women tend to perform, and a man who is happy to do his fair share of work. I find women don\u2019t consider this enough, and they don\u2019t fully realize the quantity of work that is required to run a household.Be aware of your partner\u2019s relationship to their parents. We tend to emulate the qualities and roles of our same sex parent, and develop expectations about our partner based on the role/traits of our opposite sex parent. Additionally, be aware of the relationship your partner has with their parents. Often, we subconsciously project feelings, unresolved trauma, or expectations we\u2019ve developed about our parent onto our partner.Trust is incredibly time consuming to build, and very easy to break. Keep your word, follow through on your promises, and be honest- even when you\u2019re afraid of what your partner\u2019s response might be.Life is filled with struggles and challenges, and you need to ensure that you and your partner master communication, respectful disagreement, and conflict resolution before taking things to the next level. Having someone who is explosive, unwavering, uncooperative, stubborn, or verbally abusive will take a massive toll on your wellbeing. Make sure that you prioritize effective and respectful conflict resolution.Be aware of the way your partner deals with stress in their daily life, because it will tell you how they deal with stress regarding larger issues- and should inform your decision to move forward with the relationship. Do they shut down and let you handle their issues? Do they turn to substance use when they\u2019re stressed? Do they use retail therapy to calm their nerves? The way people manage stress will tell you a lot about what you can expect from them in the face of conflict. One of the major red flags is being in a relationship with someone who has no tolerance for tension or stress. Stress is a part of life, and you want to make sure that your partner can be strong and supportive, rather than crumble under conflict and leave you to clean up their mess.Do you get along well with their family, and does their family accept you? Another reality of relationships is that you\u2019re not marrying the person, you\u2019re also marrying into the family. Having in-laws who hate you can cause so much conflict and stress in the relationship, and if your partner sides with their family instead of you, this can make you feel rejected and alone. Prioritize cordial and loving relationships with their family members, and figure out how you\u2019re going to spend holidays! Whose parents will you see more? What holidays will you spend with your family/ your partner\u2019s family? Sort these things our early because family can be a major point of contention in marriages.",
