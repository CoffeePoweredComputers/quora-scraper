America, pre-election 2016, Facebook was flooded with 80,000 Kremlin-created false \u2018news\u2019 articles masked as news, targeting at least 126 million American households with crap. Facebook was accepting lying ads, some paid for in rubles, for crying out loud. And now for 2020, Zuckerberg has actively invited lying political ads - more sensationalism, more lies, more outrage = more clicks/shares, more money. Likewise, same practices have targeted voters in UK, Italy, Germany, France, and more. Yes, Facebook is a tool used by malevolent political players. And anyone who thinks \u2018social\u2019 media is media is a sucker. ",
