            "answer_text": "These are roughly the biggest trends to watch out for . Most of these trends are already a reality today and have moved on from being a phenomenon to being a part of everyday life .  Cloud computing is computing in which large groups of remote servers are networked to allow the centralized data storage, and online access to computer services or resources. Clouds can be classified as public, private or hybrid.[1]  Im simple terms, they are just storage centers within a master data center which anybody can rent out and can access through internet. The most common cloud source is you guessed it -Email .  Big data and data analytics - Big data is an all-encompassing term for any collection of data sets so large and complex that it becomes difficult to process using traditional data processing applications.The challenges include analysis, capture, curation, search, sharing, storage, transfer, visualization, and privacy violations. The trend to larger data sets is due to the additional information derivable from analysis of a single large set of related data, as compared to separate smaller sets with the same total amount of data, allowing correlations to be found to \"spot business trends, prevent diseases, combat crime and so on. A simple example is of flipkart shoving ads of pics of previously browsed entities from their websites on our faces. About three years back the ads used to be so random. Now the ads on websites are so accurate that the exact shoe that you browsed two weeks back keeps popping up in each corner of the websites. This is a classic example of how big data analytic is used to increase revenue.     Social Media : Enterprise social networking focuses on the use of online social networks or social relations among people who share business interests and/or activities. Enterprise social networking is often a facility of enterprise social software (regarded as a primary component of Enterprise 2.0), which is essentially social software used in \"enterprise\" (business/commercial) contexts. It encompasses modifications to corporate intranets (referred to as social intranets) and other classic softwareplatforms used by large companies to organize their communication, collaboration and other aspects of their intranets.  So social media is a powerful tool that is not only restricted to posting selfies and pictures birthday cakes .  Enterprise mobility management (EMM) is the set of people, processes and technology focused on managing the increasing array of mobile devices, wireless networks, and related services to enable broad use of mobile computing in a business context. A few years back work was related to only the office desktop. Now we have phones, multiple laptops, tablets, smartpads, you name it. So there are a lot of issues that can arise from multiple devices. For example, your son might accidentally delete sensitive company data while playing in your laptop. So this focuses on all aspects that can better the experience of mobile devices. BYOD is a closely related term.  Internet of things - This is a relatively new concept.  In the near future, every device will be connected to the internet in some way. For example , the AC will receive data about the weather and change temperature accordingly. Shoes will send information to your workout database aout how many calories you burnt, how many kms did you cover today, and so on.  Gartner encompasses the terms and fondly calls it the SMAC phenomenon. ",

            "answer_text": "Thanks for A2A. IT is playing a big role changing the way Industry functions. 1. Cloud Computing: Cloud computing is is typically defined as a type of computing that relies on sharing computing resources rather than having local servers or personal devices to handle applications. In cloud computing, the word cloud (also phrased as \"the cloud\") is used as a metaphor for \"the Internet,\" so the phrase cloud computing means \"a type of Internet-based computing,\" where different services \u2014 such as servers, storage and applications \u2014are delivered to an organization's computers and devices through the Internet.    2. 3-D Printing: 3D printing or additive manufacturing is a process of making three dimensional solid objects from a digital file. The creation of a 3D printed object is achieved using additive processes. In an additive process an object is created by laying down successive layers of material until the entire object is created. Each of these layers can be seen as a thinly sliced horizontal cross-section of the eventual object.    Applicatons: a.Industrial Printing:Manufacturers have long used these printers in their design process to create prototypes for traditional manufacturing and research purposes. Using 3D printers for these purposes is called rapid prototyping. Now, fast 3D printers can be had for tens of thousands of dollars and end up saving the companies many times that amount of money in the prototyping process. For example, Nike uses 3D printers to create multi-colored prototypes of shoes. They used to spend thousands of dollars on a prototype and wait weeks for it. Now, the cost is only in the hundreds of dollars, and changes can be made instantly on the computer and the prototype reprinted on the same day. 3D printing is also used for rapid manufacturing. Rapid manufacturing is a new method of manufacturing where companies are using 3D printers for short run custom manufacturing. In this way of manufacturing the printed objects are not prototypes but the actual end user product. Here you can expect more availability of personally customized products. It is predicted by some additive manufacturing advocates that this technological development will change the nature of commerce, because end users will be able to do much of their own manufacturing rather than engaging in trade to buy products from other people and corporations.3D printers capable of outputting in colour and multiple materials already exist and will continue to improve to a point where functional products will be able to be output. With effects on energy use, waste reduction, customization, product availability, medicine, art, construction and sciences, 3D printing will change the manufacturing world as we know it. 3. 4G Technology: With the implementation of 4G networks, mobile phones and tablets are supposed to effectively perform every internet role currently fulfilled by a PC. In theory, 4G networks can operate at between four and 10 times the speed of 3G, significantly increasing bandwidth and throughput capabilities for users.   4.The Internet of Everything:The Internet of Things (IoT) is a scenario in which objects, animals or people are provided with unique identifiers and the ability to transfer data over a network without requiring human-to-human or human-to-computer interaction. Since 2008, there have been more objects connected to the Internet than peeople in the world and this figure will hit 50 billion by 2020, according to Libelium, a wireless sensor networks platform provider.The company has released a list of 54 sensor applications for a smarter world, covering the most disruptive sensor and \u201cinternet of things\u201d applications. Their list is grouped in 12 different verticals, showing how the internet of things is becoming the next technological revolution. It includes the trendiest scenarios, such as smart cities where sensors can offer services such as smart parking \u2013 to find free parking spots in the streets\u2013 or managing the intensity of the luminosity in street lights to save energy. Climate change, environmental protection, water quality or CO2emissions are also addressed by sensor networks.
