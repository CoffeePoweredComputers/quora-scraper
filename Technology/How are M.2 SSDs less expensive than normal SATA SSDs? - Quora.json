            "answer_text": "M.2 is a newer physical form factor that enables smaller drives. They come however with different interfaces and some of them enable very high transfer speeds (PCIe), and thus they\u2019re much more expensive than 2.5\u2033 SATA drives. If you find a cheaper M.2 it is most likely a SATA interface M.2, which is an alternative for laptop manufacturers to have a smaller form factor without going to an expensive high performance parts. In the aftermarket those parts doesn\u2019t make much sense besides someone willing to upgrade his thin laptop, which is not user friendly to exchange parts, so those M.2 have been of low interest and sometimes are on sale with big discounts. They have low compatibility and no speed advantage\u2026 few customers mean low price. ",

            "answer_text": "Thanks for A2A. And M.2 \u201cdrive\u201d only has to fit a motherboard slot, just like a RAM module. A complete SSD must conform to the 2.5\u2033 form-factor so that it can trade places with its mechanical counterpart. This means that you are paying for the M.2 version chips that have been repackaged PLUS the additional casing and interface hardware. As the technology matures, and the cost-factor of the additional casing becomes easier and cheaper, the devices will become competitive with each other. If the SSD case were entirely plastic, the actual production cost would get as low as 1c, but metal ferules are required for screws and metal heat spreaders are required inside to prevent the SSD from over-heating.

            "answer_text": "As others have mentioned we can see why they would cost \u201cless\u201d via materials costs. However I\u2019ve yet to see M2\u2019s going cheaper than SATA variants of similar drives? Since the M.2\u2019s are premium items typically better all around specs (Read/Write/IOPS), and they\u2019re not limited to SATA3 (6Gbit/Sec bandwidth) SATA3 is limited to 600MB/s.  PCI-E 4.0 is coming out soon but as you can see our current gen can go as fast as 3.9 GB a Second, vs 600MB a second of SATA3. Hope that helps! ",

            "answer_text": "The other answers that related to how there is less material in a M.2 than a SATA drive are on point. However, since there is currently a premium price for a M.2, it would be cool if you could point us to where you are finding the MVME drives cheaper. M.2 drives \u201cmay\u201d be cheaper but for the most part they will be found to be more expensive especially since they perform better. Better performance usually corresponds to a higher price. Even if the materials are mostly the same, minus the extra case for the SATA drive. ",

            "answer_text": "Going with the comparison centring the 860 evo series, the manufacturer has also used 2280 form factor in this which can hit the read speed of maximum 500 MB/s and write speed of maximum 520 MB/s. Everyone has the same question that when the same form factor is used in both the hardware\u2019s the why there is a huge speed difference between 860 evo and 970 evo. This is because 860 evo is equipped with the SATA 3.0 version and the 970 EVO is configured with M.2 paired with PCIe 3.0 channel. This has led to a huge price difference between: M.2 970 evo pro 1TB comes with a MRP of 400$ whereas the SATA 860 evo has a MRP of 300$ ",
