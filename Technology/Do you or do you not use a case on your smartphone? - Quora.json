            "answer_text": "I don\u2019t need a case. Before buying my smart phone, I found this video of it being agitated in a washing machine, frozen in ice, and dropped off a parking garage (the last drop damages it but doesn\u2019t disable it):  Frankly, I find it weird that cases are even a thing. Case users want their phones to be durable; however, the easiest way to engineer an impact-resistant phone is if you\u2019re allowed to design the screen, chassis, and external casing all together. The phone+case as a whole needs to be able to absorb kinetic energy. Why put a protective case on a fragile phone when you could instead have a durable phone? I think the answer is that people conflate system specs with usefulness, and you can squeeze in \u201cbetter\u201d specs by sacrificing durability. As far as I know, every smart phone on the market (including my own milspec phone) has the same basic functionality: It\u2019s a compact, low-power computer that doubles as a camera*, telephone, and flashlight. The keyword is \u201ccompact\u201d; the fact that you can take it anywhere is a smart phone\u2019s only advantage over a desktop, laptop, or tablet; and it\u2019s a HUGE advantage. What\u2019s bizarre is that the smart phone marketplace seems to ignore this advantage. Both in buying trends and in the advertising I see, it seems like bigger screens, faster processors, more memory, and better cameras* are the only reasons why anyone chooses one smart phone over another (okay, that and Steve Jobs\u2019 cult of personality, but I\u2019m not addressing that). It\u2019s like people remember only after the fact that, oh, right, this thing needs to be able to survive 24/7 in my pants pocket, because if it can\u2019t, that would defeat the point of it being phone-sized. And, so, we get phone cases. *: The camera deserves special mention. I\u2019m comfortable saying that, in a first-world nation, everyone should have at least the amount of computing power supplied by a tablet. In other words, your smart phone should always be your smaller, weaker computing option. Most people don\u2019t need a dedicated camera, though\u2014 or, rather, most people don\u2019t need a camera more powerful than the ones built into the last few generations of iPhone. It DOES make sense to optimize the camera on a phone, because it makes sense that this could be a person\u2019s ONLY mobile camera. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes but it depends on the phone, the availability of cases and if I plan on reselling it. I have owned a couple of rugged android phones that was water proof and did not have cases available for them anyways. And even with some of my regular phones. If I am not working in a line of work where I might drop my phone off a ladder or something I usually do bit use a case but I still use a screen protector because scratches can make the glass weaker. Generally im not the more careful person when It comes to my phone so they get the occasional dropping on cement or hard floor and I have not broke a screen yet. Some of the phones I have used are the HTC EVO 4G, Moto Defy, Samsung Nexus, Samsung Galaxy S3, and a couple other Samsung and Moto Phones, and currently I use a Moto E from virgin mobile that cost less then $50 and it has a built in battery (that last longer then any smart phone I ever had even with the extended batteries that required a new battery cover) and it only has a plastic ring that goes around to phone to cover the SIM, MicroSD, and it has a pull out sticker with the phone info and when I bought it their was no cases made for it (there might be some now) but even with multiple drops on hard floors I have not have any problems. Most people that I know that have broken or cracked screens had a cover on their phone when it happened. Of course some phones break a lot easier like the iPhone\u2019s, my favorite design being the ones with glass on the back and the front. LG phones and a lot of the other off brands seem to break easier too. With the phone cases I have used in the past, with the cheap snap together and soft thin ones most of the time it was more for the style of case more then it was about protecting the phone. I have used silicon soft ones and hated them because it made it hard to get the phone out of my pocket, I have used the top of the line otter case and found it to hard to type, I have used the mid grade otter case and was pretty happy with them and it seems to offer a good amount of protection but was a pain to get off if I wanted to pull the SD card or had to take battery out. When It comes down to it you gotta factor everything in and come up with decision based on that. Cost of phoneCost of screen replacementHow long you plan on keeping itIf insured, what is the deductibleHow fragile is the phoneDo you plan on reselling phoneWhat are you going to be doing when carrying the phoneAre there cases available for itIs having a case going to interfere with assessors such as windshield mounts or docksAre you going to be using multiple batteriesWill it affect wireless charger or NFCWill it make it harder to push side buttonsIf the phone gets wet will it affect the time it takes to pull battery(unless your getting a water proof case) ",

            "answer_text": "Yes. I\u2019m a huge advocate of not putting cases on phones although I understand why people use them. I\u2019ve owned 3 smartphones since 2011 and have never used any of them with a case.The phones are:1. Samsung Galaxy S22. HTC One M83. Moto G4+ I just bought the Moto a few months back as a placeholder since I did not like any of the flagships on offer at the time and needed a phone immediately but the other two have been the flagships devices on offer at that time. The closest I\u2019ve come to modifying the look of a phone is putting a skin on the One M8, like this one but only for the rear:  This phone has a smooth metal finish on the whole of the rear panel and as such was quite slippery. The skin improves the grip just a little and makes the phone stand out a bit. The other two phones, the Galaxy S2 and the G4+ already have such a texture on the rear panel, so grip was never an issue. I do not use cases for the following reasons: It ruins the form of the phone. The form of the phone and how it feels in hand is one of the most important aspects of choosing a phone for me. I would be holding it in my hand for hours during a day, so it better feel good. Of course, a case would make it redundant.I\u2019m not clumsyI don\u2019t drop my phone often and have never broken a screen. Thus, I don\u2019t feel protection is necessary. The M8 that I used for more than 2 years has a few dents and scratches along the edges and that is it. Another point to be noted is that I have never owned an iPhone. I suspect things might be different if I did.Cases add weight and volumeI don\u2019t like heavy phones. The M8 is about as high as I will go, although it was beautiful to hold, more than that would be too much. I also want the phone to slide into my pocket without much hassle and annoyance and, this would most likely be compromised with a case.Cases are flimsyI don\u2019t want anything to interfere in me pressing the physical buttons on the phone or using the ports. The experience of using the buttons, charging the phone, etc. is just much better without a case.Thus, in my case, the cons of using a case outweigh the pros by a whole lot. I don\u2019t see myself ever using a case on a smartphone. ",

And yes it looks very beautiful and sleek without a case and i love using it. But I would argue that it\u2019s really not designed that well. For a product that costs nearly $750 to buy, it should be way more user friendly - because it is primarily held in the hand it should be much much stickier and easier to keep in your hand. When I\u2019m holding it, I feel like it wants to slip out of my hand and fall to the floor to meet an uncertain fate. If the design of a product means that you have to buy another (uglier) product to stick on top of it to make it usable and protected, it\u2019s not been well designed. So I find myself resenting the notion that the phone is the pinnacle of design, it\u2019s just not and I refuse to buy into the idea that I have to have a case in order to use it, as the good folk at AT&T would have me believe. It would be like buying a new car and having to go buy special covers for the tires and windows so it doesn\u2019t slip off the road at the first corner and crack the windscreen, which would be crazy. So the result being that I just have to be very careful with this device and patiently wait until apple or any other smartphone maker fixes this fundamental flaw - it is after all a highly sophisticated computer and should be treated with some level of respect.

I use a battery power case. 5 Best Galaxy S5 Battery Cases  Overnight I will have both the phone and the case recharging, usually separately, although it is possible to recharge both at the same time off the same charger if required (but it takes twice as long, usually around 6+ hours in that configuration if the phone remains on during charging). I use the phone quite heavily during the working day. Commonly downloading mp3 files or running youtube red at the same time as navigation software from google now. I also am in the habit of swapping SD cards every few days, which means media server has a hard task in the morning associating all the files. (Many of which are 1\u20133 hour long audio files of podcasts etc) Before I used to have the case, I would regularly get to 6pm and have just 20% or less battery remaining, but using the battery case, I get to around 5:30pm before the case runs out of battery, and then the phone itself drops below 100% for the first time all day. Another strategy is to take the pair into the office (if I\u2019m working from there), then take the battery case off, and recharge \u201cjust\u201d the case itself, while I use the phone without the case for most of the day, then just before leaving work, I\u2019ll take the battery case off the charger, and put my phone in it, and start transferring battery case charge over to the phone on the ride home, often seeing my ~30\u201340% power increase to 100% about 2 to 3 hours later. I guess I\u2019m not really using a \u201cCase\u201d but an \u201cextra battery\u201d which just so happens to also function like a case. It\u2019s better than a recharger because it\u2019s slim enough that it fits in my top pocket, or my suction-mount hands-free holder in my vehicle as well either way. (I use this in my car, utility truck and occasionally in light aircraft (as a camera), and once or twice in an aircraft simulator)  This video was recorded with 2 magicams, 1 Samsung S5 (in my pocket then mounted, battery case attached the whole time) and 1 Samsung S2 (on a suction mount attached to the rear/left window without a battery case) Basically it\u2019s like having 2 batteries, 1 of which can be removed to be recharged on its own, then be returned to recharge the other battery while remaining essentially mobile the whole time.

I\u2019ve owned every iPhone since the original.  I also liked to keep all of the boxes I even waited in line for the iPhone 4  I seriously have a love for iPhones\u2014I bought the iPhone 7 the day it was released (images taken from my Instagram)  I think somewhere between my iPhone 4 and iPhone 4s, I stopped using cases. I love the minimalistic feeling of the iPhone\u2014the cool aluminum and soft edges. I\u2019ve also broken the screen on every iPhone I\u2019ve owned since the 4s. For my 6s, I replaced the screen twice. Two weeks after I bought the iPhone 7, I was running with my headphones in and I accidentally hooked my thumb in my headphone\u2019s wire and threw my phone on the ground \u2014the screen was shattered. It is still broken. I have owned a lot of smartphones and have very rarely used cases. I also have broken a lot of screens. I suspect the two are related. ",

My cell phone is a stinkin\u2019 cell phone! I don\u2019t need or want to dress it up, and I don\u2019t care about the appearance of it. It rings, I answer. Or else I push buttons on it to call someone. I don\u2019t care what color it is, or if it wears a leather glove, or fits in a holster. None of that enhances its functionality. I just want to stuff that sucker in my pocket and go about my business. NOW ON THE OTHER HAND, if you have a case that extends the range or sensitivity of my phone, we need to talk - I WANT that. But if it is just a nest, why should I care? Maybe it is just I -in fact, I\u2019ll stipulate to that- but there seems to be a morbid focus on how things look, as opposed to what they do. People worry about their titles, their business cards, their wardrobes. It very sadly appears that people derive their own self worth from how they dress up their \u201cthings.\u201d Or themselves. Dreadful. And I will admit that I have been this way for many years. Open a bank account, and have a choice of scenes on the paper check. Cute kittens, ocean waves, mountain ranges, patriotic themes - the list goes on. Damnit, just print the bank codes on plain paper, and I\u2019m outta here. Is it really important that the color of your cell match your shoes? So important that you spend much time thinking about this? Oy. Somebody, stop me! ",

Did you know what happened to me when I switched to one of those cute slimmer cases for my iPhone? Crack on the screen the next day. I used the Lifeproof case which proved to be effective but perhaps a bit of overkill. The case I have on my phone now (Poetic brand) has crystal violet stain from gram staining last semester and I have spilled milk and flour all over it. Probably a few different chemicals too (all biology work in labs so not too harmful but whoops). Recently I dropped it in a parking lot, it rained all over the phone, and thanks to my case I still have a phone. The iPhone is too pretty and delicate by itself to be Olivia-proof. It needed some help. Same goes for my iPad which has a case on it that's proudly advertised as childproof on Amazon. I work with a bunch of papers and eraser scraps everywhere (no joke it's a weekly chore of mine to vacuum up eraser scraps around my workspace). between my biochem and organic 2 books open there isn't a lot of room. The first to go down is the iPad. I always pick it up with peace of mind because it's child AND Olivia proof. ",

But i am thankful to those of you who do not, you see coming out of college living in the small city i am in there wasn\u2019t alot of job opportunities for what i took in school, so i started doing developing for android, mostly Icon packs and such at the start and i would buy these busted phones (mostly broken screens) for development purposes\u2026. after awhile i had a collection of various phones LG, Samsung, HTC, Sony, Asus. i wanted to play with these phones as daily devices so i repaired them my self\u2026..suddenly a light went on. I had the know how, i had the tools. Now 4 years later i run my own business, i buy liquidation lots of cell phones people have broken and returned or traded in.

I was so happy\u2026 By the way, I made the holes using a screwdriver. I put the back cover on a piece of cardboard and spin the screwdriver while pushing it into the back cover very slowly. Then peel the excess bits with a utility knife. That\u2019s it. Once I used red hot needle to make the holes but I messed up the cover. So I had to get another one\u2026 When I use a phone case, I use Otterbox Defender. I even made two holes on it as well, so I don\u2019t drop it in the water while taking a picture near the sea. Some people are holding their expensive phones with two fingers and taking pictures while they are bending over the fences on a bridge\u2026 I cannot do that\u2026 About Gorilla Glass; We need a Godzilla Glass because, I saw the Gorilla Glass got scratched on few phones. Especially on Note 4\u2026 Thank You!..  ",

I consider it more a privilege than a true matter of preference, however - from the first Android handset (alternately called the HTC Dream or Google G1) until my most recent handset, I\u2019ve bought best-or-second-best-in-class handsets, so they\u2019re built well and will take some damage. I don\u2019t know anyone who doesn\u2019t drop a phone sometimes, but putting an armored box around the thing 100% of the time to react to the 0.2% case of you dropping it on something hard seems very -_- to me. Then, I made a career change and my income shifted radically. My next (and current) handset was near bottom-of-the-line. Sure enough, I cracked my first-ever screen within weeks, breaking a nine-year streak. I still wouldn\u2019t use a case - the crack has progressed to be the width of the phone without affecting its functionality at all - but that told me that my \u201cwtf is with cases\u201d attitude really originated with the privilege I enjoyed to buy decent-quality handsets. I think I understand people with cases much better now. ",

Centuries of human evolution have adapted my hands to hold things properly. Over the past six years I have used the following phones - Samsung StarNokia E72iPhone 5SMoto GiPhone 6iPhone 6SAnd the total number of times in six years that I have cracked my screen is - once. I really don't understand how come people drop their phones. Do you always wear a bib because you might drop your food? Or do you always have cushions on your floor because you might drop your glass any moment? If you can handle those complex tasks daily without dropping, then how is a phone different? If you are still paranoid, you can get a tempered glass to protect the screen. But a case? To protect the back side? Why? So that it doesn't scratch? What's the big deal if it does? I thought my generation was the one that loved faded jeans. This, plus the other reasons already mentioned - it totally ruins the slimness, aesthetics, design etc. I like to experience the phone the way it was meant to be by the company. ",

This means I don\u2019t have to worry about minor scuffs/scratches that would otherwise hinder the resale value of the device. I look after my phone, and do not fling it around the place causing damage to it. Some people will claim they need a case to protect it from drop damage, water damage, and whatever damage\u2014 but I find that just by keeping a firm grip on my phone and not trying to text a friend while on a rough motorboat ride, I can alleviate these risks. I don\u2019t buy into Apple, but even so, I believe that phones are very carefully crafted to have a refined and generally beautiful appearance. Covering them up with an unwieldy, often very cheap case takes away from their presence in a way that I don\u2019t think is worth it. ",

I feel a case (even a designer case) disrupts this, as it changes the look and size of the smartphone which I don\u2019t like. You may ask why not use a clear case, well the feel of the smartphone still changes no matter how clear or thin the case is. Plus with Apple care and other such services, the replacement cost due to a broken screen is much lower, and smartphones have become more durable over time. I currently have the Google Pixel:  Why would you ever want to put a case around that? That being said the only time I use a case is when I go hiking or use my phone for its camera in a place where there is a high probability I will drop it. ",

Even without the case, and a young daughter from 1 to 3 years old who would occasionally use it, both phones survived without any cracked screens or damage beyond very minor dents or nicks in the corners. I actually found that the case I did have on it for a short time caused more damage than not having a case. When we upgraded, we gave the old phones to my wife\u2019s parents. I\u2019ve had the iPhone 6 Plus for a year and a half and never put a case on it and it\u2019s been fine. It\u2019s survived a few minor falls with barely noticeable dents. I dislike cases because they take the nice, high quality aesthetic of the phone and make them look cheap, ugly, and clunky. The nicer cases are so expensive that it\u2019s hard to justify the cost (at least in our case). For some people, cases are very necessary (I know some who can\u2019t not break their phones). But if you\u2019re like me, you can do just fine without. I\u2019m sure one day I\u2019ll have a phone break, but so far in my roughly 5 years of owning a smartphone I\u2019ve taken care of them and been lucky. ",

In the 3 years I\u2019ve had it it\u2019s been dropped off of forklifts, dropped from trucks, dropped in water and spent many a day in the same pocket as keys, knives and occasionally pistol magazines. The Kyocera Brigadier with sapphire screen. Waterproof, dustproof, shatterproof, scratchproof, (I think it might even be NIOSH explosive atmosphere rated), can Qi charge, and fits nicely in a beer mug.  I will be very sad if I have to replace it and no NOS units are available and I have to get something slim, fragile and requires a skin to be waterproof.

If I had a case on my phone, knowing myself, and this is likely true for many others, I would be a lot less careful with it. Since I know my phone isn\u2019t protected by anything, I instead always try to be aware of where it is and pay extra attention if I\u2019m holding it. As a result, I\u2019ve had my current phone for over 3 years now, a Galaxy S4, and I\u2019ve never once dropped it. The only exceptions are when I\u2019m fumbling around with it on my nightstand while half asleep, and then it doesn\u2019t fall far or onto any hard surfaces. It looks the same as the day I bought it, and I don\u2019t have to cover up any of its aesthetic features with a cheap plastic case! Contrast with my cousin, who always uses cases, but somehow manages to break her phone every 6 months. ",

BTW it might also give an attachment point for a lanyard cord, which could provide still more protection. OTOH if you are in the habit of sitting on your phone, or if you\u2019re careless about making sure it doesn\u2019t fall in the toilet, or in a storm sewer grate, or if you might leave it in the laundry, or if you have a high risk of losing it or having it pickpocketed, the case obviously won\u2019t help with those situations. I, myself, do not use one, just because it\u2019s more bulk and weight (after some very expensive trimming by the engineers, as has been pointed out) and more expense. I\u2019m just very careful about my phone. I don\u2019t have insurance, either. (You can\u2019t get insurance against theft or less, anyway.) And, of course, the financial value of these devices goes down quickly, in the sense of the cost of an equivalent replacement. ",

Amazingly, the screen is still pristine with no scratches. I assume that\u2019s due to the Corning Gorilla Glass. Nor are there any dents or scratches on the case, and that\u2019s probably due to the soft flexible plastic. For what it\u2019s worth, I don\u2019t use protection because the phone was free (and running Basic FreedomPop so I don\u2019t even pay for access). I\u2019m just waiting (hoping?) for it to break so that I can upgrade but it just won\u2019t die! ",

I've never broken a phone in my two years of having one, she has broken two in her six years. I always use a case and screen protector (I recently upgraded to a LifeProof) because I don't have the money to replace my iPhone 5s and plan on keeping this model for a while. My sister used to use a case for her iPhone 4 until her last one got too worn out. She decided to remove the case altogether and use the perfectly fine looking phone without a case, because if it breaks she\u2019ll just use her upgrade and get a new phone. She\u2019s had her phone since the 4 came out, I\u2019ve had my 5s since the 6 came out.

The smartphones of today need stronger processors for heavier applications than ever before and thats why manufacturers spend millions of dollars on research a testing to design something optimal for daily usage and to offer maximum performance possible without the device hanging up often and to avoid slow burning and damage to the cores . Whilst using an extra thick rubbery cover we tend to forget that we're just blocking the air from getting to the surface area that was designed to provide the cooling effect to the processor which happens to lack an added cooling sink fan in these devices. I have practically noticed the difference between the performance and heating levels in my phones with and without the cover. Simply obvious and by a huge margin. My last phone would heat up like an oven with a cover and even start having a lag hanging ever so often but without the cover everything got down to at least half of it. A thin rubber sheet can never protect a phone from breaking impacts except for some scratches to the color and that's it. As far as protecting the camera screen is concerned, that's something we need to compromise with as it gets all the damage and scratches after sometime even with the cover anyways. And yes, using just a temper glass for the screen won't hurt. ",

With a Palm Centro I didn't use a case until I broke the screen one day. Then I put a case on it. One day I pulled it out of the washing machine. My dear wife washed it for me. She's sweet. It dried a couple days later and worked for another year. Then I got Casio Commando that was water/drop/dust proof so it didn't need a case. Now I have a Droid that is supposed to be drop proof but I use a Life Proof case because I want some water resistance. My lovely wife has mangled three or four iPhones with and without cases. Her current iPhone 6 has a case and gorilla glass and a cracked screen. Children are wonderful creatures that obviously don't exist in Steve Job's world. ",

The reason behind is my personal experience why I put phone case on cellphone, no doubt if you invest a money on your cellphone you fell in love with it and without the phone case cellphone looks so good, back in 2016 I bought 7 plus a beautiful device at that time was fallen down on the ground and it\u2019s touch panel broke and the upper bumper side turn into full scratchy. That was the biggest investment I made at that time from my saving then I decided to use phone cover on cellphone, that loss was very shocking for me, so I decided to never off the case from my cellphone, currently I\u2019m using waterproof and shock proof case for my iPhone 11pro. These days you know every year there will a new cellphone launch everyone rush to grab new model. So, to take care of your cellphone is more important, If you are investing bigger amount on you cellphone then why can\u2019t you buy a phone case in few bucks for your cellphone ",

It really makes you appreciate the simple sleek design and will make you fall in love again with this over two years old phone. Within an hour of removing the case, went to a bar and as I take my jacket out, I see my phone fall on the ground. The panzer screen guard is cracked both front and bottom. Luckily, the phone is still intact. After getting back, I replaced the case. While I considered getting an insurance on my next phone and let the insurance company worry about the risk, I realized that smaller damages would still drive me nuts to not enjoy the phone. ",

Why in the world, would I pay $30 to $50 or as much as $100 for a case for a disposable device that I\u2019m going to replace pretty soon anyways. I keep my phones for 2 years. I never use a case. The last 6 months is particularly, but mostly because the battery doesn\u2019t last that long by then. By the time I upgrade to a new phone, the sides might be scratched up, but generally it still works. ",

I have dropped it from about 2 feet onto carpet a few times and I sometimes kept it in the same pocket as my keys, but it hasn\u2019t fared badly. In fact, I would still be using it, were it not for the fact that Microsoft canned any further updates to it a while back and the battery life isn\u2019t what it used to be. In any case (no pun intended), the phone survived fine without a case. I\u2019m not using a case with my current phone either. I predict it will wear similarly to my previous phone. ",

There are few instances I have dropped it, so there are a few scratches on the sides, not major though, must appreciate Apple\u2019s quality because I have seen people accidentally dropping their phone on the carpet and boy it shatters like Cinderellas dream, not the i-phone though.

Got it repaired again, but the touch screen got messed up, so I cut my losses and got a replacement phone since it was annoying and cumbersome to use3) LG G4 - never took physical impact damageIf something happens to this phone, I'll just buy a new one. It's last year's model, and only $180 to $250 used. Roughly $250 to $350 if brand new In all cases, I keep my phone on a belt clip so that keys in pocket won't scratch it up, especially the display and camera lenses. Having a case would protect it better, but it may not have helped the first time I dropped it (from 4ft up onto concrete). Also, it's usability to me would be diminished if I had to keep in a larger, case. If I had to let a child borrow it, then that's another matter entirely. ",

It's the thinnest, rubbery most inconspicuous case I could find, but it alters the tactile experience of using my phone to something that I require. Like my keys, wallet, lighter, cigarettes and other EDC, I need my phone to not squirm around in my hand and be responsive to the lightest movement. My hands are not sweaty so I have no surface tension assistance. The aluminum body of my phone requires me to be more deliberate with how I handle it. If I'm not, then I have to hold it harder and be more conscious of how I pick it up and move it around. It irritates me that I have the need to augment the experience with a cover, especially since I have had no problems with the glassy IPhone 4. ",

For a couple of reasons, I think getting a phone case is really important. Firstly, you\u2019re phone is essentially an investment piece. It\u2019s not cheap and you depend on it - so to drop it and risk it being out of action a couple of weeks let alone days, is something I couldn\u2019t afford doing! Also, there\u2019s so many fun and practical cases out there that you can find one that suits your style and doesn\u2019t compromise the overall aesthetics of your iPhone.

I hate using a case because the feel of a beautiful metal unibody design is destroyed by the case for starters. The sides of the phone becomes difficult to use because side bezels are nearly non existent. So, playing games and multimedia consumption isnt the same. But the phone has a camera hump which becomes a concern. When I go out, I don't have a dedicated soft surface (like my bed at home) to keep my phone. Hence, I keep it with a case, so that camera protection glass doesn't get scratched. I good to enjoy the phone but, it's equally I important to take care of the device which is very much a part of you now a days. PS : I use OnePlus 3 with 6 GB RAM ",

The glass is either flush to the case, or protrudes slightly so scratches easily if in a pocket or even just sitting on a table. A decent cases protects it by making it slightly recessed instead.They do in fact prevent the screen from breaking, The rubber bit around the edge prevents the screen hitting the ground.

            "answer_text": "It all depends on your liking! Assuming that you will use your smartphone for a period of around 2- 2.5 years, your phone will last that time without any need of any sort of cover and case. Personally I don't prefer a case since it makes the phone heavy and bulkier, makes the phone less pocket-able and hides the actual look of the phone. On the other side it protects your phone from damages(an accidental fall, small bumps here and there) and adds a little persona to your phone(if you can get a customized case or shell from somewhere). I would recommend using a screen guard for the screen and nothing else. Maybe a full body cover which is made of a material similar to screen guards and does not add a lot of bulk to the current heavy and big crop of phones available today. You can check the following website for such kinds of covers:Screen Protectors for Mobile Devices - Buy Scratch Guard, Cell Phone Body Covers Online ",

So I think a good phone case is essential for your phone, at least until they invent some kind of regenerative plastic. No matter what phone case you want to pick up, I recommend you choose ones that have a screen protector - that would give give far more protection than your phone itself has. Also be sure to look at all the other aspects, whether you want glass of plastic screen protectors, and if you want your case to be strike proof and/or waterproof. Also remember that smartphones themselves are getting more protected all the time, there are many phones now that are waterproof. Keep in mind though that the majority of those are still prone to take at least some damage from being dropped - especially if dropped into the water. You can check youtube testing videos of people testing their phones in most cruel ways imaginable if you if you want to find out what your phone can withstand - without a case, and with various types of cases you might be interested in.

I invariably remark that in doing this, they keep it ugly. Some people then argue that they choose to endure having an ugly phone if it is to keep it in pristine shape in order to resell it later.

Although I don\u2019t use a full case, I do have one of the very thin, slightly stretchy, silicone covers - like this below - on both my phone and my tablet.  It adds less than 0.5mm to the thickness of the device, and although the protection factor if I dropped either is perhaps fairly minimal, being textured it does give a far better and more secure grip, and it protects the back and edges from the usual minor knocks and marks often gained from normal daily use. I\u2019ve found that full cases are too bulky to be able to slip either a phone into the pocket in a pair of jeans, or the tablet into an inside jacket pocket; the silicone cases are fine for this.
