            "answer_text": "The best calculator for math students is the one that they know best. I own a TI-84+ CE, an HP Prime, a Casio fx CG50, and a TI nspire CX CAS. In their own ways, each of the other calculators are better than my 84+CE, but because I spent so much time learning to use the 84+ while taking College Algebra, College Trigonometry, Calculus 1 and 2, and Probability/Statistics, I almost always reach for my 84 first. If you have already learned the 84+ in high school, and are thinking about what calculator to get for high school, I\u2019d highly recommend that you get the most recent version of the 84+ family, the TI-84+ CE, because it has added features that will never get added to the older 84\u2019s. For example, piecewise functions, cut and paste in the program editor, and many more, including 7 times the user available memory. You can see some of the differences at this article:Why the TI-84-plus-CE is better than all the other TI-84's @ mazes.com . Original Question: Are TI-89 better than TI-84 graphing calculators? ",

            "answer_text": "I think the TI89 does a lot more than the 84. If I remember rightly, the 89 is the 94 in a convenient box, so it has a proper programming language, geometry, CAS on 3d graphics on top of the graphics and programmability of the 84. Which means it does a lot more, but you may find you can\u2019t use it in exams if you are a student. ",
