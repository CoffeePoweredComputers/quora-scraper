            "answer_text": "The best choice is the one FITS to your product/service, technical infrastructure/background, platform you are running (mobile/desktop etc) and the most important one the market/country that you are operating. For instance, if you are in a market that plastic cards (credit/debit) are in common you should start to choose the one who commits high approval rates/system uptimes, offers standart (e-comm) and 3Ds payments, card keeping/card vault/tokenization etc\u2026 Every country/region have some local payment methods and in some of them customers may want to choose that ones instead of credit cards like in Germany. Credit cards are not the major payment method online but direct debit payments. So know your market first! When you have some idea about those items then you should look for which payment methods you should offer to your customers and ask your PSP which payment methods they have, which services are offered with APIs, how is payout & pricing scheme look like, are there any hidden fees after you onboarded, how strong the PSP in the market and the most important one are they covering you against fraud transactions etc.. You should think well and all calculate those options at first place because once you have implemented one of them it is technically a trouble to migrate to a new system. Also you should check if your PSP is PCI compliant, if you are in a regulated country you should check weather they have fulfilled the requirements by law/legislation. ",
