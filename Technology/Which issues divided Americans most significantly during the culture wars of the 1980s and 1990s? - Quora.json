            "answer_text": "Mostly irrelevant (in hindsight) cultural issues that had mostly to do with lingering animosities left over from the 1960s and, by extension, 1970s. The freedoms that had burst into daily life during the Consciousness Revolution (\u201860s and \u201870s) were entrenched enough by the \u201880s, and certainly by the \u201890s, as to be essentially impervious to attack, yet the right could not live with these changes and set about reversing them to the greatest extent possible.
