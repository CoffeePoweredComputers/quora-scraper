            "answer_text": "You didn\u2019t mention whether this was elementary, middle, or high school. I will assume elementary. Use the Dewey Decimal System. Separate books for your youngest readers to one area. Make sure the shelves are low enough for them to reach the books without help. Some libraries are sorting picture books alphabetically into bins on a low table allowing the kids can browse easily. Shelving can get taller as the grade level of the books gets higher. Have a cozy area where the kids can sit and look at the books to see if they really want to check it out. You need tables for those who are doing research or writing papers. If your school can afford it, include computers in the library with a searchable school library catalog and internet access for research. ",
