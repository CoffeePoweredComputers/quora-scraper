            "answer_text": "Simply said, 5G is widely believed to be smarter, faster and more efficient than 4G. It promises mobile data speeds that far outstrip the fastest home broadband network currently available to consumers. With speeds of up to 100 gigabits per second, 5G is set to be as much as 100 times faster than 4G. Low latency is a key differentiator between 4G and 5G. Latency is the time that passes from the moment information is sent from a device until it can be used by the receiver. Reduced latency means that you\u2019d be able to use your mobile device connection as a replacement for your cable modem and Wi-Fi. Additionally, you\u2019d be able to download and upload files quickly and easily, without having to worry about the network or phone suddenly crashing. You\u2019d also be able to watch a 4K video almost straight away without having to experience any buffering time. 5G will be able to fix bandwidth issues. Currently, there are so many different devices connected to 3G and 4G networks, that they don\u2019t have the infrastructure to cope effectively. 5G will be able to handle current devices and emerging technologies such as driverless cars and connected home products. But it must remember that these scenarios are all still theoretical, and it will take a lot of investment by governments and mobile network operators to make them work. The security aspect of 5G also still needs to be figured out. With a greater number of users and improved services, 5G opens the door to a new level of threat. Governments and mobile operators must ensure they have the correct level of security in place before 5G can be rolled out. ",

            "answer_text": "Do not assume that just because there is a 5G signal, your going to experience high data throughput rates. The theoretical speed of 5G is 20 gigabits per second, however T-Mobile and Verizon are reporting 400 and 600 Mb/sec with their early deployments. These speeds are being measured with virtually no subscribers sharing the bandwidth. WiFi 802.11ax is capable of 100Megabits/second however it\u2019s a limited range low power technology, impacted by interference, obstacles, and the throughput of the backhaul connection feeding it. We have all experienced painfully slow Wi-Fi when we have a poor signal or are sharing the bandwidth with other users. I only once measured the peak 100Mb/second theoretical speed of a 4G LTE network and that was 150 feet from a T-Mobile radio in Frisco, TX using a prototype device capable of MIMO or multiple in multiple out, which is where the device connects to multiple radios transmitting and receiving in parallel. In addition this test took place hours after the radio was turned on, and I was probably the only subscriber on the network. That same device only recorded 600 Kb/second on 4G at my home a few miles away, yet when connected to a 3G HDMA network achieved 4Mb/second. ",
