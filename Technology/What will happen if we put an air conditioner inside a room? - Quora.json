            "answer_text": "Question: \u201cWhat will happen if we put an air conditioner inside a room?\u201d The result of an entire Air Conditioner inside a room would be that the room would heat up (the temperature would rise). An air conditioner (as is a refrigerator, freezer, etc.) is a heat pump. Heat always goes from the hotter to cooler areas. To move heat from a room to an outside environment requires energy to pump the heat \u2018up hill\u2019 into a hotter area. The energy to do that is also exhausted. If everything is located in the room, the A/C takes heat to pump it from one side of the A/C to the other along with the power required to run the pump. The net result is a lot of waste heat is put into the room and the temperature goes up. ",
