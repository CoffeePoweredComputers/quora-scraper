            "answer_text": "Yes more or less.  The Most-3D-Printed 3D Printer That's a very much 3d printed, 3D printer. But you still need some non-3D printed things, motors, electronics etc. The other problem is that unless your first printer is a very expensive, metal 3D printer that can produce strong, accurate metal parts - your smaller printer will be much less capable than the original, as the quality of its parts will be lower than the first printer, which will have a metal frame etc. Self-replicating is a lovely idea, its a great concept, it has overtones of nano-bots and Skynet etc. It launched the home/hobbyist 3D printing industry worth many billions today, but in reality, it isn\u2019t really possible in the sense most people think. 3D printers are not living cells which divide and produce two functionally identical offspring.  The parts in orange are 3D printed. This is a version of the Prusa I3 rework. When I bought my first 3D printer the first job I took on was printing a set of spare parts, as much of the machine was made from 3D printed parts. However to make the most precise and reliable printer possible, I later made one with no structural or functional 3D printed parts at all, everything was manufactured by someone else in metal, I only used 3D printed parts just for panels and covers etc. Here is my all-metal 3D printer: https://reprap.org/forum/read.php?178,702599 ",
