            "answer_text": "No iPhone apart from the latest 12 models are equipped with the proper radios to enable true 5G, so to make it seem like your phone has it, carriers like AT&T will display \u201c5Ge\u201d (5G evolution) in your status bar. It appears in areas where 4G LTE technologies like three-way carrier aggregation and 256 QAM are available. These can make wireless networks faster if your phone supports them. In reality 5Ge is just a slight improvement over the regular 4G LTE and is nowhere near the speeds of true 5G. AT&T have been criticised both by the public and competing service providers for spreading misinformation, but they don\u2019t seem to care all that much. ",
