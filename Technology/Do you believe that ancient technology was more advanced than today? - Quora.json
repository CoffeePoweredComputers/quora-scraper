            "answer_text": "Do you believe that ancient technology was more advanced than today? There is a very useful saying: \u201cThe absence of evidence is not evidence of absence.\u201d, but it isn\u2019t always true There are certain things that a technologically-advanced civilization will ALWAYS invent. Concrete, stainless steel, petroleum-based plastic, aluminum, titanium, silicon boards, and other things. I specifically listed things that do not decompose, ever, and which can be easily recognized. Lets start with aluminum. Just like iron (and mild steel) rusts, and metal can oxidize. However, aluminum oxide is impenetrable to oxygen. Which means, if you make a thing out of aluminum, and then the surface of it oxidizes, the inside will remain completely pure. There will be only a thin layer of aluminum oxide over an interior that is pure aluminum.  I chose aluminum because (unlike iron) heat, gravity, and pressure, are not enough to purify aluminum. Frank Duncan's answer to How is the aluminium purified? To summarize: the ore (called bauxite, for some reason; which is a mixture of aluminum oxide and iron oxide, and sometimes other stuff mixed in) is dissolved in sodium hydroxide. The aluminum oxide dissolves, but the other stuff doesn\u2019t. Then some chemical stuff is done to make the aluminum oxide precipitate out of the solution. Then the aluminum oxide is put into a chamber with two carbon electrodes, and a very strong DC current is run between them. The electricity causes the oxygen in the aluminum oxide to move and bond to carbon from one of the electrodes, forming CO, which is then further oxidized into CO2. I go into all of this detail to show that it is absolutely, completely, totally impossible for any combination of lightning, volcanic activity, or anything else, to make pure aluminum. If we dig up even one single aluminum item, that would prove that ancient people were as advanced as us. \u201cBut what if they just didn\u2019t use aluminum?\u201d. Nope. Sorry, any advanced society would ALWAYS use aluminum. How many aluminum items have you been within 20 feet of in the past week (even in Coronavirus quarantine)? I would guess over 1,000. Because aluminum is REALLY useful. Immensely, unbearably, accept-no-substitutes useful. I would risk saying that any society which does not use aluminum is not actually advanced at all. And, as I said above, aluminum does not rust away. If there were advanced ancients, there is 100% certainty that they would have made things out of aluminum, and those things would still exist. We would be digging them up. But, even with all of the lots of digging that modern humans have done, for mines, for building foundations, for tunnels, for underground utilities, etc, we have never found a single piece of ancient aluminum.  Now lets talk about plastic. If aluminum is useful, plastic is 10x more useful. Think about how many plastic items you have in your house right now. That isn\u2019t an accident. They are there because you needed a tool to accomplish a certain job, and plastic was the best material anyone could make that tool out of. (Don\u2019t think that an Aquafina water-bottle is a tool? Storing and transporting water is a job, and it is impossible for a human being to do without some type of container, like a clay jug, or an iron pot, or a plastic bottle. Why do you think we are no longer using clay jugs or iron pots?) And, if aluminum is durable, plastic is 10x more durable.  If ancient societies were advanced, they would have left piles like this behind, for us to find. Not a bottle here and there, huge mounds like this. Plastic is just too useful to not use. People have been using bio-plastic for for over a thousand years. The three major sources are sumac lacquer, beetle lacquer, and cow horn. Of the three, cow horn was the most easily available, and decently useful, but not good enough. If you boil a cow\u2019s horn in water, it become soft, and you can bend and shape it, and then it will harden again when it cools. But you can\u2019t pour it into a mold. Sumac lacquer is made by boiling down the sap of the sumac tree, the problem is that this releases a horrible neuro-toxic gas. The technicians who did this suffered from horrible chronic pain, and gradually increasing paralysis, until they eventually died young. But the material was so valuable that people did that job anyway! Once you have boiled the sap down enough, you have a type of plastic which can be used to make all kinds of useful things, and reheating it to melt it after initial boiling is way less poisonous. Beetle lacquer, also called shellac, is made from the egg nests of the female lac beetle. She secrets this substance to lay her eggs in. The nests can be scrapped off of the trees that they are laid on, and melted with heat, to make a useful plastic. If you wait until the baby beetles hatch before you scrape up their nest and melt it down, you will have a limited amount of shellac for an unlimited amount of time. But in the 18th and 19th century, global demand for plastics grew so great, the people started harvesting lac nests before the baby beetles had hatched! The species was almost driven to extinction. Then petroleum plastic was invented, and the poor beetles were spared. Today their numbers have fully rebounded. Some amount of shellac is still harvested, for restoration work, and historical reproductions, and for people who just really like making things in the old style. Almost all of what is now harvested is used as finish for wood furniture. But there was a time when it was used for hundreds of different applications. An object made from any of these types of bio-plastic can last for 1,000 years\u2026 if you keep it dry, and out of direct sunlight, and don\u2019t cook it. But if you bury such an object in the ground, or let it sit out in a yard, or try to store it anywhere in a tropical climate, then it will rot away in a few years. But petroleum plastic is forever. The plastic bottle that you just drank 20oz of Pepsi out of could still be in existence when the sun explodes. You think that \u201cdiamonds are forever\u201d? Ha! A diamond is a mere blooming flower, fading before the frost, compared to a plastic gateraid bottle. Or electrical wire insulation, or pair of cheap sunglasses, or\u2026 the list could go on and on. If your romantic partner wants you to get them something that will last \u201cforever, just like our love\u201d, do go for a diamond, go to Home Depot and pick up 6\u2033 of insulated electrical wire. If your partner actually appreciates the joke, they\u2019re a keeper. All of this is to say, if ancient cultures had been advanced, they would have made a lot of stuff out of plastic, and most of it would still exist. But not only have we never dug up a single piece of ancient aluminum, we have also never dug up a single piece of ancient petro-plastic. Not one.  This answer has already gotten REALLY long, and I haven\u2019t even talked about concrete (Urbanite (Broken Concrete) Retaining Wall As A Garden Feature), or Stainless Steel, or Silicon wafers\u2026 Advanced civilizations make things that last forever. We can be certain that there never was one on this planet before, because if there had been, they would have left some of that stuff behind. ",
