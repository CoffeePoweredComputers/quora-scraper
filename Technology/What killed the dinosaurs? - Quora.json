            "answer_text": "This is a more complicated question than people think. Most people are aware that 66 million years ago, at the end of the Cretaceous Period, the world experienced a Mass Extinction. People commonly call it the \u201cExtinction of the Dinosaurs.\u201d But this is a misleading name for these reasons: 1. Most dinosaurs weren\u2019t even there. Dinosaurs first evolved 230 million years ago, and over time new species arose and old species died out just like any other organisms, for many different reasons. The end-Cretaceous wasn\u2019t even the first mass extinction dinosaurs experienced, although\u2026 2. The end-Cretaceous was a BIG event. Somewhere around 80-90% of life on earth died out, including all the pterosaurs, ammonites, mosasaurs, and more, as well as almost all of the corals, mammals, reptiles, and many more. Every living group suffered in this extinction, including the dinosaurs alive at the time, but\u2026 3. Dinosaurs survived. By the time of the extinction, one group of dinosaurs had already become small, feathered, flying animals we call birds. Nearly all the birds went extinct during the event, but some hung on, ultimately giving rise to the dinosaurs we have flying around us today. So what happened? There is some lively discussion surrounding this question, but for the most part the answer is quite clear. An asteroid hit. This is very firmly established, supported by all sorts of evidence, including a global layer of meteorite ash, and a 100-mile-wide crater. Below that ash layer are all sorts of fossilized Mesozoic lifeforms, above the layer most of them are gone. The shockwave, fiery debris, and tsunamis generated by the impact are dramatic, but not really the causes of the extinction. The ash and dust kicked up spread across the global atmosphere for months, reducing sunlight, which reduced temperatures and spelled bad news for plants. Struggling plants means struggling animals \u2013 the ecosystem collapsed and took almost everything with it. Was the asteroid the only factor? Maybe not. There was some pretty extreme sea level change going on at the end of the Cretaceous, and some very extreme volcanism happening in India, which would have released tons of ash and gases. How much of an effect did these other events have on the extinction? This is still under study. For now the best answer seems to be that sea level change and volcanic activity may have put stress on global ecosystems, perhaps not enough to cause a mass extinction all by themselves, but at least enough to make life a bit more vulnerable to the effects of the asteroid impact. For more information, here are links to a very technical and less technical overview of the science of the end-Cretaceous mass extinction. ",

            "answer_text": "Have you ever seen the movie Jurassic Park? Wouldn\u2019t it be cool if you could visit a theme park to see real dinosaurs today? Better yet, how awesome would it be if you could travel to certain areas of the world to see real dinosaurs still living in the wild? We can\u2019t do any of these things, of course, because all the dinosaurs are gone. Based upon the fossils of dinosaurs found around the world, scientists believe that all the dinosaurs \u2014 along with thousands of other plant and animal species \u2014 died off in a mass extinction event around 65 million years ago. What could have caused such a catastrophic destruction of species? That\u2019s the question that many scientists have been searching for an answer to for many years. Today, there is an hypotheses that scientists believe might explain what occurred.  The most popular theory is that Earth was hit by a giant asteroid, comet, or meteorite about 65 million years ago. Scientists developed this theory because they found a layer of the element Iridium, which is rare on Earth but plentiful in space, that dates back to when the dinosaurs went extinct. For years, though, they were unable to find evidence of such an impact on Earth. Then, in 1991, scientists discovered the Chicxulub crater, which is a massive 110-mile wide crater that sits along the edge of Mexico\u2019s Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula and extends out into the Gulf of Mexico.  To form such a crater, scientists believe the asteroid, comet, or meteorite would\u2019ve had to have been at least six miles wide and hit Earth at a speed of about 66,000 Kms per hour. Such an impact would\u2019ve released about two million times more energy than the most powerful nuclear bomb. The heat from the impact would have scorched Earth\u2019s surface, starting fires worldwide while at the same time blotting out the Sun as debris filled the atmosphere. Humongous tsunamis would have flooded large parts of the world. Shock waves could have triggered massive earthquakes and volcanic eruptions. The darkness could have lasted for months and even years, interrupting the process of photosynthesis and plunging the Earth into a deep freeze. Eventually, greenhouse gases trapped in the atmosphere could\u2019ve then caused another wild swing in worldwide climate, leading to the mass extinctions that occurred. Of course, it\u2019s impossible to test such theories\u2026and who would want to trigger another mass extinction anyway? Some scientists still hold other views and prefer other theories. As long as there remains an interest in dinosaurs, scientists will continue to search for fossils that may shed light on what exactly happened 65 million years ago! ",
