            "answer_text": "Unless you\u2019re working in tech, it probably doesn\u2019t make sense to live in the Bay Area. And, even then, if you don\u2019t have family here, nor entrepreneurship ambitions, you should try to look for a job in another location. Your lifestyle would be of higher quality. Pros of living in the Bay Area: The people. This is in first position for a reason: living here, you\u2019ll meet passionate, brilliant, high energy, ambitious, creative people from everywhere in the World. It\u2019s hard to describe how invigorating that is, and how much of a difference it makes in your life.The ecosystem. If your goal, short or long term, is to build a tech company, the Bay Area is probably the best place to do it in the US, or even in the World. Sure, your burn rate will be 2\u20133x than if you went somewhere else, but you\u2019ll also have access to a lot more capital, and talent.The salary. This one applies almost only to software engineers, and not to all of them. Sure, even the average salary for an entry-level engineer seems high here (~$110k), but that\u2019s counter balanced by California\u2019s high income tax, and the insane rent. Think $3k/month for a 1BR. But you can have a very high salary as a SE here (think $300k+ all included).The weather. It\u2019s very pleasing to live somewhere sunny all year long.Cons of living in the Bay Area: It\u2019s unsafe. I have a friend who got his car\u2019s window smashed every week, 4 weeks in a row. According to Neighborhood Scout, SF is in the top 2% most dangerous cities in the US. New York is in the top 27%. There are many neighborhoods in SF that are pretty scary, both at night and in the day.It\u2019s very dirty, and SF\u2019s homelessness is sky high. Not making any value judgment here, there probably are systemic issues etc etc, just pointing at a fact: there are about 10,000 homeless people in SF\u2019s 47 square miles. Passing by 2 people, passed out on the sidewalk, with needles in their arm, on your morning walk, having someone pantless, smoking crack on your subway ride, or sitting next to you and starting to masturbate when you take your coffee, are not the best experiences (not even talking of routinely stepping onto human feces).Also, SF\u2019s ideology can have you run into a lot of trouble if you dare even talk about this huge issue, like that time Twitter fired their head of VR, one day into the job, because they found out he\u2019d written a rant on FB 4 years before, about how bad homelessness had become in SF. This is the reason I\u2019m writing this post anonymously.Its infrastructure is crumbling. SF\u2019s roads are in such a bad state that all the shaking sometimes makes it hard to use your phone in a car. The city is inundated, and massive potholes form almost every year, when it rains a bit more than usual. In 2015, a three-story lamp post, made of iron, badly damaged by urine, collapsed onto an occupied car.It\u2019s expensive. I mentioned it before, but the rent and taxes are crazy high, which makes it impossible for most people to build a family here (the reason why there are so few kids in the city). The situation is mostly due to rampant NIMBYism, basically land-owners who have a vested interest in the housing supply being constrained, so it can not meet demand and sees its price appreciate, blocking all construction with stupid reasons like \u201cthe charm of the neighborhood\u201d or \u201cnot enough parking spots\u201d.It\u2019s monocultural. I, for one, working in tech, tend to like it. Anywhere you go, you\u2019ll meet smart engineers, working in big companies, telling you off-the-record stories about what they\u2019ve been working on, or the shady hack they used to go around an issue. But if you\u2019re not in tech, it can become tiring, very quickly, to meet almost only this kind of people.a cool thing about having coffee with a friend on market street is when a guy sits down next to you and starts masturbating\u2014 \u00e0\u00b2\u00a0_\u00e0\u00b2\u00a0 (@MikeIsaac) March 19, 2017\n ",

            "answer_text": "Why would you not move to Silicon Valley? Here are some cautionary bullet points, but I\u2019ll also include perspective on what makes it great below: Don\u2019t move here if you want to get rich quick. \u201covernight success\u201d here really takes a minimum of 10 - 20 years - if you get it at all.Don\u2019t move here if you want strong work-life balance. This is a place that emphasizes working hard - the joke is \u201cpeople here will work 80 hours a week (in a start up) so they don\u2019t have to work 40 (at a \u2018desk job\u2019)\u201dDon\u2019t move here if you want a good \u201cnight life\u201d. Sure there\u2019s great music here and plenty of good food + cocktails, but the bar scene and the club scene don\u2019t hold a candle to cities like NYC, London, Tokyo or even L.A.Don\u2019t move here if you like an active dating scene. I\u2019ve been out of the singles\u2019 game for a while, but what I remember - and what I hear still - is that everyone seems to have a chip on their shoulder, no one wants to compromise, and throw on top of that most people dress like they don\u2019t give a shit about fashion / looking good and it just makes the dating scene \u201cchallenging\u201d.Don\u2019t move here if you\u2019re intolerant. Just looking within 50 feet of where I\u2019m sitting I see white people, black people, asian people, mixed people. They are christian, muslim, atheist, buddhist and somethings I\u2019ve never heard of. You\u2019ll hear English, Spanish, Chinese, Hindi, Tagalog, Farsi, and any number of languages anywhere you go. If you don\u2019t say \u2018murica ironically, this place isn\u2019t for you.Don\u2019t move here if you like to smoke cigarettes. You can smoke weed on the street and no one will look at you twice, but smoke a cigarette and everyone will look at you like you just kicked a puppy.Don\u2019t move here if you don\u2019t like Tech. If you hate tech or tech culture, you\u2019re gonna HATE IT HERE.Here are some reasons to move here There is amazing opportunity. All the big companies are here, and there are startups everywhere where you can try new things, craft your skill and maybe even get lucky.There are brilliant people here. Sure some can be jerks, but that\u2019s everywhere. The reality is that some of the brightest minds in the world are here and you can learn new things just sitting at a coffee shop and eavesdropping, not to mention the challenge and inspiration that comes from working alongside certifiable geniuses.The day life is awesome. There\u2019s water everywhere, hiking, wine country, running trails, beaches and mountains / lakes a few hours drive away. The need to \u201ctravel\u201d for vacation is dramatically reduced if you take advantage of what\u2019s right next to you.The food is amazing. I\u2019ve been all over the world and had amazing food and it doesn\u2019t get better than here. Sorry NYC, I know you like to think you have better food, and I\u2019ll give you that your presentation is nicer, but you want farm-to-table Chinese food? you can get that next to the organic Mexican place that\u2019s across from the new pop-up restaurant featuring middle-eastern fusion tapas which does chicken and waffles at night. They're all delicious.Pot is legal. Enough said.The tech scene can\u2019t be beat. It saturates everything here and, if you\u2019re into technology and \u201cfuturism\u201d it\u2019s like living in a god-damn sci-fi novel sometimes.",
