            "answer_text": "There\u2019s a right way to do it, and there\u2019s a wrong way to do it. Currently, the majority of teachers have been doing it the wrong way, mainly because they are holding onto an archaic teaching methodology while simultaneously transitioning to the near-limitless opportunities technology presents in the classroom. I\u2019ll start with how technology is utilized incorrectly. Many curriculums nowadays are prewritten guides\u2014 created by a third party company\u2014 that usually come in the form of a textbook with an online access key where all of the assignments, quizzes, homework, and tests are packaged together and unlocked by the instructor throughout the period of the course. While this sounds convenient for teaching verbatim or textbook information, it reduces the teacher\u2019s relationship with their students, it removes the teacher\u2019s awareness of individual student learning deficiencies, it encourages an environment of isolated learning, and it promotes lazy teaching practices. If this type of teaching continues long-term, then I don\u2019t see teachers being a necessary job in our near future. Education is already very standardized, and from a capitalist perspective, I could have one teacher for each subject if all of the learning materials are prewritten and available online for every student. Above I mentioned \u2018archaic teaching methodology,\u2019 so let me explain before I transition to proper uses of technology in the classroom. These archaic teaching practices have encouraged weighted tests as the standard for determining a student\u2019s overall accomplished learning in a given subject. Again, this seems to be an efficient means for setting a standard of what students have learned, but it\u2019s been proven to be a poor method for learning retention. This has been known for some time, but only recently have teachers been able to opt out Midterms and Finals for weekly quizzes and discussions, both of which have proven to be better for learning retention. Using technology properly in the classroom can be better understood if we ask ourselves this one question: What is the purpose of going to school? The answer is \u2018to turn students into confident problem-solvers.\u2019 Or more eloquently put, \u2018To give the students confidence that they can solve any problem they encounter.\u2019 This seems obvious, and many teachers will believe that this is exactly what they\u2019re already doing, so, I would argue with this: If your teaching practices emphasize preparing students for college, then you are not creating problem-solvers: You are creating information absorbers, and in doing so, you\u2019ve neglected the learning potential of the majority of your students while prizing a few students that can regurgitate the information you\u2019ve been spewing. So, now that we understand the true purpose of going to school, it makes it easier for us to utilize technology correctly in the classroom. Since the purpose is to create problem-solvers, then technology should be utilized to solve problems. One of the easiest ways to do this is to get students to collaborate to solve real problems in their community. Have a student-run social networking group that involves multiple scholastic disciplines in order to overcome a communal problem. Perhaps students could interview local businesses, or create awareness groups for community or school events. While the above ideas are more large-scale, let\u2019s talk how an average teacher can use technology properly everyday in their classroom. Start off by building a rapport with your students. Ask them something funny or interesting they saw online, or show them something you find funny or interesting. Take a few seconds to look it up and enjoy it with your students. For teaching purposes, call on a student to look something up online and ask about the source of that information. Nowadays finding a reliable source is often more important than the information presented. Finally, there are plenty of ways for a student to get in contact with the teacher or other students. This is usually done through student dashboards, and should be heavily encouraged to engage in. The challenge for teachers nowadays is not to information dump on their students, they are carrying a computer in their pocket that has all information they could ever learn: Instead teachers should collaborate with other teachers to get their students to work together to solve problems they couldn\u2019t on their own. So, the best way to use technology is to remember that your job as a teacher is no longer to pass on all your knowledge\u2014the student already has instantaneous access to that\u2014 your job is now to get students to use their available resources to solve actual problems. If you can\u2019t find ways to turn your lessons into relevant problem-solving activities, and the assimilation of technology with education continues down its current trajectory of prewritten textbooks, quizzes, and assignments online, then the teachers of tomorrow will not be people, they will be computer programs.

            "answer_text": "Well I'm fairly biased. I teach computer science. So my class is a digital class. So rarely are we not on our computers. I teach them how to use the computer and code how to solve simple problems and then make it more difficult and then ask more open ended questions that don't necessarily have an end or answer in the back of the book. In fact i have no book. We use readily available online sites like W3Schools Online Web Tutorials, Wikipedia, CodeHS - Teach Coding and Computer Science at Your School CodeCombat - Coding games to learn Python and JavaScript Scratch - Imagine, Program, Share. These are all tools for the 21st century person. Much like wrenches are for mechanics. The technology enables them to learn about tech. But it's not tech for tech\u2019s sake. It\u2019s a tool to do hard things. ",
