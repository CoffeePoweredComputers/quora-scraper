            "answer_text": "Please excuse my vernacular, but\u2026 What the flying fuck are you talking about? Neuroethology has to do with the evolutionary study of animal behavior. Why would playing games have anything to do with this? The field barely touches on humans at all. And why specifically Cyberpunk 2077? The game isn\u2019t even out yet, so I\u2019m a little confused why you latched onto that one in particular. I\u2019m trying to take this question seriously, but it really feels like you just threw two things together and are trying to see what pops out. ",

Cyberpunk 2077 is a video game.Pretty colourful, most likely gracing subjects like transhumanism and \u201chow much can you cut off a human before it\u2019s not a human any more\u201d. And maybe a side dish of \u201cwhat can you allow a government to do\u201d but how does that connect to\u2026 Neuroethology - Wikipedia The study of how animals react to external stimuli and how they take up these stimuli?
