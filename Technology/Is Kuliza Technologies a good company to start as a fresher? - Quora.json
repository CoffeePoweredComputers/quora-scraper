            "answer_text": "I started my career with Kuliza itself and let me tell it is perhaps one of the best possible companies to start your career with. I joined in Feb 2013 as an intern, converted into full time employee in June 2014 and stayed till September 2013. Though my stay is very short (8 months), the things learnt there made me what I am today. Before joining Kuliza in February 2013, I had actually given up on pursuing a full time engineering career after my graduation. I had a very good percentile in CAT (~99%) and had offers from all the new IIMs and MDI (I had not applied to any school apart from IIMs, FMS and MDI). By the time I completed my internship, I was thoroughly enjoying tech and felt I could make a career out of it. Also, I didn't want to join anything less than IIM ABC. But I could have the courage to make that decision of rejecting the offers from dream colleges for many because I felt equipped enough to make a career in tech. I'd highly recommend anyone to just grab the opportunity. ",
