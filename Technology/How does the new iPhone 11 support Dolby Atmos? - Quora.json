            "answer_text": "I couldn\u2019t find a lot of good info on Apple\u2019s implementation specifically, but it looks like this is a combination of two things.  First, there will by audio enhancements using Dolby processing to make sound clearer and more balanced. Dolby became kings of the audio industry with their enhancement hardware, and later, algorithms, so I\u2019ve got plenty of faith that this will lead to solid improvements in audio quality.  The second element, Atmos support, takes a bit more to unpack. Atmos is an \u201cimmersive audio\u201d format. Well, really, it\u2019s lots of formats. In this case, it appears to be an implementation of Dolby Atmos for Headphones. To explain how this works, I\u2019m going to quickly dive into surround systems in general. A typical speaker-based surround system utilizes multiple speakers to create a sense of 3D directionality and verticality in audio. With an Atmos system you typically have a \u201c7.1.4\u201d setup. That means seven speakers around you for directionality, a subwoofer for bass, and four speakers above you for verticality. Your brain uses your two ears to determine where a sound is coming from. You can determine horizontal direction based on which ear a sound reaches first, but you can also determine vertical direction by how sound is altered as it hits your external ear and is channeled into your inner ear. That phenomenon can be faked for a user wearing headphones with a process known as \u201cHRTF\u201d (head-related transfer function). Essentially, software processing fakes the way sound moves around your head and external ear to create an artificial 3D soundfield which you can listen to as \u201cbinaural\u201d audio. It\u2019s actually a pretty practical technology, but it has two downsides. First, everyone\u2019s ears are different, so \u201cHRTF\u201d processing generally uses an \u201caverage\u201d ear, so the effect doesn\u2019t work for everyone, and has varying degrees of effectiveness for those who can hear the effect. The second issue is that the soundfield is basically \u201cglued\u201d to your head. As you move your head, sound sources will still be coming from the same direction relative to your ears. With a 7.1.4 system, the soundfield will remain the same as you move your head. The upside is binaural audio is backwards compatible with stereo headphones and doesn\u2019t require specialized hardware (like an expensive 7.1.4 system). Overall, it\u2019s a good way to get immersive audio into a portable device. Dolby isn\u2019t the only one working with this technology; Sony is also introducing immersive music with 360 Reality Audio. ",

Here\u2019s an article on what that means for your phone audio - Dolby Atmos comes to iPhone 11: here's why that\u2019s good and bad Your results will vary, however. You should notice an overall improvement in audio quality, but it\u2019s hard to say if the difference will be staggering, even if the content you\u2019re watching is actually encoded for Atmos. ",
