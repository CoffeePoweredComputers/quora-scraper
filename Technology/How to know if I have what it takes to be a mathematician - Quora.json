            "answer_text": "Go for it! What I remember very well from studying maths is  the process of getting used to complicated ideas. I always imagined doing maths as an orderly process: you step through the arguments of a proof step by step, then you have understood it, and you are ready to move on. No need to study, really. But that is not really what happens most of the time. Rather, you gradually get used to the difficult concepts. Eventually you look back and things that seemed impossible suddenly seem easy. Now I wasn't the very best mathematician at university. I did OK, but maybe (probably) there are really some extreme maths geniuses out there. I've seen a lot of really good people also putting in a lot of time, though. I guess that's not only being more diligent about homework, but a general mindset. Like if you stumble across an interesting problem, you just take a shot at solving it, for fun. Over time you accumulate more and more tools for tackling difficult mathematical problems, and you become a genius. Actually I think that is how everything works, not just maths. I suck at art, but I think in theory I could become good at it. But I am not sure if it's possible to force oneself to be interested enough. For example I think I would have to look at a shop sign and go 'that looks interesting, I wonder what font they used'. Over time I would accumulate a mental library of fonts, colors, styles and so on that I could put together to design nice things. But so far, while I like the idea of being good at design, I am just not interested enough to wonder about it all the time. Perhaps a way to cope is doing actual projects, then being on the lookout for fonts I could use to complete that project. Might be the same for maths: maybe if you have some problems in your mind that you'd like to solve, you automatically start collecting tools that could be useful. ",

            "answer_text": "You sound like you'd be great as a math major. Many people come to math in their 20's. You aren't behind. And the fact that you also excel in writing, languages and social sciences can only be good. (Languages are on the left side of the brain.)  aYour \"being good in everything\" will make you better in math. You'll understand the applications better. Really smart people are good in lots of things. I have a BS and an MS in math. I also have minors in English and psychology. And I love to read. You sound like me. Good luck as a mathematician! ",
