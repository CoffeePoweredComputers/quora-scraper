            "answer_text": "Short answer: They are not easy for most people to use but you probably have the potential to learn the skills if you\u2019re curious enough to ask the question. They are not as easy as a desktop paper printer: there are more steps than plug and print. Stay Curious: When I first started a decade ago I had no formal electrical, 3d modelling, software or programming training. All I had was deep curiosity. Now I own 2 printers, I\u2019ve built another from parts and I\u2019m custom designing my fourth. I\u2019ve created a course in 3D printing and I\u2019ve 3D printed the majority of the gifts I\u2019ve given in the past few years. I\u2019m saying this not to impress you but to impress upon you they are tools you can learn to use. Detailed answer: \u201c3D printers\u201d is a catch-all category that covers a wide variety of technologies that make an object by adding material. There are printers that you purchase as a kit and assemble/wire/program yourself. They require technical skill to assemble properly (and safely). They also require skills to use as refining the code to match the printer is usually necessary. For pre-built printers there may be quality/design issues that need upgrading. Most consumer affordable printers benefit greatly or flat-out require upgrading. There may be connection issues in getting your printer and your computer to \u201ctalk\u201d to each other. These issues are usually minor. Assuming you\u2019ve done your research and found a printer that meets your needs and it arrives properly assembled with effective software you will still need to know how to use slicing software to turn 3d computer models into programs your printer can print. From there, you will need to be able to load/remove the print material and deal with jams, feed issues etc. If you\u2019ve read this far I recommend you find a local \u201cmakerspace\u201d or \u201chackspace\u201d or library/college/university with printers and try to get some one-on one time with a printer (with supervision). Better yet, if you have a friend with a printer or two, ask them to show you how the whole thing works. I hope this helps! ",

            "answer_text": "I absolutely abhor the term \u201c3D printer\u201d for exactly that reason. The term itself sets users up for failure because they go into 3D printing with the wrong assumptions. Then they have a bad time of it and nobody benefits.  When you hear the word \u201cprinter\u201d you think Lexmark. Easy to use and quick. Select file, press print, walk over and get print. Everybody knows how to use it because there\u2019s nothing to know. You don\u2019t need to know anything about how toner binds to paper to use it.  This is more in line with the reality of 3D printers. Do you know how to use that thing? I don\u2019t, but I can tell you it\u2019s nowhere as simple as that Lexmark. 3D printers are CNC machines. The machine they\u2019re closest to would be a 3-axis mill. They\u2019re not easy to use, but at the same time they\u2019re not hard or impossible to use either. You just have to go into this with the right set of assumptions. If you go into this thinking \u201cLexmark\u201d: You\u2019re going to have a bad time. The correct mindset is \u201cI\u2019m investing in a machine and I\u2019ll need to invest in myself if I want to make this work\u201d. To best invest in yourself, learn Autodesk Fusion. Lars Christensen\u2019s Absolute beginner series will get you going pretty quickly. Take your time, do the lessons, rewatch the videos and think about how objects in your life break down into basic shapes. Ideally, do this before buying a machine. Once you buy your machine you\u2019ll be printing lots of cubes and blocks. You\u2019ll be calibrating the machine and learning how different settings affect the final product and how different materials behave. This takes time. Don\u2019t dive into really complex things you found on Thingiverse as your first print. Namely because there\u2019s a 40% chance any given model on Thingiverse is complete trash. If you don\u2019t know what you\u2019re doing with the printer, you won\u2019t realize the model is trash and you\u2019ll think the problem lies in your printer. If I haven\u2019t scared you off, learn Fusion and buy a printer. It\u2019s a ton of fun. Design things for your life and make them. Take your ideas off the napkin and make them real. ",

            "answer_text": "It very much depends on the printer, your ability and what you intend to print. Something like the new Prusa i3 Mk3 is about \u00a31000 pre built if you are just downloading models from something like Thingiverse it would probably not take you long to master the basics. However if you intend creating your own models with a CAD package and you have never tried any 3D modeling your probably not going to find it anywhere near as easy. Printers can be as cheap as \u00a3130 if you are prepared to go the kit built route and have an engineering bent. There is a lot of help on You Tube. I would consider a 3D printer on a difficulty level comparable with using a bread making machine where you know the ingredients but not the quantities. Where the instruction book could well have been written by someone who has a limited understanding of your language. Here the internet can be your friend most of these machines have a fantastic support community. The printer I first mentioned that Prusa is probably one of the easiest with one of the best written manuals out there and even the Kit version has an excellent build instruction manual. I have computing degree and spent 10 years as a motor mechanic in the RAF I bought and built an Anet A8 from a Kit (\u00a3130) using the on line video and instructions. While I have found this an interesting exercise it still took me a day to build and I am still learning the finer details of using the printer. I would however not consider it difficult but I could see it as challenging and interesting. ",

In particular, design of 3D-printable stuff is much harder than most people realize, and a large fraction of the designs out there are flawed in various ways. Basically, the printers themselves are not that hard to use, but the software toolchains are not very good for novices. ",

            "answer_text": "TLDR - No. There isn't such a thing as a fully consumer 3d printer. Some machines are nearly there but quite expensive. You'll still get much more out of them the more you understand 3d modelling, slicing and the printer itself. Other machines are very reasonably priced but you'll need to be much more involved to be able to get good results. It's a less steep learning curve than it was 3-4 years ago when I first gave it a go. The machines will print with fairly minimal modification and setup, although might print really well with a little tweaking. 3D printing though is a hobby a bit like golf, flying, boating etc it can begin to take over your life. You can make a living out of it if you want to. It's rewarding and challenging. ",
