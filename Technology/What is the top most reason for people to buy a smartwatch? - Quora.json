            "answer_text": " 6 Reasons Why You Want To Buy A Smart Watch Right Now Prada mini Kumari 11 shares 1 K views Gone are those days when the only thing watches do was say the time. Over the years, technology has advanced and why would watches be left behind? The term ' smartwatch' is rather self-explanatory. For all the right reasons, smartwatches have achieved enormous popularity among millennials and fitness freaks over the last few years. And let's not say they too are trendy. Sure, I guess you have to wonder' why would I be interested in anything like that? Well, quit worrying because there are six explanations for wanting one for yourself. 1. It can be about more than just saying the time. It's a no-man. You know how conventional watches tell you the time and maybe the date and year, but that's all about it. Oh, it is not going to be the case if you have a smartwatch for yourself. Smartwatch provides many apps. You can get notifications, answer messages, set a reminder, pick up or decline a call, and much more. 2. There are countless customization possibilities. One of the key aspects that smartwatch owners particularly enjoy is the fact that there are quite a few customization options. Mobile watches are available with changeable wrist bands these days. If that's what you hear, let me remind you that most of the smartwatches come in different types, sizes, and styles to choose from. Let me explain. If you're going out for dinner, for example, you should strip the sporty wrist band and put them on a comfortable one. Woohoo! Who! 3. So they don't require any batteries. Many regular watches do have batteries, so you'll have to buy new ones when the batteries fail. It sounds like a challenge because not everyone has the resources to go to the store to purchase new batteries to bring them on. Smartwatches have a clear edge in this respect. Yeah, you guessed it correctly. Nowadays, smartwatches are rechargeable which is pretty cool. If the battery is about to fail, all you have to do is charge your phone. Pretty easy, huh? 4. It's perfect for doing boring things. Another cool attribute a smartwatch possesses is that they attach to your computer. Notifications may be received, quick short messages written, an alert system or even a reminder set up. There's a host of things you can say, and fiddle with. They are like little machines, to make your life even easier. 5. They are best placed to keep your ass off the couch. It doesn't come as a surprise that smartwatches have begun to concentrate on exercise to keep it important. Most smartwatches come with a sensor for motion monitoring, a heart rate monitor, a sleep tracker, and more. They are like Fitbit devices and can also do a bit of multi-tasking. 6. Well, they're pretty cheap, sure. Often simplicity plays to your benefit. Buying a smartwatch isn't going to melt a hole in your wallet or save you a penny. Just inside Rs 1,500 to 2,500 you can buy a decent smartwatch which is very amazing considering the kind of features it has to deliver. What does it say? Upvote if you found helpful ",
