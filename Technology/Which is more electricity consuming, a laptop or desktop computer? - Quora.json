            "answer_text": "Hi there, Thanks for the A2A. Everything is relative they say. And it is quite relative for this question too. Generally speaking, desktops do consume more power due to larger fans, larger processors, larger GPUs. However, here comes the relative part. If you compare an Acer Predator 21X laptop which needs 2 separate 330W power bricks and compare it to a decent 450W desktop, then the laptop takes more power than the desktop. But, that is just comparing numbers. Power draw depends on what is going on. A laptop playing a game at maxed settings will be drawing more power than a monster PC that is surfing the net or sitting idle. Needless to say, the same desktop playing a game would then surpass the power consumption of the laptop. So it is all relative. The answer will depend upon what parameters you specify for the comparison. However, looking at your average laptop and desktop, the laptop does consume less power. I hope this helps! Cheers! ",

            "answer_text": "Consumption of electricity is derived from the set up which one system has to go through for being manufactured . Simply put the out put and the internal set up determines the amount of electricity that is to be consumed . AS for the case of desktop they do come with 7 star rating stating energy efficient and so on yet there are PC which have hydro cooling system and so on inbuilt in them which consumes more than 3 to 4 laptops combined on the contrary there are laptops with high end specs like the predator series and alien-ware series which consumes more power than any average laptop or desktop . So in a short laptops are more energy efficient than PC Regards ASD ",
