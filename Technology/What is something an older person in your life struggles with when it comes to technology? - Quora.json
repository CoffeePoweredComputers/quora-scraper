He can\u2019t see that his children and (in particular) grandchildren who will be left with the house will suffer reduced usability and potential selling price as a result. We\u2019ll leave aside the fact that he\u2019s also had the house Heritage listed, so selling it is even less possible now. Now that he has no landline, he\u2019s reliant on his mobile. He\u2019s in the habit of only ever turning it on if he needs to use it. Don\u2019t bother trying to send a text message, though: He never reads them. ",

But us old folks have never been, then, wham, suddenly our whole worlds have changed. We can\u2019t be as savvy or up on things, we try just to make a phone call or text.
