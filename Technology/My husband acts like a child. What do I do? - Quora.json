            "answer_text": "First off it is probably good to accept your own responsibility. My guess is that he didn\u2019t just suddenly start acting like a child so you either married him knowing that was an issue or you married him before you really knew him and should have dated him longer to really learn what you were getting into,. It is who he is and he isn\u2019t likely to change. You need to ask yourself if the good outweighs the bad. The truth is we are all human and all have flaws and no one is perfect. If you have had kids with him I would suggest for the good of the kids is you live with it until your kids are grown and out of the house. That would be the time to decide if the good outweighs the bad. Just keep in mind that the grass is not always greener on the other side of the fence. ",

You cannot change him and he\u2019s an adult so whatever he\u2019s doing he thinks is working for him. If you cannot live with an adult behaving this way, tell him and go from there. Either he\u2019ll chose to do things different or he won\u2019t. You are not powerless. ",
