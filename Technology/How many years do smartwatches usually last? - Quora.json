            "answer_text": "In my honest opinion, Smartwatches can only last as long as the interest of the user. Once it is obvious to the wearer that any inconvenience outweighs the usefulness of the smartwatch on his wrist, the user will search for a more convenient smartwatch with an equal or greater, better group of Functions. In my experience I first bought a cheap AS2 smartwatch, with a white silicon strap for the experience. It soon revealed itself in need of daily recharging because of the color screen, and the proprietary, white silicon strap discolored and turned yellow from use. The metallic coating on the two buttons came off quickly. This smart watch lasted less than two months until I found another.  My next smartwatch was the HYBRID Titan Steel, using two batteries. One driving a stand alone quartz watch, and a rechargeable battery for the Smart portion circuit board which used a b/w LCD screen for text display. Why the analog display? I can tell the time within a one second glance. The strap was black rubber, long lasting and exchangeable. A good plus function was that it vibrated, and notified the user if BT separation or reconnection took place. But the charging was every four or five days. This watch lasted me six months, and was satisfactory.  My next acquisition was The Fossil HYBRID Grant Gen.2 Steel. I am still wearing this two years from the date of purchase. The main reason is that there is NO CHARGING necessary, as it employs a USER-REPLACEABLE CR2430 Li-ion battery that lasts over seven months, and i have replaced batteries twice already, in a couple minutes without losing data! This too certainly helps with sleep analysis, as i can wear the watch 23 hours daily. However, because the dial is that of a normal watch, and notications are by the pointing of the hands, there is no text display digitally. The original strap was brown leather, and I use washable NATO straps in its place.  It certainly is a small evolution knowing how to use a smartwatch. Although it's been two years on my wrist, (Fossil has since gone to Gen.5) i have not found one better. However I still look for newer and better functions, like the Withings Move ECG, which has NO notifications, being just an activity or sport and health  monitoring smart watch. I will have to wear the Withings on my right wrist, while my Fossil stays on my left wrist! Therefore, my first statement stands. Smartwatches last as long as the user finds it's still convenient to use! Agree? ",

            "answer_text": "The short answer is: 2 to 3 years or less. The long answer: The rechargeable battery inside the smartwatch will last 2 to 3 years or 300 to 500 cycles, like every other lithium-ion battery. It's the first thing that is going to fail. As for the electronics inside, noone can predict gow long it will last. Maybe 5 years, maybe 30 years. It's not going to last forever of course. It's important to note that the more you use the smartwatch, the wear and tear is greater, so the electronics is going to wear down faster. It's also important to note that when the battery wears out, it isn't going to be worth and economically acceptable to change the battery, so usually it marks the end of the smartwatch and it needs to be disposed/recycled, whatever the law in your country tells you to do.
