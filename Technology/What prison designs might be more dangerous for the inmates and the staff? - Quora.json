            "answer_text": "Older prisons are, as a rule more dangerous. If you look at a really old prison they were constructed in stages that lead to problems. The original cell block is constructed. Typically cells are stacked on top of one another two or three tiers high. There is nothing else. So when prisoners are let out they have to be gang chained together.  That is to prevent a mass escape or a riot. Next the prison added an outer building over the inner cell block like this  This allowed inmates to be released en mass without having to chain everyone up. Next everything was redone again when plumbing was installed to replace the \u201cHoney buckets.\u201d Now behind each resized cell was a plumbing chase to allow for access to service the water and sewer lines. Next towers and fences were installed outside. So now you have a prison originally built in the 1850\u2019s or 1860\u2019s. Rebuilt again later in the 1880\u2019s and finally again two more times. Out buildings for Trade Shops, repair shops, academic education, and administration are added. A secure yard with Guard Towers are finally included The prisons final design leave all kinds of places where staff can\u2019t see what is happening. For the inmates that means you have to carry a weapon around most of the time just for self protection. It took some time but now the older prisons, out in California and Nevada have been downgraded to house lower security level inmates. The newer prisons have taken over the Super Max/SHU duties. Why not just tear them down? San Quentin has been in existence since the late 1850\u2019s. All kinds of contaminants (Lead paint, petroleum products, solvents, etc.) have been dumped on grounds. To make the site available, removing the top soil and transporting it to a safe landfill makes the project cost prohibitive. So you can downgrade the security setting and house less risky inmates OR you can shut it down and let the place just sit. ",

            "answer_text": "In the late 1950\u2019s the new Penitentiary of New Mexico floor plan was considered \u201cstate of the art\u201d. It was called the telegraph or telephone poll design. There was one long corridor that ran the length of the prison with \u201cbranches\u201d all along the way. The idea being that you could move inmates from one location to the other (dining, hospital, school, gym, visiting, library, etc.) quickly and efficiently. Master Control was right in the middle and had a view of everything. From the beginning there was nothing but problems, example: they couldn\u2019t keep the prison gangs apart. It all came to a head in 1980 when a group of inmates in one location were able to take complete control of the whole prison in less than 30 minutes. For 3 days law enforcement just stood outside and waited till the inmates gave up (mostly because they had gotten hungry and were tired of rioting). After that all the prisons were designed so that if the inmates managed to take over one area they would be isolated so they couldn\u2019t take over the rest of the facility.   ",
