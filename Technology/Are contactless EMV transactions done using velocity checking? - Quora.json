            "answer_text": "Contactless EMV transactions make use of velocity checking on both merchant terminals and cards to reduce risk of financial losses on both sides: Merchant terminal as to ensure that maximum number of offline transactions are processed before synchronizing them to the TMS platform \u2026 Amongst amounts, POS velocities, merchant acceptable capabilities (contactless MC but not Visa or vice versa \u2026 hello PSD2!) these checks also ensures that if terminal is physically destroyed, only the last couple of contactless transactions are lost and not the whole business day(s)\u2026This is to reduce risk to the merchant banks and to prevent losses from the merchant. Worst case scenario Walmart loosing 1 day of Cardless transactions \u2026 (completely hypothetical) EMV cards have scripts embedded in them that contains lots of velocities especially for offline transactions. Depending on the issuing scripts, the card product and the issuing bank\u2019s platform capabilities, the scripts may be very advanced and specialized\u2026 The basic one ensures that velocities per amount & MCC are enforcedThis is to protect the cardholder and the issuing bank\u2019s liability \u2026 imagine BOA surprise when all their cardholders performed only Cardless transactions on the same day \u2026 (completely hypothetical) Other reasons to use velocities are to risk/fraud/balance related for obvious reasons. Hope this helped. ",
