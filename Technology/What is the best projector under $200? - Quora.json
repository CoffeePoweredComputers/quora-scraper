            "answer_text": "How To Choose Best Projectors Under $200. Here are some things to consider. Brightness (Lumen) The brightness of the image displayed by any projector depends on the amount of light it gives out. To avoid getting muddy and soft images, the best lumen degree is always sought after. So, whenever I walk into the shop to get a cheap 3D projector, one of the first places I focus on is on the ANSI Lumens rating. Here, I ascertain the amount of light the projector can throw out. For my home theater projectors, I start considering from 1000:1 ANSI Lumens. Anything lower than that does not make sense to me. If it is higher than that, it would be great, as far as other features are great too. When considering this, I also factor in the size of the room, the size of the screen I want to use for the projector, and the room ambiance light. Bigger rooms, longer distances, and rooms with more ambient light will demand higher ANSI Lumen. Contrast Ratio  This is another important area. This is the feature that adds more flavor to what the brightness of the projector gives. When you have white and black images on the screen, the ratio between both of them is named the contrast ratio. So, I definitely want to have my whites very white and my blacks very black. That is why I go for the highest ratio here. In fact, this is what makes the images appear superb. If there is not the much clear cut demarcation between the colors, you will have blurry and washed patterns. I guard against this by going for projectors with up to 2,000:1 contrast ratios. 1,500:1 can also do in dark rooms. Resolution and Aspect Ratio The resolution centers on the density of the pixel, expressed as native resolution. As said here, the number of pixels for the DLP and LCD projectors is fixed. Now, the way to get the best out of this is like this; for the projector, I intend using to view more of HDTV contents, I scout for the highest native pixel count available. Here, something between 1920X1080 will do. When it is mostly for DVD contents, I could do with pixel counts around 1024\u00d7768. Elaborately, the native pixel requirement for 720p HDTV signals is 1280\u00d7720 pixels, while that of 1080i HDTV is 1920\u00d71080 pixels. Those who want to be using this with their Blu-ray disc player should have no problems going for native resolutions of 1920\u00d71080 native pixels. But if for any reason, you want to try the 4K projectors, you would have to study the set up to see the best pixel requirement for you. The aspect ratio centers on the width of an angle to its height. The projectors with 4:3 aspect ratios are best for business purposes and are more compatible with a computer set. Those with 16:9 aspect ratios are the perfect machines for projection of DVDs and for home cinema and games. However, the 16:10, which are the best for business projection on computers with bigger screens, have also been discovered to offer brighter images when used at home than the home cinema models. so, one may be tempted to go for this, depending on how sure the person is about the unit and the amount of brightness the person needs. Projection Technologies The two major technologies for most of the best projectors under 200 of this caliber are the liquid crystal display (LCD), and the digital light processing (DLP) technologies. They come with different strong and low points and I consider these before shopping. You should too. The LCD model, for instance, works better in well-lit rooms, offers brighter colors and sharper images for data and graph presentations and does not produce ghosts in 3d images. They are also more energy conserving and a bit quieter. If these are your concerns, go for this. However, the DLP projectors are mostly more compact and lightweight, and therefore more portable. They work with HDTV, Blu-ray and DVD sources too, and the motion videos are smoother, especially for action scenes. Their black colors are deeper and truer than in the LCDs and the color contrast is higher too. Consider these while choosing. Cables and Connectivity Technology Another point I consider so well are the sources of connection for the new product, and the cables that will do the work. Suffice it to say that majority of the new units come with the HDMI connection technology. But this will also require a wireless dongle to connect it. So, will the projector come with the dongle or would I have to spend money to get one after buying it. Does it come with the VGA and DVI input methods too, because time will come when these will become necessary? The USB connection system is also very essential, and not only that, projectors that come with two USB and HDMI ports are preferable. You will also be getting more value if the older sources of connection are also involved. Things like composite and S-video input systems for analog sources may come handy someday. So, the best projector under 200 with more sources of input is always better for you. You will also be better off with units that come with the connection cables where necessary. The AC/DC and the USB cables are the basics. Fan Noise This is one thing I give huge consideration. Projectors will always have the fan that will work to alleviate the heat that will come from the lamp as it works. Considering the fact that the best low priced generator is still an indoor unit, you will always want something with reduced noise. Projectors that generate less heat like the LED types make less noise. But even among the LED projectors, some make lesser noise than others. So, to avoid being distracted by the noise while enjoying the movies and games indoors, I always look for those whose noise-canceling effects are superb. I do not go for the projector whose fan noise is louder than that of my laptop. So, I ask, check, and crosscheck for the technology used, and how low it brings the noise. I also consider the place I intend to position the projector at home. The unit that will be in the small kids room will definitely demand less noise, while the one I will place in the larger sitting room, may not need to be ultra-quiet. Audio System This is another important consideration to make when you are shopping for the best projector under $200. Now, one thing you should understand is that projectors are not televisions. While some may come with inbuilt stereo speakers, some may not even come with any speakers at all. If you are using this in a small space for a few people, the inbuilt speaker might be okay. But if not, you have to get an external speaker. Whatever the case is, the best projectors under 200 with inbuilt speakers and room for external speakers are better. You lose nothing by getting one. Screen Size This is another thing I put into serious consideration when shopping. If you have a screen already, you must buy a projector that can give you quality images when paired with the type of screen you have. If not, you should purchase a screen in consideration of the projector you are purchasing. If you have, for instance, a 1080p projector, or products of higher resolution, you must get an HD screen. This is to avoid pixel distortion and to ensure that optimal clarity is achieved. ",
