            "answer_text": "It is likely to be quite challenging, but it's not impossible. I live in a developing countries, so I can say that you might take these points as consideration: Makes sure it\u2019s useful, even though the technology is not so sophisticated. People in developing countries prefer the function than sophistication. At least it can help people do the basic things.Make sure it's not complicated to use, and provide manuals in local language. I saw many awesome techs around with some cool features, but don't seem to be popular. It is simply because it is difficult to use, or requires some technical skills to operate it. It will be helpful if there is a manual for your tech, why? Because it is not only helpful for the user, but also it is a must to provide those manuals according to the government.Promote it. Surely, you have to do it. I always see tech (mobile phones) ads everywhere. And if you ask me about the brands, you will probably don't recognize it. So, if your tech is relatively new to the customers in developing countries, you will need to promote it, so people will also know your product. Let alone there are likely to be many competitors around already.Make sure it is affordable. For many cases, it surely has a significant factors by the customers to take in to consideration. People in developing countries are likely to have a lower income, so they are taking price as a serious thing before they buy the tech.I believe that those points are quite important in case you are interested to provide technology to developing countries. Hope that answers your questions. ",
