            "answer_text": "Well unlike gas cars, you rarely \u201cfill up\u201d an EV from empty to full. Instead, when not on a trip, you just plug in at home like you would your phone. You could do this every day, or with a Tesla, even every several days. But when you are on a trip, that\u2019s when Superchargers come into play. But even then, the strategy is to stop at a Supercharger when your battery is at a low state of charge (SOC) and then only charge long enough to get to your next expected stop. The reason is that batteries charge much faster the closer to empty they are. For this reason, you are typically not \u201cfilling\u201d up at a Supercharger, but usually just sticking around for 10\u201315 minutes which charges from maybe 10% to 60%. So maybe a better way to think about your question is how much does it cost to go on a trip? The actual costs will vary based on the location of the Supercharger, as electricity rates (and laws concerning how they are charged) vary. Since I\u2019ve had my car, I\u2019ve gone on two road trips that have required Supercharging. The first was a trip about 250 miles each way, with no charging available on the remote end (so I did need to Supercharge). Starting with a full battery, it cost me $2.72 for just enough charge to arrive at the far end, albeit with a pretty low battery. I then spent $12.54 total at the remote end which was enough to drive around for the weekend plus have enough to get me all the way back with 25% left in the battery. On a second trip of about 300 miles each way, but this time staying at a hotel that had charging, I paid $7.35 for the one way trip, and then $7.14 on the return trip. So for those two trips, I drove about 1100 miles total (actually I would throw in an extra 100\u2013150 for local driving, so maybe 1250) and paid a total of $29.75. ",

            "answer_text": "It varies by State for a Tesla Supercharger. I had not had to use one for my first ten weeks, but, yesterday I took a several hundred mile trip. I was surprised how expensive it could be. I forgot to charge up the night before and I was almost on empty, yesterday morning, having driven for several days and not charged each night. So, I stopped at two different places for a half charge each time, the total for the two charges was $16.10 for an approximately 85% charge, so $19.00 for the full 310 miles. I am in Illinois, where the charge is 24 cents per kWh. Tesla apparently applied for a statewide tariff in each State and the charges vary from 21 cents to 25 cents per kWh in states where they pay for energy consumed in kWh and for those states where pricing is in cents per minute (Texas, Vermont, Kentucky, Wyoming and a few others), charges are on two tiers: 24 cents per minute for greater than 60kw and 12 cents per minute for charging at below 60kw rate. I believe the average cost is the same at $18 to $20 per 100% fill up. At home, I pay .0475 per kWh, 24 7, so it only costs me $3.80 per total 310 mile fill up. There are those whose home electric rate is twice that, and some who pay half that between 11 PM and 4AM. The Model 3 has a charging start time so you can charge during those super discount periods if your utility company offers discounted rates or special rates for alternative vehicles. My daily cost for the last two months has been $1.50 per day for my 100 mile round trip commute, which at $2.25 per gallon and 22 miles per gallon, was costing me $10 per day. So, I am saving about $220 per month charging at home. EDIT TO ALLOW FOR CURRENT PRICES: As of July 1, 2019, Illinois doubled its gasoline tax to 38 cents per gallon, and overall prices went up 48 cents per gallon since January, so at the new $2.92 per gallon price, my savings per month has increased from $220 per month to $320 per month!
