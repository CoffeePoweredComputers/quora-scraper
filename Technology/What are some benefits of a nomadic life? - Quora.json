            "answer_text": "The biggest one is total freedom. You can stay if you want to or go if you want to. You can travel fast or slow. You can live wherever you want to live - and leave if you feel like it. It\u2019s a lifestyle full of choices. The second largest benefit is financial security. Assuming you have a stable job, freelance career, or business, being nomadic means you can choose where you spend your time. And choosing where to spend your time means you can choose to live in places where your currency goes farther, places that are more cost effective. If this is a priority for you, the savings of living nomadically or, at least, moving abroad can be substantial. My lifestyle in Denver, CO, would cost me $2,500 - $3,000. In Croatia or Mexico or Italy, it costs less than $1,500. Same quality of life; very different cost. Other benefits include: :: When you vacation, you aren\u2019t paying double bills. You aren\u2019t paying rent in your \u201chome\u201d city while you\u2019re also paying for an apartment in the Italian countryside or Paris or Croatia. :: You can visit friends and family more. Assuming your friends and family don\u2019t all live in one spot (mine don\u2019t), being nomadic actually makes it more possible to spend time with everyone instead of just seeing the people within a small radius. :: You\u2019ll meet tons of people from lots of backgrounds. :: You\u2019ll have access to more international business opportunities. If you network in person all over the globe, chances are you\u2019ll pick up clients in different places. :: It\u2019s easier to make it to conferences all over the world (it\u2019s cheaper to attend a conference in Barcelona if you aren\u2019t buying round-trip tickets and paying for rent and bills back home at the same time) :: You\u2019ll be constantly learning :: They say travel promotes creativity I\u2019m sure there are tons more - but you get the gist. And don\u2019t forget that, like any other lifestyle, nomadic life has its downsides too. At the end of the day, you have to figure out what kind of lifestyle works best for your individual values. If you value being deeply rooted in community, volunteering weekly at the library, and seeing your parents every weekend, nomadic life is probably not the lifestyle for you. If you value new experiences, constant learning, and freedom of movement, it may be a good choice. ",

            "answer_text": "I guess these are your ultimate \u201cescape artists\u201d \u2026 being grossly responsible for \u201cone and only\u201d\u2026..without being condemned for llving a selfish self-centred life. On the other hand, it could be an amazing way to grow and develop independance as you grow in handling responsibility when there is no-one to help out or share the responsibility. From watching people surviving alone in the Wilderness of Alaska (the world\u2019s only remaining true wikderness ) and nomads of the deserts I noticed people with a different mindset and a determination to survive . However, nomads dont put down roots and i guess then that they don't either have the same ties or obligations of other people and life is all about living and daily survival. Is this an advantage?? Depends on what you value. I guess too that there is a difference between a nomad (in the high hills in Summer and the plains in Winter) and a migrant who is moving for humanitarian reasons. The one is motivated by tradition of lifestyle and the other by negative circumstances. ",
