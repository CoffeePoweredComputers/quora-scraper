            "answer_text": "\u201cHow much math is involved in computer science? I\u2019m an average high school student, is that OK for computer science?\u201d Getting a computer science degree leads to a career as a software developer (usually) or a computer science professor (more rarely). You can have a perfectly good career as a software developer without using any math beyond high school algebra, and even that isn\u2019t needed all the time. Some parts of the computer industry are math-heavy (e.g. CAD/CAM, graphics, AI) but most are not. Being a computer science professor needs a lot more math: you have to prove theorems about what problems are computable, and upper and lower bounds on running time. Being an \u201caverage\u201d high school student is actually more of an issue. Computer science is usually considered one of the hardest majors on campus, and the students who succeed at it are usually bright, hard-working, and have good study habits. If you are average in high school because you are coasting, that could be OK, just be aware that you will have to raise your game. If average is your level best, then you might want to look at other majors. This is controversial, and politically incorrect, but what I have seen in my career. There is a talent for writing software: hard to define, easy to recognize, rare, likely innate. The best indication that you have the talent is that college-level programming courses are easy and fun, and you can\u2019t understand why your classmates complain and struggle. So by all means try it: you will know pretty soon if programming is right for you. There is no shame in not having the talent: most people don\u2019t, including most smart and worthy people. ",

            "answer_text": "Earlier answers are pretty accurate. Computer Science IS offered under the Math Faculty of many universities, under the Engineering Faculty in some, and in its own Faculty in others. There is a significant math component. I\u2019m adding to their answers that you should be smart and good at problem solving. If your \u201caverage\u201d is because of circumstance you can change, and you do change, you will be fine. If you are doing all of your homework, all assignments, and don\u2019t get \u201cblocked\u201d or something on exams. don\u2019t aggravate your teachers, and are still scoring in the middle of the pack, you might not have the *stuff* for a computer science degree. Only you can decide that. As encouragement, many people get a thing about math in high school. Specifically, trig, algebra and calculus. Sometimes, there is a LIGHT BULB moment when that goes away. Sometimes people just work over and through it. Sometimes they never get over it. I knew a 22yr old woman with an IQ over 140 who would blank and act like a 2yr old if you asked her to multiply 11 x 10. Blocks happen. The kind of math you need to actually do CS isn\u2019t necessarily trig, algebra and calculus. You\u2019ll learn lots of neat tricks about how to represent ideas and information, how to manipulate ideas. The good news is, some of that will come naturally and be very easily. The other news is, some will be a challenge. For universities who are \u201cgive everyone a chance\u201d universities, the mininum High School average for admission is typically 75%. So\u2026 if you are a problem solver, good thinker, like ideas, procedures, understand the way things work, it might be the career for you. If that is frightening or you don\u2019t think you could manage those things? Maybe not. BTW, people think Computer Science is all about ideas, information, machines. In fact, MUCH of a career in Computer Science is about people. Understanding their needs, explaining new ideas and techniques for solving problems. There is a huge amount of interaction. It is a good career. You make a living, and get to help people a lot. Good Luck! ",
