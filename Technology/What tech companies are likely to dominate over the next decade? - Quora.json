            "answer_text": "Depends on what you mean by large. The really big ones like Facebook, Microsoft, Google, Apple, Samsung, etc, are too big to fail in that time period. Look at how long it took for Motorola and Nokia to fail and they are still around in some form.  I could see a lot of so-called tech unicorns failing in the next 10 years. Uber, Twitter, LinkedIn, etc. However, they will get acquired before they simply disappear, as would any other large tech company, and will remain in some form. I could see Amazon having some serious problems in the next decade if they don't diversify and move into higher margin business, but Amazon Web Services provides a decent backbone of profitability to give them some longevity.  If I had to pick one, I would say Yahoo!. Again, it will likely be broken up and the pieces picked up by other companies, but it is the most likely candidate.  ",
