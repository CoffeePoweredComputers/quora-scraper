            "answer_text": "I've already answered this in the negative. Cristal Kelly's answer to What was the most traumatizing school experience you had? But here, I'll address which teacher had the most positive impact on me. The one which was most negative was also the most impactful. But I have had wonderful teachers and they have also shaped who I am. When I was in middle school, I joined the band. Our band director played the French horn. When we started band, he played every instrument and allowed us to pick whichever one we wanted to play. Well, when he picked up that horn and blew through it - my soul vibrated. The sound of French horns still moves me to tears today. That was what I had to play. Needless to say, I endured much hardship for my art. When I made the transition from elementary to middle school I determined that I did not want to go to the school that all the yuppie kids from my neighbourhood would be attending. I chose to go to a magnet school. It's because of my enrolment in the band, that I was permitted to stay. But the kids wouldn't let me on our overcrowded bus with that big thing. The bus driver, sadly concurred. So, I walked to and from school so that I could play that instrument. There were many times I envied the flutists and clarinet players with their lightweight accessories. I walked the first two years. Three miles each way to school. When I was in middle school I was still a very tiny person. In eighth grade, I was only 5\u20323\u2033 and weighted 85 lbs. this thing was as big as I was. So I balanced it on my head and walked that way for the first two years. I simply couldn't carry it any other way. In eighth grade, I finally got a bike, it was like my doorway to freedom. I put the handle over one handlebar and pedalled away. It was at this school that I participated in gifted. It was in the gifted program that I was exposed to photography, typesetting, and computer programming. But it was the band and Mr. R who affected me most. Because I was in the band, I got to go on trips. This was the first time I had ever been away from my family. Quite frankly, my family was pretty dysfunctional, so this was a highlight of my existence. Because I had no money to pay for trips, I was always the top fund raiser. I learned very early how to earn my way in. This was an important life skill. Mr. R was also the first person in my life to die of AIDS. I remember the heartbreak like it was yesterday. I can tell you exactly where I was, just like when the Challenger exploded. Without this time in band, I wouldn't have learned to read music. I taught myself how to play many other instruments: including piano. It's one of the most relaxing and enjoyable things in my life today. Because of the band, I got to travel to all kinds of places. I got to see The Smithsonian museums in Washington. Because of the band, I flew on my first airplane. Because of the band, I made a friend or two in school (I wasn't really socially adept). So, Mr. R\u2026 if there is a heaven, I know you're there. You made my life much less of a hell. ",

            "answer_text": "Though my career will be in English and theatre, my most influential teacher was my computer skills teacher. In junior high school, I competed in the National History Day competition, where students put together a presentation on a historical topic. My sister had done it when she was in junior high, so naturally I followed suit. My coach for this was my computer skills teacher, Mr. W, who was the quirkiest teacher at the school (he would embrace the title). He was known for having a large number of ridiculous hats, and ties for every occasion. He made a lot of puns. Naturally, we were friends. He spent countless hours outside of school working with me on my projects, which got me to the national tournament two years in a row. He was at the school until maybe 5 or 6 each night working with students. He invited kids to his house on weekends to work. He was always smiling. He was 100% devoted to his students. About a year after I left junior high, I found out his wife had been diagnosed with brain cancer. Terminal. My heart stopped. If there were any justice in this world, bad things would not happen to good people. Loving people wouldn't get cancer. That's not how it should work. But, it does. He kept in touch. We saw him for lunch a few times. We visited with him at his house, and his wife at hospice. No matter what, he didn't stop. He kept teaching. He couldn't be as present as he was before, but his love for his students didn't end. We went to her funeral, donning red instead of black in honor of her never-ending love of strawberries. He kept teaching. He found solace in the support of his students, just as many students had in him when parents had divorced, or relationships had ended. Now he's retiring and heading off to Hawaii with his girlfriend. He told us that he's getting an apartment with an extra bedroom in Hawaii, so that anyone can come stay with him anytime. He says he's getting better every day. His impact may not have been entirely in education, but in resilience. He never quit caring for students, even as his life became more difficult and even when many people would've given up. He's got the biggest heart of any teacher I've ever had, and I'll never forget that. Mr. W, this is for you. Thank you for everything you've done for me. You've had more of an impact on students than you could imagine. ",

            "answer_text": "Mrs. F was my high school graphic design teacher. It was the first day of school abd I was a junior. It was also my first day at my new school. I was awkward, nervous, and uneasy. Hell yeah I was glad to be away from my awful Islamic school I previously went to, but would this be better? Mrs. F calmed my nerves as soon as I heard her gentle voice. She was very motherly with me and would hug me at random times, which made me feel very loved. I looked at Mrs. F as my school mom. She\u2019d always compliment and appreciate my artwork and would hang them up in class as examples. In her class, the students worked at their own pace and soon, I buzzed through so many assignments that she often ran out of work to give me. She would let me skip class or skip in her class, which was great. She\u2019d give me spare art supplies when she cleaned out her supply closet every now and then. She\u2019d draw grids (which I hated doing) on my posterboard papers, not because I asked her to, but because she genuinely loved me and cared about me. She\u2019d bring donuts for the class now and then, but would let me have an extra one. Through her many kind gestures to me, she told me that I was one of her favorite students. I could go on and on about Mrs. F, but sadly I don\u2019t see her anymore. I graduated high school two years ago and only got to visit her once. I keep in touch with her through text but it\u2019s not the same. She\u2019s the mother my mother couldn\u2019t be and I made sure she knew. Someday I hope we see each other again. ",

He obviously had a wide range of knowledge, but more importantly: practical knowledge. It all made sense. He helped to stimulate my interest in science and made if easy for me to decide to attend a college like MIT. And, looking back, he taught science as part of Engineering, which was made it so great. However, not to dismiss my other teachers, I had wonderful teachers in English, History and Mathematics. Many of whom I had for two or three years. They all made attending our public high school something we Looked Forward to doing each day. ",
