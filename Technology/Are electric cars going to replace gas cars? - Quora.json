            "answer_text": "Considering that the UK is considering banning the sale of new petrol and diesel vehicles by 2040, I would definitely say yes. However: (I must warn you, I\u2019ll incite a war by saying this against two types of people who, if I\u2019m honest, are ignorant to their own causes most of the time hence my explanation below): Battery (BEV) and Hydrogen Fuel Cell (HCF) vehicles are all \u2018electric vehicles\u2019 (use a medium to convert to electricity to drive a motor) but people \u2018don\u2019t see\u2019 the benefits of both right now, which I believe is distrupting the pace of how quick we can change to EVs which either way, is definitely considered better for the environment and also our airways (NOx emissions and soot etc) As people had said before, the pace of change in battery technology means we can have longer range BEVs (>200 miles) and with mass production also increasing rapidly (think Gigafactory), we can also reduce the $/kWh as well meaning affordable vehicles on the masses. These vehicles will be perfect for the vast majority of commuters which only need a vehicle for A to B, as well as mostly replacing ICE vehicles as long as the charging infrastructure However, I still believe that some people are not seeing the clear advantage of HCF vehicles being within product lineups: the ease of refuelling. I see this being a clear advantage to HGVs, business drivers etc which, I understand in niche applications such as taxi companies that current BEVs do work, that the \u20185 minute fuel up\u2019 is certainly the main reason why people, at the moment, will not buy a BEV. with HCF you can, and probably always will be able to do whereas with current charging infrastructure, this is quite difficult, if not impossible. Current charging standards like Chademo provide 50kW and CCS provides up to 100kW which at full speed (unlikely achieved during the entire charge session) would mean a Leaf or the Ioniq would take, at a minimum, 25 minutes or so. There are talks to boost this up to 300kW however at that point the grid infrastructure would need to be looked into more carefully when one car charging is the equivalent to 150 kettles. Just to clarify, I\u2019m not trying to discredit BEVs, I personally want to be a part of the development of them because I can see it geniunely is the future for the vast majority but what I\u2019m trying to say is, sometimes society does become blind about the options we have and \u2018putting all our eggs in one basket\u2019 is not the optimum solution. Sorry for my lengthy explanation, I thought it would be benefitial to at least include the alternatives if I was going to say EVs will replace gas vehicles. ",

            "answer_text": "It is very easy to calculate that: They will not. All over the world there are more than 1 bn cars around at the moment. As far as I know the current production rate of cars right now is about 75 million cars per year. So, if all car manufacturers would stop making ICE cars by tomorrow (what they definitely will not do) and start making EVs at the same rate they used to make their ICE cars before (what they absolutely cannot do) it would take a whopping 15 years to make enough cars to replace all current ICE cars. Right now the worldwide sales of EV cars reach about 1% of the total car sales, so it will probably take another decade (at least), util the majority of all new cars made on earth are EVs. Currently in Germany the average age of a car is some 8 years. The average price of a pre-owned car is about 12,000 USD. So it is not only a question of making millions and millions of cars, it is also a question of making them so cheap that even those can afford them who drive used cars right now. Currently I drive a car which cost me 5,000 USD four years ago. Even if Tesla would decide to lower the price of the Model 3 to 25,000 USD, I simply could not afford to buy one. I would have to wait until it is five or six years old. Cars are not like smartphones, they are more expensive and they live longer. Just imagine houses: If somebody would invent a new, revolutionary housing technology, how long would it take to tear down all houses and rebuild them? ",

            "answer_text": "Absolutely. And it\u2019ll happen quicker than most people realize. Battery Electric Vehicles (BEV) are much simpler than Internal Combustion Engine (ICE) vehicles. Your typical ICE has about 2000 moving parts. A BEV has about 100 moving parts. With a BEV, there\u2019s no oil or lubricant to worry about; the only fluid that needs replacing is windshield washer. There\u2019s no gas tank; instead, the batteries lie in a \u201cskateboard\u201d configuration along the bottom of the car, lowering the center of gravity and making the car much safer. BEVs have more storage and more room for passengers. ICE vehicles are only about 20\u201330% efficient (conversion of potential energy to actual power); the rest is lost as heat. BEVs are more than 80% efficient, which more than makes up for the lower energy density of a battery compared to petrol combustion. BEVs have linear acceleration since there\u2019s no gearbox or clutch or shifting from one gear ratio to another. They have regenerative braking to recharge the batteries. They need almost no servicing or maintenance (which is going to radically change the car dealership model.) With all the research going into battery technologies, the price of batteries is steadily decreasing. Tesla is already reporting manufacturing costs below what some experts were predicting in 5\u201310 years. Battery degradation is basically a non-issue. Tesla Model S owners typically report 1\u20132% degradation in the first year, then maybe a \u00bd% per year after that. After 10 years, the batteries should have well over 90% of their original capacity if properly cared for (which is easy.) There are Tesla taxis in Europe that have already driven over 300,000 miles with no problems whatsoever. And the batteries themselves are 99% recyclable. Beyond passenger cars, dozens of companies are working on other vehicle types from electric buses with enough power to run all day, to short haul delivery trucks, to long haul Class 8 semi-tractor trailers, to heavy mining machinery. All of them will eventually be electrified. Some people still claim that BEVs pollute the same as petrol and diesel vehicles because coal and natural gas fire the power plants used to generate electricity. But this is a straw man for two main reasons: first, it ignores the fuel needed to deliver petrol and diesel to gas and refueling stations, which is not required for electricity being delivered to chargers. Second, it ignores the accelerating movement to close coal and natural gas plants and switch to solar and wind power, including storage technologies to handle peak loads. All these reasons explain why almost every car manufacturer is rolling out BEV plans and concepts, why major cities are moving to ban the use of ICE vehicles on certain days and times, and why major countries are looking to ban the sale of ICE vehicles in the next 10\u201320 years. And switching to BEVs across the board, and to solar and wind power for generation, will be a primary driver for reducing human-caused climate change and finally taking control of global warming. With the current exception of the US, every country realizes what a serious problem is global warming, and how clean energy offers a straightforward solution to these problems. People don\u2019t realize what a major sea change this is. The internal combustion engine has reached the end of its useful life; there\u2019s no way to make it significantly more efficient, cheaper, easier to manufacture, less polluting (without cheating; see \u201cVW Dieselgate\u201d) and more reliable. BEV technology beats ICE on every one of these evaluation criteria. ",

            "answer_text": "I would say without a doubt. Will it take time? Yes. But already more and more electrification is being added to the drivetrains of various vehicles and the components of the internal combustion engine are getting more and more complex to meet government efficiency requirements and remain competitive on efficiency with competing technologies. This adds to the cost, while the main cost driver for electric vehicles, the battery, has been on a steady decline. It is said that when the cost of Li-ion batteries falls below about $100/kWh that EVs will be on cost parity with internal combustion engines. Then economics will take over. The most recent cost we\u2019ve seen quoted is $145/kWh for the batteries in the Chevy BoltEV. Just 6 years ago when the first mainstream EVs started to hit the road, costs were in the $350\u2013400/kWh range, so you can get an idea of how fast they are falling. You will probably be able to continue to buy gas vehicles, but they will cost more to buy, cost more to operate, cost more to maintain. Once this tipping point happens, the demand for the lower cost alternative will drive dealers, and carmakers, to provide the lower cost alternative. Also keep in mind that some cities have already banned ICE vehicles from certain districts, and entire COUNTRIES are moving towards banning gas vehicles in the future: Norway by 2025; The Netherlands by 2025; Germany by 2030; India by 2030. While these plans may not come to fruition on those timelines, the trend certainly is towards the end of the gasoline era. ",

Electricity is being produced at cheaper rates and from various renewable sources. This would make electric cars cheaper than petrol cars to buy as well as run. Electric cars have very few moving parts as compared to a petrol/diesel car. This makes maintaining them easier and less costly. Thus, electric cars are becoming more and more practical. This means that people would prefer buying electric cars over petrol/diesel cars. The rising cost of fossil fuels would only add to this. Petrol powered cars however won't be completely eliminated. Petrol as a fuel will only be limited to supercars manufactured by a limited number of manufacturers. People would never be able to get over the \u201cfeel\u201d of a petrol powered supercar. The noise and the drama of a petrol powered supercar. No doubt these companies will have electric variants too. But a supercar without a petrol engine doesn't make sense to me and all the petrolheads in the world. Long live the Lamborghini V12!! ",

            "answer_text": "In recent years, new car-making forces have appeared one after another. Chinese and foreign traditional car companies have also released ambitious plans for electric vehicles. The call for banned fuel vehicles has been on the rise, and the car's electrification seems to be out of control. Just a few years ago, whether it was a brand or a model, it seemed to be just a few, almost all familiar, such as a few treasures. Not long ago, the integration and mergers and acquisitions of the automotive industry were limited to the optimization of production capacity within the automotive industry. Under the new thinking of today's automobile development, new brands and new models are constantly emerging. The Internet-style propaganda campaign has been wave after wave. The auto industry practitioners have flowed like never before. The cross-border capital of the non-automotive industry has been combined to make the automotive industry Have a new understanding. Japanese auto steel thin steel, European and American car burning oil and so on are no longer the subject of car news, instead of choosing a fuel car, hybrid car or electric car; people discuss the problem also added the car range, electric car spontaneous combustion, electric Car safety and other fresh themes. Electric cars should not replace fuel cars From hybrid electric vehicles, plug-in hybrid vehicles, pure electric vehicles to hydrogen fuel cell vehicles, automotive electrification is gradually becoming the main position of automobile driving power. In addition to the hybrid electric and electric vehicles, other models are revered as new energy vehicles, and the protagonist is certainly a pure electric vehicle. As an intermediate product of the transition phase, plug-in hybrid technology is being adopted by major car companies, especially joint venture car companies. Volkswagen, Audi and Toyota have all introduced plug-in hybrid vehicles. BMW even uses plug-in hybrid technology as the direction for the development of its new energy vehicles. In the global pure electric vehicle field, the current Chinese brand is still the absolute main force. By 2020, pure electric vehicles newly developed by multinational auto companies will be listed one after another. Toyota, Volkswagen and other auto companies have launched a new and impenetrable layout in the electric vehicle market. In the process of car electrification, the traditional car companies attacked the new forces of the car, and then ignored the electric car. Due to the countermeasures against the \"double points\" policy, the change of power system, such as plug-in hybrid and oil-to-electricity, has become the main measure of traditional car companies. Electric cars should not replace fuel cars The new forces that have fully invested in electric vehicles, whether Tesla, Weilai or Xiaopeng, use pure electric vehicles as their only power route. In the process of continuously improving the cruising range, the automatic driving assistance technology The intelligentization of the car represented has made great progress. Not long ago, mainstream electric vehicles made people dare not look directly. The traditional vehicles of Beiqi, Chery, and Jianghuai oil-to-electric low-end electric vehicles are just changes in the power system, and the cruising range is in the 300-kilometer range. The emergence of new forces in the car has lifted the cruising range to a range of 400 km, and at the same time commercialized the in-vehicle intelligent system. After the traditional car companies entered the electric vehicle market, BYD, GAC and Geely further increased the cruising range of electric vehicles to 500 km. The new forces of Wei Lai, Xiaopeng and Wei Ma immediately followed up to improve their battery life. The new pure electric SUV Aion LX, which will be released by GAC New Energy, will increase the cruising range to 600 km. It is believed that in 2020, the cruising range of 600 kilometers will be expected to become the mainstream cruising range of pure electric vehicles, further narrowing the cruising range of cruising mileage to a minimum, leaving the layout of the remaining charging piles, charging power and charging speed of the battery to be solved. Electric cars should not replace fuel cars Overnight, the electric car seems to have become homogenized, the same cruising range, the same automatic driving assistance system, the same intelligent cabin design, except for the difference between the appearance and the interior, it seems to be the same. Each brand is a new player in electric vehicles, and the same is true in brand recognition. It is also so unreliable. The long battery life claimed by electric car companies seems to have no small deviation in the daily use situation, regardless of the model, or the different use environment and driving habits. Who can achieve stable car quality, true cruising range and high cost performance, who can get the user's brand recognition, but currently there seems that no car company can achieve such a goal. Driving Mercedes-Benz on BMW, Volvo's safety performance, Toyota's stable quality and energy-saving fuel consumption, in the fuel car era, each brand has its own characteristics. At the moment of electric vehicles, the new forces of making cars are more radical, but they are quite questioned by the market in terms of quality stability. The quality of traditional car enterprises has time to endorse, but they are self-styled in terms of intelligence. Intelligentization is the biggest advantage and characteristic of electric vehicles compared with fuel vehicles. In the electric vehicle companies, it is necessary to realize differentiation in intelligence, and the stability and safety of intelligent systems are the basis. It is a rapid update iteration of the system, or a seamless integration with life, is a development direction. Electric cars should not replace fuel cars Every brand is on the same starting line. Whoever can get the user's approval and gain a foothold in the electric car market is still unknown. Undoubtedly, electric vehicles are not meant to replace fuel vehicles, but to open up a whole new market in the process of development and improvement. In the process of electrification, traditional car companies need to reshape their brand image, and the new forces of car construction need to step by step, from scratch to create brand characteristics. Whether it is dilapidated or new, or starting from scratch, it is not an easy task. It depends on who can truly grasp the development trend of the market, understand the real needs of users, and achieve the balance between users and products. In 2020, the car will usher in a fully electricized moment, whether it is plug-in hybrid or pure electric. Always remember that electrification is far from an end and not a goal. The car is electrified, and then there should be then. ",

EV is very quickly turning into the Affordable Care Act in the sense that we are going to be forced into buying it regardless of if we want it. Nothing like the government deciding what's best for us because they know better. And then likely taking our tax dollars to build infrastructure to shove the idea further down our throat. I believe in the free market, and right now the free market says, as a whole, EV is a niche market. I think here in the USA I will have another 15 yrs before I start to routinely see EVs out in the country where I live. In my utopia the increase of EVs on the road is great because that should drastically lower fuel costs, which means I can go back to daily driving my Suburban without caring about fuel costs. ",

There was talk of trying to make it Compulsory for an Electric Car to be recharged at a an approved recharging station and to be \u201cIllegal\u201d to be recharged from a normal household supply. They wanted it to cost the exact same amount of money to refuel a petrol car including Tax as it would to recharge an Electric car including Tax. They were going to fit an unobtainable plug to the electric car so as it could not be plugged into any other power source except an approved Charging station. There was talk of it costing like $50.00 to recharge an electric car. There was No Mention of any Solar recharge being implemented. I am unaware of the location of any charging stations in this country at this point in time and I don't think that I have ever seen an Electric Car on our roads. Maybe they are out there but as I said I am not aware of any. As an aside Last year the biggest selling Car in Australia was a \u201cToyota\u201d 4X4 One Tonne Twin Cab Pick Up with a 3 litre diesel in it. So \u201cIF\u201d the Majority of US want to drive around in a 4X4 one tonne pick up then it is certainly a long way from becoming totally Electric in my humble opinion.

Already, many nations have announced outright bans of the sale of gasoline, diesel, and LPG vehicles starting as early as 2025 and no later than 2040. These include India, China (the largest auto market globally), Japan (the third largest auto market globally), South Korea, Taiwan, the EU auto market nations (Denmark, Sweden, Norway, Germany, France, the Netherlands, Spain, and Portugal), and Costa Rica.

Manufacturers, dealers, gas and oil companies, independent mechanics, governments etc. All of these lose money if electric cars become the norm. Of course governments will tax electric cars differently, so they won't worry too much. Electric cars don't pay road taxes through gasoline purchases. So the question is whether Tesla, a little car company with billions of dollars can beat the trillions of dollars behind these companies that will lose their businesses to electric cars. I believe John DeLorean was setup. And probably because he wanted to build cars that last for 30 years. At that time cars only lasted about 100k miles.

Many factors have an impact on demand such as cost. To date, EVs are more expensive. This will change in time but the demand has to be there to impact supply which will drive down prices. Inside of the demand conversation, we have to look at what people want/need. I drive a Smart Electric Drive. It has a real world range of 60 miles and gets down in the 40s in the winter. Most people would scoff at driving a car with such limited range. Beyond that, the MSRP of my car was around $27,000. I bought it used and would have a hard time paying that much for so little car. While the industry is growing and making advancements left and right, it just isn\u2019t at a place where a complete cutover could happen, nor should it. For better or for worse, our energy companies are a part of our global economy. Giving them time to ramp down and change is important to economic stability.

Another question I have is back in 1967 my parents bought a house and is was being said that all electric homes are the way to go and electricity will get cheaper and cheaper. So in the next decade or so how can we be sure that those charging stations they put up all over aren't going to start costing us very large amounts of money to recharge our environmental friendly vehicles? Claiming the huge price tag for charging is because we don't have a cheap friendly way to generate all this new electricity we now need just to get to work everyday. My bill for providing this house with power goes up every year per Kw. Won't EV's suffer the same problem. Wouldn't surprise me if the car companies started providing the power to charge our cars just to make the all important dollar. I haven't seen any posts about how much it costs us at home to charge that EV up every night. Here it's 18 cents a Kw so to charge a drained 300kw car would cost $.18x300=$54 per full charge on my fixed income. Everyone acts like the electricity to charge these comes free of costs. ",

            "answer_text": "\u201cKeeping in mind that electric cars are prone to catching fire; will electric cars ever replace gasoline or diesel powered cars?\u201d Let\u2019s start by evaluating the statement that prefaces your question. Here\u2019s a helpful article from CNN that provides some data that refutes your assertion: Are electric cars more likely to catch fire? Per the article, based on data on Teslas, the rate of fires is 5 per billion miles traveled, vs. 55 per billion miles traveled in gasoline cars. Admittedly, the number of miles traveled in gasoline cars is orders of magnitude higher, so there are probably pretty big error bars around the electric car numbers, but the early data points to EV\u2019s being at least no more likely to catch fire than gasoline cars. Beyond that, as the article goes on to explain, gas fires are typically more dangerous than battery fires. Battery fires tend to start slow, and will always start in the battery, whereas fuel fires can result when fuel leaks onto other surfaces, or even (in the case of gasoline) from vapors reaching an ignition source. While both kinds of fire are equally destructive to the vehicle, battery fires typically give occupants more time to notice the fire and escape. If there is a downside, it\u2019s that a driver might park an EV in his or her garage not knowing that the battery is damaged, and have a fire erupt inside the garage later. In conclusion, fire risk is certainly not a disincentive for adoption of EV\u2019s, and may over the long term help drive adoption and even save lives. ",

Over time, engineers have explored for different strategies to power our cars. trendy strategies embody gas-powered vehicles running on hydrogen fuel cells, however making gas fuel cells takes the maximum amount of energy because it expands, gas fuel isn't essentially sensible or efficient. Most yank vehicles square measure battery-powered by combustion engines: Gas or diesel goes in, little explosions power pistons and switch a rotating shaft, the automobile moves forward, and greenhouse gas goes out. however, a growing chorus of environmental activists, business analysts, and car executives square measure predicting a shift as powered electrical vehicles grow in quality.

Not many drivers will use more than a tank full of petrol on a daily basis, and for those that don\u2019t (the vast majority of drivers) it is more convenient to refill with electricity at home while they are sleeping. And they may only have to do this once a week, same as for an IC car driver - but he has to queue at a petrol station, perhaps in the pouring rain to refill! Be assured - there is no putting the genie back in the bottle now! ",

Granted, several people are willing to wait 30~45 minutes to refill their cars with electricity for free, so road-tripping in an electric car is gaining popularity, but again, the fact remains there are still people who\u2019d rather spend dollars instead of minutes filling up quickly, and those people are always going to buy gas cars instead of electrics. Also, no one yet makes an affordable electric convertible, so that\u2019s still what I\u2019m waiting on. ;) ",

You can figure that even when/if electrics become mainstream enough that new models end up predominantly electric (never mind entirely electric), it will be 50\u201380 years before gasoline models disappear completely. Because not only are they just that reliable, but the second-hand market for used vehicles going for much lower than the cost of a new vehicle will keep them around, and being maintained, until the few surviving vehicles become showroom pieces, rarely if ever driven.
