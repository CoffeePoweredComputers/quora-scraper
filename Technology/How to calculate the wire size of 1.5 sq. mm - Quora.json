            "answer_text": "Inside 1.5 sq mm wire there are 22 strands and each strands thickness is 0.3mm To measure the size of 1.5 sq mm wire first count the number of strands inside the wire. Which is equal to 22 Then measure the width of the wire by micrometer correctly it is about 0.3mm correctly. This way we calculate the size of the wire ",
