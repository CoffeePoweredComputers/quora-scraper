            "answer_text": "You don\u2019t need to feel that you can\u2019t lead a successful career just because you don\u2019t like talking to people. There are many careers in this world that involve minimal interaction with other humans. You can look at the following: Engineering: A very popular career among those with a logical and technical bend of mind. If you like solving problems, are good with numbers, and have good analytical skills, you can give this career a go. There are numerous fields in the realm of engineering, with varied degrees of interaction required.Commerce and Accounts: This is yet another career domain that doesn\u2019t entail too much interaction with people. However, you need to have an exceptional numerical aptitude, along with the perseverance to work with huge amounts of data and numbers all day. You can look at various careers in this field such as a chartered accountant, company secretary, chartered financial analyst etc.Actuarial Sciences: It involves risk-assessment for insurance, banking, finance etc. A career in actuarial sciences won\u2019t require you to interact with people much, yet it would again involve dealing with huge amounts of numbers and data. You should have a strong hold on maths and statistics, as well as a love for numbers, in order to be successful.Ethical Hacking: This can be a very exciting career for many, and doesn\u2019t require you to deal with people at all. Ethical hackers are very much in demand these days, as companies are more concerned than ever about their network security. To hold a successful career in ethical hacking you would need to have a strong logical bend of mind, and would need to be very well versed with programming languages, coding and computers.Research: This is a broad domain, and can include research in any kind of science, be it physical, environmental or biological. Researchers working in laboratories and in the field hardly have any human interaction. The number of fields you can look at for specialization are huge, including food and agriculture, microbiology, chemistry, geology etc. These would of course require you to have the right scientific aptitude and a fondness for the specific field.You can also read this article that I wrote: 6 High-Paying Fields For Those Who Don't Like to Talk!

Each of them demand different types of skills, traits and aptitude in order for you to hold a successful career in them.
