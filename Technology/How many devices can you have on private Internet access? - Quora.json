            "answer_text": "Q: How many devices can you have on private Internet access? I suspect you don\u2019t mean \u201cprivate Internet\u201d access. The Internet is a single public network. For a private network, you can make up your own rules and protocols, but it would require a separate physical network carry it between sites. I suspect you mean \u201cHow many devices can you have on a private network with Internet access?\u201d. This is different. In IPv4, you can use the subnet 10.0.0.0/8, which is defined as a private subnet, to connect 16777213 hosts to a single network/subnet. Basically, this is 2\u00b2\u2074-3. One address is reserved for the subnet ID, one for the broadcast address and one for the gateway router going to the Internet. This is a theoretical maximum, but in practise would be unworkable. I do not believe any NAT routers will handle this number of client devices, and the bandwidth of the gateway will also be a major constraint. For most residential implementations, the maximum is likely to be 253 (2\u2078-3) for wired connections and much lower for WiFi connections. I would not expect residential WiFi networks to handle more than 32 concurrent devices, and many will be limited to much fewer, perhaps down to 8 WiFi clients. Commercial wired networks can have much higher connectivity limits, but will probably be limited as above for WiFi networks as a WiFi network is a shared, half-duplex system. ",
