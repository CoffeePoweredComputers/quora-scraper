            "answer_text": "I can\u2019t say for sure, what I would personally do, but I have some ideas about what other people would do and how society would change if medical breakthroughs extended the average human life span to 200 years. I imagine the stages of life as we now interpret them, would change quite a bit. Like childhood, the teenage years, young adulthood, middle age, and elderly. The meanings of all these terms would change. What we now consider a \u201cyoung adult\u201d or a \u201cmiddle-aged person\u201d or an \u201celderly\u201d person would all change. And the expectations of what is appropriate for people to do in those stages of life would change too. People would go through way more different stages and phases in their life than they do now. The show Futurama captured this idea really well. There was an episode where Professor Farnsworth, who is 160 years old, got to much of an anti aging serum and he regresses rapidly. His hair style and clothing and personality changed for every age and stage he went through. He went from being a middle aged professor type, to disco party guy, to a stoner hippy, to a nerdy acme covered teenager again, so a straight laced conservative type, to a nerdy little boy again, and a bunch of other different stages in between, that normally a person would only go through once in their life or not have enough time to change so many times. Maybe people would reach mental and emotional maturity at vastly different ages and it would become a lot harder to figure out a person\u2019s age, just by knowing their life circumstances. For example, a 30 year old who still lives with their parents and doesn\u2019t make a lot of money wouldn\u2019t be seen as a loser, like they are in today\u2019s society. Maybe a person in that situation would be looked at more the way society views a 19 year old in that situation today. Whereas their neighbor who is another 30 year old, married with kids and a well paying job, would also not be seen as weird either. They just felt ready for that at a younger age and society would be ok with that and not judge anyone. Or maybe, society would see 30 year olds who marry and have kids as weirdos because they\u2019d be viewed as still practically babies themselves. We\u2019d probably see a lot more people waiting to age 50 or older to have kids or get a career job. (assuming the breakthrough also allows women to safely naturally have kids at a much older age.) Age discrimination in the work place would disappear. Society wouldn\u2019t judge people for doing the \u201cright\u201d or \u201cwrong\u201d things for their age. You probably wouldn\u2019t even think about how old a person is, most of the time. We\u2019d probably see lots of people having multiple generations of children with different spouses and the notion of a traditional family would change a lot more than it already has up until now.

The average and most noted and even the more noted had lives of over 600 years and 800 years was not unknown. As the ability did die out the wording was changed to not the4 ruler but the DYNASTY lived on for thousands of years. Plato was up to the debate and often eluded to the idea in much of his documented works. His was the real world and that was what he sought to explain. But the strangeness just grows. Covid19 though is a virus which is simply a bag of spare parts. Length of human DNA There are about 3 billion nucleotides in human DNA. The average length of a human nucleotide is 0.6 nanometers, or 0.0000000006 meters, so human DNA is about 1.8 meters (5 feet) long. I give you the3 symbol which doctors and indeed the very righteous call \u201cthe meaning of everything\u201d  This symbol has appeared everywhere on earth. All of the way through time even on cave drawings.  That coiled DNA is 1.8 meter long or 5 feet long. Where do you start. You need the crimping tool to cut and splice new information directly to where this is required. Covid19 is trying to do just this right now. Goes into the body and wakes all kinds of hideous past disease but dormant things. gets interesting sometimes. How old is the oldest turtle alive? Jonathan is currently the oldest living tortoise in the world. In late 2017, it was reported that he was still alive and about 185 years old. I already do know some of these aspects but people want to mull around and try to kill covid19 off. Recall these lithesome virus does show up every 101 years apart. For the love of your own one species at least learn to do the science and the research and become intelligent enough to understand what you are learning. I did keep a turtle, \u201csammy\u201d for over 7 years and she is now the largest turtle in the storyland valley zoo. (no i have no picture of her, but this is close enough) That was just 42 years ago.  get an idea now.  Death and killing is for some illogical species. Alligators will even eat human or turtle but turtles do get lots of alligator eggs. ",
