            "answer_text": "Here ars some ways to connect to internet without Wi-Fi :- Dial-up Internet access is a form of Internet access that uses the facilities of the public switched telephone network (PSTN) to establish a connection to an Internet service provider (ISP) by dialing a telephone number on a conventional telephone line. The user's computer or router uses an attached modem to encode and decode information into and from audio frequency signals, respectively. The lines regularly experience interference and this affects the speed, anywhere from 28K to 56K. DSL stands for Digital Subscriber Line.  It is an internet connection that is always \u201con\u201d.  This uses 2 lines so your phone is not tied up when your computer is connected.  There is also no need to dial a phone number to connect.  DSL uses a router to transport data and the range of connection speed, depending on the service offered, is between 128K to 8 Mbps. Cable provides an internet connection through a cable modem and operates over cable TV lines.  There are different speeds depending on if you are uploading data transmissions or downloading.  Since the coax cable provides a much greater bandwidth over dial-up or DSL telephone lines, you can get faster access.  Cable speeds range from 512K to 20 Mbps. Cellular technology provides wireless Internet access through cell phones.  The speeds vary depending on the provider, but the most common are 3G and 4G speeds.  A 3G is a term that describes a 3rd generation cellular network obtaining mobile speeds of around 2.0 Mbps.  4G is the fourth generation of cellular wireless standards. The goal of 4G is to achieve peak mobile speeds of 100 Mbps but the reality is about 21 Mbps currently. ",

            "answer_text": "First of all, internet is not Wi-Fi and Wi-Fi is not internet. Wi-Fi is simply a wireless alternative to ethernet cabling to connect devices on a local network. You don\u2019t need Wi-Fi for internet. All you need is a modem to connect to cable, DSL, satellite, or however else internet is provided to your location. The modem may be a stand-alone device, or may have a built-in wired and/or wireless (wi-fi) router. The router is what connects the network clients (wired or wireless) to the internet. Having a separate router that you own is the most flexible option. If the way you get internet service ever changes (you had DSL and now cable is available in your area), you only need a different modem. Plus the cable company can\u2019t charge you additional fees for wi-fi. ",
