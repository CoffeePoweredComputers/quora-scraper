            "answer_text": "First, it wasn\u2019t Tesla\u2019s intent to provide free energy. If I recall, the Serbian film \u201cSecret of Nikola Tesla\u201d was the only one making that claim. In articles/interviews, Tesla mused about selling \u201chorsepower\u201d from Niagara Falls\u201d to a sugar-factory in Australia, in the form of un-tappable secure-comms signals. As Tesla said, they would phone in their order, and his company would send the kilowatts to that factory. There were megabucks to be made! He expected to attract all the tycoons! (If anything was going to be done for free, it would only be some unsecured transmissions to drive all the tiny clock-motors, worldwide.) Second, solar panels now exist, so we already have \u201cfree energy.\u201d And if you have a creek on your land, and a dam with enough head, you have \u201cfree energy.\u201d That was actually Tesla\u2019s version: install broadcast-power on every inaccessible high-mountain waterfall, all transmitting into the global system. No coal turbines needed! Hydro power would become cheap! Unfortunately, investors decided that it was a delusional 1905 super-science fantasy. Instead, the US govt, (inspired by the harnessing of Niagara Falls,) started those giant dam projects, impossibly huge volumes of concrete, to create many \u201cNiagara Falls\u201d -type cliffsides all around the country. (Heh, a delusional 1930s super-science fantasy, with the tax money flowing into approved govt. contractors, rather than into the pockets of 1905 robber-barons.) Third, does Tesla\u2019s broadcast-power system actually work? Well, all the sneering objections have been defeated: It\u2019s against known science, since we know that radio waves travel only in straight lines, and cannot bend around the Earth! (Wrong, as Marconi finally proved: it doesn\u2019t apply to ground-waves deep in VLF wavelengths.)It\u2019s against known science, since radio obeys inverse-square! (Wrong, it certainly doesn\u2019t work for two-dimensional systems, and standing waves trapped in a cavity don\u2019t obey inverse-square, they obey Cosine fall-off.)the Earth, electrically, is like a vast ocean! (Wrong, not for VLF radio, where the Earth electrically is like a small metal ball inside a larger hollow ball.)the Earth has no standing-waves! (Wrong, finally re-discovered in the 1950s, they\u2019re now called Schumann resonances.)We can\u2019t send energy through the ground! (Wrong, since Tesla wasn\u2019t sending any energy through the ground \u2026instead he was sending currents through the ground. The physics was just like any AM radio tower, or any power line. Tesla insisted that his system wasn\u2019t really broadcast, instead it was a conductor (where all the currents are inside the metal, but the all of the flowing energy is entirely in the fields, outside the wire.))It\u2019s still against known radio theory! (WRONG, but this error was only discovered recently, late 1990s, where contemporary researchers found that the old 1936 \u201cSeneca Lake experiment,\u201d the one which disproved Zenneck surface-waves \u2026was apparently done incorrectly. Corums\u2019 replication (performed at the actual Seneca Lake) instead supported the competing Zenneck surface-wave theory, rather than the long-trusted Norton surface-wave theory. Tesla\u2019s broadcast power relied on the surface-wave phenomenon predicted by Zenneck\u2019s math. The disproof of Tesla \u2026was itself disproved.)If you build this thing, it simply won\u2019t work! (POSSIBLY wrong, since a tiny transmitter cannot slightly approach the operating-threshold of Tesla\u2019s system. To test the concept at all, we\u2019d need something the size of Tesla\u2019s Colorado Springs system. Megabucks are required. Tesla\u2019s supporters (the non-billionaire hobbyist community) cannot afford to build a small prototype power plant.)But Tesla was a known crackpot! (Well, so was Linus Pauling with his silly vitamin-C stuff (so, we must take away his Nobel prize! Clearly his earlier work had to be crackpot too!!) Um no, that\u2019s not how it works. Tesla\u2019s mental decline in the mid 1930s doesn\u2019t affect his 1899 discoveries. Instead, a better analogy is the Wright Brothers, widely called the \u201clying brothers\u201d or \u201cthe Wrong brothers,\u201d because they claimed to be piloting real airplanes for nearly a year in Dayton, OH. Everybody knew this wasn\u2019t happening, because if it was, then the local Dayton newspapers would be covering it! (Those local reporters refused to even look. Since they knew that flying machines were just crackpot ideas. ONLY a beekeeping newsletter carried the story.) The disgusted Wrights gave up on the USA, and took their \u201cshow\u201d overseas to France, making world headlines overnight.)This last one was a typical self-fulfilling prophecy. The same self-fulfilling prophecy may have stopped Tesla: his radio claims were widely disbelieved, hence no investors appeared other than JP Morgan, hence, no completed Wardenclyffe radio station, and no broadcasting demonstration \u2026thus \u201cproving\u201d that Tesla had to be wrong! But with Marconi, he came from a wealthy family in Italy, and obtained backing from rich family friends. So any staunch and universal disbelief from the investors out in the greater world \u2026couldn\u2019t block Marconi from completing his massive Poldhu VHF antenna tower, which was a direct analogy for (and a ddirect competition with) Tesla\u2019s Wardenclyffe tower. (And apparently Poldhu contained an enormous double-resonant transformer, or \u201cTesla coil,\u201d rather than Marconi\u2019s patented single-resonator \u201cwhip-crack\u201d transmitter.)  Tesla\u2019s giant antenna-tower at Wardenclyffe:  . Marconi\u2019s ocean-spanning transmitter below:  Note that, according to contemporary EM physics, Tesla\u2019s tower (above) would have been capable of far higher output-wattage than Marconi\u2019s. And, if it was locked onto one of the planetary VLF resonance modes, it may well have been capable of creating immense VLF standing waves worldwide, and even some \u201cbroadcast power.\u201d But even without such standing waves, whenever we broadcast some basic VLF signals via electrically-short vertical dipole antennas (in order to output some kilowatts,) then the output-voltage MUST be immense. In other words, for VLF transmissions, a huge air-core step-up transformer is required, even in Marconi\u2019s system. And if we double the voltage, we increase the emission-wattage by a factor of 4X. Marconi had to use Tesla coils to broadcast across the Atlantic. There was no getting around it. But even then, Marconi\u2019s maximum output-voltage would be limited by corona discharge from the \u201csharp\u201d portions of his array, from antenna-wire tips. Tesla\u2019s version was designed to withstand 100x higher voltage, tens of megavolts, perhaps hundreds, producing tens of thousands of times higher wattage than Marconi\u2019s own VLF broadcasts. But Tesla ran out of funds, so his tower\u2019s smooth round metal surface was never installed, and also he couldn\u2019t employ any staff of engineers to complete even some low-wattage broadcasts. The \u201csharp\u201d girder-network of Tesla\u2019s upper terminal would provoke unwanted discharges, occurring at far below his intended operating voltage. When operated at night, in this incomplete state, apparently Wardenclyffe tower generated gigantic lightnings visible for miles. (Like Marconi\u2019s system, it was designed to send out emissions today called \u201cVLF groundwaves,\u201d with RF currents in the earth (just as Tesla claimed,) and EM fields in the space just above.) Any lightning bolts (rf arcs) are a known failure-mechanism in high-power radio transmitters! Yet Tesla\u2019s system might well have been able to communicate with Europe, even when incomplete. But by that time Tesla didn\u2019t have a dime, and his staff was long gone, so the simplest experiments were impossible. Soon Westinghouse Corp came in and removed all the big steam turbines and dynamos which either had been on temporary loan, or where the flow of payments from Tesla had dried up. . ",

            "answer_text": "It is true that our western civilization runs on money and control, not freedom. From the little that I can know of Nikola Tesla, his inspiration was focused on doing what was good for the whole. He was not the average greedy and selfish person of his time. It is interesting to notice the need to put monetary value on everything today. The immense and diverse energy within water is freely available to everyone, and yet the educated and elite people will find ways of putting a monetary value on it and then giving technical explanations why it is necessary to do so. At least with water and air we can all tap into the abundant supply without any technology. I am sure there are sources of electrical energy available that could be tapped into with the right geometry and maybe a small input charge to coagulate and accumulate voltage. The limits that we have established by the laws of science are useful for working and innovating the current systems, but their is gross inefficiencies that cannot be overcome because of the laws blocking possibilities. Natures use of electricity and the energies in Light are far more efficient and free. 1901 was a pivotal year in which the negative consciousness of a few very wealthy people set the agenda for negative scientific development throughout the Twentieth century. An occasional voice was heard disputing scientific claims, but they were quickly censored. There are a few more around today, but the mass of those who know are quick to call them \u201ccranks\u201d and \u201ccrackpots\u201d. In some ways, Earth human beings are their own worst enemy because they allow their arrogance to overrule their feeling-tones of unconditional love and respect for others. When humans have self respect and work together, the outcome far exceeds the sum of the parts. This is a universal law that also would apply to electrics and magnetics if we opened our hearts to it.
