            "answer_text": "First, let me show you that wireless charging doesn\u2019t have to be expensive: This is the Qi charging receiver for my iPhone (less than 1mm thick, and easily covered by a thin case):  My actual price (delivered) was only $4 from a local online store. This is the one for my office desk:  for my house:  and an even cheaper one for my bedroom:  And this is for the car (detachable from its cradle):  And this is for when I need to go mobile for a day:  That is probably the smallest wireless powerbank that you can buy, and it performed admirably, able to charge my iPhone 5S more than 2 times (from 15% to 100%), and still have 2 LEDs lit up. So, aside from the powerbank and the car charger, my system is very cheap, and so far my iPhone 5S is still very healthy indeed! So how about benefits? No more hassle with cables, you can hide all the cablings if necessary for a neater desk/dashboard. If I need to use the phone, just pick it up and put back when finished. Or if I\u2019m expecting several incoming calls/texts/chats, then just put it back in the charging pad when finished. So far there\u2019s no significant side effect on the battery, and I\u2019ve been using it for more than a year. It is also a very satisfying feeling when using the wireless powerbank without any cable getting in the way. ",

            "answer_text": "1. Any persons with difficulty using their fingers, hands, wrists or arms to constantly plug and unplug cable cords would benefit. Wireless charging pads eliminate the need to plug cables into your phone\u2019s USB port and they give you a fixed station (a home) for your phone. 2. They're safer for kids and families with small children. Often times, young ones crawl, bite, and put things in their mouths. And kids who start drawing and cutting things will reach for wires. The chances for any of these kinds of hazards happening are vastly reduced in households and classrooms that don't have cords lying around. 3. You save money in the long run because there's no need to purchase extra cords every time you break or misplace cables. 4. Reduce the wear-and-tear of your smartphone's USB port. In general, your smartphone's hardware will remain well intact simply because you're decreasing the wear-and-tear of your phone's hardware. ",
