            "answer_text": "No. But not for any issues with design and technology. Lightsabres are inherently mystical weapons, there have been different takes on them over the years, but they\u2019ve been explicitly mystical since the mid 90s (earliest example I can think of is the novel I, Jedi). In both Legends and Disney, they\u2019re literally magical. A lot of their more esoteric properties, like blaster bolt deflection, and grounding force lightning are magical qualities. Magic isn\u2019t real, therefore no lightsabres. Even an energy blade that\u2019s similar to a lightsabre, wouldn\u2019t actually be one. ",

            "answer_text": "Lightsaber, no. Protosaber, yes. The problem with a lightsaber is that in order to power it you would need a nuclear reactor within the handle, which thanks to the laws of thermodynamics is impossible. However, if you create a protosaber, a lightsaber with a power source attached to it then it is very much possible. Hacksmith Industries, a youtube channel, built a fully retractable plasma-based protosaber about a week ago. If you are interested go watch the video, it's awesome.  ",
