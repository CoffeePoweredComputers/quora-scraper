            "answer_text": "Better in terms of what if you if you are talking about value for money smartphone then I think that the poco m2 Pro is more value for money than the realme 7 Pro because realme 7 Pro and the poco m2 pro both smartphone are having the Snapdragon 720G processor to the so the performance of the smartphone will be the same the realme 7 Pro is comes with an angular display with in display fingerprint sensor why the poco m2 Pro comes with and IPS LCD display both smartphone comes with an infinity hole display so look wise both smartphone Are equal but if we talk about the build quality than the poco M2 Pro is more great then in the realme 7 Pro because of having glass back and having Gorilla glass 5 protection on both front and back and when it comes to the camera performance that I know that the realme 7 pro has a great camera sensor which is the Sony imx686 64 megapixel sensor but hey we can use gcam in the poco m2 Pro and then this smartphone will be and good camera smartphone so that's not a big deal for me at least India kuku M2 Pro comes with a 5 megapixel macro sensor while the realme 7 Pro comes with 2mp macro camera So the realme 7 Pro is priced at 19 999 and the poco m2 Pro is priced at 13 999 so all & all the poco m2 Pro is far more value for money smartphone because having and 33w fast charger 5000mah battery better build quality having Gorilla glass 5 on both front and back better gcam compatibility having 5mp macro sensor better in hand experience all these things makes this smartphone and more value for money smartphone than the realme 7 Pro but ya if price is not your primary concern then you should buy the realme 7 Pro over the poco m2 Pro ",
