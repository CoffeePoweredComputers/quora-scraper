            "answer_text": "Well technically, Wireless speakers sound is not as good as wired speakers. Wireless speaker uses Bluetooth technology to exchange data between wireless speaker and mobile devices over a short distance using short-wavelength and building a personal area network. You cannot play FLAC (Free Lossless Audio Code meaning that audio is compressed in FLAC without any loss in quality) with wireless speaker . While you can play FLAC music on wired speakers without any problem. Wireless Speakers: Pros Wireless speakers operate without having wires connected to the central unit, as the speakers run through infrared or radio transmission. They\u2019re certainly less invasive.Wireless speakers are more convenient and you can move them around the house easily to the preferred location(s) with no worries about cables, wires, and cords getting in your way.With wireless speakers, you will never have to worry about your pet or anyone else tripping over (or eating) the wires.Techies get to boast about the amazing technology of wireless transmission, as infrared transmission and digital signals are beamed from the transmitters to the speaker receivers to give off the sound.Wired Speakers: ProsWired speakers offer the most dependable and high quality sound as compared to their wireless counterparts.Wired speakers are rarely affected by interference like wireless speakers.Wired speakers will never be affected by Wi-Fi outages.With wired speakers, you will never need to mess around with any batteries, as is the case with some wireless speakers.They are relatively less expensive in comparison to wireless speakers.If you are not a professional musician and don\u2019t want professional quality sound, a wireless speaker is a good one for you.

            "answer_text": "Hard to say, it all depends on build quality and audio source. If you are using digital audio source then in theory wireless speaker can be equally good as wired speaker with same quality. Problem is that most of them are not build to sound good, as most of people who buy wireless speakers do not care that much about sound quality as they care more about how the speakers look and easy installation and price. Sound quality comes in distant fourth. So really good sound quality wireless speakers do not sell as well as really good wired speakers. So if you buy a $1000 speaker you will not get a same sound quality wireless speaker than you would get wireless. Wireless speaker in audio system where the amplifier is build in to the speaker itself. So cost of same quality wireless speaker is the cost of wired speaker + the wired speaker amp for each wireless speaker. Do equally good wireless speaker system with many speakers will cost more than traditional system with many wired speakers + one amp. And on analog audio source, like vinyl or live it is not as good. Although digital audio quality is beginning to be better then most humans hearing quality. In general wireless speakers also aim for smaller size so they have less internal room to make the sound, specially since the case is crammed full of electronics and in general then have smaller speaker elements.  Personally I never understood the point in so-called \u201cwireless\u201d home speakers. They are not wireless, they have even more wires that normal \u201cwired\u201d speakers as they still have thick power cord to them. Personally I think speaker wired are much nicer looking on wall than power cords. ",
