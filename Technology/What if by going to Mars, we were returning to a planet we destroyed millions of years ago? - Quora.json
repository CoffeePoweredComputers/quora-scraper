            "answer_text": "Then enormous amounts of things we have observed about life evolving on Earth and the time period which humans have existed are all wrong. Humans have existed for nearly 200,000 years, thats 0.2 million years, and there\u2019s significant evidence that we evolved directly along a line that split from other apes some 6 or 7 million years ago. We\u2019re very clearly related to every other life form on Earth (with the exception of viruses) which would be problematic if we evolved on another planet. There is zero evidence of a technologically advanced civilization on Earth prior to the existence of modern humans. In other words, though there\u2019s nothing that specifically disproves this hypothesis, but it requires so many assumptions that, compared to the prevailing theory, it seems extremely unlikely. ",
