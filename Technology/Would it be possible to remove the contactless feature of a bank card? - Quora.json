            "answer_text": "Yes. One simply can shield the card with thin copper foil to disable the activation of the loop antenna and passive electronics. In most settings the payment card is required to be in very close proximity to the payment card NFC reader with some applications requiring a \u201ctap\u201d of the card to active the reader. Thus if the card is not in a close proximity <2 inches, there is a very low probability the card can be energized enough to become activated. One could also disable the internal loop antenna by using a small magnet to \u201cfeel\u201d the loop around the center of the card. With a very carful and controlled cut using an exacto blade at the two opposing lines of the rectangle formed by the loop antenna, the ability for the card to be activated would become less likely.
