            "answer_text": "I have owned 2 Micromax phones one in 2010 Micromax Q75 and the other in 2014 Micromax A25, they were of good quality, they made really good smartphones but their customer service was horrible if that can improve, it would be great. I am a little excited not too much, But I don't think many are excited, as still Oneplus and other Chinese smartphones are selling at a good rate. I have literally seen people putting their status as Boycott Chinese products and they are the ones to buy a Chinese phone the next day, and their statement is \"keval ek Mobile hai kya pharak padata hai\" you can even check the below answer, Saurabh Kumar Singh's answer to Why doesn't India become a smartphone manufacturing hub even though India has the best software engineers?

            "answer_text": "I think that as per the demand of the Indian consumers for non-Chinese products in the smartphone technology space, the relaunch of Micromax or its so called \u201ccome back\u201d in the smartphone segment is a good initiative towards the \u201cvocal for local\u201d campaign by the Indian government. Until we have Indian alternatives, we won\u2019t be able to completely ban Chinese products, so this is a big milestone towards that goal. ",
