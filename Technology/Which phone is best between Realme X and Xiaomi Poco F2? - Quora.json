            "answer_text": "This is very controversial , and I know many Poco fans might attack me , both standard 60 Hz super AMOLED display & 90 Hz IPS LCD has it own advantages , but the functionality is very limited for the 90 Hz refresh rate displays , since you need apps & games which supports 90 Hz refresh rate & currently only very few Google apps like chrome supports that functionality , moreover if not optimized properly , the 90 Hz refresh rate will eventually hurt battery life , on the other hand the AMOLED display has its own advantages since there are dark mode available it will act as battery saver since in AMOLED display the individual pixels lights up , another advantage is that we can have fency in display fingerprint scanner , since light is come directly from downwards , in my personal opinion the standard 60 Hz super AMOLED display will be better choice than 90 Hz IPS LCD display , 90 Hz AMOLED display will be icing on the cake.

            "answer_text": "Hi, I can understand the confusion to buy new smartphone at this time ,as new phones are launching atleast once in a week. So the real question is POCOX2 or REALME X2. See its depends on your usage what you want?What are your requirements?See both phones are same specs only there are few difference as given below- Poco X2 has 120hz display (Lcd) / Realme X2 has 60hz display (Amoled)Miui 11/Colour Os 7Poco X2 has 4500mah /Realme X2 has 4000mah batteryOnly these are few difference. Okay let me make it clear if you love to watch movies then go for Realme X2 And if you want feel the real smoothness then poco X2 is best (remember higher display hz consume more battery). ",
