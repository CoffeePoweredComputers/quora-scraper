            "answer_text": "If your question is about personal, home or small business computers, not at all. There were none. The large industrial companies and large businesses did not have them either. The only computers were still experimental and owned by IBM and used at their headquarters. There may have a few scattered around a few select and august universities. As the public was first aware of still yet experimental single transistors in the early 1950s, the large mainframe computers used very small vacuum tubes (valves for the English) and were the size of full rooms. They also used very large 20 inch diameter reel to reel magnetic three inches wide tapes for as a storage device as the modern harddrive had yet to be invented. There were no floppies of any size, no modems, no network interface cards, no sound cards or any cd roms or dvd players. Obviously there was no internet. Remember the very first computer was built in Enland during WW II in the early 1940s. So by the early 1950s, they were just turning 10 years old. The old fashion IBM punch cards the size of a legal sized envelopes had not yet been developed. To give you an idea of their limited computing ability, remember the \u201cFurby\u201d toys of a few years back? They had more computing power than any of all those later (from 1950s) space capsules or missions to the moon vehicles. ",
