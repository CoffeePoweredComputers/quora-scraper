            "answer_text": "The GTX 1650 is really low end and can get you by in most games. However, if you play really high, detailed graphic games I wouldn\u2019t recommend it especially newer titles from say the past 2 years. (this also depends on the rest of your PC\u2019s components, avoid bottlenecking) If you are looking for a GPU and don\u2019t have a lot of money to spare or want a good bang for your buck, I\u2019d recommend the RX 580. I had it before I upgraded up to GTX 1660S and it ran games really well at a stable FPS well above 60FPS in the games I play. It also has a much better benchmark compared to the gtx1650. AMD RX 580 vs Nvidia GTX 1650 Overall with all the graphical updates for games lately, if you are just building a PC now I don\u2019t recommend the GTX 1650 in terms of longevity. Or if you are upgrading your GPU, make sure you get one that won\u2019t need to be changed again to save money! :) ",

            "answer_text": "Look at the games you want to play your monitor resolutions it can support is a better way of thinking. A 1650 is the entry level of gaming graphics, the good point of this is the entry to mid range segment is very price competitive. If you can stretch to it look at 580/590/5500 xt/1660 these will give you solid 1080p performance. I don't expect new cards in this segment until mid 2021 ",
