            "answer_text": "Similar to other IT firms like Wipro, TCS, even HCL Tech. has different profiles to hire for. There was a time when these IT firms used to hire freshers, and train them for 3\u20136 months to get them accustomed to their work style, processes, and culture etc. But, this no longer happnes. Owing to the cut-throat competition, all these IT conglomerates no longer hire freshers even through consultancies. They rather prefer candidates who are well trained and requre minimal assistance. As far as growth is concerned, apart from the profile, companies have also started focusing on the skill-sets of each candidate. No matter if you slog for 12 hours in a day, but if you aren\u2019t being productive, the companies will no longer consider you for higher positions. So, depending on how good your profitability is for the company, they decide your growth pattern aka the annual increment. Hope my answer helps you understand the corporate culture a little better. Be Wise and then RISE. Best regards,Manu Mathur (Admin @ Manu Mathur - Blogger | Content Writer) ",
