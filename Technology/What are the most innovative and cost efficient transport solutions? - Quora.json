            "answer_text": "Trucking will be the most efficient transport solutions if handled properly Many professional truck drivers can only guess at how much is spent on maintenance, tyres, insurance and, crucially, fuel. Whatever vehicle you drive, it is helpful to know how things add up. In general fuel equates to about 30% of total operating costs so using less fuel makes good business sense and helps the environment by reducing emissions. When you understand the operating costs then you can begin to do something about it. The stronger the business, the better the prospects for the workforce. ",

            "answer_text": " Take a river or dam. Build a system of canals to channel the river through the city. Set up boats, allowing for free public transportation throughout the city without any need for added energy. Set up a platform station that is water-powered to haul the empty boats from the lower exit of the canal system to the higher entrance, so they keep going around endlessly.   In a similar way, you could deviate a river to anywhere and back, providing people with the means to just float to where they want to go. ",
