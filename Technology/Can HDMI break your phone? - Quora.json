            "answer_text": "No, but Samsung broke my HDMI. HDMI on the USB port (MHL) was in all Samsung Phones before the Samsung Galaxy S7. I could plug my phone into a projector using an MHL to HDMI adapter cable and watch a movie on my phone comfortably. (Amazon.com: Premium MHL Micro USB HDMI TV Adapter Cable for Samsung Galaxy S5 Active SM-G870: Computers & Accessories) But, this question gets my Dumb Quora Question of the Day award.
