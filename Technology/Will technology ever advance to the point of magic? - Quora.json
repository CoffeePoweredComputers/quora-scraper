            "answer_text": "Yes we are clearly in the beginning stages of that kind of transition right now. For hundreds (perhaps thousands) of years fairy tales and children\u2019s stories had magic compasses that pointed to wherever the possessor wanted to go or maps that showed the route to anywhere. Well we have those things now. They\u2019re in every car and on every cell phone. An important element in the Snow White fairy tale is the magic mirror on the wall that can answer any question. Today, any computer with Google Browser can do that. The examples abound. Magic potions were sought to make the sick and near dead well. Today antibiotics routinely do that after the second or third dose. As a matter of fact, even 150 years ago less our cell phone would have been considered a magic wand. Why? Because it lets you speak to anyone anywhere in the world. It tells you virtually anything you want to ask it. It is a magic map that will give you directions to anywhere in the world you wish to go. It will pay for things you wish to purchase and enable you to have them delivered to you from just about anywhere, most of the time with 48 to 72 hours. How could such a thing not be a magic wand? All of these things are now so ubitiquous and routine that no one thinks of them as magic but people from even 150 years ago certainly would until they learned the underlying principles making them possible. Technology is exponentially advancing now so that development builds upon development. Barring catastrophe its probably inevitable we actually will see things like invisibility cloaks because crude proto type are already under development. The development of Holographic displays and virtual reality will add entirely new aspects to what these fields can do now. Its entirely likely that holographic display will be used for interior and exterior decoration. Walls will change texture and color. Frame houses will look like castles. Windows in New Jersey will display the Serengeti or the Alps, or the bottom of the sea. Crude Holographic prototypes of these kinds of things are in existence today. Virtual Reality will become group as well as an individual experience and literally make anything and everything possible. Pretty much all of that would have been considered magic a short time ago and continued technological advancement will make what we presently consider magic possible in the relatively near future, probably within the next 150 years.

            "answer_text": "Will technology ever advance to the point of magic? No, because technology needs to follow physics, and no technology will ever allow FTL travel for example, cause it\u2019s impossible unfortunately. No high-tech will allow you to summon a ball of fire, or let you float in the air without machines, only by creating a vortex of wind around you. And also, technology is limited by energy consumption, due to thermodynamics and the law of conservation, and the amount of energy concentrated within a limited space cannot surpass nuclear forces without being quickly dissipated due to instability. While magic is a direct intervention over the laws of physics, one using magic can summon a dragon, or even a giant, ignoring weight issues, or cast a storm over a city, completely obliterating it. By using magic you could in theory(cause, it\u2019s fictional duh) get energy out of nothing, or destroy it, ignoring the thermodynamics laws. No modern feats of greatness would ever be compared to magic, because modern world relies on the laws of physics, and what\u2019s possible, it can\u2019t create what is possible or change the impossible to become possible, what\u2019s possible, is possible for modern world, while what\u2019s impossible will forever be impossible. Meanwhile magic could indeed create what\u2019s possible, or manipulate the impossibilities to turn them to possibilities. The right way to ask this question, would be something like: \u201cWill technology ever advance to the point that it looks like magic?\u201d and the answer to this question is: Yes, sure. And it is looking like magic right now, besides it\u2019s looking like a low level magic due to physical limitation, and it\u2019s doubtful it\u2019ll become much more advanced, science managed to discover all the four natural forces, and the only remaining a mystery is the gravity itself. Electromagnetism, and the nuclear forces(weak and strong) are already 100% understood. ",
