            "answer_text": "Remember, when someone is with you without any reason, then you\u2019re the reason! Let me clear. Listen calmly. 1] Advertisements: Most of the social networking sites advertise different products on their websites. They pay a hefty amount to use up that space. It is too common everywhere. 2] Games/Apps: Remember Candy Crush Saga, Criminal Case, Fruit Break and all those games where you get hundreds of notifications? People complained but still it never worked out. Because Facebook is renting their space. No, these games aren\u2019t originally from Facebook. They just took a host there and paying a lot. They happily pay because, hey, everyone uses Facebook. 3] Stealing Information: I have no polite word for this. The social networking sites aren\u2019t charging you doesn\u2019t mean that they are fools. They are smarter. They get bulks of money from your information. All the surveys are done via social networking sites and it is important too. How do you think, when you\u2019re online, what you like, what you see and all that is completely known to them. They sell this bulk of information to other buyers. They cost a lot. I hope you learned from the earnings of the social media. Thanks for the A2A User-12393054521168877084 ",
