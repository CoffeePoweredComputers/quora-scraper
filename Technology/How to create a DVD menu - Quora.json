            "answer_text": "Converting a video to DVD format is simple. Make a menu for that video with personalized buttons and backgrounds ... not so much. Luckily, the same tools that are responsible for transforming and recording our videos in a physical environment, also offer options that allow us to shape a menu much more attractive than the classic \"press Enter to start .\" Today we will see four of these tools, all of them relatively easy to use, and as if that were not enough, free . The feeling that the DVD format is \"out\" has been installed for some time. Personally, it has been a long time since I made my last recording, but the distribution of DVD movies is still as strong as ever, and I can not deny that there are many people out there who feel more comfortable placing a disc in the player to see movies. Nor should we forget the creation of homemade DVDs. From a birthday of 15 until the last holidays, every reason is valid to back good moments in video. However, one of the most frequent requirements of users is to be able to design personalized menus . While it is almost impossible To achieve the level of professionalism that we see in original films with free tools, the four options that we are going to present today are much more robust than they appear. DVD FlickDVD Flick is a classic when it comes to recording DVDs, and whoever wants a stable program (his last build is from 2009) with several years in the market will do well to choose it. Its section dedicated to the menus is what we can call basic, since it only offers six different designs. For some users that may be enough, but the more adventurous will find tutorials designed to create additional options, or modify existing ones. Wondershare DVD Creator (for Windows & Mac)Our best selection of DVD menu creators is Wondershare DVD Creator . This is because the Wondershare DVD creator is very easy to use. With just a few clicks, you can create your own DVD. Its user interface is intuitive. It has a wide variety of basic options that will make most home users create their own DVD that does everything they want from it.  Wondershare DVD Creator is free and can be downloaded for both Mac and Windows machines, so you have your bases covered with Wondershare regardless of the system you are using. You probably have the most complete menu creation system of any of the softwares on this list, and that helps you claim the top spot. DVDStylerThe Web insists that DVDStyler is the number one program to create personalized DVD menus without paying a dime. After using it for a long time and evaluating the available parameters, I must share that opinion. DVDStyler allows you to add extra screens to each menu, alter the position of the text (like its font and size) , insert buttons, and of course, change the backgrounds using external images. WinX DVD AuthorThe free program that closes this list is WinX DVD Author . Its interface tries to take the most positive points from its competitors, and although the final result makes it a little less intuitive than the rest, it incorporates a very interesting detail, which is to add music to the menu. With a little patience, any interested person will dominate it completely. Whoever wants to go beyond these programs will surely find much more advanced commercial alternatives, but which demand a certain amount of tickets. Most of these alternatives offer trials, however, if the plan is limited to freeware, I think we have a good starting point with the programs we have mentioned. Good luck! ",
