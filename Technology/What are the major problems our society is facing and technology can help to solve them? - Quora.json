Healthcare has evolved from localized services to its current highly centralized form with large HMOs, insurance companies, and the increasing market share of hospital groups. But there are exciting opportunities for new technologies to disrupt the way healthcare services are provided. By building a useful HIPPA compliant, mobile technology that creates a holistic system with direct messaging capabilities provides the opportunity to fill in the areas where there are gaps in communication in the current healthcare system to connect directly with each other to fix inefficiencies seamlessly. The stagnant healthcare field is in desperate need of innovation. Healthcare startup companies are recognizing that with current growing costs and greater needs, creative strategies are necessary to modernize this industry. It is critical to integrate a tech-savvy approach to creating a digital health revolution. This new conduit between physicians, insurance, and patients will create strategic solutions in healthcare. Companies at the forefront of developing, direct physician to patient tech mobile applications are aiming their focus to facilitate the entire process seamlessly in a simple, direct and expedient manner. As a liaison between doctors, insurance companies and patients, technology based on user-focused, real-time capacity creates a well-organized solution that significantly reduces time wasted with the issues arising from the gap in communication between physicians and insurance companies. Therefore, the use of HIPPA compliant direct messaging platform technology that has created detailed analytical tools that allow doctors to focus on what matters most for their patients, rather than having to deal with the hassles of lost communication between physicians and insurance companies. Medical offices receive countless callbacks daily over issues such as insurance denials, errors, lack of inventory, and prior authorization -- issues that cost physicians and their staff valuable time, which is better served in examination rooms with patients. Digital solutions in the form of an HIPPA text platform, created for both desktop and mobile use, for doctors on the go. This technology sidesteps and eliminates issues that may arise from missed refills and consultations. This type of new technology enables doctors to manage an efficient, more organized system for prescription delivery. This creates a ripple effect that patients also appreciate, radically improving patient satisfaction. The platform will also fosters better relationships between pharmacists and patients. Pharmacists can now directly contact patients and continue with follow up calls, making sure that patients are taking their medications and noting their progress for their physicians. It is critical to understand that in the 21st century, patients want technologies that improve their experiences and understand what patients need and how technology can transform health care experiences and create a positive ripple effect that extends past the examining room. by Tatiana Aynbinder ",

            "answer_text": "There are many ways to solve societal problems, which have been demonstrated throughout our history. How citizens go about solving the problems determines how well those problems get solved and remain solved. All societal problems can be solved, regardless of scale, with long term virtuous cycle benefits under very specific conditions: A societal model is created that is based on simple beliefs, such as the citizen is the ultimate authority, excessive power is bad, free enterprise is good, citizens are fully responsible for their well-being and citizens have access to unfettered internet and social media.A small group of citizens create principles and goals of a better society and train others on how to appreciate the potentialA group of citizens use social media to inform other citizens and social medial to document and prioritize the major societal issuesA group of citizens team up, using social media, to analyze and document each active societal issue and to actively grow the awareness around each issueRepeat the process while maintaining the definition of the goal of society, on a continuous basis, and eventually society stabilizes and maximum prosperity ensues",
