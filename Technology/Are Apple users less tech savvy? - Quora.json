            "answer_text": "I\u2019m a software engineer, and I absolutely prefer Mac OS and Apple products. The reason is actually because MacOS has much more utility than Windows, and far more potential for user innovation. Not the other way around like you mention. Admittedly, I like some Linux distros, but as far as Windows is concerned, it\u2019s the poorest design and least functional OS out there. You may need to specifically mention what you mean I guess, but my first reaction is that the truth is the opposite of what you\u2019re describing. For example, Mac OS is the only OS on the market that I can run Windows, Linux and Mac OS side by side in VMs. That one fact, pretty much disproves your theory that it\u2019s less functional. It means there is nothing you can\u2019t do on a Mac that you can do in the other operating systems you mentioned. There is no official, or even reliable way to do that on a Windows machine, and would require you to break Apple\u2019s licensing model which is a barrier that can\u2019t be overcome in a business environment. Ditto Linux for that matter. Also, Mac OS is designed much better than Windows. The designers at Windows made some really poor decisions a long time ago, and are now stuck with them. The registry is probably the worst one. It\u2019s a database, that presents itself as a filesystem like, thing. It has totally proprietary datatypes, and because there is no real standard where 3rd party developers are supposed to place settings, it\u2019s a scatter-brained mess. The registry is also the culprit that requires all Windows apps to be installed, and as that happens, files are thrown all over the file system. If it\u2019s a 32 bit app, which most still are unfortunately on Windows, it puts some files in Program Files (x86), and then some files in the %APPDATA% directory somewhere, and god knows where else. Then it places some values in the registry, although nobody really knows where. This type of process makes it essentially impossible to put a Windows system back in its original state after installing something, if you so desire. The duplicate filesystem paths are another messy Windows design. You\u2019ve got the aforementioned Program Files (x86) and Program Files. Then there is System32 and SysWow64, and my personal favorite \u2018sysnative\u2019. It\u2019s just an ugly mess. On a Mac, apps are self-contained in an app bundle. Just drag the bundle to your /Applications folder, and you\u2019re done. You want to remove it? Delete the app bundle. Settings that are normally stored in the registry on Windows, are stored in PLIST files on a Mac, which is just XML. A totally non-proprietary standard, that is simple to work with, and extremely effective. Nice and simple. Just as it should be. Design decisions like this, make a tremendous difference and there are so many of them, it\u2019s difficult to list them all. As you get used to a Mac and its OS, you literally see them everywhere if you\u2019re a power user. It\u2019s just a superior operating system. Mac OS is built on top of FreeBSD, so along with all the great Apple OS features, of which there are many, you also get the Unix goodies baked in. Python, Bash, Ruby, Perl, Apache etc are all installed by default, and work out of the box along with all the other Unix command line utilities. None of them come installed on Windows. Each of them essentially treat Windows like a second class citizen anyway, and none work as well as they do on a Unix system even if you do go through the hassle of installing them. Admittedly, they all come on Linux too, but on Linux you still don\u2019t get the great Apple features, such as Smart Folders, Automator, the Scripts menu, contextual Services, launchd, the Dock etc. There\u2019s also the fact that if you want to do any iOS or Mac OS development, you need to have a mac. It\u2019s unavoidable. That\u2019s a very large area of innovation in and of itself. Huge in fact. Arguably, the most exciting areas of development of the last decade have happened on the Apple ecosystem, and with the fairly recent release of a truly outstanding programming language like Swift, that shows no signs of stopping. I would argue it\u2019s the most exciting language out there today, and it\u2019s certainly the fastest growing language. Apple hit it out of the park with Swift. They essentially took all the best features from the most popular languages, and packaged them into one powerful and cool language. The frameworks are also designed better on a mac, and any developer with Windows experience has gone through DLL hell as you try to fix version mismatch errors. These issues are essentially non-existent on Macs due to the superior design. The build quality of macs is also superior, and despite common perception, Macs actually aren\u2019t more expensive than PCs. They just don\u2019t offer a low-end product. If you spec out a PC with similar hardware, it\u2019s basically the same price, and in many cases, actually more expensive. Then on top of that, you have to continue buying expensive OS upgrades from M$. Apple reliably releases a new OS at the same time each year, and it\u2019s absolutely free. If you look at the couple most recent StackOverflow annual developer surveys, you\u2019ll see that Mac OS is actually the most popular OS by developers now, and it\u2019s due to the reasons I laid out here. Reliability, usability, intuitive design, Unix, and great design. Obviously people should use whatever they like, but to try and make the argument that Apple systems are somehow less functional couldn't be further from the truth. They're actually the most functional, which is why you see so many developers using them. Granted, many developers like Linux too, and I'm one of them. I have 2 Linux Virtual Machines on my iMac, and a Windows 10 VM. I only use them for specific purposes like testing though, and there is no system out there I'm more productive on than Mac OS. I'm not aware of single thing I can do on Windows that I can't do on Mac OS. I'm aware of many things I can do on Mac OS that I can't on Windows however. When you combine that additional functionality with the superior design, and it's a no-brainer. ",

            "answer_text": "This is a tough one. Any way I answer, someone will disagree with me - with a perfectly valid reason. However\u2026 In my experience, yes. The majority of Apple users are less \u201ctech savvy\u201d. Even much less. Yes. I would also agree that Windows/Android users tend to know more about the nuts and bolts behind the GUI. But that is not in any way a knock on Apple. Quite the opposite. In fact, the question seems to miss a something \u201ceveryone\u201d knows. Apple is intentionally famous for exactly that. Simple. User friendly. Millions buy Apple for precisely that reason! Because they don\u2019t need to know any tech to do what they want. A child can edit video, or create an awesome presentation. An 80 year old grandparent can pick up their iPhone when it makes a noise - and be in a Facetime with their 6 year old grandchild. Neither one has to know anything about tech. That isn\u2019t \u201clesser utility\u201d! It\u2019s far more.  And then, when you get to the 5% or so who are very tech savvy, the picture changes again. When you have experience with (and background knowledge of) many OS\u2019s, you might intentionally chose the one that allows you to get your job done with the least fuss. Or you might (as for many programmers) need/want capabilities that only the \u201cuser friendly\u201d OS has. Like most gamers, I\u2019m mostly a Windows and Android guy. I\u2019ve run some servers on Linux, and I support some clients on Apple, but I\u2019m still not as comfortable in *nix land. (Yes I do know Android is *nix.) But although I am more at home in Redmond territory, and OS X and IOS often feel confining to me\u2026 I have an abiding respect for most technology born in Cupertino. My disgust and revulsion for the demon iTunes is an exception, of course. ",

You know how it works from the outside but you don\u2019t really know how it works from the inside. From the end-user\u2019s perspective, this is great. I don\u2019t need the headache. The thing is working. Fullstop. Apple\u2019s products are closed source (Edit: not completely true for OSX, as pointed out by User-12670461892230288093. Thanks!), same as Microsoft\u2019s. Why is it working for Apple but not the same for Microsoft? For one, Apple provides both hrdware and software. When you design your own hardware, it is easy to write fully compatible software for it. Another thing that tops Apple is the high standard of their customer support. When you have excellent support, you don\u2019t bother knowing the details. Why should you? Someone else is being paid for fixing your broken desktop. People like easiness. In GNU/Linux, we often write shell scripts to automate everyday repeated tasks for users. We hate to admit it, but we are also trying to ease the end-user\u2019s experience. The general perception is that a tech savvy user is one who works with the command line and hates GUI. Under Mac and Windows you usually don\u2019t fiddle around with the command line, you don\u2019t need to. Even under GNU/Linux we mostly use a virtual terminal under X. Very few (mostly server admins) use the true shell. All in all, it depends on how deep you want to penetrate inside the system. The command line is available everywhere, you just don\u2019t need (or want) to use it much. ",

They use it for simple tasks and they just want to get things done. If the computer that they are using is able to perform the task that they want to accomplish, they\u2019re content with it. Then there are the others who need to have the latest and greatest. These are the ones who believe in the hype or the next fad. If it is an Apple device, they will get that.

You find that quite a few developers are using Macbooks these days. Considering they are usually the most tech savvy people of all, I would say that Apple users are actually more tech savvy than the rest. So to answer your question\u2026 Why do users pay for Apple products with lesser utility? Are they less informed or less tech savvy? In truth.. No. It is because they are well informed on the subject, they choose Apple products. They want a machine that is reliable and usable. And in most cases feel that the high price is worth it. ",

I know of other computer people like myself who love Macs, and I also know of idiots who use Windows. Trying to define everyone who uses Macs as dumb or otherwise is kind of tricky. Lots of Mac users who are less tech savvy use it because it\u2019s simple and doesn\u2019t break as often. However, that is not the sole reason people use Macs.
