            "answer_text": "Technology will not be our downfall. Technology isn't a thing, like a predatory leopard or a dictator bent on ethnic cleansing. Technology is simply knowing how to do something, like grow food or read or detect neutrinos. Human nature will be our downfall. As technology grows, our knowledge of how to do things increases. As our knowledge increases, our ability to kill people in large numbers increases. Our ability to save people in large numbers, through sanitation and clean water and prevention of disease and more efficient food production, increases. But it is not technology that drops bombs or torches buildings. It is not technology that kidnaps girls to be sold as wives to religious fanatics. It is not technology that creates death camps or devises ever more cunning weapons. That? That's people. If people choose to use technology to destroy, the responsibility is on the people, not the technology. ",

            "answer_text": "Technology in general is a two edged sword. Depending upon it\u2019s use, it can make life better over all, or suppress everyone. History shows that downfall\u2019s happen, but life goes on and comes back. It is very hard to track one single cause, but technology has never been identified as a cause. During downfalls, technology is often lost until rediscovered. (Cement is one of those things as an example.) So, my money is places that technology won\u2019t be our downfall, we will. ",

What will destroy us will be the side effects of getting the energy to run all our technology. We are poisoning our world-land, air ,water with the search for, processing and consumption of fossil fuels. Humans should have moved beyond internal combustion by now-but we have not in any real way. ",
