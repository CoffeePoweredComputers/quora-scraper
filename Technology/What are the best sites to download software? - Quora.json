            "answer_text": "The one I use most often is Ninite.com. It provides a number of programs for most applications, creates an install file for them, then installs from that install file.  I omits any tetherware, those annoying programs you have to opt out of when installing, and installs with the basic settings.   Once started, it doesn't require any attendance, and if you run the install file again later, it will update your programs.  The programs are guaranteed virus free, and I've been using it as long as I've been on Quora (since 2011). Tucows has been another favorite since the 90's.  They have a listing of freeware for various OS's.  I haven't really used it in some time since I have other sources, but it's fun to see what they've been hosting.  Never a problem with viruses or malware. Sourceforge is a repository for open source programs.  Many of them are for Linux, or are simply source code, but there are a few for Windows.  Most of these are written by non corporate programmers, so they may be a little unfinished or buggy, but there are some fine gems in the pile, too.  The website is kind of funky to get around, but if you are using a search engine for a particular type of program, one will usually pop up on Sourceforge. Amazon features a free mobile app every day.  Some of these are pretty self serving, but others are pretty useful.  I usually get word or mystery/hidden object games that might cost a couple of bucks, but every once in a while an app will get offered that was worth substantially more.  These don't have viruses, but I do worry about the ability to spy.  You have to read the comments a bit to get a sense of what you're downloading. ",

            "answer_text": " Hello, Nowadays there are plenty of \u2018free stuffs\u2019 like software and apps are available online and someone should not spend money if his/her utility has been fulfilled with the free offers available online, especially if it is a matter for your personal computer or a laptop. Because for personal or small office use, you can\u2019t afford to buy a lot of paid software and that is not making sense too. Here is the list of my favorite free software download sites www.download.zone (a small website but gives an easy to find download button)cnet (one of the pioneer website, lot of ads and took more time to load)filehippo (a lot of software available, but a bit tricky to download)Softpedia (a good website to download free software)Filehorse (another good website for software free download, redirects on another page while downloading)Softonic - (A lot of popups and unwanted redirects)Uptodown - (site full with popups and extra download offers)This is my own personal observation and has had experience with all the above websites for our various software download requirements. I hope, it helps. IF YOU LIKE MY ANSWER, PLEASE UPVOTE AND FOLLOW ME ON QUORA Stay safe, ",
