            "answer_text": "Java is the most popular language, and it\u2019s growing faster than any other language, according to TIOBE, so not only is it the biggest, it\u2019s getting bigger faster than anything else. At the moment, there is nothing on the horizon that can replace Java, as a lot of people want stuff like static types, managed runtime, strong library support, strong IDE support, cross-platform. There are very few languages/environments that are all those things, in fact, I can\u2019t think of any. There is C#, but support outside of Windows, while exists, is only so-so, but improving. I have no idea why people think Java is dying, you\u2019d think as it\u2019s computer science, people would at least try to be evidence led. I\u2019m not aiming that at the questioner, as it\u2019s so easy to get the impression that Java is dying if you read enough forums and blogs. I\u2019m aiming it at the people who claim Java is dying without the tiniest bit of evidence for it. However, a bigger point is this, what language you learn is fairly unimportant, it\u2019s learning to program that matters. Basically, don\u2019t learn how to turn a wheel and move your feet up and down, learn how to drive. Don\u2019t learn to walk on grass and hit balls with sticks, learn golf. You could learn to program with Java, or any other language, and the language is the path you take, not the destination. In learning Java, you learn a language, but in the background, you\u2019re learning how to program. So then you\u2019ll try another language, and you\u2019ll see it\u2019s got similarities to Java (or pretty much identical, like C#), then you\u2019ll try another like Swift and see while it\u2019s different, it\u2019s 80% the same. Then you\u2019ll have try of Go, and see that it\u2019s really not that big a deal, you just remember that they call it \u201cfor\u201d, not \u201cwhile\u201d, and a lot seems pretty similar. Java is an excellent choice to learn programming, but make sure you\u2019re learning to program, not just language syntax. The easiest way to learn programming is to program. Pick a project which stretches your abilities, but is not completely beyond you. Don\u2019t try to write PhotoShop, try to write a little photo management app. Don\u2019t try to write Call of Duty, try to write Mario. ",

            "answer_text": "Java is not dying. Java annoys me for too many reasons to list and I might wish for it\u2019s death but unfortunately it is not dying. It is clearly the #1 language in the world by pretty much anyway one can count. It will take a long time for it to fall out of the top 10 let alone die. I doubt it would happen in my lifetime. That said, I would never learn a language just because it is popular. I prefer to look at the jobs I want and at the kind of places I want to work. Then I look at their requirements and get the skills and experience I need to work there. If that means I need to learn Fortran than that is what I will do. I do not care if it is a dying language. I will say Java only shops have a stuffy development culture and generally lack a spirit of innovation. Shops that use a lot of different languages (including java) are usually the most innovative. That is important to me. I know Java because a lot of places I want to work use it. There are SDK\u2019s to customize things that I need to interact with that are written in Java. When I can get away with it, I interact with the JVM via Clojure which feels much more sane. That is not always best for the teams I support so I code in Java. For me, learning Java was a necessary evil. That said, there are certainly careers to be had where you can be happy and Java free. I also know plenty of Java developers that are very proud and happy with the language. Some of them are even very talented. *most of the java hate speech is in jest\u2026 ",
