Generally this is guttural and inconclusive and not even refined enough to verify or deny. So you want to now be better than Greta and yes she is Edmonton and saw they had defaced her \u201cfree speech wall\u201d photo. Cute but my own grocery store does that a nd often in major etchings. Not quite photo album quality. Actually yes he did a 3D photo quality photo. Lucky 97 grocery is super designed as oriental but with a one block wide every inch is used up. Canada has oil Canada has alberta. Alberta has OIL. Most countries would be willing to die for the vast oil reserve that alberta has. Other countries have oil supplies dry up and then they just build a new oil well. Canada such as Syncrude and Suncor will maybe move the P & H shovel ten feet in any direction and begin that again. The shovel is already so deep but they found out in any direction they move the machine, the oil sands just get thicker and more abundant. Bitumen yes with the power of that all roads can become created. Power yes even gasoline or kerosene for aircraft engines called jets. Even the USA has the labreir tar pits.  you call that as being useful tarpits. ((sidenote the article is actually interesting even if done by USA people)).10 Fascinating Facts About the La Brea Tar Pits pleaser note restart system as this site is loaded with ewwww gross overdone ideas of what humans need. Alberta still uses people and ideas and does not mock them quite as heavy as the rest of the planet does. let me see if we go stellar on Suncor Syncrude. These companies are more private than two matrons who just had loving babies. Well they now send 8K satellites out to the skies and even to explore other worlds and I sit here twiddling my thumbs waiting for my own issue to arrive. What can you your own self display. Is someone watching you?  no nothing like that could happen? Could it? oh wow the world is starting to spin again?

            "answer_text": "Well actually the real reason they pay lip service to climate change risks is that they know there aren\u2019t any but it\u2019s politically incorrect to say so and it would hurt their business or their political future if they were to tell the truth. In a similar vein imagine if parents and teachers suddenly started telling small kids that Santa Claus isn\u2019t real the backlash they would feel. It is exactly the same with today\u2019s generation that has been misinformed about climate change to the point of hysteria . Telling the truth will affect them just like exposing the Santa Claus \u201cwill affect their children!\u201d ",
