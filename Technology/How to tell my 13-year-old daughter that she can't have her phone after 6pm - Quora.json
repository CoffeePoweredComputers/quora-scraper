            "answer_text": "First, I would like to know how many people who commented on this question actually have children? Technology has become so advanced that people think a cell phone is a necessity these days & they are NOT. Most children act like they are owed cell phones, Ipads, laptops & every other latest & greatest piece of technology that can be bought, at their parents expense. I personally know teenagers that do not have cell phones because their parents can\u2019t afford them. Guess what? They are still alive!! Second, I think the question was, \u201cHow do I tell my 13-year- old daughter that she can\u2019t have her phone after 6pm?\u201d You never stated why you want to take her phone away, & you do not have to disclose that information, but I\u2019m guessing there is a reason for it. YOU are the parent. YOU make the rules & only YOU know what is best for YOUR child. I am a mother of 4. Three are grown & out of the house & my youngest is also 13. I suggest being blatantly honest about it. Just straight up tell her & tell her why. As a parent it\u2019s your job to set boundaries & limitations wether your child likes it or not. Kids need to know that they can\u2019t have everything they want & not everything is always going to go the way they want in life. The world does not revolve around them & what they want. As parents, our kids are sometimes not going to like our rules & are going to get mad at us. It\u2019s called disappointment & they my as well get used to it now. Life is going to dish out much bigger disappointments than not being able to use a phone after 6pm! She will get over it sooner or later. This is just my opinion as a parent of a 13 year old. Take it like a grain of salt, as you should all the other comments & do what is best for your child. ",

            "answer_text": "When each of ours went to high school, they got a basic phone mainly for safety. The phone had to be turned off around an hour before bed. Anyone found on the phone too late had it confiscated for 24 hours. They rarely did that and were reasonably trustworthy. That was all we could ask. Teenagers need an hour\u2019s break from all electronics before sleep, otherwise it becomes the focus of their evenings and negatively impacts sleep time, sleep quality and daytime alertness. Studies show that kids using electronics at night (TV, Texting, emailing, social media etc) have much later bedtimes, get much less sleep per week and experience fatigue in the daytime. Many children are not getting their basic sleep which is vital for growth, learning, mood, creativity, weight control etc. As a parent, you\u2019re right to address the dilemma of electronics in the bedroom at night. 6pm is quite early for you to ask your daughter to turn her phone off. Could I suggest you push it to about 7pm then increase it as she gets older. Tell her she can keep her phone in her room but that it must be switched off at 7pm (properly off). Tell her that you\u2019re willing to trust her so long as she realises that if she doesn\u2019t follow the rule, the phone will disappear for 24 hours. For a teenager that is a lifetime, and should be enough for her to comply. Check up on her a few times but do turn the wi-fi off before you go to bed in case she gets up later. Trust has to be earned and 13 is still young enough to need rules to help her navigate through the tricky times. ",
