Integrating smartphone computer functions is just a matter of the right software\u2014so long as you have Wifi access. That being said\u2014I\u2019ve heard that installing Android on a Raspberry Pi is difficult. If you want to actually register your Raspberry Pi with a carrier and use it without wifi limitations, you\u2019ll need to connect it to a GSM modem, with its inherent speed and bandwidth limitations.

            "answer_text": "How to Install Android on Raspberry Pi ?Installing Android OS is very easy on Raspberry Pi. It must be installed on a SD-Card usually a 4GB card to enable the installation of other apps and media files. The Android UI is still buggy on Raspberry Pi and crashes a lot and is very slow. Hence it is recommendable to install the OS only on the version of Raspberry Pi with memory of 512 MB or more. ",
