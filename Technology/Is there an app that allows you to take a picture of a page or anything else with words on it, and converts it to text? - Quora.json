            "answer_text": "In order to recognize and extract text characters from image, you need an OCR (optical character recognition) software. OCR is very difficult, I tested many OCR software and currently ABBYY\u2019s OCR solution is the best in my testing. You can try their FineScanner[1] for iOS. The recognition accuracy is related to many factors, if the image is clear enough and the text is not handwritten, black text on white background, regular fonts, the accuracy could be 90% or above. But you need to purchase the in-app function to unlock the OCR function. Hope this helps! Footnotes[1] FineScanner - PDF Document Scanner App + OCR on the App Store",
