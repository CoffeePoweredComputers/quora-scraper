            "answer_text": "Yes actually that is also proper way to address a dentist. A dentist is both a doctor and a dentist. Who is a doctor? Someone who is qualified, to treat people who are ill,recognized and licensed. Who is a dentist? Someone who is qualified to treat illeness that affect teeth and gums,recognized and licenced. Gum is part of the body, teeth are part if body. Both are supplied by nerves,blood and nutrients. The tissues are live. Unlike nails,which are dead cells or tissues that is being exfoliated, teeth are not dead or not naturally exfoliated (except in the case of milk teeth that are near its functional life span). So what a dentist is dealing with is live body.A body part which responds just the way as any other part of body. And there are hundreds of diseases, issues affecting teeth and gums. And most or almost all are connected to the rest of the body. You simply cannot isolate the oral cavity from rest of the body. So as a dentist,one needs to learn about,specifically about many many illnesses that directly affect the teeth and gums.They study oral cavity and diseases in association with rest of the body. In effect, dentists need to know much in detail about the body as a whole. The medicine they prescribe are the same medicines that physicians use. And all about the medicine need to be understood by the dentist. A dentist need to know one hundred percentage of basic stuff that the physician learns,plus all the specific stuff. My own thought,as a dentist, about acquiring knowledge regarding human body and illness is that one needs to know as much and as deep as anyone who wants to repair the human body. I prefer to be called a Dentist, though. To me the word 'dentist' is stylish and specific to my profession. ",

            "answer_text": "I think dentist are never trying to search for regenerative medicine for teeth. They just keep cutting the teeth untill there are none. Here is my true story: one day while brushing I realised that one of my tooth needed attention. I was having a black spot on this tooth since childhood. It was my first visit to dentist, I was 25 age approx. During my session with the dentist she told me that not one but two of my teeth were required to have root canal. But I had never seen any defect in that upper tooth which was directly opposite to the tooth I wanted to be repaired. Non the less the doctor went on doing for both the tooth and I was sitting on the seat with Anastasiya. I was unable to take a judgement myself. Best to my surprise during the operation she used pointed knife and touched other teeth. By the end of the session, she started telling that my teeth were not well and I may need another tooth to be repaired in Next six month. I felt I never had a tooth decay ever and the only tooth that had a dark spot was from childhood. I realised and I never went back to any dentist ever. After six months the other tooth started decaying. I realised that she had cut my other teeth to expose the inner layers of the teeth so that she will get a good buisness out of me. In one year I realised that she had damaged 7 teeth I that single session. and that now I had to take extra effort to take care of these 7 teeth. After 15 years, today all of my teeth are good. Except I take very good care of those 7 teeth by brushing two times every day. Still these damaged teeyh are wearing faster but I don't need a dentist they are healthy and white.. I try. I feel if it goes this way these teeth will remain active 20 years atleast hopefully. But the wear is catching \ud83d\ude41 I regret every day ,why I went to the fucking dentist who tried to rob me of my teeth. Just brush twice daily, and do regular flossing. Research on Regenerative tooth is in progress and it will make todays dentristry useless. ",

            "answer_text": "Umm, usually, no. In some countries in order to get a dental degree, you have to finish a medical degree and do dentistry as a specialty. However, in most Western countries, dentistry is a separate degree to medicine. Here in New Zealand, dentists are conferred the right to practice dentistry, which includes surgery to the jaws, and lower face; and we have the right of prescription of the full pharmaceutical schedule of drugs (the same as medical doctors), but must justify the use of the drugs for dental reasons. Some dentists use the title of \u201cDr\u201d; and some don\u2019t. This is an affectation of tradition passed onto dentists from when the profession of modern dentistry was in it\u2019s infancy - way way back in the late 1700s. As a dentist, I really have no opinion on whether dentists should be called \u201cDr\u201d, the fee is the same what ever they call me. I do have a preference, I prefer them to call me \u201cAdrian\u201d, and NOT \u201cDr Tan\u201d. ",

            "answer_text": "Well, I am a dentist and I am called a Doctor. Why shouldn't dentists be called doctors? An MBBS graduate and a BDS graduate studies the same subjects for the first 3 years- 1.Human Anatomy 2. Human Physiology 3. Biochemistry 4. General Pathology 5. Microbiology 6. General Medicine 7. General Surgery And there are additional subjects which I've not listed which we need to study along with the above mentioned in the first 3 years. It's only in the final year that our respective field branches out. Namely- Oral and Maxillofacial SurgeryConservative & endodonticsPeriodonticsPedodonticsOral medicine and radiologyOrthodonticsCommunity dentistryProsthodonticsA BDS graduate is required to have sound knowledge of all the aspects of human body and then they are taught to deal with the oral aspect of the body, do you understand the reason for it? Oral cavity is as important as any other part of the body, it is the gateway of food, you eating your favourite food , able to taste all of the flavours is because of your tongue. Your teeth(In good condition) when you smile makes you look good. Any type of disease you have, it will show in your mouth. It all means one thing, oral cavity is so important and vast that they decided to make it another branch altogether. So, yes, I think that we should be called doctors. We are rightfully called doctors. Hope this helps. ",

Both are licensed and qualified to do surgical and other procedures as well as prescribing medications. Physician is defined as a person qualified to practice medicine, dentist is defined as a person qualified to treat the diseases and conditions that affect the teeth and gums, especially the repair and extraction of teeth and the insertion of artificial ones. So a dentist is not a physician, at least in the U.S. In Europe, if you want to be a dentist, you complete a medical education first, then specialize in dentistry. In this case a dentist is a physician. ",

Many, perhaps most, Oral Maxillofacial Surgeons have dual degrees: DDS (or DMD) and MD. When I practiced in Pasadena, the dentist next door went to medical school and ultimately became a plastic surgeon. A classmate of mine went into an anesthesia residency program following dental school and also achieved a dual degree, DDS and MD. Another classmate earned the DDS degree then he went into an oral surgery program. When he left that program he had earned his MD degree. Then he went to law school and earned the JD degree. He also married and had 7 children. There is no limit for motivated people with brains. ",

The initial three years are spent studying the concepts of basic medical sciences. However as dentists, we are confined to the head and neck and not the diseases of the rest of the body.
