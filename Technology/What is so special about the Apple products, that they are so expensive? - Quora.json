            "answer_text": "APPLE - We all know this tech giant for their premium products like mac book, ipad, iphone, etc. But getting an Apple product is beyond the dreams of many people.  So here, I'm going to explain why this giant offers products at this massive price range? 1. R&D (Research and Development) Premium smartphones like Apple spend thousands of dollars each year for Research and Development. So what is the purpose of that?\u2026.We know that all smartphones contain various parts like Screen, Processor, RAM, etc. These parts are manufactured by different companies. (But some smartphones companies manufacture these products their own.) So, even if these products are being produced their own or by other companies, Apple spend a lot of money for R&D so that they can develop more innovative products fastly and very first. They always do researches for newer technologies and implement it in their products. That is why always Apple comes with newer technologies in their smartphones each year. 2. Marketing & Advertisements Whenever new smartphone models of Apple comes, we can see it in Newspapers, Internet, Television, etc. This is because this company spend a lot of money for advertisements so as to inform about their products to all people in each and every corner of the world. After seeing advertisements, most people buys that product, since they considers it premium. 3. Salary Each company has a CEO (Chief Executive Officer) and various other officials working in there. So this company has to pay salary to all these people. The salary paid to the CEO (Tim Cook) of Apple is about the profit made by three Chineese smartphone companies. 4. After sales services Whenever you get complaints in your Apple products and you go to the nearest service centre , you can see that the officials in those centres treats you like a GOD and gives a warm welcome, notes your complaints about the phone and repairs the phone immediately. This is because these companies already has a big brand in the market and millions of people trust their products. So they doesn\u2019t want to break your trust with their company. If any customer files a complaint against their product, that will affect their company massively. That\u2019s why they care for you. So this company pay a huge amount to their officials at the service centres. 5. Sales shop Whatever extra products you want for this branded premium smartphone, you can get this at any shop, no matter where you live. If you want a screen cover, a back case or anything, you can get it at any shop. So Apple has to make their extra products available in each and every corner of the world so as to satisfy customers. This includes a huge transportation charge and hence indirectly affects the products. IMO, there is nothing much special about Apple products other than it's clean and fast OS (Mac OS, iOS), stylish look and their processors (This is what it matters most). Hope this helps. Thanks. ",
