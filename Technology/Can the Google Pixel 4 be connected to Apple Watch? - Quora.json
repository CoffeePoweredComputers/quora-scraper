            "answer_text": "No. Apple is extremely exclusive and un-friendly to other devices.. the Apple Watch can only be used on iOS devices.. so you cannot connect it to the Google Pixel 4. The only time Apple is friendly with other devices is when they see some sort of benefit for themselves.. in this case, they don't benefit by making the Apple Watch compatible with Android.. so people would have to buy a iPhone in order to use an Apple Watch. However there is another very good watch that I can recommend personally.. it's also very underrated and not really talked about much. The Galaxy Active Watch 2 by Samsung is an excellent smart watch which is compatible with any Android phone, including the Google Pixel 4. The Apple watch does not have a dedicated sleep tracker which is disappointing.. Samsung has one of the MOST ACCURATE built in sleep tracker of any device.. you can even use the watch offline and it will show you the sleep results 1 hour after you wake up right on the watch itself. There's storage space for music so if you have Bluetooth headphones, you can just listen to music on the watch without needing your phone. You can also send and receive text messages.. there's a keyboard to type on it too.. and I think the new version of the Galaxy Active Watch 2 has an always on display option. There's a heart rate monitor and a tons of fitness apps and also 3rd party apps you can download. The watch is a rounded circle which looks more like a normal watch and there's a rotating touch bezel which is a nice way to navigate through the watch. The Apple Watch is honestly overrated and overpriced, and there are better options out there. Plus, repairing the Apple Watch screen is nearly impossible.. so if the screen breaks, you might as well throw the watch in the trash because you won't be able to replace the screen without damaging the entire device (Apple hates 3rd party repair shops).

            "answer_text": "The Apple Watch can not connect to an Android device, Google Pixel 4 included. The Apple Watch works with iPhone though. There is a kind of work a round that you can do but you will still need a compatible iPhone to set it up and it will need to be a cellular Apple Watch. This is outlined here, Link; Hoping to use the Apple Watch Series 5 with your Android phone? Think again . It basically states that you would take the iPhone and pair it to set it up initially and then take the nano SIM out of the iPhone and install it in the Apple Watch. The Apple Watch can somewhat operate on its own. It wont share any information with your Android device as it would with an iPhone but it would be functional. ",
