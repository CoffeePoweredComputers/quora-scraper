            "answer_text": "Whether your internet service is shared with other people or not has nothing to do with your computer - it\u2019s something that your \u201crouter\u201d decides. So either your cable interface, or a wired router or a wireless WiFi router makes that decision. Generally, WiFi routers have a password - but those with Ethernet cable interfaces don\u2019t. The idea being that you can physically prevent someone from plugging a cable into your router - but you can\u2019t stop someone nearby from hooking up via WiFi. So go to your router\u2019s firmware setup (this is different for every router manufacturer - for me, I point my browser to: 192.168.1.1 - and a web page pops up with the router\u2019s interface on it\u2026and from there, I can change how it\u2019s set up\u2026but yours may work differently. From there, you COULD just remove the WiFi password - then anyone in range of your router can get onto your internet. But that\u2019s a very dangerous thing to do\u2026if they have access to that - then they can reach any machine on your local network - including things like printers and other devices that have poor security. DO NOT DO THAT!!! Instead, most routers allow you to set up more than one WiFi \u201cSSD\u201d (the name of your network). Mine usual SSD is \u201ccowshed\u201d (long story!) - and that\u2019s what I connect to (with a strong password). But for friends, I told my router to also allow access to \u201ccowshed-GUEST\u201d - which has a weak password that I tell my friends. The router is told NOT to allow people who access my Internet via \u201ccowshed-GUEST\u201d to communicate with any of the computers that enter via \u201ccowshed\u201d\u2026but I could equally have made \u201ccowshed-GUEST\u201d have no password at all - which should allow members of the general public who happen to be in range of my house use my Internet for free with no password whatever. For me, that\u2019s one step too far\u2026but that\u2019s up to you. Bottom line: It\u2019s nothing to do with Windows - you need to read the router manual. ",
