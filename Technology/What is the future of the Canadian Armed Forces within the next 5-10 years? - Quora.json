            "answer_text": "Budgets have been tight in the military for decades. At the end of the cold war, military bases were being shut down and that seemed to be doomsday for the Canadian military. I\u2019ve been to the one in Alsask, albeit not a full fledged base but I didn\u2019t know that at the time. It looked like something out of the tv show Lost. It\u2019s been 30 years since the cold war ended, and the Canadian Military is still going strong. Of course there is always doom and gloom as far as the discussion on how the size of Canada\u2019s military has decreased, but that\u2019s a good thing as far as not needing to send so many of our personnel away on peacekeeping missions, or even worse - to war. Yes, they are going to reach a crossroads in some areas in the next 5\u201310 years but no military branch will collapse. It will be onward and upward as the investment will finally be there. In answer to your consideration, enlist! Do it to learn a trade and if anything, when you get out earlier than retirement you can use that trade in the private sector like so many before you. Heck, even after retirement I have known many ex-military in their 50\u2019s going back to work and have hired a few myself. The Air Force is one of the most glaring recent cases of funding issues. Yes, they cancelled the F35s and this sets the military back. But think back to the Sea Kings. That started in the early 80\u2019s and was just resolved in the last few years. There have been mistakes with the new technology but it is an improvement and a large amount of funding. The same will happen with the F35\u2019s as there will be solid investment within the next decade. The Navy has also been plagued with the issue of the reconditioned submarines, only one of them to be exact. Its another sore spot but there are plenty of other ships in the navy and they will be around for a long time to come. They pale in comparison to the US but there is no need beyond what we currently have, and the fleet is being modernized right now. The Army is probably the safest bet as far as investment in the future, so perhaps this is the best area to enlist as you seem concerned by low morale by your question, if I am reading in to it correctly. The modern military for Canada is going to look nothing like the US as we have no interest in being a superpower. The goal for Canada is to have sufficient personnel to run peacekeeping missions in support roles and to take care of our home and native land. There is no need to fight wars as we have big brother south of us to spend on that! Anyone wanting to see what is currently in progress for the Department of National Defence should check here. ",
