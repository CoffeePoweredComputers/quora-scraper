            "answer_text": "Probably not Here are some reasons why:  Most of your work is going to be dull - It will consist of watching people who are doing nothing, listening to hours of conversations which have nothing to do with your work and it will be wasting time both useless reports and writing them as well.You have to lie to people constantly - Not just people whom you are spying on but to friends, colleagues and loved ones. Even when you know that they suspect you are lying and your lies damage the relationships, you have to continue to lie.Most of the \"intelligence\" that you gather will be useless - You could spend weeks, months or years on an operation simply to discover that your efforts were being used as a feint by your superiors to deflect attention from a more promising avenue of inquiry. Or you can discover that all of your efforts were in search of information that was readily available without all of the effort that you put into it and it is still of little or no value.You may make a single mistake and then your career is ruined - One tiny slip during a conversation or during an assignment and years of work on your career could be for naught. By telling someone something that they didn't need to know or by showing late for an operation (or dropping some evidence) your entire career could be ruined.You could easily be abandoned by your agency and that could cause your death - If you are an intelligence agent for your own government's spy agencies, you could be left behind for political expediency and you could years of your life in a  foreign prison as a result.You could be abandoned (#2) - If you are simply an asset for a foreign intelligence agency in your own country or another one, you can be abandoned at any time. They will disavow you (if they ever \"avowed\" you) and you'll spend years in prison or be executed as a result.You'll be abandoned (#3) - Years of being paranoid, of fear, of secrecy and of isolation can leave you a broken shell. Your agency will no longer need you and they may simply abandon you in a manner where what you know won't be a threat to them, but where you'll be unable to live a functioning life afterward.Your personal relationships may crumble - Spending so much time away from home and lying to those close to you (if you allow anyone TO get close to you) may result in a series of failed relationships and/or marriages. This in turn may make you an abuser of alcohol and other substances and thus a security liability to your agency. You'll be \"retired\" at that point ; either by #7 orYou'll be killed - Either by the other side or your own. In any number of horrible manners from beatings, to strangulations, to poisonings, to shootings. If you prove to be too big a problem for your agency or for your government, your death may be ordered by your superiors or by rogue elements within your agency.You'll live long enough to see information for which you may have traded relationships, your health or blood for become public knowledge - Who knows how many died keeping commonly known secrets of today, secret in the past? Who knows how many lives were ruined for information about ...say the Manhattan Project (America's program to create nuclear weapons) or concerning Corona (the first in the series of US spy satellites)? Details of both programs are publicly available today by anyone w/ Internet access and a few hours to burn, yet they consumed the lives of many keeping them secret and finding out what (if anything) others knew about them.Being a spy is likely a lonely and dull task which needs to be done.But most of the work is likely not very interesting.
