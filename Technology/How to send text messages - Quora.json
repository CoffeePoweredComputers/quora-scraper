            "answer_text": "Well I\u2019m assuming u have a smart phone correct? And full cell and data service too right? Meaning it allows u to make and receive call texts and surf the web\u2026.? Those are ur first steps. Then it will depend what type of smart phone u have as to exactly how. But basically Amongst ur smart phones already available features or apps there\u2019s a symbol usually that specifies which one are ur texts. Then click so it opens up And sorta as if in a way u were punching in that persons number to make a call to them, texts have a similar type agenda. Only difference is after u type there full area code and number in the top space where it should specify. And u then touch below where u would type out ur convo to when the keyboard pops up. Type whatever u wanted to say and then presss send and await their response. Any further questions let me know. Good luck ",
