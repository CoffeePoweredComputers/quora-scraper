            "answer_text": "No, you can\u2019t. Oculus Go is a 3 DOF device, meaning that it only perceives the rotations of your head. You can\u2019t move, there is no room scale with it. The only way to implement it would do some nerd hack, like mixing it with Vive Trackers.  They conceived this device to be ultra-cheap, so it has very few features. No 6 DOF headset costs anywhere near $200: the Vive Focus lets you move, but it costs $500-$600. ",
