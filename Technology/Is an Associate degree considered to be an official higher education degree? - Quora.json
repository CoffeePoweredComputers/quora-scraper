            "answer_text": "An Associate\u2019s degree is what it is. It represents a credential beyond a high school diploma. If you choose the right Associate\u2019s degree, it will be a much better investment than many bachelor\u2019s degrees. Dr. Kevin Fleming in his book, (RE)Defining the Goal: The True Path to Career Readiness in the 21st Century, explains where many well-paying jobs are hidden in plain sight: \u201cThe true ratio of jobs in our economy is 1:2:7. For every occupation that requires a master\u2019s degree or more, two professional jobs require a university degree, and there are over a half a dozen jobs requiring a 1-year certificate or a 2-year degree, and each of these technicians is in very high-skilled areas in high demand.\u201d I live two miles from a community college. One of my favorite programs there leads to an Associate\u2019s Degree certifying graduates to install and maintain robots. The maximum cost to earn this degree would be $10,000 however some of the classes are free\u2014government grants. The jobs are full time with benefits--$25/hour. There is one serious problem\u2014very little interest. The class sizes run 3-4 students. There is a mechatronics program at Gateway Community and Technical College in Northern Kentucky. The technology is incredible. The state and local industries have invested millions. They have the capacity to train 200. They graduated 27 students last spring\u2014no interest. Local industries are not happy. Another local school, Great Oaks Community College, has dropped their plumbing certification\u2014no interest. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, an Associate degree shows that you\u2019ve taken some college level courses. Some Community Colleges, inc. Washtenaw Community College, grant the Associate Degree upon high schoolers who go through their accredited high school program. A lot of people would say that a B.A. or B.S. is the basic college degree. An Associate degree depends on the type of courses you took. A qualified welder or tool & die person with an Associate degree is viewed \u201chigher\u201d or \u201cmore qualified\u201d than someone who at age 18 got the Associate with high school graduation.
