            "answer_text": "Depends on the resolution you choose. It takes a specific amount of memory to display at a specific resolution. Increase the resolution, and increase the amount of video memory needed to display it. So, if your laptop is displaying natively at 1366 x 768, and you switch to using an external monitor and you choose to use that same resolution, and you are only using the external monitor, then you will use the same amount of memory to do the job. Increase the resolution on the external monitor, and the video chipset will use more shared memory. That memory has to come from somewhere, right? It means that Windows has a little less to work with. Now, we aren\u2019t talking about a huge increase, but it is there. So\u2026 *CAN* it affect performance? Certainly. Now you know how. And\u2026 there should be a Function key on your laptop that will switch between display modes\u2026 Internal, Both, and External\u2026 in reference to the display choice. As in.. when you have an external monitor attached, you would hold the Fn key down, and tap the appropriate F1-F12 key. As to which key specifically, that depends on the make and model laptop of course. Your user manual, available for download from the manufacturer\u2019s product support page, can detail exactly which key will do this. ",

            "answer_text": "based on author comment - YES Why? 14\u2033 means you\u2019ll work on 1080p resolution (99.9% certainty )- there\u2019s the slim chance that you\u2019ll spend money on 4k display, but on 14\u2033 it will be hard to see the difference - unless you keep your nose overing about 20 centimeters from the screen. 24\u2033 for \u201cgraphic design\u201d means you need to have higher resolution, 4k/uhd/2160p or better. (and good color reproduction.) If you skimp on this, then you\u2019re not serious about graphic design - 1080p will be blurry on standard pc sitting distance so quick math tells us that when connecting 2160p(4k) screen to laptop with 1080p resolution, GPU has to generate 4 times the pixel count compared to built in screen 4times means 4x GPU usage, 4xGPU memory usage. if this laptop has only intel gpu, then 4x GPU memory usage gets \u2018taken\u2019 from regular memory(RAM) - leaving you with less memory for i.e. cad/adobe - which will leave you with slower response in projects. On top of that, intel gpu would heat up more, meaning cpu would throttle a bit sooner, making rendering (and response) time slightly longer dedicated gpu would make those things less noticeable, but unless you\u2019ll invest in laptop with separate cooling for both cpu and gpu (like some gaming models get advertised), slightly more work for gpu means slightly more heat, which will leave slightly less performance for your work - though, as i said, with dedicated gpu you wouldn\u2019t notice it ",
