All the transactions that takes place in terms of money or can be calculated in terms of money are economic activities. For example if you went to a shop & purchased a Nutella for you then this is an economic activity as you paid the price or the money in exchange for the commodity that you have purchased. But when your mother cooks the food at home & you eat it. you don't pay anything in return to her as she will never demand for it hence this is a non-economic activity or transaction. There are three types of Economic Activities- Profession- these economic activities are incurred by professionals like Doctors , Lawyers, Chartered Accountants etc. They provide their services to their clients or people as they have a special knowledge about a particular subject. So they charge in return to their services.

            "answer_text": "It depends. \u201cEconomic activity\u201d in strictest sense is any activity that creates measurable value (i.e. is remunerated). In other words, anything you do for money or anything you pay money for. The sum of everything that is done with this activity in a country in a year (all the value added), is the Gross Domestic Product. It can be measured in many ways, none of which match each other perfectly. Keeps statisticians busy. \u201cEconomic activity\u201d in a statistician\u2019s (or a bureaucrat\u2019s) language is a way to classify those activities by nature, to tax and measure them accordingly. Without classification there is no analysis\u2026 \u201cEconomic activity\u201d in a taxman\u2019s language usually means any regular activity that produces income. Getting paid to mow your uncle\u2019s lawn or write a single blog post or teach a single karate masterclass is not economic activity. Doing it more than occassionally is. Ubering, in any shape, is beginning to be recognized as economic activity (as it is). If you work at something that does not generate objectively measurable value (as in, it does not generate a wage or price for someone) it is not an economic activity. Painting a masterpiece that never gets sold nor accounted for, is not economic activity. Developing the world\u2019s best artificial intelligence algorithm for free (in your off-hours) is not economic activity. \u201cEconomic activity\u201d in a wider sense refers to the \u201crobustness\u201d of an economy or the frequency of economic transactions, not so much the volume (GDP) as the intensity of transactions relative to that volume. If the money supply is stable (not now), the money velocity is almost a reasonable indicator of the way activity is going. \u201cEconomic activity rate\u201d is the part of the population that wants to work (people in the market for a job).
