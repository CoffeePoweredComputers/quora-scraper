            "answer_text": "What do you think Google are? A software company? NoAn IT company? NoA web browsing company? NoA search engine company? No If you look at where Google get their money - they are the worlds largest advertising company! 95% of their revenue comes from advertisers. So you and I - are not Googles customers. Googles customers, are the advertisers.You and I - are the products that Google sell to advertisers. They make people into products, by pretending that everything they do is free, and altruistic, and done with a \u2018Do No Evil\u2019 mindset (this is their company motto). The truth is - that as we find a nearby coffee shop by a Google Search, and drive there via Google maps, and pay with Google Pay, and sit watching a Google Youtube video, or playing a Google Store app - the entire endeavour from Googles point of view, was to harvest all of that information from you.They need to know where you are, and what you\u2019re doing at all times, they need to watch every moment of your lives because that\u2019s how they provide the value to advertisers. Microsoft are a software company. They simply make things with software and sell things with software. Google has marketed this as evil - and people are starting to realise that this is nonsense. The predicted demise of Microsoft has not happened, and quite the opposite is now true. Google need people to CONSUME content and not CREATE it - because creating content takes away their control. Hence Google Chromebooks - the dumbing down of a PC to be a browser. So Googles competition is anything that empowers people to use their computers to create content, and allows them to do things outside of the google ecosystem. ",

            "answer_text": "Not many can compete with Google in the search engine space. With 92.96% of the global search engine market share, Google clearly dominates the playing field. However, its most threatening competition may come from search engines within websites and apps that offer more than just searches, such as those of Amazon and Facebook. In the fiercely competitive and profitable world of online search, Google dominates in the United States with a 62.5% share of the web search market.Microsoft sites (Bing) and Verizon Media (Yahoo) come in second and third in U.S. web search market share, capturing 24.7% and 11.5% respectively.Google faces indirect competition for Internet dominance from search engines within Amazon and Facebook, especially as people bypass Google altogether and use these sites for their searches.",

            "answer_text": "The only thing Google is indisputably dominant in is search and the associated data mining/advertising. In mobile OS, iOS competes. In mobile or computing hardware, they are actually a pretty small player. In cloud, they are middle of the pack. In tablets/laptops they compete with budget Windows computers (but are a small player in general vs. Windows). Google is also now entering the video game industry with Stadia, we\u2019ll see how that goes but there\u2019s really stiff competition. Even things like self driving cars has competition\u2026 so yeah, there\u2019s plenty of competition for the company in general. ",
