            "answer_text": "DISCLAIMER:- The information that has used to prepare the answer is collected from different websites from the internet, eBooks & articles. People are aware of the senses that they have. But now in the world of technology, the demand of people is the use the technology as their sixth sense which in other word is to bridge the gap between two worlds namely digital and real. DEFINITION:- Power of perception seemingly independent of the five senses which are hear, touch, smell, sight and taste. REASON FOR DEVELOPMENT:- Compel the technology to adapt people\u2019s environment. People would then be able to stand up from the chair in front of the computer monitor and would enjoy the re-al world at the same time interacting with the digital device using it as their extra sense i.e. the sixth sense. INVENTORS & DEVELOPERS:- Idea behind this marvelous technology was started in 1990\u2019s by STEVE MANN at MIT when he was Media Lab student, who actually proposed first wearable computer. First proposed head worn projector and camera in 1994, then he developed it and proposed neck worn projector and camera during 1998.  After Mann, the concept was developed further by PRANAV MISTRY { the Head of Think Tank Team and Director of Research of Samsung Research America} when he was a Research Assistant and PhD candidate at the MIT.  HISTORY OF DEVELOPMENT:- The first archetype of the sixth sense was very much bigger and was not working properly to use daily so they came out with a modified neck worn type which was like a pendant.  Steve Mann wearing a camera projector dome in 1998. But later on mistry switched up with a smaller projector and created the pendant prototype to be worn around the neck. The archetype was built from an ordinary webcam and a battery-powered 3M projector, with an attached mirror and all connected to an internet-enabled mobile phone. There are several projects which got inspiration or somewhat based on the sixth sense i.e. THE INVISIBLE COMPUTER MOUSE. There are various applications of six sense technology in educational purpose like a practical classroom, which can be conducted anywhere, anytime with the help of six sense technology which will help us to create more stimulating learning environment. HARDWARE:- There are some components required to use the sixth sense gizmo, these are following 1) CAMERA \u2013 digital eye of the system. 2) PROJECTOR \u2013 augment the physical object , wall or anything else. 3) MIRROR \u2013 reverts the projection coming out from the projector 4) MICROPHONE - to listen the audio effect when we use the paper as a surface 5) MOBILE COMPUTING DEVICE - processing device in user\u2019s pocket, all the above components are connected to it wires or wireless. 6) Color Markers- these are necessary in order to make camera understand the position of the finger. Users\u2019 fingers are marked with red, yellow, green and blue colored tape which helps the camera to recognize the hand gestures that act as an interaction instruction for the projected application interfaces. APPLICATION:- There are several application of this technology in our day to day life. 1) MAKE A CALL-  2) SEARCH FOR THE MAP \u2013  3) DRAWING APPLICATION -  4) TAKE A PICTURE \u2013  THERE IS A LOT OF INFORMATION IS AVAILABLE ABOUT THE SIXTH SENSE TECHNOLOGY BUT ONLY THE SOME VITAL POINTS ARE DISCUSSED BY ME IN THIS ANSWER. THERE ARE TWO IMPORTANT LINKS YOU REQUIRED PRANAV MISTRY TED TALK:- The thrilling potential of SixthSense technologyPRANAV MISTRY:- Pranav Mistry - WikipediaTHANK YOU FOR READING . ",
