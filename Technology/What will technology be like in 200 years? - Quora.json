            "answer_text": "We have gone through an enormous period of technological expansion because after the industrial revolution, we discovered new ways to get the world to work for us, and not the other way around. Back then developing technology was low cost, with high reward in efficiency, but we have started to approach our optimal solutions, meaning the way we do things, is a really good way to do it and to do it more efficiently would cost a ton in research and development. This leads to abandoned technologies. We are constantly discovering nanomaterials, robotics, rocket, and tons of amazing stuff, that companies cannot implement, because the cost isn\u2019t worth the reward in efficiency. We are doing things really well as it is, and doing it better isn\u2019t worth it. This slowing will continue until we make an incredibly fantastic new breakthrough in technology that will inspire a new golden age of creation. This could be anything from AI technology, to genetically engineered super-organisms, to super nano-materials, or a new era of space colonization. Without this, I predict we will have colonies on the moon, mars, be mining asteroids, but very little will change in our day to day life, besides using electricity for everything, computer-integration, and expansion in VR technology. These technologies, space exploration, Electric energy sources, VR, and AI technology, in my opinion have not reached their optimum, and so will continue to expand. If we make a golden age breakthrough though, we cannot even imagine the things we\u2019ll be able to do. We could be immortal, or living in virtual societies, or even colonizing the universe. Anything could be possible. ",

            "answer_text": "Let\u2019s focus on some hard problems that seem very easy at the moment. Log in to your account. The way you type your login details should be enough to know who you are.  At the moment you need to switch to your device, take a picture of your face or scan your fingerprint to have a second factor authentication. By using keystroke dynamics, we are now able to authenticate someone. Typing biometrics is unique to each individual person, no two people type the same. And this technology exists now with the use of ML. So what will technology be in 200 years, it will be very easy to use. That is how I see the future. ",

But nanotechnology, virtual reality, teleportation, molecular computation with holographics, space colonies, space wars, lunar and Martian mining, nanobots infused into our bloodstreams to attack every and all plaque, consume pre-cancers, etc.,, ultra-fast solar generation of electricity with zero intermittencies and extra storage capacities in trillions of watts, etc. Too science-fictional ? Then lets wait until 2220. ",
