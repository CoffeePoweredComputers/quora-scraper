            "answer_text": "Like any act between two consenting people (going to dinner, going to a movie, having sex, working on a project together or anything else) the experience for a woman getting fisted can be good or it can be bad. When the experience involves two people who have desire and the knowledge how to properly do it then women like getting fisted a great deal. It is something like nothing else you can experience and can be intensely pleasurable. If it is to be intensely pleasurable for you; you must first prepare yourself mentally to want to be fisted and then you need a partner who will read up on how to do it properly and who will tune into you and your pleasure rather than be full of him or herself wanting only to do what they want in the way they want to do it. Fisting is a dance between two or more people where there is a flow needed between all that requires proper preparation to fully enjoy it and maximize your pleasure and desire for it. ",
