            "answer_text": "I hope so. We should definately keep using them more. In most of asia they are actually a regular feature in public life, for common illnesses like the flu. Conscious, Responsible Behaviour about Contagious Diseases should not be reserved for times of epidemic. Wearing face masks against viruses is only one example of that. FYI - Did you know you caught the bacteria responsible for tooth decay and gum disease from another person\u2019s mouth at some point in your life? Now how do you feel about people with a mouth full of decay who don\u2019t bother to brush their teeth because they\u2019re already done for? Back to respiratory illness and face masks \u2026 As a rural dweller, living 60km from town and travelling into town for groceries once every 3 weeks as my normal life, I do have an acute awareness of the way colds and flu spread. Every time our family gets get a cold it is straight after a trip to town \u2026 of course it has to be, we\u2019ve lived in \u2018lockdown\u2019 as our normal existence for 20 years. So in our lifestyle, our close social contacts stand out, and we know where we got a virus when we do. Often we catch a cold if we\u2019ve heard someone with one nearby. Our discussions after town trips frequently include \u201cI heard someone coughing in Pak\u2019n\u2019Save yesterday \u2026\u201d or \u201cIt\u2019s probably psychosomatic but I\u2019ve got a sore throat and we\u2019ve just been to town \u2026\u201d When I notice there is a sick person in a store, I keep an ear on them and navigate around, almost subconsciously rearranging my planned shopping list order to keep in the other side of the store. If successful, generally you don\u2019t get sick, but sometimes you just get trapped in the same aisle, and sure enough probably get sick a couple days later. That person could have worn a mask in public. In hindsight, I think it would be helpful to carry disposable masks, and just put one on if you hear a sick person in the shop. If face masks became a regular feature in public, perhaps we could approach that person and offer them a mask too. Last year I don\u2019t think that would have been possible. If I\u2019d walked up to a common cold victim and offered them a disposable mask to help prevent spreading their illness around, I think it would have caused great offence. As a culture, that\u2019s not right, logical, or constructive. As a species, we should be more conscious, at all times, of the diseases we may be carrying. We have immune compromised patients living among us. I\u2019ll finish with 3 examples I remember from everyday, pre-COVID life where we (humans) could have done better. #1 \u2026 in the grocery store a child, a girl of about 10 trotting miserably along after her mum clutching a box of tissues, trying to catch her sneezes and breathing through her mouth, with red eyes, flushed skin, holding her head like it ached, and already showing dry flaky skin on her poor red nose. I maintained a roughly 2 meter distance, and although I did end up walking past in the same aisle twice, I consciously timed my breathing to naturally exhale while passing and luckily enough didn\u2019t catch it. I also gave her a sympathetic smile and a thumbs up (she smiled back), and at our next pass I quietly said Cheer up, it seems like you\u2019re at the worst of it so you\u2019ll feel better soon \u2026 However, she simply shouldn\u2019t have been brought to the store by her mother. It is irresponsible to bring a disease carrier into a public place at the peak of their contagion. #2 \u2026 Two people visited us to buy a goat, involving a 30 minute chat at 1 metre social distance outdoors in the open air. I noticed one had a dry raw nose from too much blowing and, naturally not wanting to catch it, kept more upwind. I somehow managed to ask (awkward!) if he\u2019d had a cold recently \u2026 \u201cYes, actually today was the first day I felt up to going out\u201d, but it seems they never even thought about transferring it to us, and I didn\u2019t know how to say it. Unable to communicate \u201cthey\u2019re contagious!!\u201d to my father for fear of causing them offence, he stayed in the firing line as it were \u2026 so 2 days later Dad has a nasty cold \u2026 and then gives it to me 2 days after that anyway. #3. \u2026 I was travelling on an intercity bus with a coughing person sucking throat lozenges seated 4 rows back on the other side. Over the 3 hour drive I contracted that virus, it was a doozy too it literally took my voice away! PLEASE \u2026 YES, let\u2019s ALL keep using Face Masks as a Regular Occurrence in Public \u2018even after\u2019 COVID-19. If we don\u2019t, we\u2019re just all too stupid for words. Don\u2019t worry though \u2026 COVID-21 will sort us out in that case. Lol. ",

            "answer_text": "The need for masks and distancing will come and go as hotspots develop and play through. The virus will likely wax and wane all over the globe for years. The sheer number of people who would need a vaccine, once developed, staggers the imagination. It's not just one age range + travelers, as with our existing flu viruses and other established diseases. It's everybody in the world. Because eventually the virus will get to everybody. Even with an effective vaccine, there are people who can't tolerate vaccines, and there are anti vaxxers. And very poor people in remote areas. Just in the US, we have our regular citizens and we have illegals. Can we convince all of them to show up for a jab in the arm? How will we know we've gotten enough of them to make a difference? I fear that could get very ugly between untreated illegals and fear among the rest of the population. The virus will continue to mutate, because that's what viruses do. If we're lucky it will mutate to a form that does not affect humans, they way plagues of old did. But it's not confined to a single continent, so it's not like a local mutation will save the whole world. Our easy worldwide travel works against us. This thing spread really far, really fast. The Chinese did their best, but it had already traveled across the globe by the time they clamped down, and it seemed like most other countries were a bit shell-shocked and, in some cases, in severe denial with their response. Right now, in the middle of the pandemic, with our fall and winter phase beginning, plenty of people are not only not wearing masks, they are declaring the pandemic an overblown hoax. Because that's what you have to do if you can't admit your government has conducted a lame and ineffective response. You pretend 200,000 deaths and counting in the US alone is normal and just how it is *shrug*. As much as people think we are bottoming out right now, with economies struggling, companies going out of business, school children on hold or trying to deal with chaotic and unsatisfactory setups, I think it's going to be a long time before things get back to anything like normal.

            "answer_text": "The actual question would be: \u2018Will Covid-19 last more than necessary.?\u2019 To answer this we need to look at the the historical background of certain flu viral infection. The Spanish influenza that occurred in the early 19th century claimed a lot of lives. But it did not last for long. Today Healthcare systems have improved considerably and so are the ways to tackle flue related illnesses. While Covid-19 remains without a cure, it may not last or more than a few years. If it does, it will not be as lethal as it is now. The only challenge with this strain is that it may have been developed in some kind of sophisticated biology laboratory by some cruel scientists and deliberately spread to communities. My assertion may be correct or not. But let's suppose it's correct, this will mean that the engineers of this species may have developed it with a mind that it last for long and cause a lot of havoc and financial implications along its paths. In this instance it will mean that we will have to learn to coexist with this virus so more than required. In this way, masks will be a norm and not an exception. I think I tried to address your question. Sorry about some speculations in my answers. ",
