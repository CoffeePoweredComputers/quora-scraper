            "answer_text": "24 Hours in the Life of IT Professionals 5:30 AM: Dragged to consciousness by alarm clock. Pulled out of wonderful dream where Vista desktop upgrade went without a hitch. 3:30 PM: VP of Sales stops in office to show off new iPhone. Wants IT to support it. If you've ever watched the hit TV series \u201c24\u201d on Fox you may understand the direction I\u2019m going in with this article. If not, let me clue you in. The show follows the events of some dastardly terrorist attack and the intrepid federal agent Jack Bauer\u2019s attempt to foil the bad guys. But these events always track within a 24 hour period and neatly wrap up in the final hour of that day. IT professionals only wish they could nicely wrap up all their project work and the fires they must extinguish within a 24-hour period. As in \u201c24,\u201d technology can greatly enhance our ability to resolve difficult tasks quickly. However, technology can also wreak havoc because of security intrusions, viruses, poorly trained personnel and overworked, tired IT workers trying to accomplish too much in too little time. Despite all this technology at your finger tips, do you ever feel like there are simply not enough hours in the day to get to even half of the tasks on your daily to-do list? Well, join the club. Today\u2019s IT worker is truly stretched to squeeze every valuable minute out of every hour that races by each day. With short-handed technical staffs working in a global environment, the stress levels of IT workers are being pushed to extremes. I thought the best way to illustrate this was to walk through a typical day of an IT manager. This may or may not resonate with other IT professionals, but hopefully it will illustrate how 24 hours can rocket past anyone working in IT. 05:30 \u2013 Dragged to consciousness by alarm clock. Pulled out of wonderful dream where Vista desktop upgrade went without a hitch. Back to reality and off to the office. 06:00 \u2013 Check the Blackberry while waiting for the traffic report to see if any system status alerts went out overnight and if the offshore development team in an opposite time zone has sent in their deliverables. Good news: no traffic issues. Bad news: a slew of system alerts and no deliverables in the inbox 06:30 \u2013 Can\u2019t find seat on subway. Balanced between the masses and manage to send an email to offshore counterpart to see what the hold up is. While waiting for response, dig into backpack (no respectable IT professional carries a brief case any more, do they?) and pull out latest IT trade rag. 08:30 \u2013 Roll into the office later than usual thanks to a subway snag. Receive email from offshore manager explaining that build didn\u2019t work. Now testers in US office will get to surf the Web all day. Must quickly prepare for 09:00 staff meeting. Shouldn\u2019t have read the trade rag on the subway. 09:00 \u2013 Start staff meeting with bad news. Budget cuts have killed a pending software purchase that would have saved the team many hours in predicting and troubleshooting network issues. This means more after-hour support calls from irate users complaining about slow applications. End meeting on a positive note by announcing retirement of our biggest pain in the rear end-user. Everyone agrees that this helps offset the software budget loss. 10:30 \u2013 Meet with CIO to discuss business intelligence initiative. Selected vendor was recently purchased by Oracle after team just finished migration of all databases to Microsoft SQL Server. CIO asks if the contract can be voided and wants an answer by end of day. Time to call in the lawyers. Had plans to meet a friend for lunch. Plans cancelled. Having lunch with lawyers instead. 12:30 \u2013 Review contracts with lawyers over lunch in office. Determine contract cannot be voided. 13:30 \u2013 VP of Sales stops in office to show off new iPhone. Wants IT to support it. While explaining reasons for standardizing on Blackberry, VP of Sales downloads a new ringtone and then states he appreciates the support team making an exception for him. He nonchalantly strolls out of the office blaring his new ringtone. 14:00 \u2013 Deliver annual review to underperforming employee who pulls out a salary survey to show how underpaid she is. 14:45 - Lunch of cardboard-like pizza plus dizzying lawyer speak, and a soured annual review leads to every IT person\u2019s favorite afternoon snack: Tums. 15:00 \u2013 Do research on BI alternatives on the Web just in case lawyers change mind. Web access sure seems slow. Network monitoring software sure would have been nice. 15:30 \u2013 Person on-call goes home with flu. Ask for volunteer to cover tonight. No takers. Assign on-call to team member who feels underpaid. Just because. 17:00 \u2013 Finally have time to check email. About 125 new emails since morning, not to mention five new voice mails. Cherry pick messages to respond to and pray nothing important was missed. (Helps that the CIO\u2019s emails are highlighted in red) 18:00 \u2013 On way out of office, \u201cjokingly\u201d called a slacker by one of my colleagues. After amazingly settling into a seat on the subway, pull out laptop to work on weekly status report for the CIO. Had to put away laptop after a few minutes to give up seat to pregnant lady. (I wanted to show IT people have a heart too!) 20:00 \u2013 Home in time to have wife hand cranky baby over with a \u201cShe is all yours.\u201d Turn on noise machine (the lovely sound of artificial rain falling helps baby \u2013 and sometimes adults \u2013 stay asleep). After finally rocking her to sleep, a deep, very loud buzzing sound comes through the noise machine. Baby starts crying. Darn Blackberry GSM noise interference! 21:00 \u2013 Woof down frozen burritos. Conclude microwave is better invention than Blackberry. 22:00 \u2013 Conference call with offshore team to figure out what happened with the build. Some typhoon has hit the offshore office. Realize disaster recovery plan didn\u2019t have contingencies for that team. Another day of Web surfing for the testers tomorrow. 01:00 - Head hits the pillow! But before blissful sleep can end the day, a realization flashes across the strained brain that the weekly status report is not finished thanks to being nice to the pregnant lady. Start to rationalize it can be done on the subway, but no guarantee of a seat. So back down stairs, open the laptop and crank out the status report. 02:00 \u2013 Sweet dreams. Unless of course the dreams are about tomorrow. Or maybe dream about being an intrepid IT manager and saving the day? ",

            "answer_text": "Today\u2019s Reality In IT Sector:- IT Sector holds the beauty for the youth. Behind the screen the scene is like as follows: IT ppl don\u2019t want to work for those long hours, for ample amount as a salary. But can\u2019t do anything because doing job as an IT professional becomes trend today, which was drawn by the people in retrospect. But in today\u2019s cut throat competition,in this sector, we have to give best out of it, each day. This is the race of \u201csurvival of the fittest\u201d. Facts: You have to work for a month but the sad part is that, you get paid for a week. Rest of your salary is invested on you,by giving you facilities like cab and pretty social environment. (Still company tries as much as of cost cuttings on its employees.)You will get only 30% hike when you switch the company. (In rare cases it might be much than that, it depends on knowledge & Exp.).Constantly have to struggle for the rest of your life. But don\u2019t worry you will not be able to realise it,because of your already built-up thought process.This One is for MALE: You will not get a \u201cilliterate beautiful girl\u201d for marriage, if you will not work in IT company. Hope you ppl got this one.Illusions: You will get BMW,Audi.(It may be possible but near to 50\u2019s)You will plan a trip to go abroad with your parents.Expected peaceful life.Realities: You will get a quality standard of living.Weekend is like fun till 30\u2019s.Good Social Life.Busy in daily life, leads to live apart from parents.In the end \u201conce again people started working with the work they don\u2019t want to work, to impress people they don\u2019t like, to spend money on the things they don\u2019t want to buy.\u201d-think wisely creations.
