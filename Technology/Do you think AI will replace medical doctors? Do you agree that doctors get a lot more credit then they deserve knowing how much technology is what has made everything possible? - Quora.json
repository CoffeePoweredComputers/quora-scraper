            "answer_text": "In the early nineties I did my studies with researchers who do AI in medicine (I did research in the environmental field, but was hanging around with the guys who were in the medicine). Their diagnosing models for some medical conditions were at the time performing worse than the specialists but far better than general practice doctors. Human doctors were continuously failing to diagnose patients with multiple illnesses as they over-focused on only one of them. And most of the models were simple enough to be represented by a straightforward yes/no checklist so they could be directly used by the doctors at least as a sort of decision making support. Of course, the doctors did NOT use the models as they refused to believe the decision making could be that simple and that diagnosing can not be done without intuition. They were correct, the models were far from perfect, but still better than most general practitioners. I do not remember exactly how did the patients accept the models but as those were the days before Google, I doubt the massive self-diagnosing was popular yet. As with chess, AI will definitely outperform doctors soon and is outperforming them at the moment in many tasks. But general acceptance and use will be much higher hurdle to jump, and strong resistance from the professional community is probable. And seeing anti-vaccine movement today, I am sure the \u201canti-AI\u201d movements will soon become popular with the patients, too. In the long term, I believe AI diagnosing will be as common in the hospitals as an ultrasound, but the doctors will still be running the show. Not only the examination is still manual to some extent but the patients will probably always prefer a human to work with them. So if someone considers entering a medical school today, she/he will definitely not be obsolete until retirement. But in 100 years, who knows? ",

            "answer_text": "In few instances it might act as substitute but generally not. The reason is very simple, the human element involved in diagnosis in any dept is much higher than any other field. I will give you few examples 1)Suppose a patient comes to you in our country i. e. India with fever. You did all tests, they are negative. No history of contact with TB. Still maximum physicians will start ATT(Anti tuberculosis therapy) in that patient, as by experience we have known that any fever in which all tests are normal, TB is of high probability. Do you think AI will really think of it. It will only think what is fed in it and will rely more on investigation(whether it will examine or not, tell about hepatomegaly or not etc I don't know). 2) There is a word called sick looking. You will find many patients in OPD who are vitally normal but they are sick looking i. e. Not looking good. I don't know about other dept but on many diseases in Pediatric this is one of the very important criteria for getting alarmed. How can AI, identify it I don't know. 3)Medicine is not maths or physics where you will have discrete answers. You will have to apply your brain and anticipate things. Many times especially in ICU doctors can anticipate things and work accordingly. E.g a child having gasping type respiration needs to be intubated whatever his ABG is. Since AI relies more on values, I think they will miss many such things. 4)A doctor has to not only deal with patient but their attendants also. He has to make them understand in simple language and councel them. It's not a Google form where you have to tick I accept and everything will be fine. 5)Even in OPD you will find many patients of gastritis, diffuse body ache etc in which there is no proper history. They talk meaningless. We have to derive its meaning by our examination. 6)Yes its right that to some extent Radiology and Pathology might get affected by it as these branches are based on discrete values and figures however its a distant reality and long path has still to be covered.

AI is set to have a massive impact on jobs across every industry in the coming years, and healthcare is no exception, but previous posts on this topic are spot on \u2013 it won\u2019t replace doctors (or lawyers or other professionals). What it will do is support them by taking on the more mundane, predictable, formulaic decision processes enabling them to focus on higher value, more complex tasks. In the case of medicine, AI will prove massively more capable than any individual could ever be at predictive support where knowledge of countless previous case histories and studies helps to improve statistical diagnostics. This is already happening. The medical profession is likely to change radically in response to this, but I believe to everyone\u2019s benefit as clinicians will be able to direct their skills to the still endless demand for areas of medicine that AI can\u2019t touch, be that trauma care, emotional support, complex surgery, investigating less common conditions, research etc. etc. As to the second part of the original question \u2013 this has already been capably answered: The premise that the tools we use in some way diminish the respect warranted by those highly skilled in their deployment is flawed.

Algorithms are being developed to accurately diagnoses, stage the disease and also suggest the best line of treatment. There is a laser machine developed in germany which can laser the retina without much intervention from the doctor.

            "answer_text": "AI cannot replace doctors so easily. Few points to think. Healthcare AI machines are the software model built with the combination of Engineers, Doctors an Data scientist.Recent Popular AI research from Google is headed by a Doctor. Lily Peng, MD, PhD - World Medical Innovation Forum BOSTONMedical field is so wide with countless number of diseases and varieties. It varies with region, ethnic, gene, etc. It is very tough to build the AI system for diagnosing each one of them.But AI can help/assist doctors in generation/compilation/evaluation of reports and let them make better diagnosis.I personally feel, most of the successful doctors diagnose it based on their experience and intuition .The beauty of the qualified doctor is their ability to retain so many things in their mind for a moment and make diagnosis out of it. AI should be used constructively to assist them rather than replacing them.",

            "answer_text": "The two parts of your question don't add up. You ask if doctors will be replaced by AI, so you're presumably acknowledging that this is not yet possible, in other words, that doctors can offer something which \u2018technology\u2019 cannot yet do? In the second part you ask if doctors get too much credit because technology does all the work. You have answered your own second part of the question. ",
