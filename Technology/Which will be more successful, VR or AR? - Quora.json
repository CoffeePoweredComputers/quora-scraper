In 2015 and 2016, VR was on the cusp of the new trend, but the industry turned into a very low point last year, a lot of companies went bankrupt or shut down, while some survived and became today\u2019s industrial pioneers. Although the VR industry is still in the valley currently, it is rising steadily. As the technology develops, devices such as VR headsets and VR cameras are getting more affordable and providing a better experience, data transmission becomes faster, the barrier to produce and enjoy VR content is lower than what it was before, which allow more people get access to enjoy VR content. After they get to know VR, the demand for more quality VR content would grow, which stimulus the expansion of VR market. The future of VR content is to be more interactive and engaging. The earlier virtual reality was almost exclusively gaming trend, but VR game and videos have an implicit boundary. The main theme is to engage the audience. Unlike the traditional film viewers who passively accept the information that the filmmakers want to convey, the audience who wears VR headsets can interact with the story to decide the direction of the story. In other words, the ending depending on how the audiences choose in the interactive components. Therefore, the audiences become the characters and have the power to control the VR stories. The global virtual reality market size was valued at USD 960.9 million in 2016 and expected an exponential growth over the forecast period from 2014-2025, said Grand View Research. The projected market potential benefits from diverse and affordable VR devices, and its ability to be incorporated into the widespread application from commercial to medical fields. The considerable market potential attracts many tech companies to share the big pie. Although the VR market is highly dynamic, the competition is also very intense, requiring the tech companies to upgrade their products consistently.  Image retrieved from Statista Virtual reality is a hot topic in the field of science and technology. It is assumed that the cost of hardware and the complexity of production are the obstructions for the massive adoption of virtual reality. However, the experts from the VR industry have different opinions. Virtual reality is an underestimated field that could bring changes to medical therapy, professional training, and life experiences for both consumers and business beyond videos and games.

            "answer_text": "It all depends on the application. If I said what\u2019s best, oil or wine, it will depend on the application. If you put motor oil in your wine glass, or red wine in your engine, it\u2019s not going to go well. Ultimately, AR will probably be used more; I think (20+ years) AR contact lenses or (near term) AR glasses may become ubiquitous, although there are physical constraints with AR glasses that are lightweight, show a sharp, clear, image. VR is great for total immersion. AR is great for adding information to the world we already currently live in. Both have their uses. I DO think AR may eventually be a bigger market than VR, just because you can only stay in VR for so long. Gartner seems to think VR will mature quicker than AR, interestingly: Top Trends in the Gartner Hype Cycle for Emerging Technologies, 2017 - Smarter With Gartner ",
