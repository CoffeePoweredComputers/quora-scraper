            "answer_text": "In my experience very few managers understood innovation and creativity. They seem to base their behavior on conserving their income and status and trying to maintain respect in order to get to the next job review for a raise. Looking good and innovation generally are opposing problems. Innovation always has risk, managers do not want to risk their position in the company. In my opinion this is one reason why companies get intellectually stuck. It is also reasonable that wealthy companies may experiment with a new product by starting a subsidiary company under a new name in order to isolate the risk. 3M was offered plain paper copying from Haloid Corporation. 3M refused. Xerox was formed. 3M could have dominated the plain paper copy market but stayed with their thermal process. Medtronic was offered Lithium battery technology in 1972 and refused because of the risk. Cardiac Pacemakers Inc and Intermedics were formed to take advantage of Lithium technology. Cardiac Pacemakers was sold by Eli Lilly to Boston Scientific for $ 26 Billion $ Cardiac Pacemakers was offered a Pyrolytic Carbon Heart Valve, they refused saying that the market was too small. St Jude Medical was formed to build the Pyrolytic bileaflet valve. St Jude was ultimately sold to Abbot for $26 Billion$ Innovation has very high risks, generally the managers are afraid of the risks. For large companies with a large war chest it is much less risky hence easier to study a potential takeover target and buy it in order to \u201cinnovate\u201d Reminder here that innovating by inventing a product requires marketing and building a method to sell it. Truly innovative products may take years to find customers. This is another reason why large companies seek operating businesses. Acquisition has much lower risks and sales numbers are available to the potential buyer. ",

            "answer_text": "Troubleshooting the lack of innovation can often be quite a complicated situation as innovation is affected by tons of different factors, such as organizational culture, organizational structure and related processes, the tools and capabilities it employs, as well as the strategy it has chosen. I generally recommend innovation managers to look at the topic in light of these four aspects.  Usually the challenges in one area lead to another one, so what you have to do first, is to figure out the root cause of your problems.  For example, your organizational structure can be highly hierarchical and it might be no one\u2019s job to come up with new ideas and products or to figure out ways to grow the business. In this case the organization obviously won\u2019t have the capabilities to execute on innovation and any innovative spark the culture might have previously had will likely burn out soon. However, in this case, the likely root cause would actually be strategy. If the organization is only focused on doing the same thing as always before and isn\u2019t interested in putting much emphasis on improvement or in renewing themselves, any rational manager will then organize the structures to do just that as efficiently possible to save on costs. Of course, this kind of an approach is unlikely to lead to new innovation, so the solution would be to first reshape the strategy, then start working on the rest of the aspects one-by-one.  For more on the topic, I\u2019d recommend this quite extensive article that I wrote on the topic: Innovation Management \u2013 Definition, Processes, Frameworks and More. ",

            "answer_text": "In my opinion, managers know how innovation organizations have to look theoretically. They know the lists of characteristics from management books, but most of them are misunderstood. On the one hand, easy-to-like behavior could be really useful, but it is not enough to help the company to be more innovative. Firstly, the managers have to welcome failure but realize the incompetence immediately. Companies should set high-quality standards for their employers, where they can feel that taking risky ideas that ultimately fail is fine, but bad working habits are not acceptable. Secondly, flat but strong leadership is a must, because companies have to be able to make decisions immediately and let the information spread easily in the corporation. Getting a good balance between flatness and strong leadership can help the organization to work with innovation in the future. Thirdly, people have to feel psychologically safe in their company, where they can speak openly about any problems, but always consider the facts and the data behind their problems. In an article, which I recently read about data-driven innovation I gained insight about the power of it. ",

            "answer_text": "There are 2 things that top managers do that kill innovation - and many of them don\u2019t even know it! 1. They allow fear to kill creativity, which is why we should all make sure we understand this key leadership lesson from cavemen. Most of us can remember a manager who sounded a lot like this: \u201cOhmygosh, we\u2019re in trouble! We need to cut costs and increase sales, we need reductions here and growth there, we need to make smart moves and fix X, Y, and Z.\u201d It\u2019s sad how often managers run around like panicky chickens with their heads cut off, and then wonder why their people climb into a foxhole seeking safety, wary to develop (or even suggest!) anything new. 2. The second (and even more sad) way that managers impede innovation is by penalizing it and rewarding its opposite. Here\u2019s what that looks like: When people take a risk and fail, management punishes them.Meanwhile, they reward people who never take risks and stick to the safe route, keeping their hands clean by never doing anything.Would you want to innovate in an environment where your friend recently got fired because his big idea fell apart? Where your colleagues who \u201ccheck the right boxes\u201d and \u201cfly under the radar\u201d chug safely along, collecting their yearly raises? If you want innovation, you must start rewarding it and make change a source of excitement rather than fear. But a word of warning: if you\u2019re in a large organization, this can be a very difficult train to turn around. But not impossible. (What\u2019s impossible?) Good luck to you! ",

            "answer_text": "Good question! Too many managers and leaders forget that innovation can mean a new method of leading or managing as well as new product. You have to be innovative to be an innovator. Managers have the opportunity to create the work environment that ignites emotions, fuel motivation and inspire creativity. How? Use each day to create momentum that builds on the previous day\u2019s efforts. Don\u2019t just go to work and see what unfolds. Intentionally make momentum unfold. Connect with your team and determine what specific triggers inflate or deflate. Use the manager pulpit to build well-being. Generally, team members respond well to catalysts that support their work like, autonomy and help from others as well as things that promote and nourish work. Such as, recognizing contributions, demonstrations of respect and encouragement. Yes, you\u2019re right, these are well known approaches to well-being at work. But ask: how can managers make what is common knowledge common practice? This is the progress principle. Creating daily wins. Team members feel like they make progress each day and each day builds momentum. Treat team members well, facilitate steady progress and recognize people and their contribution and you\u2019ll create an upward spiral of momentum. Then just watch the creativity unfold right in front of you. Brian Braudis, Increase Your Impact ",

Innovation Mindfulness in the corporate environment This is one of the things I do for a living. I work with companies to help them become more innovative. It is certainly possible for a company to become more innovative. It takes some willingness of the managers to make changes and to try new techniques. I find that most employees are excited about making positive changes in an organization. Many managers are a bit afraid of doing this. It takes courageous managers to initiate and maintain a new innovative environment. I work with both managers and employees but no program will work without an innovative mindset in management. I hope this is helpful. Let me know if I can be of assistance. Best Jon ",
