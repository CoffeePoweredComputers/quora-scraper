            "answer_text": "Definitely the Redmi Note 9 Pro Max makes the better sense compared to the POCO F1. POCO F1 has been in the market past 2 years but still has a chipset made truly for gaming and good performance. But it still has a wider notch which looks old compared to the punch hole display of the Redmi Note 9 Pro Max. The Note 9 Pro Max has a glass build and design compared to plastic on the POCO F1. The screen is also brighter and bigger compared to the one on the POCO F1. The only area where POCO F1 holds an edge is in gaming as it gets the 2018 flagship Snapdragon 845 which is better than the Snapdragon 720G. The daily performance may be the same but when its gaming, POCO F1 is the clear winner. Coming to cameras, the Redmi Note 9 Pro Max gets four cameras which includes 64MP main camera + 8MP ultrawide + 5MP macro and a 2MP depth camera whereas the POCO F1 has only two cameras: 12MP main + 5MP depth. So the Redmi Note 9 Pro Max takes better photos and videos and those extra cameras makes it the better choice. The Redmi Note 9 Pro Max comes with 5020mAh battery which provides better battery life compared to 4000mAh battery on the POCO F1. The former also comes with a 33W fast charger which charges it faster compared to 18W fast charger on the POCO F1. So overall taking everything into consideration, the Redmi Note 9 Pro Max is the better choice. ",

            "answer_text": "Now Poco F1 is outdated. There is no reason to think about it. Redmi Note 9 Pro Max is modern, comes with better design, good camera setup, larger battery and most importantly faster charging. Snapdragon 720G is powerful enough to compete against Snapdragon 845. So, I recommend Redmi Note 9 Pro Max over Poco F1. If you want a Poco Phone, consider buying Poco X2. Here is the comparison : Redmi Note 9 Pro Max vs Poco X2 ",
