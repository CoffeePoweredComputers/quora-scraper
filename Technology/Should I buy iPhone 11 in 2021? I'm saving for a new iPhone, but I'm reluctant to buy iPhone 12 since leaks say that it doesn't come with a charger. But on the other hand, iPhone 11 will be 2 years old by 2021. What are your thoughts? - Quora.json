            "answer_text": "Counter Q: Before you start believing leaks, rumours, grapevines, etc., think \u2026 and think hard. If a phone does not come with a charger, how is it going to be charged? As regards whether you wish to but iPhone 12 or 11 or whichever, think hard again. Do you really need to spend the insane amount of money for something that is not going to last 3 years, at most 4? You may think that it will make a style statement. Think again once more. You don\u2019t. No one cares what phone you carry. You will use the phone mostly for communication and social media. There are plenty of cheaper phones that can do the same job. The iPhone excels at photography but not by miles. Are you an avid photographer? What do you photograph usually? Selfies at home and outside? With less than 1/4th the money, you can buy a very nice other brand smartphone, nearly as good as the iPhone, and have plenty of money for a short holiday or to be spent on home improvement. If you are very rich, it doesn\u2019t matter, but it is still your money. Edit: I have disabled comments. There are people who have cherry picked on one phrase here - a phone that will last only 3\u20134 years. The comment has been, iPhone lasts more than that. I very well know that it does. My iPad Air 2 is of 2013. I am using it to reply here. It is great. iPhone can last just as long. But would anyone keep it that long? Consider that 2013 was the days of iPhone 5/5s. How many iPhone users does one find today still using iPhone 5/5s? This is what I mean when I say the typical phone doesn\u2019t last beyond 4 years. For the rest, Please read the comments and answers below. Thank you. Once again, I will keep repeating myself - think, think hard and think again. It is your money. ",

            "answer_text": "I think you need to stop worrying and overthinking it. I mean this in a nice and caring way not a mean way. Nobody knows what Apple will bring out in 2021. You may have read stuff but they are only rumours. It is not solid evidence. It is likely the iPhone 12 won\u2019t even be around as a brand new model then as it will be too similar to the 2021 model. However, that also is only a rumour. They use the 11 then as the next model down from the 2021 models. Who knows? We don\u2019t know. The only way you will know for sure is to wait to 2021 when Apple launch the 2021 models and see what they launch. Until then you won\u2019t know for sure. All that said, forget the charger. Look at all your options and buy the phone you like the feel of better, the phone you think is the nicest to use and the phone that fits your needs the best. If it is a model that comes with a charger that is great but don\u2019t buy a phone you don\u2019t like as much just to get a charger. Chargers are very cheap and it is not worth not buying the phone you like the least to save a few dollars on a charger when you are already spending a lot on a phone to start with. So forget the charger, buy the phone you like the best and just pick up a charger if you need to. After all it is the phone that is the important thing not some charger. ",
