            "answer_text": "The term \u201ctechnology\u201d is derived from the same root as \u201ctechnique\u201d, it\u2019s all about how to produce an effect. Physics is the study of how the physical world works, and so it is all about why some effect occurs, whereas technology is not so much bothered with the \u201cwhy\u201d so long as it works. As such, the two are opposites of the same coin. As an example, a m-dean aircraft is a great convergent of technology and science. Science tells us why wings generate lift, and then technology optimists that to make aircraft fly efficiently, then science measures different quantities associated with flying, so that better technologies are developed. For a specific example, decades ago planes started dropping out of the sky when they\u2019d been in service for some time. A scientist studied it, and realised the metal being used was susceptible to metal fatigue; the tails were literally falling off the aircraft in mid flight. Once the engineers knew that, they worked out how to detect it and minimise the effect. ",
