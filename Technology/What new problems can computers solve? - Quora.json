            "answer_text": "This question may have been asking for a list, but to be as accurate as possible: they can help us with anything \u201ccomputable.\u201d This may seem like an obvious or trolling answer, but its not. Computability - Wikipedia My education mostly swept towards Turing Machines, which include (as far as I am aware) all modern electronic computers, excepting perhaps quantum computers, and defines anything with computational logic. Turing machine - Wikipedia To oversimplify: if said computer is a magical futuristic impossibly powerful computer, it can help us solve any problem we can figure out an algorithm for: a series of steps which, if followed completely, will lead to a solution. Computers all follow a series of steps, even if those steps change its own algorithm. This is true even of \u201cAI\u201d (which doesn\u2019t actually exist yet) on neural networks, self-changing computer programs, and a number of other scenarios with too many steps and variables for a person to solve by hand. Its a set of instructions, and in theory a person with infinite time, precise instructions, and zero mistakes, could solve the same problems with no schooling or knowledge, just following the diagrams for a Turing Machine.  Turing also did a mathematical proof to show what isn\u2019t computable, even before he invented the first machine computer. ",

            "answer_text": "Unscientific answer: If you write the appropriate software to solve the specific problem(s) at hand, a computer running that software can solve: Easy problems.Moderately difficult problems.Very difficult problems.Extremely difficult problems.There are problems beyond this that computers cannot solve. Seriously, though, because general-purpose computers are programmable, they can be programmed to solve an infinite number of problems\u2026far more than four. I suspect your question is asking you to regurgitate something your professor or textbook said. None of us reading this question know the context of the question, so you will need to refer to your notes or textbook for the appropriate response. ",
