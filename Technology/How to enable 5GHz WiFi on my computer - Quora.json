            "answer_text": "If your computer has 5GHz wifi then there is no [easy] way to disable or enable it separate from 2.4GHz wifi, so you already have it. If your computer is older and doesn\u2019t have 5GHz wifi, then you can buy a 5GHz wifi USB stick and use that instead. Remember that your router must have 5GHz wifi, which can be enabled and disabled as some routers only support 5GHz OR 2.4GHz, not both at the same time and so have a switch and always come with 2.4GHz enabled by default. So, you might need to upgrade your router instead, or as well. If you want to know if both your laptop and router support 5GHz, you will need to find the model number and search for it online. You can find the model number for your wifi card in Device Manager on Windows, or if you have a Mac just search for the Mac model. ",
