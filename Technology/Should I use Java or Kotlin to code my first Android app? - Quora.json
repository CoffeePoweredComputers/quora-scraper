            "answer_text": "I agree with Garry Taylor that java has a lot of tutorials, so it would be a rich choice for beginners. But let me tell you something, I learned kotlin while I was working on an android project in java, and it happens a lot that I stop at some point and say \u201cthis would have been a lot easier and nicer in kotlin\u201d while all the time I used kotlin, I never felt the same for java. Kotlin is rich in features and saves a lot of time on a lot of poiler plate code, it was designed to extend java and add features to it, so when using kotlin you feel like you are working with a cool modified version of java, and I say that because you can use literally all java classes, libraries and APIs, from within kotlin (the opposit is also supported equally nicely) and all the new features of kotlin is added to it. So even if you choose to begin with java, I advice you to learn kotlin when you get what's going on and who calls what, it will add to you, and you won't regret it. ",

            "answer_text": "Thanks for A2A, Ayman Els Ahmed. Whichever you feel comfortable coding with, But if you are looking to learn one of these languages and want to know which one you should choose,.. Before I answer it straight, let's consider which we should choose and why, Kotlin is a modern language which combines functional programming and object oriented programming. Java is an old but widely accepted language, with lots of support and additional libraries. It's basically object oriented but with the new versions coming it is trying to take the functional side of programming as well. Okay with that aside! Let's choose a programming language. Every library out there for Java is available for Kotlin. Kotlin is a newer more better language in terms of syntax. It has a better IDE suppprt, intelliJ IDE developers are the people behind Kotlin. So, I think it is clear that you should go for Kotlin. ",
