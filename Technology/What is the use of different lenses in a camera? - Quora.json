            "answer_text": "The Use of different lenses in a Camera is they deliver the purpose for different Uses. If you are wild life photographer, you are far away from your subject in that case you need long focul length (300mm or above) lens. If you are into events photography you need fast and general purpose focal length lens like 24-70 with F stop of 2.8 or close. If you are into portrait photography you need faster and telephoto lens like 70-200. Macro lens are used to shoot small things like insects etc and getting very very close to subject. Wide angle lenses are used to shoot nature, or photography in tight places etc. So there are hundreds of purposes of doing phtograhy but there can not be lens that can fulfill all purposes; hence different lenses.

            "answer_text": "Well there are a lot of lens for dslr cameras. Each has a specific focal length that it can zoom or focus, with a specific aperture size. Prime lens such as 50mm or 85mm has very wide aperture and they are best for portrait photography and landscape photography. They can absorb more light and can give a better bokeh effect.   Link for prime lens:- Prime lens Zoom lens like 250mm, 400mm, 600mm has small aperture when used at large focal length but they can be used to capture images very far away without breaking of pixels like in mobile cameras. they are best suited to wildlife safari and adventure trips to jungle.   Link for zoom lens:- Zoom lens Macro Lens are used to capture images of object that are very small and they can be used to capture image by keeping the camers very close to the object I.e the min focal length of these lenses are very less. These lenses are also used for magnification. For example if you want a better image of hanging spide you will have to use macro lens.   Link for macro photography:- Macro photography Last one is combination of lenses and reverse lens mount that can be use with the help of adapter rings and extension tube, these are used to attach two lens together to give better results and higher magnification ration.
