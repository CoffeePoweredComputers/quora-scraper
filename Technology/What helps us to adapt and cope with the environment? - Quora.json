Fossil fuels are essential to help us cope with severe weather. There is no alternative now or in the future. Diesel engines save many lives with alternative power when the electricity grid goes down. Major equipment is necessary to repair levies after flood damage.

            "answer_text": "The environment is adapting to us because of carbon emission, over population and greed but the impact is on the worse side. For humans it is evolution. We will learn to adapt with sudden climate change, drought or excessive rainfall, summers may become hotter and winter colder. We may find snowing in areas not heard of, less drinking water, food shortages. Our body will gradually adapt to these changes. ",
