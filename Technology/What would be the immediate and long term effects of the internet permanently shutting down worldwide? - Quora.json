            "answer_text": "So you want to know what will happen if the Internet packs up its bags and says \u201cSayonara\u201d to us, right? Well, that will never happen because the Internet is made up of several networks. If one goes down, the others will still function. But if you want an Internet-free area, look no further than North Korea. Everything there is controlled, even the Internet. Movies have to be downloaded onto USB sticks, and then smuggled into the country for people to watch. You can see that the people there CAN live without the Internet; even though they have their own intranet, it\u2019s censored to the hilt, and only the elite have access to computers. We\u2019ve lived without the Internet, and we can do it again. ",

In short - a lot of people die. Even more people suffer, then die. And a lot more people suffer, go on suffering, and then die. So - all in all, it\u2019s not good. ",
