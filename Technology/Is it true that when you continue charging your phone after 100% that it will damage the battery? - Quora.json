            "answer_text": "The charger is inside the phone, the thing you plug in is a supply of charging power - a power supply. The charger shuts off at 100%. If the battery drops by 1% or 2% (depending on the phone), the charger will \u201ckick in\u201d and bring it back to 100% - then shut off. Will it damage anything? Lithium batteries of the type used in cellphones (there are different types) last longest if they\u2019re kept between about 80% and 40%, so charging to 100% will shorten the battery longevity, but not by enough to worry about, unless you plan on keeping the phone for 5 years or more. About the only possibility of damage is if a component in the charging circuit goes bad and, due to the fact that the \u201ccharger\u201d is plugged in, starts a fire. So if you have a Note 7, get another phone. Otherwise, I wouldn\u2019t worry about it. (I do \u201cworry\u201d about it in my phone, to the extent that, since I root all my phones anyway [how can you run Linux if you can\u2019t get elevation to root when you need it - it\u2019s like someone with an amputated right arm pitching right-handed], I run Magisk Charging Switch, set to 80 40 - if the phone drops down to 40%, and the \u201ccharger\u201d is still connected, start charging. If the charge reaches 80%, stop charging. But before Magisk? I used to leave the charger plugged in for days at a time. And I recently sent that phone to a lady who [most likely] had hers stolen. It has a new battery in it - well, new about a year ago - but it was over 4 years old, and the batteries they put into phones these days can\u2019t be expected to give like-new performance any longer than that. Never had a problem, except that the \u201ccharger\u201d does draw a bit of current even when the charger in the phone shuts off, so if I had unplugged it at 80% for 5 years, I could probably have saved about a dollar or two by this time.)

            "answer_text": "The charger is not charging the phone when the battery is fully charged. Instead what it\u2019s doing is powering the phone. The battery is effectively out of the circuit apart from the charge being monitored. So no, you can leave the phone connected to the charger as long as you like, and quite the opposite of doing any damage it\u2019s prolonging the life of the battery by not using it to run the phone. Note however that the battery continues to self-discharge gradually. The phone monitors this and once the battery has discharged itself enough then the phone will connect the charger to it for a minute or so to restore full charge again. This may or may not show up on the charge percentage reported by the phone. There\u2019s nothing you can do to prevent self-discharge, and unfortunately it means that the battery life gradually gets used even when the charger is attached. Just to be clear, the idea of keeping a battery at a partial charge being better for the battery than a full charge only works for storage, ie: when the phone is switched off. If the phone is on, even in standby, then it\u2019s impossible to maintain a partial charge without cyclically connecting and disconnecting the charger, which means that the battery is powering the phone when the charger is disconnected. Powering the phone shortens the battery life more than being idle at full charge. In theory it would be possible for a phone manufacturer to offer a \u201cmaintain partial battery charge\u201d option whilst the phone is plugged into a charger, instead of the \u201ccharge to full and then maintain full charge\u201d approach used in today\u2019s phones. This would also be ideal for long term storage of mobile devices, leaving a charger connected to ensure the battery doesn\u2019t go completely flat. But of course this option doesn\u2019t exist, and as it\u2019s not really in the manufacturer\u2019s interest to extend phone battery life then I can\u2019t see the option being introduced. ",
