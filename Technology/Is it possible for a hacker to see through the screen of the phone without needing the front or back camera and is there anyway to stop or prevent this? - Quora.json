            "answer_text": "\u201cAny sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic\u201d - Arthur C. Clarke It is very easy to look at technological wonders like the modern smartphone, or at scary unknown entities like the \u201chacker\u201d and treat them respectively as magic objects, or magic monsters. But the reality is that the smartphone is just a small computer with a collection of inputs and outputs that can be readily understood. And \u201chackers\u201d are just regular people who explore what computers big and small can really do, even when the owners of those big and small computers might not want the computers to do some of those things. What \u201chackers\u201d are not is magic. If someone is attacking your phone, they may gain control of the cameras on that phone, and they may be able to access the video feed from those cameras. Cameras are just a type of sensor that responds to light in a two dimensional array, and they can be controlled by the operating system of the phone, or in some cases by an attacker who is able to run code on the phone. Cameras are an input to the phone. Screens on the other hand produce light but do not respond to light. The screens on a modern smartphone have a layer that responds to capacitance, which we think of as \u2018touch\u2019. So modern smartphone screens do have an aspect of input. But they do not respond to light, so the screen cannot be used to \u201csee\u201d in any typical understanding of the word \u201csee\u201d. So, no. It is not possible for an attacker to see through the screen of a phone without needing the front or back camera. ",
