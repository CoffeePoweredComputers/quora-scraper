            "answer_text": "The actual answer is that the modes are propagation modes each one of which is a unique solution to Maxwell\u2019s equations as constrained by the fiber parameters . For most basic training classes to promote the easiest understanding , it is usually simpler to treat light as a \"ray \" and represent a multimode fiber with a relatively large core , about 50 \u00b5m , as being able to support multiple rays or paths of light propagating down the fiber . So the lowest order mode is the one that travels directly down the center of the fiber , and the next higher order mode travels at a relatively low angle with respect to the center of the fiber bouncing off or reflecting off the core cladding boundary, when it reaches the edge of the 50 \u00b5m core edge. The very highest order modes are traveling at a higher angle with respect to the centerline of the fiber. Any mode traveling at a higher angle than that will \"leak\" out of the fiber . In a single mode fiber , the diameter of the core is reduced , typically to 9 \u00b5m or so, until only one mode can be supported and all other propagation modes are extincted. Interestingly , fiber is not intrinsically multimode or single mode . It is multimode or single mode any given wavelength . (So if you transmitted 850 nm light down a \u201csingle mode\u201d fiber ,with a 9 \u00b5m core , the light would actually be traveling along multiple modes and it would be a multimode fiber at this wavelength.) One singlemode fiber parameter that is rather important is called the \u201ccutoff wavelength\u201d or lambda sub C. The LsubC is about 1180 nm in many single mode fibers. The cuttoff wavelength is the wavelength at which the fiber transitions from multimode to singlemode operation . (Historically some single mode fiber's have had cut off wavelengths as high as 1290 nm which incidentally created its own share of issues, due to it\u2019s proximity to the operating wavelength of 1310nm.)

            "answer_text": "Mode refers to the spatial distribution of the light propagating through an optical fiber. In introductory physics classes, there is a tendency to only talk about light in terms of plane waves \u2014 which have a uniform, infinitely extending, transverse intensity profile \u2014 since they provide simple examples of the physics being studied. The thing is, these plane waves cannot exist in nature due to the whole extending into infinity nonsense. This means that in real life situations, propagating light has to have different, more complex transverse intensity profiles \u2014 these different profiles are called the modes.  Plane wave vs. Gaussian beam. The Gaussian beam has a Gaussian intensity profile. Due to the transverse confinement of light propagating in optical fibers, only certain modes are supported by a given fiber; these allowed modes are determined by the material and geometry of the fiber. In the case of single-mode fibers, only one mode is supported. ",
