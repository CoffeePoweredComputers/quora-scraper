            "answer_text": "The following points should be considered when taking this decision: 5G is still not an established standard & technology, it is evolving & will take few months if not years to stabilize. After that it will need to be widely implemented across carriers. The same lifecycle was observed for 3G/4G.Initially 5G might be more used for wireless broadband applications & gradually make way to mobile devices.Mobile phones with 5G support will be introduced in the market in 2019, but as with the first LTE phones, they will probably have drawbacks like being bulky, battery draining devices, not quite ready for prime time.Such phones will anyway continue to support LTE & apps actually requiring 5G will gradually evolve.So, maybe if you're looking at purchase in near future, might be better to go for a good LTE device & upgrade in the next cycle.

            "answer_text": "5G is on the way for sure. However, unless you are a tech leader I would advise waiting until it matures a bit more. One caveat might be if your city where you use your phone the most is offering 5G now then perhaps it would be an option for you. As others indicate, it's a bit like VHS and beta days right now, what you buy might not be your best option in 2 or 3 years ",
