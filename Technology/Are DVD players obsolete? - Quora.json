            "answer_text": "DVD rental has declined precipitously, so they are not often used for that. However, many people still own movies on DVDs and still use their DVD players to play them. A writable DVD is also still a good way to copy a video onto a medium which allows someone to play it on their TV. I know a guy who does not have a computer, but he does have a DVD player. He likes boxing but can\u2019t afford to subscribe to premium channels. So there are some boxing events on Showtime which I copy to DVD for him to watch. He would certainly not regard his DVD player as obsolete. ",

            "answer_text": "More or less, yes. DVD players are still being manufactured and sold. But only the real cash strapped would buy them because a DVD player is cheaper than a Blu Ray player (by some $50). When a Blu Ray player can do everything a DVD player can do, and much more, why would anyone buy a DVD player today is beyond me - except for price. ",

It takes quite a while for media types to change and a lot of overlap during the period. Keep in mind that VHS based machines were being made until about two years ago which places that more than 20 years after the launch of DVD ",
