            "answer_text": "Possible? Yes. Likely? Not at all. A large number of government services are becoming increasingly reliant on the Internet. Communication about COVID-19 with the general population, with medical professionals and with other groups that have specific needs is to a large extent being done online. Then you have people doing government work. If they can\u2019t work in offices stuffed full of potential virus carriers, they need to work from home - and cannot do that without the Internet. The ability to home shop if you\u2019re quarantined? Largely Internet-reliant. The only possible reason I can think of for a government to order disconnection of Internet services (which would be the last nail in the country\u2019s economic collapse coffin) is in the case of civil unrest brought about by failure to adequately deliver services and food to the population. So not at all likely. ",

            "answer_text": "I don\u2019t believe it would be in the interests of politicians to shut down the internet. It is arguably the glue that is holding people together while we\u2019re all in lock-down. Remove internet, and there would be no entertainment for the masses. With no entertainment, people would hit the streets to protest/riot, and that would not only accelerate the spread of Corona virus, but cause various governments to be overthrown. \"Religion is the opium of the people\" is one of the most frequently paraphrased statements of German philosopher and economist Karl Marx. It was translated from the German original, \"Die Religion ... ist das Opium des Volkes\" and is often rendered as \"religion... is the opiate of the masses.\" If Karl Marx were alive today, he\u2019d almost certainly strike out \u201creligion\u201d in his famous statement, and replace it with \u201cinternet.\u201d ",
