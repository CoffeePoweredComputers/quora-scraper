            "answer_text": "You would be unwise expose yourself to the liability associated with the hazard of controlling something that large with something relatively ill-suited to the task. You haven\u2019t said what kind of control you need, what kind of motor it is, or any other parameters of the task. You ask the question on a relatively general web site with little focus on that kind of technical matter. There are real dangers related to motors. Unless you really know what they are and how to mitigate them, please don\u2019t put yourself and others in danger by trying to do something outside your sphere of expertise. There are electrical code laws and other rules in place in most locales that restrict what the lay person can do. Leave something of the nature you\u2019re proposing to licensed tradespersons &/or engineers. ",

            "answer_text": "Well, very carefully. More detail in the question is always better. For example, what kind of control are you talking about. On/Off? or Speed and direction? Do happen to have a part number for the motor? In either case, you can find solid-state relays or controllers that will interface to low level signals available from the Pi. If you had included more detail in your question, I might have been able to recommend a controller that would do the job. ",
