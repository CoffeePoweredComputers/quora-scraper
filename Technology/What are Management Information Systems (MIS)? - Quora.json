            "answer_text": "Management information systems (MIS) provide information in the form of reports and displays to managers and many business professionals. For example, sales managers may use their networked computers and Web browsers to receive instantaneous displays about the sales results of their products and access their corporate intranet for daily sales analysis reports that evaluate sales made by each salesperson. Decision support systems (DSS) give direct computer support to managers during the decision-making process. For example, an advertising manager may use a DSS to perform a what-if analysis as part of the decision to determine how to spend advertising dollars. A production manager may use a DSS to decide how much product to manufacture, based on the expected sales associated with a future promotion and the location and availability of the raw materials necessary to manufacture the product. Executive information systems (EIS) provide critical information from a wide variety of internal and external sources in easy-to-use displays to executives and managers. For example, top executives may use touch-screen terminals to view instantly text and graphics displays that highlight key areas of organizational and competitive performance.  ",

            "answer_text": "Did you happen to notice the Quora definition in the MIS group? Management information system, or MIS, broadly refers to a computer-based system that provides managers with the tools to organize, evaluate and efficiently manage departments within an organization. In order to provide past, present and prediction information, a management information system can include software that helps in decision making, data resources such as databases, the hardware resources of a system, decision support systems, people management and project management applications, and any computerized processes that enable the department to run efficiently. That\u2019s pretty close to what others are offering in response to this question. The one additional note I\u2019ll add is a few thoughts on the name of the group that manages an organization\u2019s technology. In the old days of my early career a company computer department was typically called EDP, then MIS, next briefly IS, and finally IT seems to have stuck. That is: EDP = Electronic Data ProcessingMIS = Management Information SystemsIS = Information SystemsIT = Information TechnologyWithin the differing names I'd say there is also a hint of the advancing scope of technology.
