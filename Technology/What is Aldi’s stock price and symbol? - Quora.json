            "answer_text": "There are actually two Aldi companies, Aldi North and Aldi South. Neither is publicly traded. The companies were individually owned and operated by two brothers, Karl and Theo Albrecht. Each brother owned & operated one company. Both brothers were worth in excess of $10 billion each when they died. One of the Aldi companies owns Aldi in the US and the other Aldi owns Trader Joe's. Both men transferred the bulk of their stock to various charitable foundations, in order to beat the tax man. Their heirs receive massive dividends-hundreds of millions per year-on that stock, but they own very little. ",

They never communicate about the need to do so on a short and medium perspective. If they need to get cash for expansion they will probably do it under private investment.
