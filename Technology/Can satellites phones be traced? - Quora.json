            "answer_text": "Satellite phone tracking is not only possible, it's widely used by military and security services. There are at least three ways to track a satellite phone. Tracking radio frequency emissions is one. It is relatively simple to receive this signal for a trained technician. Using commercially available tracking devices is another. There is ample technology already on the market for doing so. Companies including the Polish firm TS2 sell monitoring equipment to track different models of satellite phones. Finally, satellite phones can be tracked through their own built-in GPS devices or weak encryption protocols. It is very likely that the GPS location data is transmitted by the sat phone. Many newer satellite phone models support automatic location sharing including the Inmarsat IsatPhone PRO, Inmarsat IsatPhone 2, Iridium 9575 EXTREME, and Iridium GO! HotSpot.  If you have a vehicle or boat that you want to be tracked through your satellite phone, tracking features are also built into some satellite phone docking stations. The user of the IsatPhone 2 can control who receives the tracking reports being sent from their phone and how often the reports are sent. The user can also start or discontinue the tracking reports by touching a tracking button on the side of the IsatPhone 2. In order for location sharing to work, the IsatPhone 2 needs to be registered on the Inmarsat network. This is the reason that the IsatPhone 2 belt holster is designed to hold its antenna in an upward orientation even while it\u2019s holstered. This allows the IsatPhone 2 to stay registered even while you walk along the trail. Here are the steps: The first step is to create a contact in the IsatPhone 2 address book for the person that will be receiving the GPS location reports. From the IsatPhone 2 home screen, press the Contacts soft key : Phonebook : Options : New contact.Enter a first and last name and a phone number. Phone numbers must be in international format. So for example, to enter a contact for Outfitter Satellite\u2019s main phone number, you would enter 00-1-615-889-8833, where 00 is the dialing prefix and 1 is the country code of the United States.Press Options : Save and the new entry is in your phonebook.To enter an email address, select a phonebook entry, press Options : Edit : Options : Add detail.The next step is to set up a \u201ctracking\u201d contact in your phonebook. From the home screen, press the Menu : Location Services : Tracking : Configure Tracking : Option : Add from contacts : Text Message. Select the contact from your phonebook to whom you want tracking reports sent.Now press Back : Edit interval. Select a time interval for GPS reports.Finally, press the Back soft key and Tracking status : Enable.Now, enable or disable the stream of GPS location reports from your IsatPhone 2 by clicking the Tracking Button. This is the button with an arrow head symbol located on the right side of the phone. When the tracking feature is engaged the Tracking Indicator LED on the front screen of the Isatphone 2 will light up.  Cost Considerations Each GPS location report that is sent from your IsatPhone 2 is counted as an outbound SMS message. So you pay for GPS location reports as usage. Using a short time interval between tracking reports like 5 minutes will result in increased SMS messaging costs. Most people select 30 minutes. This means that you would send about 16 reports during an 8 hour day of hiking or hunting. So, on most service plans this might cost you around $8 per day. That is a pretty small price if you go missing in the woods. When your friends and family start looking for you, the density of reports will be high enough that your last location report should be fairly close to your actual position. ",

            "answer_text": "How can who trace a satellite call? Law enforcement or an individual? An individual can not trace a satellite call or even a cell phone call. Now law enforcement has tools and access to people at the phone companies that assist with law enforcement issues. So what I describe below is how law enforcement would trace a satellite phone call. There are currently three major satellite phone service providers. The first step would be to determine where the call entered the terrestrial telephone network. Each of the satellite phone operators has specific locations where they place calls from their customers onto the Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN) to reach phones not also on their network. These locations are called \u201cGateways\u201d and/or Point of Presence (POP). The locations have a switch (or multiple switches) that translate the satellite call to the PSTN call and hand it off to a carrier for delivery to its destination. (If you are tracing the other way, this will appear as the termination point on the PSTN from the originator of the call.) As soon as you have determined where the call entered or left the PSTN networks, you know which satellite phone operator the satellite phone is operating. Everything about that call is stored at the switch where this transition is made. The call record detail and call in progress information is in the switch and can be pulled by the operator at will. The information will include the satellite phone identification information, the billing information for that phone and where in the world that phone is at the time of the call. If it is a call that happened at an earlier time, the call detail is stored for billing purposes and the same information can be pulled. The location will be GPS coordinates, not a street address. The accuracy of the GPS coordinates will vary between carriers. The tracing of the call between two satellite phones on the same satellite network can be performed by the satellite operator as it does not use the PSTN for completion, although the phones are connected at the same switching location as they would use to go out to the PSTN. The phones are connected on the ground, not in the satellites. The rules about pulling this information vary by the law enforcement agency and the jurisdiction. In the US, federal agencies have a great deal of capability on their own and an \u2018administrative subpoena\u2019 is all that is needed. They have specific officers that are permitted to issue these subpoenas when needed. Some agencies and locations require search warrants. However, the telephone carriers of the world all have some obligations in this area as part of their \u201ccommon carrier\u201d licensing and are usually cooperative. This is not to be confused with the situation with Apple and the contents of a phone. This is the call record detail or active calling information, which is not considered the personal property of the phone owner. The sharing of this information between telephone companies is required for the systems to work and for billing purposes. Therefore, phone owners have no expectation of privacy for this information. This process is not automatic like tracing a call between two terrestrial lines or two cell phones. This type of tracing would require a call to the satellite phone operators operations center. However, the operators do have people available for this activity. ",

            "answer_text": "If you have the cooperation of the operator you might have a chance, they have some ability to determine location because it is part of the efficiency of the system, you need to know the rough location for some of the timings in the system.  But precise location is much, much harder and requires sophisticated electronic listening equipment. Being a radio a satellite phone must emitt some signal and that signal is traceable. Knowing exactly where the radio is requires phased arrays, difficult processing and exotic technology but it is possible if you are prepared. The thing is you need to be in the area with this equipment.  The most common way to do that is to use a special aircraft which is fitted for electronic warfare. It circles the area of interest and listens on the target band. The problem is what to do if there are multiple sat phone users in the same area, then you have to decrypt the calls and analyse them, but some governments have that technology. ",
