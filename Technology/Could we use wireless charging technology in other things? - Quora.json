            "answer_text": "Well, it\u2019s useful when you want the safety of not exposing any conductors. Such as for charging your electric toothbrush in a wet environment next to a bathroom sink. Other products have the sense not to bother though, as our existing wireless charging technology doesn\u2019t actually serve any useful purpose if you think about it. Take electric kettles for example. Many of today\u2019s kettles are wireless. No really - the ones that use a base like this:  See - no wires involved. You just rest the kettle on the base and it gets power. OK, so it\u2019s not wireless charging technology, but that\u2019s the point I\u2019m making - it\u2019s practically no different. And in fact the docking arrangement used by kettles is far superior to wireless technology. It can transfer much more power, and without any efficiency loss. And it keeps the kettle in place. And there\u2019s no electronics to go wrong. Wireless technology that still requires you to place the device onto a base is pretty pointless really. You can do much better using just a simple docking device, and so this is exactly what other products do. Like rechargeable Dyson hoovers, or rechargeable tools, or rechargeable torches:  Or indeed, rechargeable phones:  ",

            "answer_text": "Maybe. It depends on the source source (battery) inside the unit, and if there\u2019s room to be able to modify it to accept a wireless charging system. Many devices can be easily modified to accept a wireless charger for a very low cost by using a receiver from sources like eBay. ",
