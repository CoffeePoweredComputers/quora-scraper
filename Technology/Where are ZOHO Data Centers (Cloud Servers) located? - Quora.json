            "answer_text": "If you have an IP for the ones you use I can find out pretty easily. Based on some simple investigation... They seem to host with Internap, who is a reputable hosting company with a global footprint. They don't seem to use a CDN in front of the website. It looks like it's hosted in San Jose physically. Most of Zoho is based in Chennai India, and they handle everything from that location. They do have some execs in Pleasanton, CA (such as the CEO and some marketing folks, somewhat near San Jose). The company is still primarily based in India. They likely manage this colo remotely. Let me know if you're looking for additional info, I can update my answer. ",
