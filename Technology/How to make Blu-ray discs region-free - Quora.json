Blu-ray disc encoded with the region code A can only be play with a Blu-ray player with the same region code or a Region-free player. You can\u2019t play a Region A Blu-ray disc with a Region B or Region C Blu-ray player. A Blu-ray disc that carries a specific region code can only be played with the Blu-ray player of that specific region. But there are some region-free Blu-ray players that can play all Region A, B and C Blu-ray discs.

This kind of Blu-ray discs can be play with all Blu-ray players no matter what region codes are encoded on them.

There are many programs out there that can help you get the job done. I've had the pleasure of using a great tool entitled losslesscopy to backup and rip all my Blu-ray collections.
