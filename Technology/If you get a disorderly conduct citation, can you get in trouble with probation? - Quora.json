If you failed to call the Agent you will get 90 days in Jail, on a sanction, if this isn\u2019t your habit of disrespecting authorities or a revocation if there are additional charges. The Judge will decide to amount of time if more charges happen. Obviously you need to find better places to be, with people who want you to be successful, or you lose your chance to be under supervision and go straight to jail. ",

Your P O can violate you, and you will go to jail/prison and serve the rest of your orginial sentence. ",
