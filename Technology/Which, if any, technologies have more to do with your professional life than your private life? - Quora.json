            "answer_text": "Digital imaging and supercomputing. Although I am a photography hobbyist, I am professionally responsible for imaging the insides of rocket motors and rocket engine sub-assemblies. I use a digital detector array (DDA) to capture radiographs (x-rays) of an object as it is rotated. The process is called computed tomography. These images are assembled by a supercomputer\u2020 to render a 3-dimensional representation (known as a \"volume\") on a 2-dimensional monitor. The volume can then be sectioned, sliced, dissected, and viewed in innumerable planes, as well as dimensionally measure features. The application can also export a dataset that can be used by another program to plot the surface and features for comparison against a point cloud or CAD model, before-and-after comparison, or provide lot or group average or product timeline information. In my personal life the most intensive processes are stitching up to sixty 30MB photos into panoramas using the Brenizer technique, or performing focus-stacking and HDR processing. Even a quad-core i5 with 10GB RAM is sufficient for most duties. Typical single-image post-processing requires even less horsepower. \u2020 \u2013 The typical supercomputer is basically eight Xeon chips, four 1GB Tesla GPUs, 192GB of RAM, and two 30\" medical-grade monitors. A RAID should go without saying. It's actually the software licensing and data highway that cost the most. ",
