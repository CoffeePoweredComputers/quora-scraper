            "answer_text": "Firstly, not all entrepreneurs are innovators. Some entrepreneurs (many highly successful) have taken ideas and business\u2019s models from others, and executed them rather than basing their startup on an invention or a novel model. Most famously, Microsoft purchased or copied nearly all of their bignsuccessful products starting with MS-DOS. Secondly, there is no correlation between innovators and entrepreneurs. Most inventors couldn\u2019t tell you the difference between gross and net revenues, let alone do market reseach or write a business plan. I\u2019ve personally coached dozens of these folks. Lovely people, but best focused on inventing. Then there are the many many innovators who work for big, established companies. People who are too risk averse to quit and run with their invention, which they often can\u2019t do as the company they work for owns it. The intraprenuers have given us nylon, Teflon, scotch tape, Post It\u2019s, the credit card, the certificate of deposit, the 30 year mortgage, the 747, Concord, satellite, cable TV, cellphone, internet, WiFi, and Oreo cookie, just to name a few.

            "answer_text": "I can only say many people are hobbyist and tinkerers. They indirectly participate in a long line of innovation, but they are not entrepreneurs because they took no risk.  Are the other guys who invented light bulbs before Edison innovators? Are a scientist who invent something but did not see the commercialization of it an innovator? If Edison pioneer the electric car in 1895 but failed, does it make him an electric car innovator?  Edison, electric car, 1895.  An innovation is to disrupt the old. An entrepreneur is someone who build a new business, such as a pizza take out or a high tech startup.  Entrepreneurs are hence always innovators, and innovators are always entrepreneurs, because you have to prove your value. ",
