            "answer_text": "I would say there are positive and negative effects of technology on students. On the one hand, it is true that technology can bring distraction to students, especially when you know that they are basically glued to their phones, and that even if you ban technology from your classroom, they still manage to use them without you even noticing it. It can also give them very easily access to information that might harm them. However, technology is also great for so many reasons, and the fears linked to it can be overcome in some efficient ways. In my opinion there is no denying that technology can benefit in a lot of way the educational system. Students are hyper connected, whether you want it or not. So what are we supposed to do? Resist the changing world we live in and not evolve, or should we embrace this reality and push it towards a better good? Technology is definitely a great way to revolutionise and optimise the learning process and the educational experience for students. Technology is changing the way students learn but also the way professors teach! And this is great news! Times are changing and technology is everywhere. Putting this reality to the good of education is a must and the benefits from it are real! Technology can bring many benefits to education such as using these mobile devices that usually distract your students in class to a better good. Instead of having in mind that digital tools such as phone, computers, and tablets are a distraction to students, why not embrace them and turn them into exceptional learning tools? Technology can lead definitely improve participation and interaction with your audience. One great benefit is for instance, the fact that technology enables very effective audience response systems in classrooms. Audience response systems are a great way of increasing the level of participation and interaction with your audience and students tend to enjoy the class more and remember the content better. Wooclap is an awesome and easy tool for that. It\u2019s a great interactive tool used on all devices; smartphones, tablets and computers. All you need is the link to the website and you can turn presentations, classes, meetings into a great interactive experience. It is a good way to change the rhythm of classes by transferring part of the learning directly to your participants. This allows great interaction, collaboration and more engagement from your classroom. Go check the website : ",

            "answer_text": "Technology is like knife which have advantages and disadvantages depends upon the way we use it Due to technology huge Pool of knowledge is available at your place in laptop, mobile phone etc. One have opportunity to learn anything, everything over the net But unfortunate part is teenager are exposed to things which are really harmful and can distract their mind from their goals. Quantitative wise use of technology should be made by user. Once it becomes addiction it can ruin Sometimes what I observed technology (especially social networking sites) has hijacked their intelligence Students sitting in the class keep on checking their whatsapp, facebook, instagram once they got opportunity to do it.
