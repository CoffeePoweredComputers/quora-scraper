            "answer_text": "Absolutely not, and it would also be utterly useless to do so. I\u2019ll disregard any supposed benfits that banning fossil-fuel powered cars would have. There are three problems here, called \u2018batteries\u2019, \u2018electrical grid\u2019 and \u2018electricity production\u2019. Batteries do not nearly have the energy denisity of petrol or diesel, and neither can they be replenished nearly as quickly. For people in less populated areas, it\u2019s impossible to make do with a car that only has a range of 200\u2013300km, and needs at least 2 hours to recharge to 80%. Electricity isn\u2019t always available either. Batteries also have a limited life that depreciates faster in hotter environments. In colder climates, there\u2019s the problem that heating takes (a lot) of additional energy from the battery, that a combustion engine delivers for free. Batteries are also very expensive, so it\u2019s hard to economically compete, and it\u2019s not afforable for the general citizen. The electrical grid becomes a problem in crowded areas around large cities. If everyone drives an electric car, electricity production and distribution will have be revised completely. Charging an electric car takes lot more than running the average household. And there will be peak times, like after 6 o\u2019clock when everybody\u2019s home from work. Electricity production is not only more complicated because of larger and more varying demand, but it\u2019s also non-sensical as a solution to fossil fuels. After all, the huge majority of it is produced USING fossil fuels. A powerplant is more efficient than a car, but that advantage is severly reduced when you consider losses of transportation and losses because of charging the battery. And batteries can\u2019t be (and certainly aren\u2019t) completely recycled either. Assumed that fossil fuel powered cars are a problem, and that electrical cars can be a solution, it\u2019s only sensible to switch when electricity production is sustainable, and when batteries have become a lot cheaper and evolved to be on par with the petrol tank. I don\u2019t think it\u2019ll be that way in the near future, so I also think it\u2019s stupid to plan to abolsh them before we can be sure that it will be. For now, the only alternative for fossil fuels is ethanol. It is completely carbon neutral and sustainable, it\u2019s used widely already, and its share is growing steadily. E85 isn\u2019t widely used yet, but 5% to 10% ethanol in fuel is common now, and i\u2019m sure ethanol will replace petrol altogether in the near future. It offers similar performance, and is perfectly suitable for a gradual conversion, because it can be mixed with petrol. Technology and maintenance personel doesn\u2019t have to be converted dramatically either. It\u2019ll become the new \u2018gas\u2019 in a year or twenty, i\u2019m sure. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, and several nations and municipalities have already made commitments to ban sales of gasoline, diesel, and LPG vehicles, with some bans starting as early as 2025 and none later than 2040. These include India, China (the largest auto market globally), Japan (the third largest auto market globally), South Korea, Taiwan, the EU auto market nations (Denmark, Sweden, Norway, Germany, France, the Netherlands, Spain, and Portugal), and Costa Rica. Many cities and jurisdictions have also enacted bans in nations that have yet to announce a ban at a national level. These bans will force a more rapid transition to 100% EVs than predicted by current industry sales forecasts, which project EV sales to rise rapidly. Phase-out of fossil fuel vehicles - Wikipedia A recent conservative projection by BHP predicts a best case of EV sales comprising 50% of the market by 2030 and 100% by 2050, with the globe\u2019s entire fleet of operating light duty vehicles reaching 100% EV by 2070. BHP predicts half of all global vehicle sales could be electric by 2030 The BHP projections are reasonably consistent with those by Bloomberg New Energy Finance: Global petrol car sales may have already passed peak as consumers eye electric vehicles I believe the transition to EVs will be faster than these projections (as it needs to be to meet the goals for reducing carbon emissions recommended by the IPCC and endorsed my all major science agencies).
