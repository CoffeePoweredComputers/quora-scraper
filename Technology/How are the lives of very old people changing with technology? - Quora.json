            "answer_text": "It is an interesting question. I have seen several old people who were not able to cope with the new technologies and they are inconvenienced. I have also seen number of old people who learnt these things with a sporting spirit are enjoying the benefits. ATM: My father refused the debit card given by the bank. He was writing a cheque and somebody has to go to bank and withdraw money for him. After sometime he became so old his signature was not matching with the one in the bank. Finally, reluctantly he accepted the debit card which was used by other people to withdraw money from the bank.Internet: They have no knowledge of computers and were not able to operate one.I also have seen people who learnt to use computers after retirement. Consequently they were able to use online trading, Mutual Fund investments etc from home. They are busy and making money. Some of them are able to watch YouTube videos on spiritality without going out.Mobile phone: Lot of people learned the minimum operation to receive and make the calls. However, they were not able to type the messages or use WhatsApp etc.Metro Rail: My uncle refused to travel by Metro because he was afraid he may not be able to board the train in 30 seconds.Booking Tickets: They have to depend on others for this kind of things like booking tickets, paying bills etc. which has become much easier but they are not getting the benefit.Oder people are used to personal contact. Because of these new technologies, people are not making effort to meet in person. This is a bit disconcerting to older people.",

            "answer_text": "Not well sadly. My mother is so afraid of technology, I call her the technology moron. She is so scared that she is afraid to learn and catch up with what is going on. Once my father died, she really lost all sense of reality and just volunteers so that people really don\u2019t know all of the bad things she has done in her life and allows her to escape from what is going on today. I downloaded her phone manual but so tired of explaining what to do or being blamed for something I had no control of, I simply make it easier. I tell her to go to the place where she bought her phone and they will fix it. Tired of the SOS calls when it comes to wireless, bluetooth, etc\u2026they just don\u2019t get it and it\u2019s an overload for them to understand this is the future. They want things to be simple, on and off buttons. GOSH\u2026.life is crazy! ",
