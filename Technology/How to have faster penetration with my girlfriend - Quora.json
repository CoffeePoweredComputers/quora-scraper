            "answer_text": "I do have a method that I think will help, but it will take some commitment on your part to get physically fit enough to pull it off. First, you need to be able to support your upper body in a push-up position for this to work, so start doing pushups everyday to build your strength and endurance. You'll also need to do Planks to build up your abdominal muscles to support yourself. Next, you need to work on rhythm. For this method to work, you'll need to do this on a bed or other springy surface, hard surfaces don't work.  Step 1: When in bed with your girlfriend get into a missionary position. From there, get into a push-up position with your arms completely extended. Step 2: Place your hands next to her hips while remaining in the push-up position.Step 3: Using your arms, push down gently at a comfortable interval to induce a bouncing motion. Ideally, you can position yourself so that when you bounce, you can simulate thrusting without actually having to move your hips.Step 4: Once you have established a good rhythm, you can slowly increase the speed at which you push your arms down so that the intervals between thrusts get shorter (this is tiring, so hopefully you've been doing your push-ups). Try doing this without moving your hips. If you are doing it correctly, the bed will move her up and down and you won't need to thrust your pelvis at all.Step 5: You can start moving your hips to thrust at an even faster rate. This part is hard to describe, but once you have a feel for the motion it will be natural.Step 6: Rest and repeat. The idea is to use the bed and your arms to do most of the work. If done properly, you can increase the speed substantially without pulling a muscle in your groin.  Note that this will take a bit of practice to get the rhythm right, and that any movement by her can alter the motion. Its best if she can lie still and let you do the work, but don't be surprised if she gets into it and moves. If that happens, just take a break and start again. I hope these instructions are clear enough for you to use. Good luck! ",

            "answer_text": "Well, I know how it is to try to do this for a woman and then only a minute later you are finished. It's embarassing. But it doesn't have to be that way.  One thing that helps is not being so focused on what's going on. When you see her getting really turned on it will make you get really excited and was the end of it right there. So don't focus on her so much. Don't focus on you either though. Try to think about other things, things that are not very sexual. Maybe think about a math problem or taxes. Anything that will distract you from how great it is and how much she is loving it.  Try kegel exercises. Tighten and release the muscle that you would use to hold it in when you really need to pee. I can't even begin to explain how many sexual benefits you will aquire from this. But you need to do this exercise all the time. Do it when sitting down, do it when walking, do it when driving, do it when you are talking to people. No one will know you are doing it and you can do this all day if you want. After a while you will have built up that muscle and you will notice all kinds of improvement in every area of sex.  Have more sex. Explain to her that it's difficult to perform to her needs without more practice. Get her to agree to have sex with you at least twice a day. Every other day will make it hard to fuck like she wants you to. If you have sex at least twice a day, you will be able to pound that shit for hours each time. If she is not willing to accommodate you in this she won't be able to get what she wants. It's as simple as that.  Work up to it. Go really slow at first. Let her play with it a little or give yourself a loose and slow handjob while you orally pleasure her. Take it slow, and if you feel yourself getting excited stop for a while. Change positions a lot, any time you feel yourself getting close to finishing, stop and let that go away before you move on to another position.  Masturbait more. Focus on learning how to make it lat for a long time. Don't use porn, don't think about any fantasies. Think about how it feels and what experiment with it to get a feel for how to make it happen. Don't focus on climaxing, don't be in a hurry. Don't be embarrassed or ashamed about it. ",
