            "answer_text": "Every apps in Android has an unique identifier, which is called the package name. Package names are usually in format of <domain>.<publisher/company>.<app name> such as com.example.app1 . In AOSP (Android Open Source Projects) apps, most of the app package names start with com.android.* . com.android.contacts is the Contacts app, com.android.settings is the Settings app, and com.android.systemui is the System UI (which handles the main Android theme and wallpapers). Well, some phone manufacturers are adding their app with different package name, such as com.sec.android.* for Samsung, com.google.android.apps.* for Google and com.rim.* for BlackBerry (including BlackBerry 10, BlackBerry Priv and other BlackBerry apps in Google Play, except BBM which is com.bbm). Other apps also have the package name as well. For example, org.mozilla.firefox for Mozilla Firefox, com.ubercab for Uber, jp.naver.line for LINE, and com.nianticlabs.pokemongo for Pokemon Go. So, if you update an app, Android knows what app to be updated since the update has its package name, with different app versions. ",
