            "answer_text": "Every type of battery has their own properties and need a charger adapted to the battery. Batteries use chemistry to store electricity and chemical reactions are temperature dependent. A temperature which is to high or to low is bad for the lifetime of a battery. Big battery like cars and home battery systems should have a temperature probe. The small ones usually don\u2019t have it. Nissan Leaf cars are known to lack cooling and have problems with repeated fast charging without a cooling down period because it heats the battery. As a consequence the charging current is reduced. Li-ion and NiMH batteries should not be charged below 0\u00b0C (32\u00b0F) and I recommend to let them cool down first if their temperature is above 40\u00b0C (104\u00b0F). Most batteries were designed to work at room temperature. The only commercial batteries I known that work at high temperature are ZEBRA and NaS and they include their own thermal system. I would not expect ordinary people to work with that type of batteries. ",

            "answer_text": "Smothering them while recharging. Batteries don't like heat and when they charge they also give off heat. Don't put your smartphone on the bed or the pillow, that traps heat. Place them on a cool flat surface. On car type batteries don't have sparks or open flame around them. Lead acid batteries give off hydrogen gas when recharging. Older batteries were more susceptible than today's fit still no sparks or open flame around them. ",
