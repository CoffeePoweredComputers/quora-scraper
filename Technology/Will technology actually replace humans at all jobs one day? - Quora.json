            "answer_text": "Yes. By then though, we\u2019d reach a stage in which none of us have to work in order to survive. We\u2019d let the machine do the work for us while we play and do whatever we want. That is if there isn\u2019t a group of elite that monopolize everything to gain power. Honestly speaking, if the whole world pull together right now and work together to raise the standard of living, no one in this world will be living in poverty. It\u2019s because there are people out there who hog all the resource and build systems to keep them in power that we aren\u2019t able to do that. Fact, it\u2019s not because we\u2019re incapable of understanding each other that we don\u2019t understand each other. It\u2019s because we refuse to understand each other that we don\u2019t understand each other. It\u2019s not because we\u2019re incapable of achieving world peace that we don\u2019t have world peace. It\u2019s because we choose not to have world peace that we don\u2019t have it. People keep blaming on factors like scarcity and all the BS but at the end of the day, the fault lies within us. It\u2019s just that no one wants to admit it. Over the course of my life among humanity, I learn that it is hard to save a species that doesn\u2019t want to be saved. ",

            "answer_text": "Once a job is automated, it is worth almost nothing. Think about translating a computer language into a machine language. In the 1960s, that might have been a valuable job, but now a compiler does that automatically. It\u2019s worth maybe 10 cents for the electricity. If you had someone come to your home and wash the dishes every day, what would you pay? You might have to pay between $2000 and $8000 per year for that service, right? How much would you pay to your dishwasher machine? Well, you do pay for the electricity, but that\u2019s probably worth about $60 to $80 per year. Essentially, that \u201cjob\u201d became completely worthless. So, no one would wash dishes by hand in our current society. Take a look at the Tesla factory. How many people are working on that assembly line? Not many, right? We\u2019ve lost 50,000 factories to China because the Chinese can do the work for less than Americans. The thing to keep in mind is that if those jobs hadn\u2019t gone to another country, they would have been automated away. Things would have been pretty much the same as they are in any case. Even though most jobs have already been automated away, we live in a society where both spouses typically work full-time and barely make enough to make ends meet. In fact, many people have to work multiple jobs. Have jobs been eliminated and we all relax on the beach? No. ",
