            "answer_text": "1. Triangulate your view with believable people who are willing to disagree. Seek the advice of the most believable people you can find. If you don't know how to judge who the most believable people are, seek the advice of others about how to do that, such as people who have already chosen such believable people. By questioning experts individually and encouraging them to have thoughtful disagreement with each other that I can listen to and ask questions about, I both raise my probability of being right and become much better educated. This is most true when the experts disagree with me or with each other. Smart people who can thoughtfully disagree are the greatest teachers, far better than a professor assigned to stand in front of a board and lecture at you. The knowledge I acquire usually leads to principles that I develop and refine for similar cases that arise in the future. In some cases in which the subjects are just too complex for me to understand in the time required, I will turn over the decision making to knowledgeable others who are more believable than me, but I still want to listen in on their thoughtful disagreement. I find that most people don\u2019t do that\u2014they prefer to make their own decisions, even when they\u2019re not qualified to make the kinds of judgments required. In doing so, they\u2019re giving in to their lower-level selves. 2. Sincerely believe that you might not know the best possible path and recognize that your ability to deal well with \"not knowing\" is more important than whatever it is you do know. Most people make bad decisions because they are so certain that they're right that they don't allow themselves to see the better alternatives that exist. Radically open-minded people know that coming up with the right questions and asking other smart people what they think is as important as having all the answers. They understand that you can't make a great decision without swimming for a while in a state of \"not knowing.\" That is because what exists within the area of \"not knowing\" is so much greater and more exciting than anything any one of us knows. 3. Believability weight your decision making. In typical organizations, most decisions are made either autocratically, by a top-down leader, or democratically, where everyone shares their opinions and those opinions that have the most support are implemented. Both systems produce inferior decision making. That\u2019s because the best decisions are made by an idea meritocracy with believability-weighted decision making, in which the most capable people work through their disagreements with other capable people who have thought independently about what is true and what to do about it. It is far better to weight the opinions of more capable decision makers more heavily than those of less capable decision makers. This is what we mean by \u201cbelievability weighting.\u201d So how do you determine who is capable at what? The most believable opinions are those of people who 1) have repeatedly and successfully accomplished the thing in question, and 2) have demonstrated that they can logically explain the cause-effect relationships behind their conclusions. When believability weighting is done correctly and consistently, it is the fairest and the most effective decision-making system. It not only produces the best outcomes but also preserves alignment, since even people who disagree with the decision will be able to get behind it. But for this to be the case, the criteria for establishing believability must be objective and trusted by everybody. At Bridgewater everyone\u2019s believability is tracked and measured systematically, using tools such as Baseball Cards and the Dot Collector that actively record and weigh their experience and track records. In meetings we regularly take votes about various issues via our Dot Collector app, which displays both the equal-weighted average and the believability-weighted results (along with each person\u2019s vote). Typically, if both the equal-weighted average and the believability-weighted votes align, we consider the matter resolved and move on. If the two types of votes are at odds, we try again to resolve them and, if we can\u2019t, we go with the believability-weighted vote. Depending on what type of decision it is, in some cases, a single \u201cResponsible Party\u201d (RP) can override a believability-weighted vote; in others, the believability- weighted vote supersedes the RP\u2019s decision. But in all cases believability-weighted votes are taken seriously when there is disagreement. Even in cases in which the RPs can overrule the believability-weighted vote, the onus is on the RP to try to resolve the dispute before overruling it. In my forty years at Bridgewater, I never made a decision contrary to the believability-weighted decision because I felt that to do so was arrogant and counter to the spirit of the idea meritocracy, though I argued like hell for what I thought was best. Regardless of whether or not you use this kind of technology and structured process for believability weighting, the most important thing is that you get the concept. Simply look down on yourself and your team when a decision needs to be made and consider who is most likely to be right. I assure you that, if you do, you will make better decisions than if you don\u2019t. 4. Recognize that 1) the biggest threat to good decision making is harmful emotions, and 2) decision making is a two-step process (first learning and then deciding). Learning must come before deciding. Your brain stores different types of learning in your subconscious, your rote memory bank, and your habits. But no matter how you acquire your knowledge or where you store it, what\u2019s most important is that what you know paints a true and rich picture of the realities that will affect your decision. That\u2019s why it always pays to be radically openminded and seek out believable others as you do your learning. Many people have emotional trouble doing this and block the learning that could help them make better decisions. Remind yourself that it\u2019s never harmful to at least hear an opposing point of view. Deciding is the process of choosing which knowledge should be drawn upon\u2014both the facts of this particular \u201cwhat is\u201d and your broader understanding of the cause-effect machinery that underlies it\u2014and then weighing them to determine a course of action, the \u201cwhat to do about it.\u201d This involves playing different scenarios through time to visualize how to get an outcome consistent with what you want. To do this well, you need to weigh first-order consequences against second- and third-order consequences, and base your decisions not just on near-term results but on results over time. Failing to consider second- and third-order consequences is the cause of a lot of painfully bad decisions, and it is especially deadly when the first inferior option confirms your own biases. Never seize on the first available option, no matter how good it seems, before you\u2019ve asked questions and explored. To prevent myself from falling into this trap, I used to literally ask myself questions: Am I learning? Have I learned enough yet that it\u2019s time for deciding? After a while, you will just naturally and open-mindedly gather all the relevant info, but in doing so you will have avoided the first pitfall of bad decision making, which is to subconsciously make the decision first and then cherry-pick the data that supports it. But how does one learn well? LEARNING WELL For me, getting an accurate picture of reality ultimately comes down to two things: being able to synthesize accurately and knowing how to navigate levels. Synthesis is the process of converting a lot of data into an accurate picture. The quality of your synthesis will determine the quality of your decision making. This is why it always pays to triangulate your views with people who you know synthesize well. This raises your chances of having a good synthesis, even if you feel like you\u2019ve already done it yourself. No sensible person should reject a believable person\u2019s views without great fear of being wrong. To synthesize well, you must 1) synthesize the situation at hand, 2) synthesize the situation through time, and 3) navigate levels effectively. * Read the chapter \u201cHow to Make Decisions Effectively\u201d in my book Principles to get the whole package of suggestions.

            "answer_text": "Wake up early.  Wear super comfortable clothes.  Find a place you feel comfortable writing.  Have your favorite pen and a nice notebook.  Then, write down everything you want to do in life - without putting the pen down for a break.  I mean everything!  No limitations.  No judgement.  Want to learn tap dancing?  Be a pilot at the age of 96?  Fine.  No judgements or limits.  That comes later after you are done writing this.  Perhaps you write for half an hour straight.  Fine.   Once you have the list, break it down into categories:CareerMoneySocialSpiritual/giving backeducationadventuresOTHER every thing you write, put under one of the categories.  Once you have the category, start noticing things....which category has the longest list of items?  Which one is kinda thin?  Maybe your spiritual list is packed.  You are all about giving back and no concern about money, status, career.  Or maybe you are all about the money but not giving back.  You will notice where your mind is focusing.  That's the trick, your mind is more focused than you think.  You just need to make yourself aware of it. Once you build the categories, ask yourself if you want to add anything to the super thin categories or to remove things from the super dense categories.  Then, go on to prioritization.  In this phase, you just prioritize things from 1-5.  Things that are deeply important and critical gets a 5.  Things that are OK, but not all that big of deal you might give a 1 to.   Now, make a new list of only 4's and 5's.  Next, what career, life plan, or direction would give you the best opportunity to achieve all the items on your list that are high priority?   This takes some creativity and a bit longer to come to.  For some, it is immediate and glaring.  For others, they need to think, reflect, talk with people, then craft a very unique path to achieve their goals - either way you will live a life that is uniquely based on your own dreams and no one else's.
