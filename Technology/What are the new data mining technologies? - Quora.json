            "answer_text": "Hi, 1. Automation Automation is one of the hottest topics in every sector of industry at the moment. Whether it\u2019s the World Bank fearing for the future of low skilled workers or reasons to be optimistic, it\u2019s an issue very much in vogue as we enter 2018. Mining is no different \u2013 autonomous trucks are becoming an ever more frequent presence around mines, with market leaders Cat and Komatsu introducing their automated haulage systems in the last two years, and Hitachi announcing their offering in December 2017. The next step in mining automation could even be mines with no miners, after Rio Tinto unveiled their plans for a $2.2B \u2018intelligent mine\u2019 packed with driverless trains, trucks and robotics. They\u2019re not necessarily just replacing jobs either \u2013 some automation in mining is allowing producers to drill deeper and with narrower shafts into conditions uninhabitable for humans.  2. Underground Excavators In underground mining, safety is a top priority and earlier this year Atlas Copco released their new line of Underground Mobile Miners specifically for hard rock mines. This new technology circumvents the traditional, and more dangerous, drill and blast method and also means that mines wouldn\u2019t have to be evacuated in order to mine hard rock. Atlas Copco believe their technology has the potential to \u2018change the mining industry\u2019.  3 Electric Vehicles Mining isn\u2019t necessarily seen as the most environmentally friendly industry, and with the Paris Climate Agreement and a host of other factors urging the international community to do more to reduce emissions and tackle climate change, the use of electric vehicles is set to become more and more popular, replacing their diesel-powered alternatives. It\u2019s an interesting market too \u2013 no one company has monopolised the space and, whilst companies like Cat are developing products like their Underground Electric LHD, we\u2019re also seeing a host of smaller players moving into the area. ETF Manufacturing have recently introduced their all-electric surface haul truck and GHH have also introduced their own range of electric LHDs. 4. X Ray Diffraction It\u2019s not all hardware that will be changing the game in 2018. Mining software has been making every mine \u2018smarter\u2019 for some time, and one of the most innovative examples of this is X-ray diffraction. This is used to analyse samples to check their property densities which saves both time and money when targeting particularly rich materials. Companies like ALROSA have already enjoyed successthrough effectively utilising the technology. There are a number of other players too though, with SGS, Bureau Veritas and Bruker all involved.  5. Sensor Based Sorting Innovation isn\u2019t just staying down the mine either. Companies have been investing heavily in new mineral processing technology, with sensor based sorting being a particular area of focus. Sensor based sorting is designed to split commercially valuable minerals from ores as efficiently and cheaply as possible \u2013 leading to increased productivity. Steinert and Tomra are both big players in sensor based sorting, and in 2018 I think we\u2019ll see these two and others investing more into the area, and the incorporation of even newer technology into separation, such as mining magnets.

            "answer_text": "With my approach.. visual mining I extract everything I want to my screen.. With highlights on matches and proximity matches as well\u2026 As fast as you can see the results will flash by if you hold down the enter key\u2026. even faster. If you don\u2019t have RANDOM mining you got nothing\u2026 Nope. I can sample my videos (over 3500 on youtube) by picking a random file and playing a random segment\u2026 over and over. Nothing is found until someone sees the Gem.. Yup This method can spew these finds at you at blazing speed\u2026. Fast fast.. ",
