            "answer_text": "They really do last for a long time and never cause any issue. In terms of Windows vs Mac, I\u2019ve had my Mac for more than 3 years now and it still runs as if it\u2019s brand new. I was a Windows fan for all my life, have always hated Mac, until Vista came. I switched to Windows 7 after that and it became better. I ended up switching to Mac after that since I was done with college and could buy what I wanted with my money. While Vista was the problem, I really had found that Mac is much better than Windows. They say that if you have a really good brand of Windows, it will last for a long time. But I found that those are super expensive (much more than a Mac). And if you\u2019re going to spend that much money on Windows, why not just spend your money on a Mac? From using Mac, though, I realized that it works much better for me because it syncs easily with my iPhone (music, photos, messages). It even has the App Store so it feels like it\u2019s just your iPhone. iPhone is my favorite phone and I have never switched because it\u2019s very user friendly. My background is tech but I find Android and Windows phone so confusing to use. An Apple product is easy to learn. And once you have an Apple product, you pretty much know how to use them all already. I can be on my Apple Watch switch to iPhone, switch to my iPad or to my Mac, and it feels like I\u2019m just using one device. I can basically jump from one device to another and can continue what I was doing from one device. I have an Apple TV and I find it works so smoothly with my iPhone, too. I use my Apple Home and the app doesn\u2019t seem like it was just put together at the last minute, I love it. So why do people prefer Apple? Because they last a long time (great value), they\u2019re user friendly, and my favorite part is the great Apple ecosystem. The more Apple products you have, the more you use the Apple ecosystem, the better they function for you, so it simplifies everything for you\u2026 it makes our life better. ",

            "answer_text": "Expensive is relative. Apple\u2019s cheapest tablet costs around 350 USD. One notable feature of iOS devices is airdrop. This adhoc sharing feature lets you share photos and videos with 2 taps. No WiFi or cell service required. Try doing that with the competitors devices. My friend used airdrop extensively to share pics on their safari trip. Another feature I value is security and privacy. From reputation, IPhones and iPads have very good security features. Even the FBI and police have trouble unlocking them. We are not criminals with illegal documents to hide. We are simply humans with perhaps embarrassing pics and emails we prefer to keep private. So if you have a choice to either get a cheap phone or tablet, rather than pay a few more hundred dollars for the added privacy, what is privacy worth to you? Android regularly reports another security hole, and most Android makers never release patches or it takes months or years to patch. How does that ease your mind of your photos and messages being vulnerable? Would you pay a few hundred dollars more to Apple for ease of mind? Apple on the other hand releases security patches that are available on almost all recent iOS devices. Showing they understand their users need for privacy. Another security fence is the iOS App Store. Time and time again you\u2019ll hear of another malicious app on the Android App Store, but it\u2019s much more rare with IOS. Apple is not cheap. But they provide simple and useful solutions that\u2019s ahead of the competition. ",

            "answer_text": "I\u2019ll take computers first. In a value sense, compared to similar specification PC hardware, Apple is not too costly, and they seem to last a long time, so they\u2019re actually good value. Of course, Apple don\u2019t really have a cheap model in their range, but they\u2019re not interested in that market, because at that level - around \u00a3300 - they can sell you an iPad instead, and a lot of people aren\u2019t even bothering with having a laptop or desktop at all these days, or so it seems. One of the reasons Apple is preferred by some people, has a lot to do with the operating systems they create. MacOS is much more stable & reliable than Windows, and it feels more intuitive - just nicer to use; that reliability and feel of use was enough, alongside my frustrations with Windows 10, to make me ditch Windows at home, and go back to Mac. That brings me to the iPhone & iPad. Once you get out of the bargain basement in tablet prices, i.e. \u00a3300 and above for a tablet, the hardware is pretty similar in performance, though you can probably get more memory for the same price in an Android tablet, to be fair, than you would get with an iPad. The iPhone does generally seem to be more expensive, and less comparable in price, than other phones, except at the upper end of the Android range. I totally understand those criticisms, and that is one of the reasons why Android phones & tablets are also very popular. So, why are people prepared to pay more, and get the iPhone and iPad? The simple answer is iOS - it\u2019s brilliant. Just like the Mac, iPads & iPhones have an operating system that\u2019s just nicer to use for some people, and very stable. To be fair to Android, it seems pretty stable whenever I\u2019ve tried it - much better than Windows in that regard - but I just hate the way you have to use it. I had several smartphones before I went over to an iPhone - each with their own proprietary systems, some better than others - the last was a Palm Pre, which I really liked. I would have got another, but they really hadn\u2019t caught on, and apps were few & far between. The only real competitors for an OS by then were iOS and Android. I tried both, and the choice was obvious. While some of us like, prefer, or even love iOS and/or MacOS, there are also people that don\u2019t like them, and prefer one or more of the alternatives, and that is fair enough, but it\u2019s good that we have a choice.

            "answer_text": "One major reason for Apple's success is its dynamic, constantly changing business plan. Jobs intently studied the market and tried to ascertain the pulse of the audience. Apple originally started as just another computer company. Apple had to expand its offerings if it was to grow. Apple's reputation and brand allow it to charge a premium for its high-end products like the iPhone 11 Pro Max. And adding memory or storage to these products increases the cost even more. Because of this \"Apple Tax\" Apple products are often more expensive than its competitors. Apple product has never been cheap in any country and dramatically the cost of its new gadgets is increasing over time. It has become a symbol of status and only rich class people can afford them. Also, the technology required to manufacture them is very costly. A lot of times you must have wondered why these apple products are so expensive. In this video, you will know the reasons why Apple products are so expensive.  ",

            "answer_text": "Why are Apple products so popular even though they\u2019re so expensive? Because the TCO is generally better than any other product made by the competition. Yes, they usually don\u2019t have the super most last minute parts, but any professional will know by then that 99% of the flaws have been already been patched or upgraded. Every-time that Apple has a Keyboard-gate or a Dongle-gate or a Bend-gate, it comes out with less damage than the Battery Explosion-gate. Many companies are more fanboys than the fanboys themselves: Apple takes the audio jack away and heaven and fire fall on all \u201cApple sheep\u201d\u2026 next year all high end Android take it away, Apple takes away the SD expansion slot and more fire and hell fall on \u201cApple sheep\u201d\u2026 the following years, all high end Androids take it away. Same with laptops: Apple takes the CD/DVD drive away and all blogs and news take on all \u201cApple sheep\u201d that keep buying \u201cunderspec\u201d products that take away their freedom\u2026 next year all high end laptops get rid of the CD/DVD unit, now USB-C and so on and so forth. Just this week, iFixit gave a rating of 1 (the lowest) in serviceability to the Microsoft \u201cMBP-killer\u201d, the Surface. Reliability plays a lot as well as the need for maintenance. I give it, I hated totally the fact that I cannot open my MBP with Touch Bar and not change the RAM, SSD or any other part myself and make it \u201cbetter\u201d with less money than what Apple charges, but I also know that these machines pay for themselves in work-life. And of course, there are a lot of individual horror stories about how a person got it broken on the first week never to look back and never to buy again Apple stuff, or the other poor guy who was totally mistreated by an Apple Genius or Apple Services, but in the end, those stories are way less than the rest of the industry. My two MBPs-Mid2012 are still working with their original parts including the charging cables (never frayed) and the charging blocks/RAM/HDDs and DVDs. They still received the latest OS update up from Mavericks (that makes it Yosemite, El Capitan, Sierra and High Sierra, or 5 OS upgrades over their service life, not many PCs can boast the same). So at $1,500 per machine, their TCO is now less than $300 per year ",

            "answer_text": "Overpriced is subjective. I'll give my analysis in macbook / windows laptop context, since I haven't really able to compare other products. Unfortunately, given windows laptop is the widely used laptop, then the term of \u201coverpriced\u201d is judged from the price of components put together in a windows laptop. This is different with macbooks generally. They really pay attention to a lot of things other than that. For example, there're so few laptop that is so light, but with long lasting battery. Their trackpad, which a lot of people ignore when counting \u201coverpriced\u201d, are miles ahead of most of laptops out there. I never been able to work mouse-less when I'm using windows laptop. But with mac, I feel like I don't need mouse for work. Tbh, I feel like using mouse on mac, I can't utilize the convenience of the trackpad. (I am mainly a software dev) Their os design is top notch, while windows 10 is, well, incoherent here and there (windows 10 still got outdated design on, e.g. explorer). Not to mention those notorious updates which managed to break something. Another thing is the office suite. Windows users need to pay subscription if they want to use native implementations of office-like apps, while mac os comes with them out of the box (pages, numbers, etc are free). Google docs is free of course. Their macbook screen also one of the best ever on laptops. So, any jobs requires color accuracy will feel at ease too. So yeah, bottom line is, you can't only calculate \u201coverprice\u201d mainly from CPU, RAM, Storage, and GPU. There're so much more factor other than that. Btw, to give my answer context, I am a 3 months old macbook pro user coming from a lifelong windows laptop. If anyone asks me if I want to switch back to windows and leave macbook or not. The answer is always not. At least up until this point. Btw their trackpad is soooooo great! Note: Microsoft surface, the nicest looking windows laptop, is priced similarly to macbook.If you want to compare macbook to bulky gaming laptops like ROG, please don't. They serve different market. e.g. I don't want to bring bulky laptops for travelling. It's not portable. And unnecessarily heavy.",

One reason is Apple's excellent and clean design, quality in production, easy to use features & performance, advertising, and marketing are the key elements to buy people apple products even it is costly.

            "answer_text": "I\u2019m gonna level with you for a second. Keep in mind, this is coming from a PC person. While the performance per dollar of Apple\u2019s computers is usually sub-par, the hardware to price ratio is actually very competitive. For what you pay ( partial exemption on Pro titled models), you do get close to as good of a price as what you can with personalized building, and it\u2019s rather competitive as compared to most prebuilders. So, spec sheet price vs spec sheet price, Apple is generally quite good. Apple\u2019s OS offerings, while never my preference, do have some strong points as well. Now, I bring up performance per dollar, because while Apple does make good on providing a competitive spec sheet, Apple\u2019s cooling solutions are often lack luster at best, and in sustained high intensity work loads, Apple\u2019s performance tends not to live up to their spec sheets suggestions. Which is part of the reason why Apple\u2019s systems are not overly popular ( along with the cost). There are a lot of sections of the market that Apple products have little to no acceptance in, and there is often some rather stiff competition within the market segments they do target. ",

Another important factor for its fame is Marketing.From the begining,Apple never placed its product in so called under budget products.This created mindset that apple products are best.They showed its customers what customers wanted to see,that is WOW products that people are delighted to see regardless of its specs.This lead to loyalty of its customers. This is why apple products are famous despite of being expensive ",

Brand loyalty.Security.OS.Design.Ecosystem.Apple for many, has much to offer and some don't really take that into account when seeing the price tag. There is a sense of community when you buy a Apple product, you get good customer service when your product has an issue, the security features are great, the design of the devices are always great to see, and the ecosystem makes everything seamless when your on the go or are a busy person trying to keep up with everyday life. Granted, Windows and Android can offer a similar experience, but Apple just has that extra feeling to it, if that makes sense. Hope this was insightful. Cheers! ",

The next best thing is the lagless ui and smooth interface which attracts everyone to iOS ecosystem apple always optimizes each and every application available on app store.Also apple provides 5 years of software updates which includes security updates for the iOS devices which we don't get to see in andriod and finally iOS devices can easy last for more than 3 to 4 years or more and even if the devices are old the performance will be same as the day you bought it. So, definitely iOS devices are better option but they are expensive but it is worth every penny. Thank you ",

Samsung has that curvy gold phone that costs more than any Apple iPhone, but with Samsung issues and people caring more for Apple, Apple only gets the heat. Other than that look at the new razor how much of a rip off that is. Meanwhile other than Apple being unique, their phones have the fastest processors on the market. ",

There are a fair share of androids, both equally, as well as more expensive than any iPhone or iPad. Should people not love their Note 20 Ultra then? Let me ask you, Do you have a favourite car? A favourite perfume? Things are loved (if at all) for experiences they can offer. If someone who owns a Rolls Royce, loves it, is it because of the price tag or the user experiences? If you love a particular perfume, is it the fragrance or its price? I\u2019m pretty sure the assumption you present in the question is flawed. Some people love iOS for the simplicity, some for the security and privacy, and some for simply being different from android. People love android because they can customise and tinker. People love it because people have preferences and opinions. Similarly some people have preferences and opinions making them like iOS. Price tag was never the reason for loving something. What it can offer for the price matters. ",

To be truthful I don't feel like operating on windows anymore and is more secure than windows. I'm not saying that windows is not secure but it affects your pc performance gradually becoming slow and coming to build quality they are manufactured with much precision ,you could obviously say when you hold them both. I've to say Apple products can't be used for gaming like windows because some games available for windows are not available for Mac. For gaming windows is best but if you are professional doing some work go for apple it's worth it. Thanks for reading. :) ",
