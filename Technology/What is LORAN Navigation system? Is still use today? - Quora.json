            "answer_text": "Original Question \u2014 What is LORAN Navigation system? Is still use today? LORAN is an acronym for Long Range Navigation. It was an excellent system in its day, based upon the British Gee system. While it was less useful in its original form, it provided much longer range. They are both hyperbolic systems using the difference between the receipt of time signals from two (or more) stations. The line which represents the difference for each pair is a hyperbolic curve, and two curves will generate a fix. The original system, ultimately called LORAN\u2013A was less accurate than a sextant fix, but it could always be used. Frankly, it was a curse to use. When LORAN\u2013C came out (LORAN\u2013B was a bust) it automatically matched the time signals and as a result massively improved the accuracy. It also extended the range to the point where it was normally possible to cross the Atlantic and sometimes the Pacific using LORAN\u2013C. The accuracy was a function of the length of the line which connects the two stations and the distance between the ship and the stations. It remained in popular use until satellite navigation replaced it in the middle of the 80's, and in some places until the turn of the century. ",

            "answer_text": "LORAN was a navigation system that used the time delay between a master radio station and at least two slave stations. Special charts were printed that had lines of equal delay printed on them. Mathematically the LORAN system generated sets of hyperbolic curves. By plotting the difference between two related stations the position could be located on the chart. The last version of LORAN to be used, Loran C had receivers that did all of the math internally and displayed latitude and longitude directly. LORAN was decommissioned several years ago due to aging equipment, increasing maintenance costs, and competition from GPS. ",
