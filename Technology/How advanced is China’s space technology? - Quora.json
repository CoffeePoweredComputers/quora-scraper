            "answer_text": " China\u2019s Technology is on the rise and currently, is not more advanced than the United States. \u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022 . As impressive as China\u2019s innovation and progress may be, however, it is premature to declare that China has caught up with the U.S. tech industry. Interventionist government bureaucracy, stodgy state-owned enterprises, a rigid school system and \u2014 above all \u2014 harsh restrictions on individual freedoms continue to stifle independent thinking and creativity and constrain China from realizing its full innovation potential. While China is well positioned to succeed in \u201cstrategic\u201d industries such as semiconductors, pharmaceuticals and commercial aircraft due to its vast pool of engineering talent and the size of its domestic market, so far it has remained a laggard. China has failed to develop an indigenous chip industry despite a state-led drive to do so, with tens of billions spent over the past four decades. \u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022 .

            "answer_text": "China has a big space budget which is commercial, civilian, state sponsored scientific and military in its makeup. Their rocketry is still largely derived from the old Soviet Soyuz technology imported during the Cold War and much else in the infrastructure dates from that period. The country has a capable satellite manufacturing industry as well. They have the worlds largest radio telescope capable of picking up the signature even of satellites that have been shut down whilst passing over it. In conclusion I would say technologically in most areas they are behind the US and Europeans but not by much and in some areas such as the radio telescopes they are ahead and in others rapidly catching up and overtaking the rest of the world. One current advantage the US and U.K. both have is a lot of new private sector investment in small satellites such as those offered by AAC Clyde Space and low cost space launch technologies such as those being offered by Virgin Galactic and SpaceX.

            "answer_text": "We are planning to build a space station and we are testing our design by launching Tiangong and Shenzhou spaceship. We do all these research by ourselves and most importantly, We never failed since the launch of our first spacecraft: Shenzhou I. No people died and no spacecraft exploded from the launch of Shenzhou I to Shenzhou XI. The first satellite we sent to the space, called Dongfang Hong, which means \u2018red orient\u2019 in English, and was sent to space by using the Shenzhou I spacecraft. The payload of Shenzhou I was heavier than almost all rockets that time. China have the technology to build heavy rocket with more payload, heavier than almost all kinds of other rockets and send our crew or satellite safely to the vast sky. Now, we can send two or even three satellites into space with one rocket, building spacecrafts and dock it onto another one in orbit. And soon, if other countries don\u2019t have any new plan to build another space station, after the ISS expires, China might become the only country that have a space station in orbit. ",

            "answer_text": "China\u2019s Long March 5 is not yet operational. This rocket would be a little ahead of the US\u2019s 1966 Saturn IB. Work on this rocket began 30 years ago and 48 years after the Long March 1 in 1970. In contrast, the US went from its first large rocket, the Atlas 1 in 1957 to the Saturn IB in 9 years. China put up the Tiangong 1 spacelab in 2011 and Tiangong 2 in 2016. The combined mass could have been carried on a single Saturn IB in 1966. China began animal testing in 2000 which was 30 years after Long March 1. The US began animal testing in 1959 which was 2 years after Atlas 1. In terms of manned missions, China is roughly equal to where the US was during Gemini in 1965. Perhaps someone is impressed with China\u2019s record, but I don\u2019t see why. ",

            "answer_text": "This is mere speculation on my part with no hard facts or research at hand so take it for what it's worth. China is good at reverse engineering or copying and are virtually the leaders in process improvisation. But when it comes to novel product development especially in the hi-tech arena or even when it comes to ideation China has not reached critical threshold. USA, Russia, Germany, Japan are clear leaders (Iam sure there are a few others) Space technology needs deep pockets which China definitely has. But it also needs brainpower and established technology they can harness to shape tomorrow. With all due respect to the Chienese I am yet to come across or might have totally missed development that demonstrates those skills and achievements. ",
