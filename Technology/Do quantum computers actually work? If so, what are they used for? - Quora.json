            "answer_text": "So, here\u2019s an explanation for laymen: A classical, deterministic computer executes a series of instructions and at the end comes up with an EXACT result. For instance, you give it 1 million large numbers, the program will search through them, and tell you with absolute certainty whether a number that you search for is or isn\u2019t in that large set. Unfortunately, to achieve this, the program will have to make millions of steps. Consequently, if you are facing a problem which would require trillions or quadrillions of steps of a classical computer to solve, you cannot solve it like that, because you do not have enough time. A quantum computer is probabilistic - it will not give you (in the areas where it is useful) an exact, super accurate answer; instead it will give you one or several highly probable answers, which you can then verify in other ways. As an analogy: Before every elections, researchers query thousands of people about the way they intend to vote, and based on their answers, give you estimates of how the election might turn out. Sometimes, the researchers get it VERY WRONG, but oftentimes, their predictions are very accurate. The polling before election also cannot tell you with certainty how a random John Doe is going to vote, but it can tell you that e.g. out of every 1000 people in Paris, roughly 60% will vote for Macron, 20% for LePen, and the remaining 20% will be split across multiple remaining candidates. And even though this doesn\u2019t tell you how each specific person will vote, it can still be used to devise strategies, plan promotional campaigns etc. The hope with Quantum Computers is that they will be able to \u201ccrack\u201d certain widely used encryption methods, thus allowing state actors to decrypt communication of criminals and hostile foreign agents in reasonable time (unlike Classical Computers which would need millions of years to crack the communication). It will not be perfect, it will not be able to crack every single message, but it may be successful enough to disrupt \u201cenemy\u201d communications or planning. Of course, one can only guess how encryption mechanisms will evolve once classic encryption is vulnerable - kinda like we see viruses and bacteria evolving more resilient strains now that antibiotics and antiviruses are killing the \u201cweaker\u201d versions.

            "answer_text": "physicists in Australia have made a high-precision sensor that can measure gravitational and magnetic fields at the same time. The device uses an atom interferometer to track the motion of a Bose\u2013Einstein condensate (BEC) in free fall and the researchers say it could improve the search for iron ore, hydrocarbons, diamonds and other minerals. Geological exploration often involves making local measurements of the Earth's gravitational field. In a classical sensor, this involves dropping a mirror a certain distance and using light-based interferometry to measure its height at several points during its fall. However, because this approach involves many moving parts it is not well suited to vibrational, noisy environments. Quantum sensors, on the other hand, use atom interferometry to measure the free fall of cold atoms. Developed over the past decade and now sold commercially, these devices have surpassed the sensitivity of their classical counterparts. However, like classical sensors, they are at the mercy of ambient noise \u2013 and particularly stray magnetic fields. According to Nicholas Robins of the Australian National University (ANU) in Canberra, scientists go to great lengths to shield these devices from stray magnetism in order to minimize noise levels. Two in one In the latest work, Robins and colleagues at the ANU have made this magnetic sensitivity a virtue and created a quantum sensor that can measure changes in both accelerations due to gravity and those due to magnetic fields. Not only does this provide accurate gravitational data, they say, but it also yields magnetic data that could be very useful for mineral prospecting. The new technique involves cooling a sample of rubidium-87 atoms to just a few billionths of a degree above absolute zero in order to turn them into a BEC \u2013 a state of matter in which all constituent particles share the same quantum state. The BEC cloud of atoms is then placed in a quantum superposition of three magnetic spin states and allowed to fall under the effect of gravity for several metres. During that time, the height of the cloud is measured three times using an atom interferometer, a device that exploits the wave nature of matter to make extremely precise measurements on atoms. The advantage of using a BEC, explains Robins' colleague Kyle Hardman, is that the waves of the constituent atoms remain coherent across the full width of the cloud, which is several millimetres across. This makes it easier to achieve the overlap needed between the two paths of the interferometer to achieve a given sensitivity \u2013 thereby allowing the device to work in noisier environments. Spin superposition However, Hardman says, the device's real novelty lies in the spin superposition. Because the three spin states are sensitive to magnetic fields in different directions, the BEC cloud will tend to split into three components as it falls. One state feels magnetic fields pointing upwards, causing it to lag behind during free fall, another is immune to magnetic fields, while the third is subject to downward pointing fields, which boosts it acceleration towards the Earth. The relative size of these three components at the interferometer's output therefore reveals the magnitude and orientation of local magnetic fields. To put their device to the test, the Australian group's researchers created a BEC of two million atoms and ran the interferometer continuously for eight hours, dropping a new BEC every 13 seconds. They looked to see whether they could accurately monitor the varying gravitational acceleration of solid Earth tides \u2013 the deformation of the Earth's crust by the tug of the Moon and the Sun. They also varied the height of their interferometer during the measurement period in order to map variations in the ambient magnetic field. The results of those tests, says Hardman, show their sensor to be \"a state-of-the-art gravimeter and state-of-the-art magnetic gradiometer\". Indeed, it is able to measure variations in the acceleration due to Earth's gravity (g) of one part in a billion. Elegant extension Florian Schreck of the University of Amsterdam praises the Australian group for its \"interesting and significant\" research, which, he says, \"elegantly extends the capability of atom interferometers to disentangle the influence of gravity, magnetic field strength and magnetic field gradient\". He believes that a portable version of the new sensor \"will be interesting for geology and the prospecting of resources\". That kind of mineral exploration involves loading an accelerometer on to an aircraft or helicopter and then monitoring the tiny changes in gravitational field that occur as the instrument passes over regions of the Earth. Hardman says that adding magnetic measurements into the mix would yield more detailed crustal maps, but maintains that this can only be done properly if a single device measures both the gravitational and magnetic fields. \"If you fly two separate machines it is difficult to merge the information,\" he says. Hardman adds that the team hopes to commercialize the technology, but cautions that they must first overcome a significant technical hurdle: how to reduce the time needed to prepare BECs. Currently standing at around 10 seconds, this limits the rate at which they can make measurements and with it the resolution of their mapping. However, he believes they can do better than the roughly 30 years he says it has taken the mining company Rio Tinto to make classical gravimeters operational. \"Cold-atom technology is developing very rapidly,\" he says. The research is described in Physical Review Letters. About the author Edwin Cartlidge is a science writer based in Rome ",

            "answer_text": "Basically it has been known to us that Quantum Computers are very much faster than classical computers i.e their speed is quite good, the simplest difference we knew ,is about their fundamental units i.e for classical it is bits(0,1),but Quantum Computers uses Qbits(|0>,|1>). So Qbits is the quantum version of a bit, and its quantum state can take values of |0>, |1>, or both at once, a phenomenon known as superposition(a quantum behavour which can take two or more values simultaneously by overlapping them). The half angle bracket notation |> is conventionally used to distinguish qubits from ordinary bits. so such quantum concept makes it very different and faster than classical computers. if we think that in the old era there were very less computers are present that time people even cant imagine about the archietecture behind the computers and doesn\u2019t even could imagine how we are using it know similary know we are making algorithms or ideas to how to use it are simply on pen paper but in the future it will make the scenario change by its beauty of utiliazation over classical one. If we had a quantum computer, we could use it to model quantum systems. (This is known as \u201cquantum simulation.\u201d) For example, we could model the behavior of atoms and particles at unusual conditions (for example, very high energies that can be only created in the Large Hadron Collider) without actually creating those unusual conditions. Or we could model chemical reactions\u2014because interactions among atoms in a chemical reaction is a quantum process. ",

Its only one person and the possibilities are many so that person has to try out almost every possibility until he gets out. That is how computers solve problems.  Now, in quantum computers you can again imagine a maze but not only with one person, but with multiple people (for every possibility one). If there are that many people, one of them would get out of maze almost instantly. So, the quantum computer, behaving in a quantum mechanics manner solve problems faster. Really really faster. ",
