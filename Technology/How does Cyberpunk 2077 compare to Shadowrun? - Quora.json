            "answer_text": "The two settings are basically similar settings, with one very big difference. Cyberpunk is a traditional cyberpunk setting. It has the usual William Gibson stuff with the world having broken down and being controlled by megacorporations, and humanity making use of cybernetics to try to survive in a broken world.  Shadowrun is cyberpunk mixed with high fantasy, turning into some kind of angsty cyberpunk dark fantasy with a blend of magic and tech. You have elves, orcs, dragons, trolls, dwarves, and the rest doing the William Gibson routine with spells, swords and bullets in hand.  But even though the settings are a similar kind of dystopian cyberpunk future, Shadowrun focuses on a specific theme \u2014 runners, which are like a bunch of mercenaries who do cyberpunky jobs in the dystopian world. The emphasis is on the industrial espionage and other jobs that goes on between the megacorps as they employ shadowrunners to do the dirty work. Cyberpunk on the other hand takes a broader swathe of the cyberpunk genre and the campaign doesn\u2019t necessarily have to focus on the runners. Although typically it does because megacorps are what make the world go round in these settings. Now since you were asking about Cyberpunk 2077, that means you\u2019re talking about the video games. The upcoming Cyberpunk video game is even less comparable to the Shadowrun games. Cyberpunk 2077 is a first person shooter RPG, so it is going to play and feel similar to Deus Ex (the original Deus Ex), but with a modern coat of paint. The Shadowrun videogames are generally pure RPGs. They are typically top-down or adventure RPGs and not first person shooters. They are not going to play anything similar to the Cyberpunk game. There is I believe one Shadowrun video game that was a first person shooter, but I never played it so I can\u2019t comment. The recent Shadowrun games are all tactical RPGs with a semi-isometric perspective. ",

            "answer_text": "Tabletop? The CP games are into a pure, tech cyberpunk. No magic, elves, dragons, etc. Also, decades after the fact, I can admit I prefer Mike\u2019s game mechanics to ours :-) Video games? We\u2019ll have to see next Spring, won\u2019t we. I suspect CP2077 will be far superior, as it is coming out of one of the best game design studios in the business at present. ",
