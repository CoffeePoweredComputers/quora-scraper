            "answer_text": "A bit of high school Physics will help here. Image from Wikipedia.  There are three main types of radiation: Alpha, Beta, Gamma. They have different properties in both penetration and ionising ability. Ionising ability relates to how they interact with molecules (including your bodies cells.) Alpha particles are fast \u201415,000km per second!\u2014 traveling Helium nuclei. Due to their energy they do a lot of damage. To put this into perspective Polonium 210 is a strong Alpha emitter. The LD50 (kills the median adult) of this isotope is less than 0.1 micrograms (the size of a grain of salt.) However I have handled Alpha emitters in the Physics lab, and also in common smoke alarms. This is because Alpha particles have very little penetration ability. They can not penetrate more than a few centimetres of air, let alone the outer layers of skin or clothing. Po210 is mainly dangerous if ingested, where it directly damages DNA. There is a big difference between incidental exposure to Alpha emission, and ingesting a concentrated source that then emits all its energy into your body. Beta particles are very fast travelling electrons. With much less energy than Alpha particles they do not do as much damage, but have more range and penetration. They travel about a metre in air, and can partially penetrate skin and clothing if you are close enough to the source. Fast travelling electrons are used in other situations but are not called Beta particles unless emitted by the Beta decay of an unstable isotope. Electron guns as used in old style TV sets are not Beta emitters for example. Finally Gamma rays are high energy (short wavelength) photons. Travelling at C they penetrate almost anything, including your body. That is not actually a bad thing, a fair proportion of any Gamma radiation that you may be exposed to will go right through you without interacting with anything. Gamma rays can be stopped by large amounts of steel, lead, concrete or something similar. Near working reactors neutrons are also emitted as radiation but they will be long gone. In a nutshell then the most dangerous radiation is indeed stopped by radiation suits. The real danger is inhaling or ingesting any radioactive material or dust etc. Also keep in mind that the most strongly radioactive materials have short half-lifes, and will be gone by now. Most of what is left will be longer half-life isotopes like Cesium, daughter products and the like. These things are nasty but they are known risks. I would still consider visiting such a place for mere tourism foolish in the extreme. ",

            "answer_text": "The Chernobyl unit control rooms (all four of them) are already reasonably accessible to visitors with appropriate escorts and PPE. Unit 4 control room is heavily contaminated and has some significant radiation areas in it. The major concern would be internal dose via ingestion or inhalation of loose contamination. This is effectively controlled using simple PPE, and it is now monitored using scintillation-based whole-body counting. ChNPP issues reusable cotton clothing including a hair cover, pants, shirt, jacket, gloves, socks, shoes, and a dust mask. Contamination on the operating benches in the Unit 4 control room ranges up to about 30 kCPM on a 2\u2033 pancake Geiger detector, which, subject to a few hand-waving assumptions, is around a thousand times higher than what would be allowable for release from radiological controls in the United States and about 500 times typical natural background on this type of detector:  The highest radiation fields in the room today are in the back, along the south wall abutting the turbine building. This area typically holds little interest for visitors (though it is used by ChNPP employees to take illicit smoke breaks). There are some areas that range up to about 30 milliroentgen (mR) per hour, roughly equal to 30 mrem/h, from gamma radiation. In the United States regulatory framework, such an area would be controllable as a posted \u201cRadiation Area,\u201d and is about 2000 times local background. In contrast, the front of the control panel has minimal external radiation fields despite the contamination on the surfaces there.  Nothing is particularly frightening about the radiological state of the Unit 4 control room. I have spent hours in there. I am not sure where this \u201c40000 times normal\u201d figure originates, but I will speculate that it\u2019s due to uninformed use of a measuring instrument. ",
