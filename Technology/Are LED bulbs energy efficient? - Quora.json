            "answer_text": "Well despite what all the other answers are saying, in absolute terms NO, current LED bulbs are not particularly efficient. If a white light was 100% efficient, it would generate around 250 Lumens (depending on the colour temperature) for each watt of power used. However few of today\u2019s LED bulbs that are generally available exceed 100 Lumens per watt, and many are significantly worse than this. So generally you\u2019re not going to get better than 40% efficiency. Within the last year or so there have been white LED bulbs in the laboratory that achieve more than 200 Lumens per watt. These are some way from reaching the domestic market, although they are beginning to appear in the industrial market. Here\u2019s an example: ISON\u2122 LED High Bay | HBIF3 - Orion Energy Systems Inc. Specialist lighting aside though, one of the issues in the domestic market is that manufacturers are not required to have (nor do consumers have enough knowledge to demand that) their products state efficiency in Lumens per watt. The information (Lumen output and wattage stated separately) is there to allow this to be calculated but few buyers do this and take it into account when choosing. The choice is generally made by a combination of brightness and purchase cost, and of course it\u2019s generally cheaper to produce the less efficient LED lights. So there\u2019s limited competitive drive to improve product efficiency, and in fact if anything competition driven by lowest cost is acting against efficiency. All that said, for domestic use, most of the LED bulbs on the market are better than any other lighting technology you can buy today. Together with their other advantages, including backward compatibility with existing light fittings, this should make LED bulbs first choice for the majority of lighting needs. One exception is halogen bulb replacement, as mains powered LED bulb technology for such a small form factor is not really comparable yet in light quality. Also for very occasional use lighting the additional expense of an LED bulb might not be justified, although of course prices are falling. However when buying LED lights, especially for high demand lighting areas (bright, multiple bulbs, and/or heavy use), the savvy consumer should do some research and consider exactly how efficient different LED bulb options from different manufacturers are before buying. EDIT: if you can\u2019t be bothered working out the comparison, the filament-style LED bulbs are generally around the best you can get today for efficiency, in some cases exceeding 120 Lumens per watt. Like this one for example:  Also they look good as well! ",

            "answer_text": "LED Lights Are The Most Expensive - 16 Times More Expensive Than Incandescent Bulbs  At present, incandescent lamps are facing gradual elimination of the situation, energy - saving lamps become the mainstream of the market. In the market, it is not hard to find that energy-saving lamps become the main product, new LED lights are not hard to buy, and incandescent lamps have been difficult to find. From the appearance, the LED lamp not only has bulb ball but also has a lamp tube. However, the labeling of the outer package shows that the power of the LED lamp is much lower than that of an ordinary incandescent lamp.  The brightness of LEDs and CFLs selected is mainly based on the wattage corresponding to incandescent lamps marked on the packaging box. A 3-watt LED lamp with an illumination equal to the 25-watt incandescent lamp.  According to the data, many people still choose incandescent or energy-saving lamps, and there are not many customers for LED bulbs. \"LED lights are too expensive.\" LED lights are 16 times more expensive than other energy-saving or incandescent bulbs.  Incandescent Bulbs Consume The Most Electricity  So what are the practical effects of these common bulbs on the market? Here's a comparison of three common bulbs on the market.  The three types of bulbs are incandescent, energy-saving and LED, with prices ranging from USD3.00 to USD49.80. The rated power of the incandescent lamp is 40 watts, and the rated power of CFL is 8 watts. The nominal power of the LED lamp is equal to 40 watts, while that of a LED lamp is 5 watts.  In the experiment, the three bulbs were connected to a 220-volt lamp holder in a darkroom, and the current was measured by an ammeter to measure the actual power of the bulb. At the same time, the packaging box of three light bulbs is placed 30 centimeters away from the bulb, and the reflection of the box is photographed with the camera with fixed exposure, so as to feel the difference between the three light bulbs directly.  By testing the current, the actual power of the three bulbs was quickly obtained. The current of an incandescent lamp is about 0.18 amperes, and the measured power is about 40 watts. The current of the energy-saving lamp is about 0.035 ampere, and the measured power is about 7.7 watts. The LED is about 0.021 amperes, and the measured power is about 4.6 watts. From these data, the incandescent lamp measured the highest power, is also the most power consumption.  LED Lights Are The Brightest And Coldest  So what about the actual lighting effect of the three bulbs? The same exposure combination was used to take a series of photos to record the reflection of different light bulbs on the box. The photos showed that the LED bulb had the highest brightness despite its nominal power of only 5 watts. Incandescents are slightly less bright, giving off yellow light that looks bright but feels relatively soft. Energy - saving lamp the shape of the tube is back, the luminous area is larger, but the color is white when looking directly at a bit harsh.  Same as 40 watts or equivalent to 40 watts, why is the lighting effect different? That's because light from incandescent bulbs and CFLs diverges in all directions, while light from LEDs is emitted in a single direction, making them appear brighter than the other two bulbs.  In terms of heat dissipation, incandescent bulbs cannot be touched directly by hand due to the high temperature after 2 minutes of use. Although energy-saving lamps are obviously hot, it does not feel very hot if you hold the lamp with your hand. However, LED bulbs are very small.  LED Lights Are The Most Cost-Effective  At that price alone, buying an LED is the equivalent of buying 16 incandescent bulbs or nine CFLs. LED lights are obviously not as cost effective as CFLs and incandescent bulbs. However, taking factors such as power consumption and lamp life into account, the LED lamp's lighting life is calculated at 15000 hours, equivalent to the sum of 15 incandescent lamps or 3 energy saving lamps. In terms of power consumption, incandescent lamps need to consume 600 degrees of electricity, energy-saving lamps are 115.5 degrees, while LED lamps are only 69 degrees.  Calculated at USD0.48 per kilowatt hour, the charge for 15,000 hours is USD333 for incandescent bulbs, USD139.44 for energy saving lamps, and USD82.92 for LED lamps. If used for a long time, LED light is the most cost-effective, and the best lighting effect.  ",

It is also proven by the scientist that LED lighting bulbs are more energy efficient and long lasting.   Lets have a look on its extraordinary feature- Long life The lifespan of LED light is much longer than the life cycle of incandescent, HID lamp or fluorescent sources. A high quality LED will generally last 70,000 hours or longer. If a LED fixture is illuminated an average of eight hours per day, it will last over 20 years before needing to be replaced Energy efficient LED is the most efficient lighting source; its energy efficiency level is 80%-90% if compared to traditional bulbs, which means that about 80% electrical energy gets converted into light, while just 20% being lost, which get converted into heat Eco-friendly All components of LED lights are 100% recyclable, and they also help to reduce carbon footprint by one-third. Durability LEDs are quite durable and created with robust components that are highly tuff and can withstand extreme conditions. No maintenance As an LED bulb has longer lifespan as compared to a fluorescent tube, the time spent on maintenance and replacement can be reduced drastically if LED lights are used.

            "answer_text": "An electrical current passes through a microchip, which illuminates the tiny light sources we call LEDs and the result is visible light. To prevent performance issues, the heat LEDs produce is absorbed into a heat sink. LED lighting products produce light approximately 90% more efficiently than incandescent light bulbs. Compared to traditional incandescents, energy-efficient lightbulbs such as halogen incandescents, compact fluorescent lamps (CFLs), and light emitting diodes (LEDs) have the following advantages: 1.Typically use about 25%-80% less energy than traditional incandescents, saving you money 2.Can last 3-25 times longer. LED bulbs are becoming increasingly popular for their low energy use in everything from residential lighting applications to street lighting. These lamps not only use up to 85 percent less energy, but can last anywhere from 25 to 30 years because they have no filament to burn out. Although current LEDs on the market tend to be on the pricey side, they will eventually make up for their initial cost in annual energy savings. ",

Some of the off brands I have been lucky to have last 5 minutes about the best they have done was about 3 months. I bought four 6oW equivalent Phillips bulbs 8 months ago they are guaranteed for 3 years. They had similar construction with the off brand bulbs. As of now two failed together about two months ago then I replaced another one Friday. That makes three out of four and I expect the fourth one to fail so I can return them soon. I am disappointed with them. I just started on a box of eight GE bulbs with different construction I hope they do better. ",
