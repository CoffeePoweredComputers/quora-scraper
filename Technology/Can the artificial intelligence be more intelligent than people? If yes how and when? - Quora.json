            "answer_text": "Are you more intelligent than your neighbor? How do you prove it? What about you being more intelligent than an Australian aborigene? How do you justify your statement? There is no proof or justification about you being more intelligent than anybody (or less intelligent, for the sake of argument). There is no Fundamental Theory of Intelligence to explain how and why you are like that compared with any other person. Such Theory should explain also why animal intelligence cannot process abstractions and it has instincts instead of free will (like we humans have, and that is what pushes us to think humanly). As long as we do not have it (THE Theory) we cannot IN ANY WAY simulate/emulate/create Artificial Intelligence, the one real, on par with human one. Machine learning/deep learning do NOT processes abstractions, but symbols. Symbols are weak replacements for concrete notions. We can use ML/DL, but these technologies are not AI, but PI - PseudoIntelligence. Do you know what Pseudo means in Greek? Or maybe SynthI, meaning that we take parts of human/natural intelligence and digitize them, fusing them together. It is the equivalent of chymera - another term from Greek mythology, a monster made of different parts, each from a different animal. And Pseudo/Synthetic Intelligence cannot in ANY way become more intelligent than us humans, because it is a fake intelligence. It needs us permanently, programmers that make and control the algorithms ( they can improve the parameters of the processes, but not turn to other processes to control them; for example DeepWhatever from Google was able to beat human champion at Go, an ancient and difficult game, but it is totally unable to do it for any other game. True, it did it again for some strategy game multiplayer, but it needed human intervention for that, certain reprogramming, some changes. Or a human does not need that - and even more, a human can deal with ANY kind of data as input, while such programs need specific, precise data, or else\u2026 All these arguments disqualifies the so-called AI of today as Artificial General Intelligence, that one on par with HI, HumInt\u2026 ",

This AI does it FAR faster and better than a human does. Humans require crutches like alphabetizing. You don\u2019t need Turnit Over\u2019s(TM) next to the Turnip Twaddler(TM), they never go in the same order. But a human would need to organize the warehouse in that way.The AI is faster and smarter about it. Organizing MILLIONS of objects in hours that would take teams of humans weeks or years to do. We have multiple examples of this all over. Self-driving cars as far as we can tell are set to be better drivers than we are. Able to see all 4 directions at the same time and drive safer than us. What we will NOT be seeing is general AI. AI like Cortana who can be set any task you set her/it. Computers are optimized to do their job. Building one that can do anything is a waste of a tool. You don\u2019t want your hammer to also be a welder. Just use 2 tools and stop making a generalized one.They don\u2019t work in the workshop and they don\u2019t work on the computer. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes. AI may not be more intelligent than some people but it can be more intelligent than many. It already happened. A simplified version of how intelligence operates would include the comprehension of several variables or factors, their correlation or interaction, and inference making. All these operations require maintaining information in the memory. In these logistic operations and memory retention AI beats most people. For example in the hospital intensive care units an APACHE II scoring system has been in use for a few decades now. With input of many pieces of information on a patient\u2019s vital sign and physiological function APACHE II generates a score reflecting the severity of the patient\u2019s disease and his risk of death. The score is used to guide clinician\u2019s management of the patient. An advantage of this system is that it can do its job consistently from patient to patient, which even skilled human beings don\u2019t always do. ",

Because she will have access to the brain network (culture/society/world) and learn from multiple sources and multiple brains. In short, you give her your personal knowledge then she keeps learning from the network without your participation. With AI everything gets more complicated. It is like a child that has to be trained forever and the attempts to connect it to the network so far failed miserably as it got totally confused in the infinite world of human perceptions. AI can be intelligent only in anything it was trained on, no more, no less. Can we create a network of AIs where they can train each other without our participation in the future? Time will tell. ",

They fail to appreciate how completely and fundamentally different the two things are. Our human noggin contains an extremely complex organ which evolved over 300,000 years and governs a behavior optimized for survival and reproduction. As well, our newborn brain still needs over twenty years of worldly experience just to understand other humans and attain some basic common sense. We acquire our highly flexible intelligence by interacting with the world as a human being. No computer can ever do that. Current developments in AI aren\u2019t showing any progress in a biological or general type of intelligence beyond a very low level. The top researchers are saying that even a primitive AGI is a long way off and it\u2019s unknown how it would ever compare to human intelligence. No one really knows what computers will be doing in one hundred, fifty or even ten years. All we can say for sure is it will be distinctly non-human. ",
