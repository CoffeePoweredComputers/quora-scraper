If so, how does it achieve that given that they are both linear voltage regulators?\u201d The GND / Adj pin current (basically the supply current of the regulator itself) can be different. The effect of this current on the efficiency is usually negligible, however for low-power circuitry, it can be significant. Considering these two parts, the difference is small: both draw around 50 microampers. If the device itself consumes 20 microampers only, it\u2019s probably a good idea to look for a better efficiency regulator to conserve battery charge. If the GND / Adj pin current is small compared to the load, the efficiency of all linear regulators is Uout/Uin, regardless of the part or circuit details. All linear regulators have exactly the same efficiency. ",
