            "answer_text": "QLED is a very broad term for mini-LED displays, quantum dot layer simply converts the blue mini-LED\u2019s behind the LCD into RGB, this turns into vastly superior IPS panels with pretty perfect blacks, in fact this is the ultimate LCD display that for some reason only comes to production in 2019\u20132020 as opposed to 10 years ago. Picture quality of OLED is better, since it\u2019s emissive technology, but it will only be better for a short time before the burn-in will slowly destroy the image, and before the organic pixels lose their color and become washed out. OLED is also super dim and unsuitable for bright rooms. OLED TV technology is not the same as OLED in your phone, it\u2019s much worse, it\u2019s fundamentally different only sharing the organic pixel chemistry, because it\u2019s impossible to make OLED panels that are in your phone bigger than ~5\u2033 in size. OLED TV\u2019s also have PWM flicker at low brightness when you\u2019re watching TV at night, this leads to feeling of sand in your eyes, and other cases migraines. So the best TV you can get today is QLED/Mini-LED (they are the same thing) a miniLED display must have the quantum dot film otherwise the picture will be blue instead of RGB. These TV\u2019s will easily have 240Hz refresh rates, will have HDR, will not burn-in and die like OLED. OLED is too disposable and with normal TV cycle being 10 years or so, OLED simply won\u2019t last that long. ",

            "answer_text": "Q. Between OLED and QLED, which one has a better image? Which one is better for gaming like frame rate and refresh rate? A. I can\u2019t speak specifically for gaming. I am not a gamer and no one in our home uses a TV for gaming. As far as the first part is concerned - which TV has better image quality - I think OLED is superior on all respect accept for brightness. ",
