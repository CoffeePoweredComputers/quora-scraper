            "answer_text": "I have taught modern military forces techniques from Sojutsu (spear) in using bayonet and battojutsu (sword drawing) in drawing the pistol. I have also seen a Japanese showman cut a \u2018bullet\u2019 fired at him, but I also saw Penn and Teller catch bullets in their teeth. Warfare evolves. Having a number of katana (sword) from o-datchi to tachi (long to short) and shinken to iaito (real sword to modern sword). None of these swords would do much against a 5.56 round. If you get the angle just right you may deflect the round\u2026but where will it go? And this is before we take automatic fire into account, and bullets from military rifles travel faster than the speed of sound\u2026 A Samurai sword wouldn\u2019t make much of a dent in modern body armour, but a modern rifle would go through Samurai yoroi like paper. I know a Samurai could cut around gaps in the armour, but you still have distance to take into account\u2026 Modern soldiers kill from a long way-a-way. Bayonet fighting is rare because there are so many alternatives. Artillery, main-battle-tanks, infantry fighting vehicles, multiple barrel rocket launchers, air support from fast-aircraft, helicopters, remotely piloted vehicles (drones) both large and small\u2026 War evolved for a reason. We learn to defeat their weapons, they get new weapons, they defeat our weapons, we get new weapons. Your friend has a very romantic notion of Samurai, but it probably comes from not practising Samurai arts, or watching too much anime. ",

            "answer_text": "When we look through history we see that swords, spears and longbows gradually go out of style once firearms are introduced and improved. This happened pretty much everywhere, even in Japan. In the centuries before samurai were essentially dissolved in the late 1800s, they were even known to use firearms themselves because as it turns out, they were effective. And those were crude 1500-1800s era firearms, pretty crappy compared to what we have today. Katana were certainly used alongside said firearms ofcourse as it took until the early 1900s for guns to gradually but more or less completely replace melee weapons in most parts of the world. In the katana vs bullet side of it, it is certainly been demonstrated that bullets fired onto the edge of a katana can in fact be split and leave the blade intact. However, bullets not hitting the katana perfectly aligned with the edge have a drastically different effect and can quite easily mess up the blade to the point of no longer being a viable weapon. So while I can\u2019t say I have empirical evidence that a samurai could 100%-for-sure-ive-seen-it-happen be killed by a hail of bullets from a modern rifle, I\u2019d say history indicates that it is the more likely outcome that said samurai would end up quite dead indeed.
