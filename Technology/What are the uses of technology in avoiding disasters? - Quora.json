            "answer_text": "With some technologies you can predict a disaster like floods and cyclones and take necessary precautions to limit the damage. But no such technology is yet to be devised for earth quakes and the late President, Abdul Kalam used to make frequent references to such a technology. but with proper technology in construction, you can limit the damage to great extent.
