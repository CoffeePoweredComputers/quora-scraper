            "answer_text": "Farming is hard work. In the west a lot of farming is mechanized and the farms is a lot bigger. With that being said, higher risks, higher input costs and more marginal profits, economies of scale prevail. The less developed / mechanized farmers work physically harder. I believe you still have to plow, sow, reap. Tend livestock. I have personally cut hay through the night, plowed 14 hours non stop. I am sure others will answer the same. The bigger the farm, the bigger the machines, tractors, plows etc. Farming in Europa, super industrialized. BUT, long hours. Seasonally little sleep. It is maybe not backbreaking any more for Eurocentric communities but is is still hard long hours. The tools exists and is getting better but the hours has stayed the same. Try a dairy farm on industrial scale for long hours. ",

            "answer_text": "Well it's much less labour intensive and has been for a while but there's still a lot of hard work to be done. There's fencing, shearing, milking, stock handling, heavy machinery to maintain etc\u2026 and most fruit and vegetables are still harvested and packaged manually. Farming will always involve some heavy labouring and long days, but as the saying goes, hard work never killed anyone. You'll get a sore back sometimes but not a broken one. ",
