            "answer_text": "I would say there are four main groups excited for Cyberpunk 2O77 Some people see it as a futuristic version of GTA. All I can say to that is: WRONG.The game studios current fanbase, of course, as with any other game from any studio.Fans of the Cyberpunk 2O2O and 2O13 pen and paper RPGs who want to see the game translated to the AAA videogame setting properly.RPG fans. And on that point, I believe some elaboration is needed. As we know it, the modern AAA RPG doesn\u2019t ever exist in its full. Take Skyrim, which incorporates RPG elements in the way of multiple playstyles and imaginative role-playing while most of the game design and quest structure is 1OO% linear.Take Kingdom Come Deliverance, which is relatively similar to Skyrim, but in a realistic setting and focuses on ambient interaction and learning curves as RPG elements.Take the Witcher III: Wild Hunt, which focuses largely on role-playing within a set role with non-linear narrative scenarios through choice and consequence mainly in dialogue.There is always a certain element that these games are forced to focus on, and leaving the rest out, half-RPGs I would say.What\u2019s left for someone who wants a more rounded RPG experiences? Well, you have the indies, 2D puzzle solvers and isometric RPGs which simply aren\u2019t capable of immersing the player into a world and narrative the same way a AAA title can.The reason for the hype is that Cyberpunk 2O77 seems to be encompassing the largest scale of the RPG experience in a AAA setting so far, in a very unique noir theme.Character-creation, non-linear gameplay and narrative, multiple playstyles, choice and consequence, gear customization and character-development, skills communicate with dialogue, quests and level design, there\u2019s item inspection, romance options and background checks as well.Also a number of sandbox elements, such as free driving and vehicle customization, activities like mini-games, strip clubs, boxing, etc.These elements to be framed out with the high quality writing philosophy expected from Projekt Red, inside an enormous futuristic metropolis (something that was never even attempted yet) in a cyberpunk theme, add to that that Projekt Red has had practically double the staff they had for the Witcher III: Wild Hunt and its expansion packs on Cyberpunk 2O77 and still has about 4OO+ developers working on the project, barely a year away from release, as well as running the game on a brand new engine with probable next-gen compatibility. There\u2019s a form of online element confirmed for the game, as well as single-player expansion packs to be rivalling Hearts of Stone and Blood and Wine.And those are practically the main reason for the hilarious amounts of hype around Cyberpunk 2O77. Oh, and there\u2019s Keanu Reeves playing a key role in the game, with the most amount of dialogue second only to the player, V. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, I think everyone is excited about the release of Cyberpunk 2077. The Covid-19 makes this game even more excited. I've been excited about Cyberpunk 2077 due to a perceived lack of open world gta style sci fi games in the industry over the years.  Image Source: NME I mean like really big AAA releases that can rival the likes of GTA but through the lens of science fiction/cyberpunk. It feels like something devs have avoided over the years to be honest. This game feels like it's going to break that pattern at least to me. Here is how the story is explained by a Redditor:Even back in 2007 with The Witcher 1, I've noticed CDPR really understands how to build memorable moments and situations. Scenes or quotes that really stick with you even years later not just because they were funny or ridiculous but because they were earned with complete arcs. I still vividly remember Dandelion's party with Shani and Zoltan, Iorveth finally smiling and playfully hitting Geralt in the arm, Geralt taking selfies in Toussaint with his explorer buddy, and Gaston's drinking game. Even as their writers come and go, CDPR seems to know that it's intriguing characters that make the plot and side quests come alive. I know it's a tiny detail that not many noticed in the Deep Dive video, but when V asked where Johnny was in a scared voice while hooked up to the NET I think I got a glimpse of that CDPR writing gold. Especially when we've heard that their relationship can be contentious. Gotta love that character development *chef kisses fingers*. ",
