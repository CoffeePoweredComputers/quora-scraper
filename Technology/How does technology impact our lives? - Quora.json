            "answer_text": "Technology does impact our lives in both good and the bad ways: Lets\u2019 s talk about the good things first!! With the help of advanced technology the word \u201cIMPOSSIBLE\u201d has no role to play in our lives.Technology has left no stone unturned in becoming the greatest learning source for our present and future generations. From learning to teaching. from connecting to friends through social media or ignoring them for no reason, from exploring the places online or booking tickets to travel\u2026technology has become an undetachable part of our lives. But don\u2019t forgot the other side of the coin. The solution to one problem with the help of technology has given rise to another problem. Instead of taking care personally we are sending sms or giving a call on important occasions which were attended personally in olden days. Children have no practical knowledge regarding any outdoor games because they have been playing these games online. Lack of sleep, health hazards, lack of social skills,stress, isolation etc \u2026are the things w have gain from internet. In short using a particular thing for limited time is good but getting addicted to anything is bad. ",
