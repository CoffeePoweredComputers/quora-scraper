            "answer_text": "The iPhone XR is a better buy especially in India. There\u2019s a huge price difference between the two here but if you are getting one from outside of India, you should go for the 11. But if you are buying from India carry on reading - XR looks exactly the same as the 11, but just has 2 cameras on back and a slight repositioning of the logo.XR is still pretty new, just launched a year ago and is available for 39k on Amazon whereas the 11 is available for 57k. So you are saving a ton of money.You will get the updates for the next 4 years with the XR, whereas with 11 you\u2019ll get it for 5 years. But since majority of us change phones in 3\u20134 years the XR should definitely last the duration.The battery life on the 11 is only 1 hour more compared to the XR. The XR out performs all the other iPhones be it X, XS etc when it comes to battery life.If you are not very keen of the wide angle camera then you can totally get the XR. I had the option to choose the XR or 11 and I opted for an XR and I don\u2019t regret it. Hope this helps. If you liked my answer please upvote so that others can benefit from it. :) ",
