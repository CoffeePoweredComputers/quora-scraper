            "answer_text": "Are we talking about Samsung Electronics or Samsung as a whole? If you're comparing Apple to Samsung, then Samsung. It's a multinational conglomerate company. They sell phones, washing machines, health equipment and even make ships. If you compare Apple, then Apple is literally just a spec compared to what Samsung does globally.  However, Apple has been very good, at PR. They have one of the most recognisable logos in the world. The simple Apple with a little bit is so noticeable, well placed and extremely well managed. If anything goes wrong PR wise, Apple are soon to damage control it. It's one of their biggest selling points. Without it, no iDevice would sell like they do.  Anyways, enough about the comparison and onto the question! Popularity SamsungSamsung works in many, many different industries around the world and really depends where who you're talking too. If you're speaking to an American about phones, they'll most likely say Apple. But if you're talking to someone from a third-world country, they'll say Samsung. This is because Samsung has budget lines for these developing countries. The budget lines pack a punch and have high sales for their low price. The thing that gives Samsung the edge here, is how they've entered so many different markets, they've managed to spread their brand name.AppleThe way Apple works is through exclusive PR. By owning an iDevice, you're owning something exclusive and luxurious. That's what Apple try  to do and do well. Apple haven't gone into many markets. They're in the hand-held music player, phone, tablet, laptops, desktop computer and a few other markets which are all within the personal tech industry. Apple focus on first-world countries because the expensive price is unattainable to developing nations. Like above, Samsung has the edge hereOverallBoth companies have a huge name for themselves. But like I said, it depends who you're talking too. Apple is a very Westernised brand name, specifically in relation to the markets above. Samsung however has grown and is in many different markets and industries.Value and wealth SamsungAccording to Wikipedia, Samsung's figures are as follows (2014):Revenue 305 billion USDNet income 22.1 billion USDTotal assets 529.5 billion USDTotal equity 231.2 billion USDThose are some massive figures. Looking at the Apple figures for 2015, the only place that Apple beats Samsung is the Net income (see below). Another thing that Samsung has, is nearly 4x more employees. Samsung has a worldwide collective of 489,000 employees.AppleAgain, according to Wikipedia, Apple's figures are as follows (2015):Revenue 233.715 billion USDNet income 53.394 billion USDTotal assets 290.479 billion USDTotal equity 119.355 billion USDIf you compare the 2 sets of figures, Samsung dwarves Apple in 3/4 of the categories, with Samsung's total assets being above 300 billion USD more. OverallThe figures don't lie (or well, shouldn't), and it appears that Samsung has a lot more money than Apple. Samsung have a lot more of an impact globally and have spread their name far and wide to earn the most money possible.Complete overall Both companies are huge, but Samsung has diversified and has managed to gain money through expansion. Samsung Electronics is one of the few Android phone manufactures to make a profit. They also own some pretty big real estate.
