            "answer_text": "In short, you can't prevent DVD files to be copied. Encryption and region encoding in DVDs was conquered years ago. Your best alternative is to embed some kind of watermark inside the photos. Make it visible across the whole image so that it is not easy to remove using a tool such as PhotoShop. If they are previews, I think that it will be acceptable for your clients to have such watermarks and get the actual photo file once they agree to purchase them. ",

            "answer_text": "If photos convert them to a slideshow using something like Nero or proshow producer add motion to the photos, this way screenshots will become harder. If video, add black video on the beginning or end of the video files or both sides. When the Dvd is ready calculate where the black video is and puncture the Dvd with a needle, thus making it unreadable in that spot. That blocks all copying programs from reading it. There is a workaround but we don't want it known do we :) ",
