            "answer_text": "Leaves are not organisms by themselves. They are part of a living organism called a plant. Depending on the type of the plant, some leaves stay permanently and don\u2019t fall off while others do as part of a normal process of lifecycle of that partical plant. Leaves are basically liver, and kidneys, and lungs in one. Process of photosynthesis happens there. The rest of the plant brings water and minerals from the ground and protects the leaves, carries them and exposes leaves to the sunshine. So, some leaves \u201cdie\u201d on the branch and fall of \u201cdead\u201d. Some fall or are taken down by some outside force (a curious human, maybe!) and thereafter they still continue with \u201cliving\u201d for sometime, ie, processes continue. Was the exact mechanism and time of \u201cdeath\u201d I don\u2019t know but it probably has to do with absence of fluid, ie, water. ",

            "answer_text": "A leaf doesn\u2019t die at all; neither is it born. Nothing is born or dies. In the case of your leaf, its elements lose stability, it falls apart, becomes humus, then soil, and moves on to nourish other living things. We\u2019re all connected, and the connections aren\u2019t broken; they continue. A leaf in the American Midwest will become soil, butterflies, dust on the piano, even the piano itself; it\u2019ll become part of the person your great grandchild marries; it\u2019ll be part of a fly that pauses on the new president\u2019s nose during the inauguration. Be nice to every living thing, says the Dalai Lama, because everything was once your mother. Even the leaf. ",
