            "answer_text": "I hate to consider answering these types of questions because the result has no significance whatsoever on the safety of transport. Such questions have as much meaning as asking, \u201c What is the meaning and purpose of life\u201d when it is us who need to provide meaning and purpose to life! It is stupid to compare the danger of transport based on per unit mile traveled. Also, are we to consider, the damage to the vehicle, the number of deaths or the numbers of injuries whatever their gravity?Let us take three land vehicles, one is a slow school bus with 50 children on board driving twice daily through a busy city, one is a car with single driver driving through a busy city during the busiest time and one car belong to a farmer's teacher wife who uses in to go to the country school on side roads which do not carry many other cars. Irrespective of the miles they cover, logic suggests that the most dangerous should be the bus, then next is the city car and the least dangerous would be the isolated country car. No doubt a sports car would be the most dangerous, but it has nothing to do with the car itself and more with the state of mind of the driver himself! It is not the crafts that are dangerous but the conditions and the state and environment they operate in, as in air displays. If any form of transport happens to have an incident, then the question to ask is which transport craft would be the most dangerous to the people in it and those outside it.There are so many to consider, including, the aircrafts, the ships, the trains, the busses, the trucks, the cars, the bicycles, motorcycles, the gondolas in Venice and the longboats in canals, the ambulances and the police cars which have their own preference/priority state to consider, society being what it is . In an incident involving an aircraft, the possibility of total loss through death in and outside the aircraft is rather high and much higher than the sea and land transport, merely due to the fact that there is a third dimension of height and altitude involved and this danger is shown by referring to the salary offered to pilots. A pilot does not use any higher skills than a bus driver driving through a busy city center for long hours. We should judge the dangerous factor of a craft by the number of deaths per incident and not per mile! That alone would suggest that the aircraft is the most dangerous means of transport. But of course that would not go down well with statistics and so we introduce the \"PER MILE\" condition/state as the aircraft would balance its danger with the speed and vast amount of miles it covers. In addition to the salary of a pilot, one should weigh up the insurance premiums to judge which is the most dangerous and risky vehicle to use. Statistics could be made to play a nice but cruel social game.Considering the engineering and piloting of any craft, I would suggest that all the level and standard of workmanship, engineering and the qualifications of the licensed pilots and drivers of any transport vehicle, would be at par with each other as no person in his right mind would expect the level of engineering and piloting/driving of any craft would be any different and below safety standard. The safety of a car is no better than that of an aircraft, even if one considers the tons of flammable fuel an aircraft carries and the fact that landing is the most dangerous part, which other vehicles do not need to experience.What makes quite a difference is the density of the traffic one operates in and the most dangerous would be city driving in the busy hours, where one would expect the high-density driving would be tiresome and stressful where thousands of vehicles move about per square mile. Luckily not all finish in death. The trains would be less dense, while the aircraft would be the least dense traffic, including the shipping operating offshore, but certainly not in busy harbors.There are so many blinding factors to hide the danger of transport, including telling the pilot that he is solely responsible for the passengers and the head honcho, in the plane, when this is the best lie only believed by fools. A pilot is only responsible to save his own life and that is what he is trained for. Obviously this is hidden away from him as that statement would not go down well with the passengers who fly with him who all think that they have a superman to save them when in fact, they are totally on their own as when they ride in a bus or a train, but not when driving their own car. A pilot in commercial flying is forced to save his life, even if he is flying an empty aircraft or one full of cargo. The aircraft is an expensive asset and risky and dangerous to fly and so there is psychology used on both pilots and passengers which is seldom used on busses and trains and taxi cabs. Irrespective of what type of transport vehicle one considers, the worse situation is when air pilots and sea captains and land drivers find that their \"docile vehicle\" is totally out of control and some activity severed all the controls to the stability of the craft. At that moment the docile steed becomes a wild bull, and the drivers and the pilots and the captains become masses being thrown about like cowboys riding a bull.In those conditions, every means of transport is like the wild bulls shown in the submitted videos and all are equally dangerous.Any form of Transport is like any Religion-based only on hope and faith of arriving at the destination and one cannot be totally rational when taking a flight, or a bus, train, car, horse, bull, bicycle and motorcycle ride. The truth is that people like the benefits and conveniences and comforts or transport and they will proceed to take the risk. Considering the relativity of what pilots and drivers get paid and what passengers are willing to pay for the ride in vehicles and cowboys riding on the back of a wild bull for excitement, all one can say is that many people lower the value of their own life where one can definitely say, LIFE IS CHEAP, even when one travels first-class hoping to get the better treatment as they got on the Titanic!

            "answer_text": "Answering raises issues over whether we mean in practice or under ideal conditions, and at what point we distinguish between transport and leisure. One possible answer is \u2018whichever one, regardless of it\u2019s nature, which is most often operated by people who are incompetent or malicious\u2019. E.g. while part of the reason both air and rail passengers are killed far less often than car occupants lies in the physical nature of both modes, another is that train drivers and airline pilots tend to be far more skilled and responsible people than the average car driver. If car drivers had to demonstrate (and keep demonstrating) skills and responsible attitudes to the same standards to keep their licences, the roads would be both a lot safer and a lot emptier. Do we count such modes as hang-gliders, canoes, swimming or skiing as forms of transport? All can occasionally be used as means of getting from A to B, even if more often used for leisure. Do we distinguish people who drive for the fun of it with no destination in mind from those who drive to get somewhere, or treat all car driving and motorcycling as transport? Assuming we exclude rare modes such as swimming and hang-gliding used as transport, and assume a skilled and sensible user, the answer is probably motorcycling in areas where road maintenance is poor.
