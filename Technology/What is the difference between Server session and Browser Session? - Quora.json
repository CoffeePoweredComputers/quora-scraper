            "answer_text": "A server session creates a file in a temporary directory on the server where registered session variables and their values are stored. This data will be available to all pages on the site during that visit. A session ends when the user loses the browser or after leaving the site, the server will terminate the session after a predetermined period of time, commonly 30 minutes duration. I think both of them are same. Because a browser session remains as long as the user has kept the browser opened. As soon as he closes it, the session expires. And once this session expires, it sends data to the server to close this session over there as well. So they both work simultaneously I believe. Hope this helps. ",

Server then uses the features of the cryptographic scheme to verify the auth token on the fly to authenticate clientRef: Sessions vs. Token based authentication ",
