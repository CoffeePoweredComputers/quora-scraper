A Great laptop should contain the following aspects to pass and achieve best inspection and higher rating.   No bottoming out: The most important thing is to have a keyboard that makes it difficult to \"bottom out\" or hit the base with a lot of force while typing. Bottoming out makes your fingers sore and slows you down.Good feedback: You want the keys to feel springy but not stiff, so they pop back up quickly and offer enough resistance to prevent you from bottoming out.Deep travel: The more space between the key and its base, the less likely you are to bottom out. A typical laptop has between 1.5 and 2mm, while thinner ones have less than that. However, great feedback can make up for shallower travel.High actuation force: The harder you have to press the keys to make them actuate, or register the press, the less likely you are to hit the base hard; 60 to 70 grams of force is typical.Honestly a Laptop following these modifications are essential to make a good rating. Doing designs like changing the colors and the keyboard key configurations are also advisable. ",
