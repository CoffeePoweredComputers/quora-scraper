Ringing Bells, which is quite a new company had started its operations only last year will start with the production of the handsets in Phase-I and aims at full indigenous development of the feature-rich smartphones, it said. It did not disclose any other details about manufacturing, products and pricing. The company had recently entered the Indian mobile phone market, with a Smart 101 phone for Rs 2,999. It also offers two feature phones Master and 4u priced at Rs 999 and Rs 799, and a 5,600mAh power bank called Kiwi priced at Rs 399 in its portfolio. This is a very good initiative by the company and the Indian government, as this will allow more and more people to more ahead with technology especially in the rural areas.
