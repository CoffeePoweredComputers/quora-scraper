            "answer_text": "Thanks for A2A. Optical Fiber is a wired communication medium. It is made using one or many thin strands of glass or plastic.  These thin strands are packed together closely and is known as the \u201dCore\u201d. Each strand is further covered by another transparent covering known as \u201cCladding\u201d. Being delicate, the core and the cladding are further protected by various other coverings.  Optical Fiber works on the principle of \u201dTotal Internal Reflection\u201d of light. This principle states that, \u201cWhen a ray of light travelling from an optically rarer medium to a relatively denser medium, is incident upon it with an angle, greater than the critical angle for that pair of medium, the light ray gets totally internally reflected.\u201d  Since the light gets reflected due to its own properties, and not mirrors, the light intensity is preserved. Further, since light is unaffected by electric and magnetic fields, optical fibre has a very low attenuation rate of 0.0001 dB/km. Also, this loss occurs mainly at the joint of two optical fibres. Since light is used for transmission, speed of transmission is comparable to the speed of light, and the bandwidth of Optical Fibre is Infinite.  Uses: Optical Fibre is present invisibly, everywhere. The whole Internet Backbone runs on Optical Fibre. Undersea cables spread across oceans are actually optical fibre. In mobile communications, only the connection from our phone to the BTS(Cell Tower) is wireless, rest of the communication is handled using Optical Fibre. Even in the case of Telephones, Copper wire is used from our home to the distribution box, rest of the communication is via Optical Fibres.  Shown above, is the current scenario. With the advent of Fibre Broadband, we will get an Optical Fibre directly coming to our home router.  Hope you liked my answer. ",
