If your existing phone is having some issue / outdated, I suggest that you buy one of the phones listed in Best cheap phones 2020: top budget mobiles in India immediately. No network in India supports 5G for now. It will take at least 9 months for commercial 5G lauch in India. It might take around 2 years at least for multiple telecom companies to support 5G. New 4G phones purchased now have 1 year warranty and will start becoming outdated only after 2 years. You can plan to update from 4G to 5G after 2.5 years with cheaper 5G phones ",
