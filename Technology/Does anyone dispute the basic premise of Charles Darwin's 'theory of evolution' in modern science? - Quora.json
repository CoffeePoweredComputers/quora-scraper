            "answer_text": "Yes. The Majority of scientists may or may not accept evolution, (most are not sure how it happened). But of those who are not scientists there are:40% of Americans Believe in Creationism Over 40 Percent Of Americans Believe In Creationism, Survey Says Seventh-day Adventists reaffirm six-day creation Why the hold out? Look at this.What the Fossil Record Tells Us About EvolutionThe fact is there is evidence. Observable evidence that disputes what the other side has been believing. Because if evolution were true there would not be so much evidence that disputes it. Look at all of the fossils that are of the same kind that are found in different times of the earth layers. This is a definite demonstration that shows species within the kinds of organisms. And we see this all of the way up to today. There has been lifeforms that were once thought to have been extinct. But were actually found still living. These fossils are thought by some to be millions of years old. So that means that there should be no organisms alive today that are not looking like these once thought extinct lifeforms. And yet too many of them are easily seen to be to be of the same kinds of organisms. There are thousands of preserved organisms found in amber said to be millions of years old. And these have family members still living today. And even though there is supposed to be millions of years difference between the fossilized and living family members, they are easily recognized as belonging to the same kinds of organisms. So this is something the evolutionists are trying to keep from allowing to come to the front. Why even though I have mentioned this over and over again, those evolutionists who have tried to make denials about my claims, don\u2019t even bother to dispute my arguments. And the only thing that the evolutionists have come up with to dispute this is by backtracking and declaring that \u201cnot all organisms really needed to evolve, or evolve at the same pace in time\u201d. But this is like their excuse as to why evolution was not observed today. They primarily say that evolution is not observed because it happens too slowly to be observed. That no on lives long enough to confirm it actually occurring. They of course have no answer to the holes that this opens up. Because if we don\u2019t live long enough to be able to confirm it, then how could they have lived long enough to know it actually occurs? They do this all of the time for all of their evidence. They submit some outlandish excuse and explanation and then declare that it can\u2019t be observed but accept it because they are scientists and they know what is or isn\u2019t occurring better than everyone else. So they go back, tweak their theory, to accommodate the holes but provide nothing to support that the excuse actually does fill the hole. It\u2019s more like putting leaves and twigs over the hole, because it is not filled in and becomes a trap for the uninformed. And then they try to distract from the fact that even though the offspring are not identical to the parents, the descendants have still been always classified as of the same kinds of organisms as the parents. Now the skewed percentages should be expected with the amount of effort and money atheists and evolutionists have invested in removing God from public education. And this is not even mentioning the open animosity and belittling that has been shown toward Christians first and especially those who are Creationists. And children experiencing this by peers and teachers find it hard to not reject what others are making fun of them over. But this is primarily due to the Christian churches lack of making sure that what is believe is not followed up with more than just \u201cI believe\u201d. We have grown complacent with our walk with Christ and with responsibility to \u201ctrain up a child\u201d. So instead of training we expected our lives to be the training. And even then Christians have not been all that we should be living up to. So we as Christians owe our God and the world an apology. We have failed in our responsibility to \u201clet the light so shine\u201d. And we have to make up for it now. And the first way is to allow the World to see that we can trust in God\u2019s Word. Recognizing that Satan can deceive. Which is why so many scientists have fallen for the really small amount of evidence that the evolutionists claim exists in support for evolution. Which they do simply by making up the evidence and saying they don\u2019t have to provide empirical that historical evidence is just as sound. But as Creationists continue to make up the time by letting the world see the true evidence that will clearly show the smoke and mirrors magic show the evolutionists have been deceived by for so long.

            "answer_text": "Does anyone dispute the basic premise of Charles Darwin's 'theory of evolution' in modern science? To be sure we are talking about the same topic, in science, theories are proven to work explanations of facts and observations. In lay use, a \u201ctheory\u201d means, \u201chere\u2019a an idea or what I think happened\u201d , a wild guess, etc. So, evolution itself is not a theory. Evolution is an observed fact. The theory that explains how it works, in nature, is called \u201cNatural Selection\u201d. No one who understand what evolution is, or how it works, disputes evolution, or, for that matter, natural selection. It is possible to understand what evolution is, and how it works in agriculture for example, but not in nature. That is what Lamarck, etc, had been TRYING to do. They knew about evolution, they knew how it worked in agriculture, breeding crops and livestocks to get desired traits, etc\u2026 .. but, could not come up with a working explanation as to how it worked in nature\u2026 with no farmer choosing who gets to breed. Darwin\u2019s premise was very very simple, the way most brilliant ideas seem, once someone describes them. His premise was basically that in nature, instead of a farmer deciding which individuals reproduce to get traits the farmer wanted, nature did. So, all that happened was that parent\u2019s the survived to reproduce, had whatever traits worked, in nature. So, the offspring inherited whatever traits worked. And that is it in a nutshell\u2026 that is the premise\u2026 called \u201cNatural Selection\u201d. :D ",
