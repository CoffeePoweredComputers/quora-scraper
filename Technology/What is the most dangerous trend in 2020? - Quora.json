            "answer_text": "The incredible growth in media-driven race hustling. On the streets and in America\u2019s families, \u201crace\u201d relations are fine. Increased marriages across ethnic and \u201ccolor\u201d lines. On the block on which I currently reside, there are several \u201cmixed\u201d marriages and kids of all backgrounds all over the place. People are nice to one another and the atmosphere is relaxed. A few years ago I was in Seattle hosting a tech conference and walking through Redmond, I noted that every other couple seemed to be an occidental/oriental mix. (If you\u2019re triggered by \u201coriental\u201d, please keep it to yourself and I\u2019m actually quite happy if you\u2019re offended.) In a mall, I watched an O/O couple try to pose their little girl for a portrait. The baby was dressed in an adorable Scottish frock and a tam o shanter and was quite unhappy about the whole affair. I wasn\u2019t sure if the outfit was a cultural statement or the parents just thought it looked cute. I watched for a couple of minutes as mom and dad made faces at their daughter and did those little dances you do when you\u2019re trying to make an infant laugh. \u201cAmerica moving forward into the future,\u201d I thought. By contrast, watch CNN or MSNBC and it\u2019s back to Birmingham and Bull Connor. Oh, and BTW, for all those idiots going on about how police are targeting \u201cblacks\u201d for death, here\u2019s a link to the execution of Daniel Shaver, a 26 year old white guy at the hands of a murderous police psychopath. As the cop pumps five rounds into this helpless man, you can FEEL the \u201cwhite privilege\u201d oozing all over the place. The Police Murder of Daniel Shaver | National Review. The cop was acquitted of second degree murder. This video, for a reason I cannot fathom, was not shown at the trial. The psycho, after being fired, was REHIRED temporarily so he could obtain a $30K-for-life pension. He had \u201cPTSD.\u201d There are some real problems with how police are trained and hired. Too many policeman and departments adopt hyper militaristic attitudes and permit bullies and sadists to operate unchecked and don\u2019t look to weed these types out in the first place. As in the case of D. Chauvin. But ask Dan Shaver how his \u201cwhiteness\u201d worked out for him. How many minutes did CNN dedicate to this killing? rick ",

            "answer_text": "Right now it looks like the rioting. Democratic mayors and governors are getting their policeman to take a knee instead of requiring that law and order take precedence over the disorganization. The way it\u2019s being handled it and reported is also scary. Remember when the Republicans wanted the economy opened two weeks ago? When they protested, they were the objects of bad publicity because they were not wearing masks and social distancing. The people who are doing the protesting and rioting are also not wearing masks unless they don\u2019t want to be seen on security or TV cameras. They are also not social distancing. Social distancing used to be the word of the day. Now it\u2019s peaceful protesting. And when rioting breaks out, it is being called mostly peaceful protesting. Semantics is playing a large role in how this is being perceived, reported, And how it is trying to influence you and your way of thinking. ",
