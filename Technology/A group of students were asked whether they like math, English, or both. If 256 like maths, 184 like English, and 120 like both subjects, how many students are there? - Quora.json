            "answer_text": "I believe that if we subtract the number of people who like both from each individual amount of those who like one alone, we can arrive at the correct answer. This is assuming, of course, that the number of people who like both is assimilated into both other groups: Just English+Both=184 and Just Math+Both=256 and Both=120 By this reasoning, we reach: (184-120=64)+(256-120=136) 64+136=200 total people. As an aside, I believe that non-Brits were asked what subject they liked (math), and the polling was conducted among Brits (maths). Or you were in a slight hurry to type and forgot that first \u201cs\u201d ",
