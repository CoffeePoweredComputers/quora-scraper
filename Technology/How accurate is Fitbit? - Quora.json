            "answer_text": "No, it is not accurate and it is not meant to be. Fitbit trackers use a 3-axis accelerometer to understand your motions. An accelerometer is a device that turns movement (acceleration) into digital measurements (data) when attached to the body. By analyzing acceleration data, trackers provide detailed information about frequency, duration, intensity, and patterns of movement to determine your steps taken, distance traveled, calories burned, and sleep quality. The 3-axis implementation allows the accelerometer to measure your motion in any way that you move, making its activity measurements more precise than older, single-axis pedometers. Fitbit trackers have a finely tuned algorithm for step counting. The algorithm is designed to look for motion patterns that are most indicative of people walking. The algorithm determines whether a motion's size is large enough by setting a threshold. If the motion and its subsequent acceleration measurement meet the threshold, the motion will be counted as a step. If the threshold is not met, the motion won\u2019t be counted as a step. Other factors can create enough acceleration to meet our threshold and cause some over counting of steps, such as riding on a bumpy road. Equally, it's possible for the algorithm to undercount (not meet the required acceleration threshold). Examples here include walking on a very soft surface such as a plush carpet. ",

            "answer_text": "I've been wearing a Fitbit Flex for over a year now. I haven't actually counted steps or anything to try to measure its accuracy. But here's a thought about accuracy of Fitbits or similar trackers: Personally, the accuracy is not an issue for me at all. I don't need accuracy, I need consistency and \"comparability\" to other days. I don't need to know exactly how many steps I have taken today. I don't care if it's 14'234 or 14'235. But I DO care whether I have been more active than yesterday and how today compares to other days. So I use the Flex to gauge my activity with relation to other days. It reports usually in line with what I feel I have done (i.e. if I've been out for a long walk the Fitbit reflects that). The Flex, being pretty basic, can't tell the difference very well between different types of activity, but using the App (I use it on my Android phone) it's easy to enter activities like \"30 minutes weight training, high intensity\" or \"1 hour cycling at speed x\". So it end up giving a neat picture of the ups and downs of my activity. And it makes me feel bad if I don't go to the gym. ",

On several models you can watch your step count increase in real-time if you want to spot-check for a particular use case. ",
