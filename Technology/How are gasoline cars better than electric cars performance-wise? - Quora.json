            "answer_text": "I own a Tesla Model 3 and it is a really fun car to drive. Electric motors have high torque at zero rpm so they are better off the line than most ICE cars. The acceleration is very smooth as well. The Tesla smile is real. An electric car's performance weakness is the amount of energy the battery can hold. Teslas have a long-range because the resistance drag of the vehicle is very low and the energy used from the battery is very efficient. Running at high speeds and acceleration drains the battery pretty quickly. Gasoline has a MUCH greater energy density than current battery technology. That means if you are looking for performance over a long period of time an ICE vehicle will win every time. ",

            "answer_text": "performance is 100% a result of the engine. If you think most gas cars are better, i pray you never get in a drag race with a Tesla. They are easily as fast as Corvettes. There was a software patch available that gave the 2015 model a 0\u201360 time of 2.6 seconds. It was appropriately called the Ludicrous upgrade. That time is equal to the fastest Lamborghini. Electric motors have a couple of benefits that make them better: They make tons of torque and they don\u2019t require you to shift gears. The tesla doesn\u2019t have any more HP than most cars on the road, and it weighs just as much. The torque is obnoxious. Anyway i digress: it IS possible to upgrade some cars to ludicrous speed with gas engines, cheaply but that is less and less possible with computers in everything now. ",
