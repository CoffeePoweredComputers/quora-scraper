            "answer_text": "Most of the paying gigs in music technology require programming and lots of it. Start with a user-friendly graphical programming tool. Max/MSP is ideal, since it was designed for music specifically. Next, pick up a scripting language or two -- Python and Javascript would seem to be the really useful ones these days. Finally, learn a \"real\" programming language or two, or three: C, C++, Java. You would also be well served by picking up some digital signal theory, music information retrieval and machine learning. (I'm hardly an expert on any of these things; maybe someone will put some good resources in the comments.) Finally, if you can produce mobile and web apps, you'll be highly desirable in any music technology setting. Good luck! ",
