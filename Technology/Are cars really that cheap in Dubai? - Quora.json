            "answer_text": "Hey brother. 6000 salary is barely enough to live here. 20,000$ for those cars is not cheap compared to the prices in the U.S, you can get a brand new one for that price. Also, maintenance and parts over here are expensive. It's a hot country so tyres need to be changed every year or two and ACs and overheating are common issues. Consumables such as breaks need to be changed frequently. Maintenance will be around 200 per month (at least). You need a budget for parking. 6000 salary means you'll be in a sharing flat which means you won't get a annual parking permit which means you'll pay around 10\u201315 dirhams daily for parking. That's 400 per month. A budget for fines (1 radar you'll loose 10% of your salary). I pay every year about 5000$ in fines. It's normal to pay at least 1000$ in fines yearly for everyone, regardless of how careful you are. That's around 300 per month. A budget for at least once a week car cleaning (sandy). If you do it in the station it's 30 dirhams, 4 times a month is 120 per month. (Cleaning your car in the public parking is illegal) Also, you'll never become a citizen so your stay in UAE is temporary. You never know how temporary, could be 3 months before whoever hired you, fires you. You'll have to eventually sell it before importing it into another country is going to be extremely expensive. You'll loose a lot of money on depreciation because those cars specially in the UAE will loose more than half their value by the time you sell. Which is going to cost you 10,000$ in a 1 or 2 year period. This is all considering that the car you buy isn't a melon or has heavy hidden issue. These kind of cars in UAE are absolutely used to their limits in the UAE, we have long empty roads some people speed to 250\u2013300 on and empty areas with roundabouts that people drift. If the car has issues, you will truelly suffer with repair costs, they are not cheap here. Sorry to disappoint you or scare you but you can seriously ruin your life buying a car for that much with that small of an income. You really want to own a car, rent one on a monthly basis. You can get a car for 60 dirhams per day if you rent monthly (that's 1800 monthly), and pay nothing else, and be safe that way. However, I suggest you rent a car only when you need it because 6000 salary sounds like you will be stuck at work most of your week, and maybe only go out on the weekend. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes cars are cheaper and fuel is cheaper in Dubai. But car fines, parking, traffic rules and getting licence is a different story. The salary of 6000 AED if it includes accommodation then be careful. The accommodations are prohibitively expensive. It is better to do a good homework before buying a car as Dubai Public transport is world class and very reasonable in cost. The car insurance , registrations , license, parking and fines will be more expensive than using public transport leave apart annual 30 % depreciation in cost of car. Think twice. ",

            "answer_text": "As competition is high in Dubai, so prices of cars in Dubai are low comparatively from the rest of world. But I think so the person who only come to visit to Dubai for a month or less, has no need to buy a separate car for travelling, There are many rental car companies like Rental Cars UAE, Careeder, United Car Rentals,Progress Cars etc, All of them provide best services to their customers, including free delivery services and many more. I suggest for all visitors and business persons that instead of looking for new car purchasing,rent a car in Dubai at affordable price and save your time and money. ",

I moved to US from UAE and it is more or less the same here as it was in Dubai. What is more expensive is service, even simple regular check. The regular service is 5000 km for some cars. And it add up. I had a friend with older car and his service bill for one year was almost the same as the cost of the car. ",
