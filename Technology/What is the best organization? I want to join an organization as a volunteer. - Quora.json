            "answer_text": "\u201cBest organization\u201d leaves a lot of room for interpretation. Volunteering is as individual as the person doing it. Depending on your skill-set, your passion, your availability, and what organizations are even in your area, not to mention which ones have volunteer opportunities that match up with you, the list is limitless. I know people who volunteer at pet shelters because they have a heart for dogs and/or cats. This fits them perfectly but would not for me. Most hospitals have opportunities that range from assisting at the guest services desk to behind the scenes. I volunteered as a chaplain at a hospital for years and loved it. Organizations such as The Salvation Army and the American Red Cross, simply because of their size, often have the greatest diversity of types of ways to volunteer, be it something that you do regularly or just from time to time. Start by asking yourself some key questions: What is my passion?How much time do I have to give?What skills, talents, gifts do I have to share?What groups are in my area that may be able to use me?After asking yourself these questions, start your search. Thank you for wanting to give back to your community. ",
