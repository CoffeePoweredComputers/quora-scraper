            "answer_text": "My phone does, because it has been told to in order to use Siri by voice. But you should assume that if it is electronic, it has a microphone/video camera, that it is collecting data\u2014especially if you are doing something massively illegal. Since there is always a way around security, and because designers frequently put in back-doors for various reasons, you should not trust that these devices are inactive, skimpily because the device is off. If it has power, it can listen. How important this is, is up to you. But you need to be aware that your TV, phone , security system et al may be telling on you\u2014and even your power utilization profile tells a lot about your activities! The question is, how much risk is there of misuse against you, and how much value do you gain, and neither is an easy question to answer, since data can be used to sell you things you may not want or need or even don\u2019t work. (If I know what you have bought, and I know what you have returned, I can determine how likely you are to accept junk for a product without complaint\u2026 Wally-World makes millions on cheap crap that breaks immediately, because people don\u2019t bother to take really cheap crap and return it! Big data excels at finding suckers! If you value your privacy, don\u2019t do anything around such devices you wouldn\u2019t do in the middle of the street\u2026 ",

            "answer_text": "Technically speaking, yes. Even so, it has no ability to make sense of them on its own. Built-in AI like Bixby, Google Assistant, Siri, etc. are listening for their key calling before they will actively try to compute anything else you say but this does mean they are listening for these phrases at all times. There is also the concern among some that people with nefarious aims will use these aspects to their own ends by hacking into your device and thereby turn it into a remote listening device. This is possible but not something that can be done by your typical person - in other words, not common. There\u2019s even a method for doing this with speakers thereby turning them into listening devices but again, you have to know how to do it and those speakers have to be connected to something that connects out of the home. In addition to this, there\u2019s the topic of traditional wire-tapping which there is a version of this for cell phones but requires a legal reason & approval before a judge before any government agency is allowed to do it - just like with wired phones. Again, those in the know who have no qualms about being illegal could do this too (aka cyber-savvy criminals). ",
