            "answer_text": "In my experience,yes,they will dry out and possibly clog the print nozzles,and then you have a problem. You are told to print a test page periodically if you don\u2019t do that much printing. That is why I did not replace my last inkjet printer. I have a $79 b&w laser-jet that uses toner powder that does not dry out. You can get color laser-jet printers,but the cartridges can cost an arm and a leg. 99% of my printing is text,so b&w is good enough for me. Non brand name B&W cartridges can be gotten on Amazon for a huge savings. I got my laser jet in the fall,and am still using the original cartridge. They seem to last a lot longer than inkjet cartridges. ",

Why are we still need to these process on our printer? Because inkjet printer will dry up when you have a long time not to use that, it will cause the printer\u2019s printhead show some problems that cost you a lot to fix it, such as the printer won\u2019t print, you need to find out the problems between printer or cartridges, and it may takes your time to buy another printer for printing. So, let\u2019s keep your printer work 2\u20133 times a week to keep your printer run better. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, Ink cartridges dry out over time because when you are sitting in your machine for a long period, it will eventually dry up and become unusable. So, always printing once every couple of weeks to keep your ink cartridges operating smoothly. Also, printhead cleaning can regularly get an idle cartridge up and running again. If dried up ink is making a clog, the cleaning function works to prime your cartridges. ",

            "answer_text": "Sure. It\u2019s designed to dry up once printed on paper when it is exposed to air. And there is always s little air that enters the ink cartridge while printing. So it\u2019s onlt a matter of time before the ink inside the cartridge dries up. It\u2019s therefore a good idea to print something occasionally to keep ink flowing. With inkjet printers I recommend printing at least once a month. ",
