            "answer_text": "How have my parents influenced my life? They kept me out of jail. They kept me out of a grave. I'm going to start with my father, and quote part of an answer I wrote My father is a paragon. He is the greatest hero that I have ever known in the history of mankind, because he is my hero. He is the protagonist of every story, the guy everybody likes, and the guy everybody comes to when the going gets rough. He deployed to Desert Storm voluntarily. That's right, he wasn't selected to go, yet he volunteered because he wouldn't abandon his fellow Soldiers. When my father retired from the Army after 22 years of service, he took a job as a flight instructor at a well known company. Despite having been a Chief Warrant Officer 4 (a very high rank), despite having been a Company (100-150 Soldiers) Commander, and despite knowing he would be underpaid, he took it anyway. He took it because he knew he would advance. What did he do next? He bought a house that he couldn't afford - yet. He bought us the nicest house he could find, because he refused to settle. He wanted to provide us with more than he had, and so my father - the Commander, my Optimus Prime - took a second job as a stock-boy at Discount Auto Parts. He worked two jobs to be able to give his family the life he felt they deserved. Benjamin Norwood's answer to Who are your personal heroes and why? What about my mother though? My mother is the sweetest person I've ever met. Intensely loyal to her family. Forgiving above all else to her family. Family is everything to her. When my father wanted to kick me out of the house for being in a bad way, it was my mother who was my saving grace. Absolutely noone understands me like my mother. It is a special relationship that few people have. I still call her mommy, even in a warzone. My mother is the one that is always there for me. She is the one who taught me that although a problem can be too big for one person, no problem is too big for an entire family. She is the one I can turn to.  How has my mother influenced my life? She saved it. I will be going into more detail about her at a later date, with a special post just for her. When I do..I'll come back to this and update it. ",

            "answer_text": "Thank you for the A2A. I consider myself to be extremely lucky to have experienced very effective parenting. I know this is not the case with a lot of people. I am not talking about your parents loving you. Unless someone is a dysfunctional retard, he/she will always love his/her child. Even animals love their off springs. This is how we are programmed, there is nothing extra-ordinary about it. What I am referring to is effective parenting.  Both my parents, like most of my family, are extremely educated and high achievers in their professional and personal lives. They are both self-made individuals. I was brought up in an environment where people around me were motivated and hardworking. It was an inspired childhood. A lot of critical skills were inculcated in me very early in my life,which people don't learn in their entire lifetimes. Despite being financially very well off, I was never given gifts. To make my parents buy me my favorite toy, I had to accomplish something before, like solve a hundred math problems in an hour or to run half a mile in less than 10 minutes. I was made to realize that other than your parent's unconditional love, nothing comes for free and you have to work hard for everything else.  No expenses were spared in my education. Besides that, I was never provided with any unnecessary luxuries, I still am not. I never went to school in my parents' cars. Even when I missed the school bus, I had to take an auto to my school which was about 40 minutes away from my home, in the scorching Delhi heat. When I complained my mother used to tell me this:\"To fulfill your needs, we are duty bound. To satisfy your indulgence in luxuries, we are not. That, you will have to manage for yourself.\"All my needs were looked after, none of my luxuries. I never understood the logic behind this then. Now, I cannot thank them enough. I was brought up in a stable home. There were no unnecessary arguments on trivial issues between my parents. No work related problems and frustrations were brought home. Whenever they disagreed with each other on anything, they made it a point that they did so in my absence. A lot of times, they used to team up against me when I did something wrong. Then, I used to think that they both had something against me, now I realize that they in fact were on my side every single time.  They taught me how to succeed with probity and honesty, the importance of going to bed everyday with a clean conscience, and that there is no substitute to hard work. They taught me how critical it is to accept your faults, and instead of living in a state of denial and stubbornness, work toward rectifying them. They took me to places around the world, and in the process enriched my with invaluable experiences. I know the sleepless nights my parents have whenever I have something as trivial as a fever, but they never pampered me. They made me push myself to my very limits, comforted me when I fell, helped me rise up back again and kept surging me forward, relentlessly. I don't want to appear arrogant but to say that I turned out just \"okay\" would be an insult to them, to their parenting. I turned out to be awesome, and my parents deserve full credit for it. I can never forget what my father told me when I was really down one day. Me: It is over, I am tired and exhausted. I cannot do this.My father: It is not over as long as you have a beating heart. Whether your legacy is over when it does stop beating, will depend on what you do when it has not. ",
