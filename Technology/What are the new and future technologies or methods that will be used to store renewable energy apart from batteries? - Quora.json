            "answer_text": "There are many ideas for energy storage. Some of these have been implemented at large scale, and some just at small scale. Here are the ones I\u2019m aware of, excluding conventional batteries. Flow batteries (these are based on chemical reactions, like conventional batteries, but can have large storage of the materials separate from the battery itself).Fuel cells (some types are reversible, others aren\u2019t)Pumped hydroFlywheelsSuperconducting rings (energy stored in the magnetic field)Pressurized caves (the cave isn\u2019t essential, but it\u2019s a convenient large volume)Weights in mine shaftsSolar thermal, with e.g. molten saltI once heard a proposal for using nuclear weapons to melt the salt in a salt dome, then using water to extract the heat from the salt to create steam to turn a generator. Crazy, but definitely interesting.Note that there are other gravity-based \u201cstorage\u201d mechanisms, such as electric trains in hilly areas, but these are local to that system rather than used for the electric grid.

            "answer_text": "Gravity. The most reliable long term storage recoverable with advanced transportation. HEFF (Hyper-Efficient Flexfuel Frieght) is able to recover 90% of energy available to store during the sunshine day and output each night. Moving 5000 pounds per second up hill per elevated guideway. Pumped hydro would be another way to use HEFF to move water to higher lakes for recovery through hydro dams. Pumping water uphill with traditional pumps in the field is low performing. Studies of real pumps show an efficiency of 50 to 60% for the uphill trip and 91% ish for water downhill generation. The round trip not being as good as HEFF. The difference being the difference in moving through air versus moving viscous water. The pump vanes create turbulence that loses energy to local heat. Put your hand on any pool pump while it is running and you can feel that lost heat even though the cool pool water constantly cools the pump parts. Often in pump stations the pump is not well matched to the driving motor from field data. Improving the energy recovery from pumped storage is possible now. Water does not have to be the heavy object raised further increasing the total energy recovery from gravity storage of energy. Fundamentally air is much less viscous than water. ",
