            "answer_text": "Economically, Yes. Nigeria is richer than it\u2019s ever been. That is the objective truth, it isn\u2019t growing at the pace of the Asian Tigers, but it is much better than it was. The problem lies in our political stagnation and derived from it, a general cultural retardation. Regarding the first, the truth is that our political culture hasn\u2019t evolved past the colonial era. Nigerians have refused to own our governance. Political culture revolves around protest from the ruled and suppression from the rulers. There are of course the visible signs of suppression, the army and police, but what of the hidden ones? \u201cAwon Boys\u201d that ensure that people vote \u201cproperly\u201d? I\u2019ve always found this video representative of Nigeria.  The election packages that serve as inducements to vote \u201cproperly\u201d  There is a certain irony in the symmetry. The \u201cgifts\u201d are the fruits of our economic development, yet their cost is our actual development, our roads, our schools. Hence we\u2019re left poorer, meaner, angrier. We\u2019ll scream, we\u2019ll curse \u201cthem\u201d, we\u2019ll fight for \u201cthem\u201d, and when in two years we\u2019re given the power once more to change things, odds are, we\u2019ll do\u2026nothing. The objective truth after all is that we\u2019ve never had it so good, but there\u2019s always somebody else lurking to ruin it all, a Muslim, a Christian, Hausa, Igbo, Yoruba. Best vote for the status-quo, keep things \u201csafe\u201d, and the enemy away.     You think things are changing, but are they\u2026truly?  I\u2019ll reiterate, the problem isn\u2019t our economy, it\u2019s the fact the average Nigerian based on which part of the country they were born, thinks the guys in jets are their friends, and these the enemy.    \"Whom the gods would destroy they first make mad\" .

            "answer_text": "Generally, Yes it is honestly depending on what aspect you want to look at (human capacity or infrastructure) but at an ultra slow pace. So slow that the development is barely noticeable. Why The rest of the world is moving very fast and Nigeria is not keeping up but doing catching up..Because there's a huge amount of \u2018politics\u2019 in everything at the government level of things.Eg : (this is a real story but I won't call names ) a governor said he won't build the roads of a particular place because the people there didn't vote for him when he was a governorship candidate he won't even TRY..A past administration built some very fine secondary schools (junior highs and high schools) when economy was buoyant so the present administration won't encourage people to use those schools (despite the huge amount invested) because it would give glory to the past governor who is presently not a member of his party.Most are done privately by individuals with the little resources they have (instances of our development).More people now are in on online bankingSocial media compliantMore access to information (once again thanks to social media)Online shoppingSome people now operate cashless (very few people)Before people do rural - urban migration, now there has been some urban to rural because people are building houses in their villages.More people have access to education, healthcare (irrespective of the quality and cost) .Now if you look at the points you would see very little from the Government. So infrastructurally very little progress, human capacity wise some improvement over a vast stretch of time. ",
