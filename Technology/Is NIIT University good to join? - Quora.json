            "answer_text": "Hey so I assure you I am the best person to answer your question! And I promise that I will say the exact truth.. . Because I went through the same dillema as you are going through right now! Let me tell you about myself.. i cleared 12th PCM this year and I scored 92 percentage.. I also cleared jee mains this year but my rank wasn't good enough to get into nit Or iiit.. So I applied for niit university, I thought it was a great college ( placements are good). . Their site is designed is convincing and attracts students.. I appeared for their counselling session and I received 75 percent scholarship as well.. . So I forgot to mention one thing.. As soon as I enrolled myself on their site\u2026 . My gmail was flooded with messages about why I should choose niit.. The first thing that made me question if this college is good.. They started calling me and tried to manipulate my mind to join niit.. And honestly speaking I even started believing them.. In the AIP session I was asked stupid questions which a student from 10th could even answer.. I was made to write an essay as well.. I even asked that why people have reported their number to be spam or are saying that this college is bad don't join.. They replied that those are frustrated students who are just putting hate against the college because they were scolded here.. Moving on! First of all let me make this clear I belong to a lower middle class family and my mother is a single mom who works hard so that I could study.. Having said that.. . After a day I get a call from niit that I have received 75 percent scholarship and other things.. And they asked me to pay 25000 rupees for blocking my seat.. Somehow managed and paid that amount\u2026 now they stopped calling me for few weeks because unka kaam hogya tha unhe paise mil gye the!.. Then the time of admission comes.. Their total fees for 4 years btech program was coming out to be 10.6 lakhs.. Even after 75 percent scholarship\u2026 hostel fees is included which increases by 20000 every year for some reason.. . And that too in triple accommodation non A/c This was the biggest set back for me.. But I decided to get an education loan and go.. But before investing 10 lakhs I wanted to be sure and asked for personal experiences.. I searched Facebook and I got some contacts.. But those people were saying everything good and nobody literally nobody told me about anything bad over there.. This made me more suspicious.. And I asked my friends to get me in touch with any genuine niit students.. I got one contact.. He was as my friend\u2019s friend he promised to tell me the truth.. He said Infrastructure- awesome Teachers- some are great while many are average. Social life - you are forced to stay inside the four walls of the campus just in the name of discipline People - there are some good and focused students but some are into smoking and drinking. . You can call them spoiled rich kids.. (And niit if you are reading this then let me tell you THIS IS A FACT!) I also asked if it's worth 10 lakhs.. He immediately replied NO until you are looking for a huge infrastructure and a brand name which is slowly declining for some reason that's it.. I won't reveal his name because the university asks it's students to post good reviews on these kind of sites! The biggest thing.. You would be given a contact number of a person and he/she would be helping ( I mean influencing) you to pay the fees and join niit! I am not saying the university is bad and you should never go in it.. Because it is better than many other shitty universities.. But if you ever get even a thought in your mind that you should take a drop year.. Then go for it instead of joining niit I am sure you can do better.. And if you are not getting any kind of scholarship by the university then I beg you please don't put yourself and your family in this trap.. Until you are super rich! Never trust them because they will say only good things about the university because they are getting money to do so! Find contacts (geniun) not from Facebook.. All the best make a wise decision! I have taken drop this year and I am preparing for jee again.. Wish me luck! \ud83d\ude03 ",

            "answer_text": "Hi there, I am a third year B-tech CSE student at NIIT University (NU). After I finished my school, I was also in a dilemma as to which college should I choose. I had an option of three to five colleges in mind and this was the time when my elder brother helped me out and suggested me a way to go for the best suitable college for me. According to him, one should also compare colleges based on these four terms- 1. Brand 2. Infrastructure 3. Quality of education 4. Placement Now let me discuss about all these four points one by one with regard to NIIT University which will prove that yes, I took a good decision back then at 2016 when I joined NU. Brand- Established in 2009, NIIT University inherits three decades of rich expertise and global know-how of its principal sponsor, the NIIT Group. Nurtured by some of the foremost thought leaders and corporate-practitioners of the country, the multi-disciplinary University focuses on emerging areas of technology and management. Infrastructure- NU provides top quality infrastructure facilities at the campus. There are 2 academic blocks with an auditorium and a library at the basement. We have 3 hostel buildings for boys and 1 for girls. Rooms with single, double and triple occupancies are available for boys. The fully residential green campus offers an idyllic and intellectually vibrant environment for pursuing higher education and research. Quality of education- I can assure anyone that the course structure here is well organised and NU has the edge over other institutes due to more than 30 years of experience of NIIT group. The professors teaching CSE- related courses are really good, with notable names like Dr Prosenjit Gupta from University of Minnesota, Dr Sudhir Kaiker from Canada, Prof Kamlesh Bajaj and Prof Navin Kapur from IIT D. Many students have worked with them and published research papers and gone to conferences. Placement- Students from NIIT University get placed at the top-notch companies of the country. For placements we have companies like Amazon, IBM, CTS, ZENSAR, PWC, Big Basket, Tech Mahindra etc. with the highest domestic package of 11 lakhs last year. NU also sends its students for industry practise program in the last semester where we get to deal with the real-world problems. For industry practice this year we had companies like AMAZON, PWC, IBM, PAYU, ZENSAR, WIPRO, TCS, CADENCE, SPAIENT, COKE etc. All in all, NU is a great place to be in. If you are a gifted student, you get the platform you need to shine on. You can also get scholarship, which is evaluated at an interval of 2 years. Nothing will be spoon fed though. You will have to work hard and prove yourself. PS- In case, you have any other question regarding NIIT University, message me and I will try to help in the best possible way out there. ",
