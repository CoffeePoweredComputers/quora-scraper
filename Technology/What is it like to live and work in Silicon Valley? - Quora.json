            "answer_text": "I moved from Ohio to Boston, stayed only one year, and then decided to go West. Many people said I would fit right into the Silicon Valley. Well, they were right. I arrived in the Silicon Valley in 1991 and never left. It\u2019s because: A. Home set-up: I\u2019m in a house in a cul de sac. (We just paid off our house. Awesome, huh?) I was offered a very nice position \u201cback East\u201d at a large corporation but declined because of our neighborhood, school system and house. We\u2019re set up here. B. Weather: there\u2019s no humidity. I grew up in snow, ice and humidity. Before I left Boston I spent a winter scraping ice off of my windshield. It is fun playing in the snow but I don\u2019t want to work in it. C. Tech/VC center of the world: I\u2019m in the tech business and many tech businesses are here. It\u2019s easier to get clients here. Also, international clients like hiring me because they need a rep that\u2019s in the Silicon Valley. If I left I\u2019d lose that edge. The majority of the world\u2019s VCs are HQed near Stanford U which is close to me. D. The can-do attitude reigns here: people get massive support in doing big things like starting businesses and running marathons. There are many CEOs and founders nearby where we live. People compare notes about running companies. I feel right at home. In summary, the people in the Silicon Valley feel a positive spirit that\u2019s hard to match in other places I\u2019ve lived. Tech company leaders like it because it\u2019s easier to hire tech workers like engineers. By the way I didn\u2019t mention the negative stuff because I am speaking from personal experience. As the saying goes, \u201cIt\u2019s all good.\u201d ### ",

            "answer_text": "I lived and worked in Silicon Valley as a marketing and communications writer (with emphasis on technical writing) since 1998 [http://linkedin.com/in/theoknock]; I bought (and lost) my own home here, and have lived in both San Jose and each and every one of its satellite cities. Accordingly, I can give you a fair estimation of what it may be like for you to live here, even without knowing your race or economic class\u2014the top two factors determining the quality of your life in the Valley. In order to achieve that, first read this: READER | Did your demons follow you to Indiana? Afterwards, gauge your emotional state. That\u2019s what it\u2019s like here: shocking, scary. Being here would give plenty of cause for your friends to worry, and might even estrange you from your family. Nobody wants to be related to the problems that are born here. ",
