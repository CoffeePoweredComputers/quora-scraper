            "answer_text": "It will be an extraordinary achievement to become a space civilisation that does not need this planet. And if our descendents can get by without Earth I expect they can get by without any planets. I think planets (other than this one) will be more effort than they are worth to colonise, especially if you are a capable space civilisation capable of making space habitats to order. The planets of other stars, if ever some way to reach them is developed (unlikely), will be the most difficult to colonise of all - and the presence of alien life, unlike in the galactic empires of science fiction, is much more likely to make colonising harder, not easier. Note that I think space is much harsher and it's resources more difficult to exploit than the enthusiasts like to say. If we ever successfully colonise space, it will be testament to the extraordinary wealth and resources of Earth's economy. ",

            "answer_text": "Answer: Yes, assuming that we do not suicide ourselves into extinction. In which at this moment in time. The future of humanity doesn\u2019t look to good as every nation is building war machines for a future WW3. Our solar system is progressively getting closer and closer to the black hole at the center of our own galaxy. Once our solar system starts to get closer and closer to other solar systems. Then we all are going to have all manner of new stresses. Then once our solar system crosses from the darker regions of the galaxy and into the lighter regions. Humanity will need to be looking outward towards the outer boundaries where new star systems may be our new home. Then we must go to them and establish new homes. Then repeat as necessary. Eventually, galaxies collide into one another or several at one time. Humanity will need to have the ability to cross through the cold darkness and into a new galaxy. To establish new homes. ",
