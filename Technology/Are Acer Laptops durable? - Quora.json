            "answer_text": "As of now, Acer Laptops are for sure durable. I\u2019ve been using this machine (Acer Aspire V5) for more than a year now & have encountered no durability problems or any other problem for that matter. I use my laptop quite roughly, (picking it up from the screen, etc..) and have found, no problems with it. However, I\u2019d like to mention here (because I also repair laptops) that there has been an increase in the number of durability problems with these brands: HP, Dell, Lenovo. The problem with HP laptops is that the hinges in the LCD are broken easily, even with regular use (not rough one).The build quality of Lenovo & Dell laptops are poor. The body, internal structure, base, positioning of parts inside is bad. ",

            "answer_text": "I don't know about anywhere else in the world but if if you are in India, I suggest you to not go for Acer unless it's the gaming lineup. You will be considering the Acer because it's giving better specs than the HP, Dell and other manufacturers in the same price range but actually you are missing out the other important things like build quality, motherboard chipset, after sales service. I will tell you my personal experience with the Acer laptop: March 2018: bought an Acer Aspire 5 (515G) for 36K May 2018: Got the keyboard replaced in warrenty as some keys were not working. September 2018: Got the motherboard replaced, (board was dead) January 2019: Got the motherboard replaced again, this time, it was shutting down automatically. May 2019: automatic shutdown problem strikes again and now it was out of warrenty and I was busy so didn't get it repaired till Aug 6, 2019 25 Aug, 2019: same problem with motherboard and now the technician is saying to replace the motherboard which will cost 10\u201311 thousand. I asked him, why it's happening again and again and he said, it's the problem with Acer motherboard chipset, very poor quality hardware. And did I mention, for each warranty repair I had to wait for 30\u201345 days for the spares. And that's my experience, if you still want to buy Acer, go ahead. I hope your purchase will be better than mine ",

            "answer_text": "I recently bought acer Nitro 5 around 10 july 2020. Charger Was not Working, So i replaced the laptop and it took like 15 days just to replace it. After 2 week of smooth functioning the windows crashed. So, next day I reached out to service center and the next day Window was reinstalled but it was taking like 2 3 minutes to boot up and the employee of service center said that there is a problem with the hard disk and its need to be replaced. After like 2\u20133 hours the window got crashed again and it was showing no hard disk. So I spam Mail To acer and they send me to give my details. Now I am waiting for the reply for like a week and nothing came up. Now, I am bored in this lockdown because acer is not helping Much and i don't know how much they will take to replace it. So in my opinion its not durable if problems are coming up every two week. ",

Acer has excellent performance as I can do my assignment, work and play PC games effortlessly (The Sims 4, Sid Meier Civilisation 7, Tropico 6 & etc). It never really overheat. There are 3 problems that I encountered, My keyboard was not responsive during its\u2019 first year. I sent it to the Acer centre to change it but the problem arose again during its\u2019 second year.My speaker spoilt during my 4th half-year of using it (due to water accident).Now the base of my laptop disintegrates due to its\u2019 plastic material and the loosened screw. So I need to be very careful when I\u2019m using it. HahahaI think Acer did well in creating their laptop as it lasts for more than 5 years. I have no complaint except for their keyboard quality. After all, you can say that I\u2019m a happy Acer user! I\u2019m planning to buy their latest Swift 5 soon! Wish me luck! ",

I mean my personal experience says something will break down very fast, in most cases, whether it is the speaker or the optical disk drive or maybe the keyboard. There was a time when couple of my friends bought because they were kind of cheap. But after couple months something minor got damaged and after one and a half year bigger things starts breaking down like display and cooling solution. So I would ask you to stay with better brands like Asus/Toshiba/Dell/HP. Good luck! ",
