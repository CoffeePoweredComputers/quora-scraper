            "answer_text": "They\u2019ve gone where all the erased files in a magnetical medium normally go, to nowhere, they are all recorded in the same place, a hard drive, an SSD, a micro SD card, name it, where you put them in the first time. How could this possible? Because of most of the time when you \u201cerase\u201d a file, it doesn\u2019t disappear; that file is just marked by the system like \u201cwriteable space\u201d and when you put another file into your device, the new file is written just in the same place where the old file was; just replacing it. So, normally a file is not erased, it\u2019s just replaced for a new one that occupies the space in the device where the old one was. That\u2019s why you can \u201crecover\u201d a file that was erased using an app that allows you to do that. ",

            "answer_text": "Nowhere. They usually stay where they are, until they're overwritten. Here's an analogy (I think that's what they're called, anyway). Someone builds a house (in this case, a file) and they live in it. Then, they move away (in this case, you deleting the file). That house is still there and always will be there (mostly) until someone else comes around and builds a new house (file) where the old one was. Then that house, or file, is only truly gone once something else takes it's place. ",
