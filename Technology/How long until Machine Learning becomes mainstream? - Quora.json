            "answer_text": "Machine learning may be not familiar to everyone, but it is mainstream and most of us come across it in our daily lives. Of course, the capacity to apply machine learning can certainly expand and we\u2019re still learning how. Any online shopping or streaming you do nowadays will offer recommendations or suggestions. On that same note, chat bots and customer service flows use specific scripts. Using GPS to travel or a smart home device isn\u2019t surprising anymore. These all use machine learning to refine the experience and gain accuracy through data collection. Virtually everything we do produces data and our data is valuable. There\u2019s a lot more research and testing to do before we see more universal and accurate applications, but machine learning is already mainstream to a certain degree and it\u2019s definitely still growing.
