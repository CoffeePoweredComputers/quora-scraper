            "answer_text": "We have two broadband suppliers in our household. The upstairs and downstairs are separate suites and the person downstairs prefers cable so he has broadband through the cable company and I prefer the telco which uses fiber optics now so the upstairs gets internet, phone and TV via the telco and the downstairs gets the same via the cable company. The cable company also uses fiber but only to the neighborhood. \u201cThe last mile\u201d as it\u2019s referred to is still coaxial cable whereas the telco is right to the house. ",
