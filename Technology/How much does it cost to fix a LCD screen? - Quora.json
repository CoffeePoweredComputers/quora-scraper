            "answer_text": "Depends whether you\u2019re willing to give it a go yourself or not. Apparently LCD TVs use a few very large, fairly obvious capacitors at the back, and these are often of a lower spec than is ideal. When they fail (which is a frequent cause for dead LCDs) they look obviously different (I think they get a dent in the top, its been a while). So you could take the back off your LCD and look to see if there were any obvious damaged capacitors. If there are, google the serial numbers to see how much they are to buy new. Its then just (!) a matter of unsoldering the old one and soldering the new one. I got the above from t\u2019internet to fix my monitor, and when I opened it up the capacitors were obvious (big cylinders) but they all looked fine. I phoned a local monitor repair guy and gave him the heads up the capacitors looked fine; he said that there was probably not a lot of point in him trying to fix them then, but said he had a few small ones and I was welcome to it for free if I\u2019d like to pick it up, which I did :-) Hence, this is second hand and unverified information!

            "answer_text": "Unless you specify on exactly what type of equipment it belongs in or on, no answer here will be of any use. TV? Don\u2019t bother with it. Either find a similar one that has a working display but the electronics are shot, for you to swap parts with yours, or buy another tv. Even a 32\u2033 LCD tv is as low as $79\u2013149 for some high-end models. A 55\u2033 model can range from $249.99\u2013500, depending on make, model and features. Some 55\u2033 models can even run you over $1000. Cell phones? It depends. Laptops? Same. Tablet? Also the same. ",
