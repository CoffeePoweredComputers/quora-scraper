            "answer_text": "You are sort of messing up the physics minds with your question, some thinking you are alluding to Tesla finding some unlimited energy. What Tesla did find was a way to harness unlimited energy and then a method to distribute this energy wireless to both industry and homes; then using the energy in creating or converting it to electricity. In order to obtain a firm understanding what Tesla found and performed, one needs to go back to the beginning that started Tesla\u2019s relentless quest to find a phenomenon\u2019s answer; then to determine if and how it could be used for humanity\u2019s benefit.  A phenomenon that started wireless energy Back when DC electricity was being used and dynamotors was creating the electrical energy, they used knife switches to apply the voltage to the circuits. When the switch was being closed, a huge potential was radiated into the air and some unknown force capable of throwing someone against a wall or knocking them down happened. Some electricians were killed, and many others injured with this phenomenon; it was eventually filtered to ground thus allowing the switch to be thrown safely. Tesla wanted to know where this potential voltage, some hundreds to thousands of greater than the power source, plus the physical force came from. Tesla\u2019s quest which he spent most of his life seeking, being why and how could these events happen, where is this extra, huge energy source coming from? Definitely not from the dynamotor! Science in the dark then and still today!  Tesla was no genius First one must presume Tesla was no genius as many had him pegged to be, he was a human just like you and I. What differentiates Tesla from the crowd, being his determination, and the ability to use his brain like a computer; i.e. one being used today. He never filled it with trash like you and I. He was always dedicated entirely to his work and probably spent what we would be compared to two life times working on his projects. This phenomenon was very high on his list, and he was determined to solve it at all costs.  Tesla solves the phenomenon This phenomenon resided outside any taught science in his time, so he had to research back in time to find the solution; then he nailed it down with experiments. One could bet many failures were experienced, with even close calls of loss of life happened a couple of times. He created pulses with technology to simulate the switch closing, and used magnets to create of stream of energy from the surrounding air. Remember the switch closure creating a huge potential:  It does not take any rocket scientist to discern what Tesla found and verified with numerous experiments; it being an energy source. But what was this energy?  Energy from space You and I can look at space and we see nothing, we can see and even feel the energy from the Sun, Tesla commented Earth gets 80% of its energy from the sun and only 20% from space. But Tesla was not talking about solar energy. In fact, back in 70\u2019s, an electrical contractor for power companies rented office space in one of my computer stores, he stated both wind and solar were the two least practical methods of obtaining electrical energy. Tesla came from a time aether was still thought to be a possibility. And for certain Tesla would have applied this ingredient to his solution. In fact, he did, however, discarded it because aether acted like a gas versus this phenomenon was more closely hedging on current and voltage (electrical).  Tesla and zero-point energy The question becomes, could Tesla been experimenting with the Zero Point Energy? I will leave that up to the reader to ascertain, but let me quote a statement made in Nick Cook\u2019s book, when Mr. Cook asked Marc Millis, at the NASA Glenn Research Center, \u201cWhat was zero-point energy?\u201d  Conclusion Yes, it is possible Tesla did find an infinite and potentially limitless energy source, and both the military and NASA are most definitely researching it today. Tesla not only discovered this energy source, he also was capable of harvesting (Mined) and distributing it also. One can determine he most certainly solved the electrical switch phenomenon, and his technology developed a stream of energy that could been broadcast versus these stupid wires we are plagued with today. A power grid that is extremely vulnerable to any adversary; capable of wiping out half the world\u2019s population in months, if not weeks!   ",

            "answer_text": "Yes it is very possible that he found a way to harness unlimited energy. But like I have said if other related Tesla answers. Tesla\u2019s research was all confiscated by anonymous people. No one knows what happened to them. But what we can infer about what was in is research. Are things that will scare people. Sorry for getting off track with stuff unrelated to the question. Nikola Tesla worked with electricity. He was so amazed on what it could do. He believed the possibilities when using electricity were endless. If he were alive right now. I am certain that we would be able to teleport, control nature events, become immortal, time travel, basically rule the entire universe. And possibly build one of are own. Nikola Tesla should be considered the smartest man to have ever walked planet earth. He truly was a special individual that helped shape the future that we are now present in today. There are things from Tesla that we are still waiting to see happen but trust me 2000\u20132100 will be the biggest leap in technology that we have ever seen. And it\u2019s gonna be because of some Tesla\u2019s research research that will be coming out into the public. ",
