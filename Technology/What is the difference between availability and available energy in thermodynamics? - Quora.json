            "answer_text": "Terminology continues to be confuse all through the years, but I think \u201cavailability\u201d, \u201cavailable energy\u201d and also \u201cexergy\u201d are synonyms of the same magnitude in technical thermodynamics in English. And I\u2019ll give you a simple and precise definition, just to attempt to counteract the answers I see here that are either not very correct or not very accurate (and sorry to say this, but it is true). If you consider a system and its ambient at temperature T_0, availability can be defined as the magnitude whose balance is given by (balance of energy) - T_0*(balance of entropy). For an open system of constant volume in steady flow (the easy case), availabilty of the mass streams is thus the property h-T_0*s, where h is enthalpy and s is entropy. Its variation across the system is balanced by shaft work, q*(1 - T_0/T_s), where q is heat transfer and T_s temperature of the system boundary, and - T_0*s_g, where s_g is generation of entropy inside the system. The idea is that the exergy, the potential to do work, is inverted in actual work, the work that the heat could have done in a Carnot cycle, and a part, that is exergy destroyed, also called lost work, proportional to (minus) entropy generation ",

            "answer_text": "Available energy or availability both are same thing. Which is also called EXERGY. Available energy represents the work potential of any system when it interact with their surroundings. It is the maximum work obtainable from any system when the system change its state towards the state of surroundings. In simple words \u2026 if the system is at the state which is diffrent from the surroundings there is always a opportunity exists to extract some useful work from the system until it comes to the state of equilibrium with surroundings. This useful work is availability . The concept of availability is extension of second law of thermodynamics which deals with quality of energy. How much amount of work we can extract without any irreversibility from the system is the availability. Ex. Suppose we have a system which is at higher temperature then surroundings . From this system we can extract the work by operating a heat engine between the system and surroundings . The maximum work done by the heat engine is the energy of the system. ",
