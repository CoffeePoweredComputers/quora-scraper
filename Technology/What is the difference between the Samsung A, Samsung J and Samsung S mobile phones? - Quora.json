So, if you have a company that wish to take over flagship market, you would consider manufacturing flagship smartphones, but if you stay in this territory, you will lose low-end smartphones share market. Then, you will consider manufacturing other low-end smartphones to take over its market.. and so on. In general, the difference for you as a consumer is in the cost of each category\u2019s devices, offcourse low cost means low specifications for a device. Better specifications = higher cost. Here is a brief description of Samsung galaxy serieses lineup (plus represents 100$ US): Galaxy J Series: Tend to be built using low cost hardware. Designed to be a low-end smartphone but with an average performance. Price tag: ++ Galaxy A Series: Tend to be more like a Galaxy C series with a small drop off in specifications.

Price tag: +++ Galaxy C Series: Tend to be using specifications close to S series, sometimes better on paper in two or more aspects (e.g: Galaxy C9 Pro has a 6GB RAM and a 4000mAh battery, while Galaxy S7 has a 4GB RAM and a 3600mAh battery, both 2016 phones). Price tag: ++++ Galaxy S Series: Tend to be samsung\u2019s interface in smartphones world, designed with the most powerfull available hardware that samsung claims to have, uesd to show off the company\u2019s best smartphones industrial design. Not mandatory to have the best specs on paper in every aspect (e.g: known by an average battery life, not the best available). Price tag: ++++++ Galaxy Note Series: Tend to be a pumped up S series with an overall improvements, an all-new stylus: S Pen, a better hardware, bigger screen size, slightly updated UI.

            "answer_text": "J series phones are simply budget offerings from Samsung and almost all of them come with entry level specs and the performence is also pretty average.But the battery performance of J series phones are very good as we've seen it before and display is also good some times.But camera,CPU and all others are strictly average. On the other hand,A series phones are the mid-range devices from Samsung and they come with a good specs but the real world performence is somewhat between above average and good.They often fail to prove their value for money.Yeah they are good but are very expensive for my like.Other smartphone makers like Oneplus,Xiaomi,Honor provides their flagships with a high-end specs and the performence is actually excellent.Even you\u2019ll get a slightly older Samsung flagship in the same price.So,in my opinion,Samsung galaxy A series is a 'no-brainer'. Last comes the flagship 'S' series.They come with the high-end specs and outstanding realworld performence.The display is probably best in the market,amazing camera,performence,battery,design,built quality.You will hardly find any negative point.They are among the best of the bests! Hope this'll help ",
