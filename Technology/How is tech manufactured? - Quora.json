            "answer_text": "You know a hammer is technology, right? You know a plow is technology.... right? You know pencils are technology.... and forks and plates and cups.... all that is technology.  You know this, right? Because I'm fairly certain that when you say and hear the word \"technology\" you only think of something EXTREMELY specific when compared to what technology actually is.  Like... a laptop.  To you, that is \"technology\".  Never mind that a laptop is actually made up of multiple different parts, most of which are manufactured in wildly different ways from each other. I mean.... the lid of a laptop.  Not the screen, just the plastic half of the lid that your fingers touch when the laptop is closed.  That's plastic.  It is made in a mold.  Hot, molten, liquid plastic is forced into a mold and out comes the top of the laptop.  Now, the  LCD screen?  Which part of the screen do you want to talk about?  The printed circuit board on the back?  That board had to be manufactured separately from the different clear layers within the LCD panel, which is different from the white plastic backing to the LCD panel... I mean, here we are, not even into the guts of the laptop, and we are looking at half a dozen different manufacturing processes for just the parts of the lid. So.... do you think that maybe... just maybe... you could explain yourself a little better?  You know... that impulse you had to stop me and say \"No, what I mean is...\"  That.... that right there, that thing how you meant to say something else?  That's the question you need to be asking. Otherwise, technology is largely manufactured in a factory with specific equipment, procedures, and trained personnel. ",
