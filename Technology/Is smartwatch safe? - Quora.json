            "answer_text": "Smartwatch Radiation Health Risks1. Nausea and Headaches With EMF radiations have come reports that individuals are experiencing symptoms that are commonly associated with radiation. If you\u2019re a 24/7 smartwatch wearer and tend to find yourself prone to nausea and headaches, these symptoms could be the direct result of radiation.  2. Sleep, Memory, and Mood-Related Issues Furthermore, individuals have also reported that they have experienced insomnia in relation to their use of smartwatches. This is common with any consistent use of technology because it can result in reduced concentration and lowered productivity. The largest problems occur when users fail to disconnect before bedtime. As a result of sleep issues, memory problems and mood swings have also been reported. Due to the blue light used in technology like smartwatches, laptops, cellphones, televisions, etc., it can be difficult for the brain to shut down after using these items. If you find yourself lying awake at night, strive to shut down all technology 2-3 hours before heading to bed. Engage in quiet activities like reading to give your brain a rest.3. Body Dysmorphia A health risk that often flies under the radar with smart devices is body dysmorphia. There\u2019s been an increase in the number of individuals who overeat due to constantly being distracted by the notifications and information accessible right in their hand (or in this case on their wrist). When you\u2019re being flooded by notifications and information right to your wrist, you\u2019re less likely to notice everything else going on around you. If you\u2019re sitting at a table and eating, you may miss your body\u2019s cues that it\u2019s full. This often results in overeating and overindulging, which may result in unnecessary weight gain.4. Distractions While being connected may seem like a benefit initially, smartwatches remove you from the present, even more so than your phone does. While it\u2019s not socially acceptable to remove a phone from your pocket during an important dinner or other specific social situations, a watch is attached to your wrist and allows you to be constantly distracted. Being connected is one of the largest selling points of a smartwatch, but at the same time, it can be a significant drawback. Not being present wherever you are can have a real impact on your real human relationships. ",
