            "answer_text": "In the US \u2014 you cannot. Let me clarify that \u2014 while it is technically very easy to do, it is practically impossible, because no provider will let you send a text from a number not registered with them or otherwise verified as being associated with you. You can buy your own equipment, write your own code, use a service \u2014 none of that matters. At the end of the day \u2014 that message needs to be sent through a provider, and that provider will require sender verification. Now, you can obtain a number from a number vendor (there are plenty around, free ones like GoogleVoice or paid ones) and then obtain a service (from the same source or a different one) that will allow you to send texts out. But it will be your number, not someone else\u2019s. And you will only be able to send that number as caller ID. It will still be associated with you, and traceable. It just won\u2019t be your personal cell number, that\u2019s all. As others have said, spoofing a caller ID on a text message is illegal, and it carries hefty fines and, possibly, jail time (depending on your jurisdiction). Plus it may result in the carrier that allowed this coming under FCC scrutiny. Which is why they don\u2019t allow it. It\u2019s OK to have multiple numbers and to use them for communication. It\u2019s not OK to pretend to be someone you are not. ",

            "answer_text": "I think it is correct that you can not fake other known person\u2019s number. But there is way of similar approaches. I have ever purchased another phone number, mark it in my contacts as \u201cSanta Claus\u201d. And then, at the Christmas Eve I set up a greeting text message automatically sent to my personal phone number at midnight, and told my kids Santa came to watch them. You can use the same way to mark that number as Justin Bieber, Bill Gates, Donald Trump, your CEO\u2019s name\u2026 whoever you like. The key points for the successful game are, 1) You can buy and release 2nd phone number with low cost, and, 2) The texts can be sent from that 2nd number at the right time in a secret way. The best case shall be without your intervention. Try the app called AutoSender in AppStore, if you have iPhone/iPad device. These 2 points are all met. And yes you can also use TextNow, or TextMe, etc. to get 2nd number for texting, but with them you have to send texts manually. Simply search \u201cauto text\u201d or \u201cAutomatic text\u201d or \u201cauto SMS\u201d in AppStore, you will get it on top. ",

There is a similar capability in faking the \u2018from\u2019 line in e-mails - it requires an ISP to verify the sender. ",

Hire an expert to configure it, generally $150 or more per hour, takes a couple days (if you could do it yourself, you wouldn\u2019t be asking here). This is what most phone/text robocallers, fraudsters and spammers do. But it\u2019s also dead normal for a corporate switchboard, which is why it\u2019s such a hard problem for the FCC to kill spam and fraud over phone lines. However, none of these methods are foolproof. The caller ID will show the spoofed number but the phone company will still have your metadata. If you are misbehaving you can still go to jail. And that\u2019s true for basically any method involving a phone line. If you\u2019re planning on it for any black market or malicious reason, I\u2019d advise against. ",
