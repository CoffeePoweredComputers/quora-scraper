            "answer_text": "This answer is in Indian context: Since Indian engineering curriculum is 40 years old hence NO Indian engineering college produces any skilled-employable Cloud Computing professional. Hence there is NO serious Cloud Computing companies in India. Cloud Computing happens primarily in the developed countries. Hence there is NO accurate answer to this question.  To become a cloud computing professional you need to put in about 6000\u20138000 hours(or 6\u20138 years) of self hardwork. It is an engineering arena of computer science hence NO such engineering happens in Indian because Indian engineering curriculum is 40 years old and NO such serious cloud computing companies are there in India. Serious Tip: Make several kinds of Operating Systems and several kinds of Web Browser and put it on your github profile to be able to impress some cloud computing professional in some developed countries. All the other ways to reliably become a cloud computing professional are a subset of what I am suggesting. A cloud computing professional primarily does a subset of these two kinds of projects while working as a cloud computing professional !!! ",

            "answer_text": "It\u2019s all going to depend on what country you are in and what tier city the company is based on. The fact is the cost of living plays the vital role when companies decide the pay scale of their employees and it usually varies from one state to another. I know people that left the tier 3 cities and got more hike in tier 2 and tier 1 city, but in other places, the pay scale of tier 3 city might be a decent long-term level to be looking at. The salary figures mentioned in the above post might be the benchmark, but I guess companies will consider the certifications / experience, etc\u2026 So in my opinion, the best way to determine what the entry level package in Cloud is to simply apply your resume in some leading cloud hosting companies in the India.
