            "answer_text": "I personally consider social technology to be a form of technology. For example, I would call the invention of the serf system in the early Middle Ages to be a social technology. So if I cite social technologies in this answer, please keep that in mind. Here is a short laundry list of pivotal inventions in the French Revolution. The Metric System The metric system is undeniably the most important result of the French Revolution, and it began very early in the Revolution (1795). The Revolutionary calendar, the metric system, and decimal time were all products of the Revolution. One was such a bad idea they got rid of it immediately, one lasted only a few years, and one took over the world. The mania for equalization of measurements seems to me an underlying theme of the entire period. \"Egalitie\" had never been tried before, and found some very strange expressions in its early days. The Encyclopedia The idea that knowledge could be collected and categorized to such a high degree of precision had tremendous influence. It begins the idea of the popular notion that the world was \"knowable,\" and that there was even a reason to apply reason to governance. The French Revolution marks one of the very first times that anyone tried to remake a society on entirely \"rational\" principles. It didn't work, but that only proves how difficult true rationality is to achieve. The Guillotine The guillotine marks the invention of \"painless death,\" which simply did not exist before. The idea that huge groups of people could be disposed of without cost or consequence is one of the hallmarks of the French Revolution, and the massacres should be viewed in that context. The people simply did not know that death could be so troublesome. Death was, to them, a constant presence, and the idea that death could be painless was, in a way, viewed as a gift. All men die, and most of them die very soon. These men died without agony. Early terrorists like Robespierre thought (especially at first) that meant that since they died without pain their deaths would be without repercussions. They were entirely wrong, but that is what they were thinking. The Potato The potato was beginning to make its presence known in the French Revolution. As strange as it seems, the potato made total warfare possible. Before the potato, war was limited to one or two seasons. The soldiers would come into an area, take all the crops, and eat them. Then winter would come and everybody would die, soldiers included. Since the potato was a root vegetable that could support life alone (unlike the other root vegetables known at the time), it meant that after the soldiers left there would still be something to eat. The peasants would dig up the potatoes, survive the winter, and then the next year they could do the whole thing again. The potato allowed conflicts to rage for much longer and more intensely. Soldiers by the same token lived longer, gained more experience, and invented more weapons. Effective Artillery It's very well known that Napoleon's secrets were artillery and logistics. Whether you consider Napoleon to be the end of the Revolution, or the beginning of the middle, his devastating use of cannons was his trademark. The invention of \"machine boring,\" or the use of a drill to make a clean and consistent hole in a piece of metal, was central to the improvements in artillery and firearms. Arsenic Although poison was not invented during the French Revolution, arsenic (or \"inheritance powder\" as it was known) was freely available and used for many nefarious purposes. We'll probably never know the secret history of the Revolution, but there is no doubt that at least a few people who \"got sick\" were poisoned. There is also the fact that Scheele\u2019s Green, a brilliant green color that contained arsenic and was extremely poisonous to everyone who came close to it, was used in house paint, early wallpaper, and room decorations. Arsenic in green paint is blamed for the death of Napoleon from stomach cancer, which was certainly a pivotal moment in the end of the Revolution, and there\u2019s no telling how many others it killed before that. Good Cheap Printing The \"libelists\" and pornographers did more to stir up hatred for Marie Antoinette than Marie Antoinette did, and that's saying something. The philosophes were entirely beneficiaries of the first real literary culture in history. I personally do not believe that secret societies could have proliferated without so many people owning their own personal printing presses. The proliferation of Rousseau, mythologies, and Greek histories stand out particularly as types of popular literature that gave shape to the Revolution. Ironworks Industrial concerns were just getting started. Large-scale ironworks were significant in the French Revolution, as much for their methods of production as for what they produced. Ironworks were the bastion of the aristocracy, especially at the beginning. Communism Fran\u00e7ois-No\u00ebl Gracchus Babeuf, who was executed in 1797, is widely considered to be the father of the ideas that developed into communism. ",
