            "answer_text": "If all of human kind bound together and combined all of our knowledge and resources with a single vision and plan the advances in technology would be almost endless! The breakthroughs in tech we see today are developed from a small cross section of our global society. Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR) are examples of technology that is growing at a rapid pace and will provide better training and development in areas of medical, all fields of engineering, social media and other Internet related applications, etc\u2026 Examples of this technology is Microsoft\u2019s halolense, which is assisting in providing breakthroughs in manufacturing and engineering, and oculus rift and quest for gaming. Microsoft HoloLens | Mixed Reality Technology for Business Oculus Homepage As money continues to shift toward technology like AR and VR you will see it grow at an exponential rate. Some of the numbers are staggering. 6 VR and AR Statistics: Shaping the Future of Augmented Reality with Data I only bring this up to point out that if all of human kind were to invest in and focus on this type of technology AR and VR would be part of our every day lives by now. In 1961 Kennedy announced and cast a vision for America to be the first country to put a man on the moon. In 1969 that vision became a reality. With technology that pales in comparison to what we have access today they were able to do this. This is but one country who accomplished, at that time, the impossible. If the global community was able to cast a vision like Kennedy\u2019s vision we may have already had colonies on the Moon and Mars. Our environmental issues would be solved. Disease could be eradicated. This list is can go on an on. Human kind will need to bind together if we are to last as a species. Without a common vision and the ability to live peacefully with one another the the very technology that could save our planet can also destroy it. ",

            "answer_text": "I would say that we effectively are already seeing it. It's easy to point out regions of conflict and say \u201cwhy are we so stupid, just think of what we could accomplish\u201d, but I don't think that's an accurate take on the world in terms of output. All resources are essentially traded on an open market. There are a few counterexamples such as sanctions or tarifs, but pretty much any resource is still traded on market terms. So we definitely do trade resources, which I would argue is combining in a relatively fair way. Knowledge is shared as well. Our scientific disciplines are fairly mature and similar across the world. Most impactful journals are in one language (English) to facilitate the spread of ideas. In my opinion the reason the world is so close to this ideal is due to American influence, and it's allies more generally. The US Navy keeps shipping lanes open ensuring sea trade which allows for market economies to trade which I established above is one way to fairly share global resources. So we have the RESOURCES part of the question. Everything produced by US government research is automatically public unless it is a military secret or compromises national security. The early internet is a good example. This eventually became available publicly and we eventually got the internet we have today. The internet, a US government project, has made the vast majority of human KNOWLEDGE available immediately and for free. The touch screen, GPS, search engines, bar codes, microchips, the digital camera; all these things were made origionally by US government research. This was free to the world which is why the screens in phones are manufactured in South Korea, the batteries are made on China, the SOCs cores are designed in the UK, modified and designed into an SOC in the US and made in Taiwan. There are too many parts to list out, but the iPhone and other phones in general are absolutely the result of knowledge and resources being shared relatively freely. The world has gotten hugely more complex in the last two or three decades, and that can't be taken for granted. ",
