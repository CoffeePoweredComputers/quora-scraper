            "answer_text": "Not much if any. It appears that \u201cclean coal\u201d is a con\u2014a billion dollars in federal subsidies in exchange for no reduction in pollution. Reuters, generally considered to be one of the least biased news sources there is, did an investigative article on clean coal and found that in some cases clean coal polluted more than regular coal. Here\u2019s a bit from their article: Consumption figures compiled by the U.S. Energy Information Administration show that American power plants are on track to burn about 160 million tons of clean coal in 2018 \u2013 a fifth of the U.S. coal market. That amount would generate about $1.1 billion in incentives at the current tax credit amount of $7.03 per ton. But most of the plants receiving the subsidy failed to reduce NOx emissions by 20 percent \u2013 the threshold required under the policy \u2013 in 2017 compared to 2009, the last year before they started burning refined coal, according to a Reuters analysis of EPA data on power plant emissions. \u2026 At 22 of the 56 plants, NOx emissions were higher in 2017 while burning refined coal than they were when using raw coal in 2009. Duke Energy found that not only did their NOx emissions increase, but local groundwater was being polluted by one of the chemicals used to clean the coal. ",

            "answer_text": "So far as I understand it, \u201cclean coal\u201d is a marketing slogan intended to remove people\u2019s concerns about the harmful effects of burning coal. Some years ago, coal burning utilities were required to erect tall smokestacks so that the black plumes of smoke they emitted would be spread out and not fall on the immediate surroundings. Later they were required to put filter bags on the \u201csmokestacks\u201d of their plants, to capture the soot and fly ash so the black plumes were diminished. Still later they were required to put \u201cscrubbers\u201d in the smokestacks to capture sulfur oxides that were causing acid rain. So coal could be burned without the great black plumes. All of these changes were opposed by the coal-burning industries as \u201ctoo expensive\u201d and fought for years. But I don\u2019t recall that any of this was called \u201cclean coal\u201d. When it became evident to atmospheric scientists that coal burning was harmful in and of itself, as resulting in emission of CO2, and no easy technical solutions were available to permit continued burning of coal without damage, masters of public relations came up with the idea of \u201cclean coal\u201d to refer to a variety of unproven ideas which somehow could capture the CO2 from burning coal and let the coal industry continue. That is what I understand the premise of \u201cclean coal technology\u201d to mean. To answer the question in short, \u201cclean coal technology\u201d has reduced \u201cpollution\u201d very little if at all. How much has clean coal technology reduced pollution? ",
