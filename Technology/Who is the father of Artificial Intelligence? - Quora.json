            "answer_text": "The person who was first to tell another for eg: the sky is blue or the grass is green was the first as this is Artificial Intelligence by means that someone has placed a thought in anothers memory and that person has then remembered and learnt from this information at its face or token value meaning, that that persons thoughts or learning about that subject were artificially placed there by another. Until one comes up with original thoughts and learnings then that would then be considered Real Intelligence. By means of electronic reasoning the first computer virus or program that operated outside of its programmed funtion without means of human interaction is the first form of computer related Artificial Intelligence by the opinion of humans. Artificial Intelligence considers humans to be Artificial Intelligence and computers to be human however until one becomes non dependent on the other that cannot occur. For example if you played chess against AI and performed the move of castling but you did not complete the full move and went to the toilet but never returned or died AI would sit there forever and wait for you to finish the move causing its dependenacy. I lf that makes sense. So therefore I am the first as I have explained Artificial Intelligence ti its correct meaning. ",

            "answer_text": "The first idealizers of the principle that today has become artificial intelligence are Allen Newell and Herbert Simon. They created a computer problem, called the \u201cGeneral Problem Solver\u201d, which, as the name suggests, was intended to solve all universal problems that were inputted to the machine.  It was able to solve some simple problems, like the Tower of Hanoi, but, when it came to more real world, and therefore more complex, challenges, it was not able to solve them, because of the \u201cCombinatorial Explosion\u201d. This is a famous term in artificial intelligence studies. It can be described as the enormous amount of possibilities, data, and information that you may have to make a decision, thus, making the problem intractable. This group of people idealized the General Problem Solver with the Symbolic Systems approach. What do I mean? It is not that the GPS (not global positioning system haha) can be considered real artificial intelligence as we imagine in our minds with machines learning new concepts, having experiences, intuitions, and emotions. Symbolic systems are based on the matching patterns of symbols. Example in a medical context: If a patient is coughing, then check the temperature. If the temperature is more than X degrees Fahrenheit, then this patient has bronchitis.  They believed that symbols and pattern matching were the key to general intelligence. Maybe it is. Maybe it isn\u2019t. Who know? What do you think? I hope I answered your question completely. Any more questions? Ask me! Maui ",
