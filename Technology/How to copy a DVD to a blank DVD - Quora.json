            "answer_text": "Before we go into the DVD to DVD copy process, it\u2019s important for us to learn clear the DVD to DVD copy workflow under different conditions. Have only 1 disc drive If you have only one disc drive and would like to copy DVD disc to another blank DVD disc, first make sure your disc drive is recordable and writable. The DVD to DVD copy workflow for 1 disc drive only computer is a little bit complicate: you first need to create a disc image file of source DVD disc, then burn the created disc image file onto target blank DVD disc. ISO image file is the most popular image file for DVD disc backup. Have 2 disc drives It becomes relatively easy to copy DVD to DVD with 2 disc drives installed on computer. Still, you should firstly make sure at least one of these 2 disc drives is recordable and writable. You need to: insert original DVD disc into one disc drive and target blank DVD-R/DVD+R disc into the other (disc recorder drive), and then make use of DVD copy software to copy original DVD disc onto target DVD disc directly. Copy protected DVD disc It should be noted that most DVD discs are protected or region restricted. To copy protected DVD discs, you firstly need to get DVD copy software that could decrypt DVD discs, remove disc protection and region code. After disc protection removed, the DVD to DVD copy process becomes the same as the above mentioned 2 ways. For all these conditions, you can use Leawo DVD Copy to do the copying. ",

            "answer_text": "For copying a DVD to a blank DVD, you need to use a software that provide this functionality of making DVD from DVD.
