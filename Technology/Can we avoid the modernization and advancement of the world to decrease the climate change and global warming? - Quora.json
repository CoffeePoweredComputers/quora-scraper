            "answer_text": "There is no way to do it. The premodern state was defined by not knowing. Could you lay in there in the cold next to wood knowing full well how to start a fire and freeze to death without starting one? The biggest thing to realize is we aren't advanced. Our thinking is based in our ape past, where we threw away waste without concern and had no problem, because we evolved in equilibrium with our environment so human waste is actually plant food, feeding plants which support us. The environment is no longer capable of dealing with our myriad new waste products from our \"advanced\" life. Yet all most of these advanced technologies do is serve an enthroned ape self, throwing toxic garbage out nature can't deal with. Actual advancement in terms of civilization would enthrone the scientific self, and balance the equation of civilization with a new way. It's a different kind of thinking which realizes there is no \"away\", instead we have to arrange things, knowing there is a time and a place for everything. ",

            "answer_text": "No. It\u2019s too late for that; there are too many people to feed and clothe for switching to a more primitive life style to eliminate climate change. Unless most of them died first. We are reliant on modern agriculture - machines, fertilizers, pesticides - to grow enough food. That requires the whole infrastructure of modern society to build and service the machines, run the factories, train and house and entertain the workers in the factories and so on. There\u2019s no good reason why we can\u2019t both have a modern society and eliminate climate change too, except that it\u2019s getting a bit late and we\u2019ve got too much invested in destructive ways of doing things. Even if all political leaders switched gears overnight and worked immediately to solve the problems, we can\u2019t just ban fossil-fuel burning overnight - it takes decades to build more efficient and cleaner factories, houses, vehicle fleets. We\u2019ll have to settle for a sub-optimal future - millions dead or displaced, but not the billions that would result from trying to revert to animal power or a hunter-gatherer existence. ",
