            "answer_text": "There are various devices which are used to diagnosis and each device work differently. This is very important you should know that how the device is used because if you know it then you can treat the patient very accurately if you do have knowledge that how to use that particular device then you can not treat the patient properly. There are so many types of equipment like X-ray, CT scanner, MRI, Ultrasound and various kind of OT machine. Each machine has some similar and different sequence to operate. So, Every person who examine the people that should be aware of this kind of machine. Because if in future you will face any equipment part problem then you have to replace them all for good result. we can help you to replace any kind equipment\u2019s part.

            "answer_text": "the short answer is, depends on the kind. Many use x-rays to look inside/thru the body. Some use ultrasound (sound waves we can't hear) to look inside, break up small kidney stones or gallstones. Thermal imaging uses special cameras to show the temperatures of different parts of the body. Bone scans are doing by injecting a slightly radioactive chemical into the body, then taking a full-body picture with large slow camera that records where concentrations are. And those are just the ones off the top of my head. Medical imaging is a hugely growing (and to me, fascinating) field. Most of all, it helps us make sick people better. ",
