            "answer_text": " According to Faisal Kawoosa, Founder, TechARC, launching 5G phones is a process that aids the development of network testing for telecom operators. This ensures when the time arrives, the industry is prepared to meet the needs of the end-user. The 5G phone revolution has begun in India and brands are bringing in devices that support the latest network connectivity. However, the network meant to run on these devices is nowhere to be seen in the country. Industry experts believe that for consumers to experience 5G on a mobile phone, we\u2019ll have to wait till early 2022. So why are brands launching 5G devices already when it isn\u2019t going to change the speed at which you stream YouTube videos or download heavy files off the internet? This was interesting to note because, during its launch of the 5G phone on Monday, Realme pointed out that before the launch of 3G and 4G network in the country, manufacturers had already shipped 50 million and 35 million devices respectively into the market. More importantly, people talk about phone brands merely future-proofing themselves with the devices, but does that stand on the credible ground in this case as well? Madhav Sheth, CEO, Realme India explained that 4K TVs launched in India much before the content was made available and he believes the same logic justifies the point of bringing 5G phones before the network gets rolling. Conclusion: above fact point that it will take time to roll out the 5g network in India 2022. So 4g phones are not that bad for 2 yrs. will 5G be launched in India? ",

            "answer_text": "Someone will say yes, someone will say no. Buying a 5G smartphone in 2020 has its advantages and disadvantages too. First Advantages: Your Smartphone will be 5G ready when 5G will launch in IndiaYou will not have to invest money in a new phone after 5G will launchBut there are disadvantages too: You smartphone will be 5G ready but not fully 5G because it will not support all 5G frequency bands in India if you buy in 2020.Since It will not have all 5G bands it may be possible that It may not be able to catch 5G signals even if 5G will be available in your area.You may have to pay more for that feature which is not worth its priceSo my opinion is that you must see the overall value the smartphone provide rather than only seeing at 5G because It will then be a feature you could boast off but you may not use that feature. See 5G as a bonus not as compulsion. If you have any question ask in UNFOLDING THE TECH. ",
