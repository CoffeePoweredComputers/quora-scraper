            "answer_text": "Geographically, politcally or culturally? I\u2019ll answer all three. Geographically Taiwan is an island.     Doesn\u2019t it look great? Go visit! Now politically, this island is administered under the province of\u2026Taiwan. The province of Taiwan is currently controlled by the Republic of China, colloquially also called Taiwan. The Republic of China claims the whole of mainland China, but currently only controls the island of\u2026again, Taiwan. Well, and part of Fujian province, specifically the islands of Kinmen and Matsu, but mostly Taiwan.  The People\u2019s Republic of China, colloquially called China, claims Taiwan as part of its territory. The Communist Party claims to be - and is accepted by the world as - the successor state of what they consider the defunct Republic of China, and the ROC on Taiwan as a rebellion.  The two sides are officially in a state of civil war for control of China, ongoing since 1927 - though most people consider the war to have ended either in 1949 when the Republic of China retreated to Taiwan or 1950 when Tibet was reunited under the People\u2019s Republic of China. Since 1949 the Republic of China has governed the island and the People\u2019s Republic has governed the mainland, both sides ready at any moment to REUNITE THE MOTHERLAND, DESTROY THE TRAITORS AND RESTORE THE CHINESE NATION TO ITS FULL GLORY! Like the worst neighbours ever. But of course neither side buys what they\u2019re selling. The Republic of China knows they\u2019re not retaking the mainland any time soon, and the mainland knows Taiwan is far more than a provincial rebellion. So in short, politically the difference between Taiwan and China is convoluted and requires very exact definitions. And I\u2019m stopping here before anyone yells at me for insulting their territorial integrity.  Yes, I suppose I shouldn\u2019t hold out hope. Culturally, the difference is relatively simple. Relatively. Chinese culture refers to a set of traditions followed throughout China. With 1.4 billion people and the third largest country in the world by territory, it\u2019s a diverse place. 56 recognised ethnic groups on the mainland with immigrants and the descendents of immigrants from Russia and Korea and now Africa thrown in as well. Daoists and Buddhists and Muslims and Christians and Atheists make a mess of any attempt to assume \u201cChinese\u201d faiths and beliefs. From Cantonese Char Siu in the east to Tibetan Tsampa in the west to Dongbei Dumplings and Mongolian mutton from the north, the country\u2019s cuisine is so diverse it\u2019s almost impossible to say what Chinese food is. Dozens of dialects and languages, often barely mutually intelligible, make for a some of the most diverse media the world has ever produced. Each region has a tradition and even population that rivals major countries! Basically, Chinese culture is the sense of being part of the grand Chinese tradition. It\u2019s a loose, shared tradition of descent from the visions of Emperor Yu and Kongzi and Qin Shuangdi and a thousand other thinkers and artists and soldiers and scientists that still manages to bind a people together into one greater whole that I so love. It\u2019s a set of flexible ideals that nevertheless remains resilient and I am endlessly fascinated by it. Taiwanese culture is one of these infinite permutations. It\u2019s a mix of Fujianese colonists, Japanese conquerors and immigrants, mainland exiles fleeing the fall of the ROC and the original Taiwanese Aboriginals, a Polynesian people who have lived there for centuries. The food is to die for, a mixture of Chinese and Japanese with an emphasis on seafood and pork.    Their Aboriginal peoples are prominent icons, 16 modern tribes with 5,000 years of tradition.  But Taiwan has also been the centre of Mandopop and popular Chinese culture for decades, with historical icons like Teresa Teng hailing from the island.  As well as modern singer celebrities like Jay Chou.  Or A-Mei.  Or the band Mayday.  And that\u2019s just music. Taiwan is also known for television shows like\u2026well, too many successful television shows, and movies, and books and even video games like the classic \u2018tale of sword and fairy\u2019, one of the first and most significant Chinese video games.  Taiwan\u2019s culture is dynamic, and has made an outsized contribution to Chinese civilisation. And I\u2019m sure nobody will find regarding Taiwan as a Significant Chinese Province controversial.  I probably am Oh Great Toad, I probably am. ",

            "answer_text": "There are two countries in the world who call themselves China: Mainland China: PEOPLE\u2019S REPUBLIC OF CHINATaiwan: REPUBLIC OF CHINAUntil 1912 China was not a unified country, it was divided between many dynasties just like India was before independence.  On 25 Aug 1912, \u2018SUN-YAT-SEN\u2019 formed the biggest political party of that time by the name of \u2018Kuomintang\u2019 and started working to unify China as a country(Republic of China). In order to make all this possible, \u2018SUN-YAT-SEN\u2019 needed weapons and to get them he joined hands with the communist party of China which was on a scale smaller than \u2018Kuomintang\u2019 but it was a way to get support from USSR(founded in 1922). By 1925 with the help of funds and weapons from the Soviet Union, they were able to unify most part of China but a tragedy happened in the form of the death of SUN-YAT-SEN on 12th March 1925 which led to the split of the ruling party into two: Nationalist party led by \u2018CHIANG KAI-SHEK\u2019Communist party which was led by \u2018MAO ZEDONG\u2019 After the split Nationalists tried their best to suppress communist and on 12 April 1927 Shanghai massacre happened where thousands of communist were killed.  On April 1927 a civil war started between both the parties for the control over the country because of all the killing by Nationalists. Just when both the parties were trying to eliminate each other, Japan took advantage and invaded China on 19 Sep 1931 and took control of the biggest part of China which is Manchuria. Japan didn\u2019t completely took control but gave power to a party which was nothing more than a puppet. These Incidents put both parties into thinking and they shortly joined hands to overthrow Japan but they didn\u2019t totally become allies as there were just too many differences which can also be seen by the act done by communists in the form of an attempt of assassination of the leader of the nationalist party \u2018Chiang Kai-shek\u2019. Japan saw an opening and invaded again and the event is known as the second SINO-JAPANESE WAR which gave control of a big part of China to Japan. This time China was lucky coz Japan surrendered in the second world war without any conditions and had to let go all the places which they captured.  Japan was out of the picture after the second world war and both the parties were struggling for power once again but this time they were not alone. Communists were supported by the Soviet Union and Nationalists were supported by the USA. The Soviet Union shared their border with China and communist soldiers were better trained which ended up with nationalists remaining only in the Taiwan region. The USA and the whole world was with Taiwan which made it impossible for China for an invasion. In fact, until 1971 the majority of the countries in the world considered Taiwan to be the real China. That\u2019s not it, even the UN seat was also with Taiwan. China would never have the UN seat if it wasn\u2019t for Nehru who was just too anxious to be a world leader and gave the UN seat to China which was originally offered to India.  By 1971 most of the world countries started switching their stand to Mainland China to be official China and the same year the official seat of UN was taken away from Taiwan(REPUBLIC OF CHINA) and was given to Mainland China(PEOPLE\u2019S REPUBLIC OF CHINA). Today there are only 22 countries left which officially consider Taiwan as a country. The interesting part is that Taiwan has never declared itself an independent nation coz according to them they\u2019re the real China. On New year 2019, Xi Jinping in simple words said \u201cLose hope for freedom and be a part of China or be ready for war\u201d Taiwan\u2019s President TSAI ING-WEN said: \u201cTaiwan is made of people who love freedom and believe in democracy and the people of Taiwan will do everything to protect their freedom.\u201d CREDITS and Sources: Saurabh Maheshwari(Gyan Jara Hatke) Taiwan President: Mainland China is Still Our Territory - chinaSMACK Mao and Chiang heirs bridge gap When Nehru Refused American Bait on a Permanent Seat for India at the UN Xi Jinping\u2019s message: Taiwan\u2019s president speech: President Tsai issues statement on China's President Xi's \"Message to Compatriots in Taiwan\" video: Xi Jinping\u2019s speech and then reply from Tsai Ing-wen   full story: China's Xi Jinping says Taiwan 'must and will be united' with Beijing ",
