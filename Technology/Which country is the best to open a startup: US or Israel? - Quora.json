            "answer_text": "It really depends on a few factors; your resources, support, where in the country you're setting up and if you need people to order online or for them to come in the store. I can say this, I don't know that much about the rest of the U.S., but in NYC (New York City) it's probably not a good idea to open a startup unless you have some money saved up. You'll need to pay high rent, but depending on what your business is, once you get it started, if you picked the right place, it can take off really well and turn out to be really successful. The only stuggle is advertising and getting the customers in the door. I'd do a kickstarter first to help get it started at the least. ",

            "answer_text": "As others have said, it depends on where you are and more importantly, where your customers are. If your target market is in Israel, then startup in Israel. Conversely, if your target market is in the US, startup in the US.  The other important consideration is the costs associated with each. Especially if you're currently in Israel and have to move to the US or Vice-Versa.  That could get expensive. Also, figure out the pros and cons associated with the costs of running a business in Israel vs. the US.  Last but definitely not least, your network is extremely important. Having a strong network in either market could be the difference between success and failure.  ",

I can state categorically that Silicon Valley is an excellent place to begin your start up.  Duh. Kidding aside, on Quora, I'd ask Noam Kaiser an Israeli VC who probably has lots of experience with this.  Other than that, the best people to ask are Israelis who have done startups and later migrated to the US.  ",

Both countries are great for startups and both offer challenges, but getting close to markets and customers is always a good thing. Think about what your business is going to do, for whom and for where. Then decide what is best. Note there are many companies with offices in both markets due to the rich engineering and other technical talent. ",
