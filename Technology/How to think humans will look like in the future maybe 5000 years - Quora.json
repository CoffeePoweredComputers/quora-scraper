            "answer_text": "I think they\u2019ll look quite the same as in our own time. 5000 years is quite a short time leap for evolution to show its magic. However, small changes are inevitable. I'm guessing human bodies will adapt to cope with heat better than today, as a result of climate change. So water distribution in our bodies might have been improved a bit, we'll probably be sweating more and craving water more. Our body temperatures might be just a bit higher. The amount of body hair will have decreased even more than it has decreased over the last millennia. Also, I'm guessing there's less hair on our heads, chins and cheecks. Besides far warmer temperatures, food itself and its distribution around the globe might have consequences for our guts and stomach. It's impossible to predict what food will look like in 5000 years, so besides logical adaptations to our internal digestion system it\u2019s beyond my creativity. ",
