            "answer_text": "\u201cWhat is the best drone that can carry ten pounds, fly two miles, and is cheap and dependable?\u201d None that can be bought off the shelf ready to fly. A drone to carry ten pounds\u2026easy. A drone to fly two mile\u2026easy. A cheap drone\u2026easy. A dependable drone\u2026easy. Combine all four requirements\u2026 impossible. If you save some money, 3 options in the one drone is possible. Once you add cheap to the equation you make it an impossibilty. To fly out to 2 miles requires a long range rc transmitter and reciever. I have some pretty good 2.4ghz gear, and can get to about 1.7 miles before i encounter transmission issues. And that is with clear line of sight to the model. To go further would require a 433mhz transmitter module and reciever. These are not designed for the beginner pilot. So 99.9% of off the shelf drones will NEVER reach 2 miles. To lift 10 pounds isnt hard. But is does require powerful motors, high discharge lipos, a well tuned flight control and a frame large enough to be stable with that much extra weight attached. A custom built drone is easiest to achieve this with, as again 99% of off the shelf drones wont come close to lifting this SAFELY. Put it this way, a DJI phantom will struggle to lift off with 10lbs attached. Also to reach 2 miles with 10 pounds of weight attached will probably require multiple lipos, i have seen flight times drop by 80% when excessive weight is added to a drone. Dependable can be hit or miss. Well designed systems can last a long time, but overload them and the life span of certain components will suffer. This is another reason for a custom built drone. To lift 10lbs, i would use a system with 25-30lbs of lift. Your better off with more thrust than you need. Murphy's law. If you have it you wont need it, if you dont have it you will wish you did. Now to the biggest issue in your question. Cheap will never have any of your other requirements. Cheap is for toy and racing drones. As i said a DJI phantom cant lift the weight you are asking for, struggle to 2 miles but will be dependable. I have one drone that could meet ypur requirements, but the cost to build it was almos double the cost of a phantom just for the drone. I already had a transmitter and reciever, lipos, fpv gear, gimbal, camera and more wire and plugs than you would ever need. Sure i could have shaved the cost a little by using a cheaper frame, maybe would have bought the cost down about 1.7x the cost of a phantom, but wanted my foldable carbon fiber frame regardless of the cost. Now if your willing to put in the time and learn to fly a plane, this is a game changer. Without the extras i listed above that i already had for my drone, it might cost $300-$500. Still not what a lot of people call cheap, i still class it as cheap. This is something you work up to doing so i am not going to go into details. ",
