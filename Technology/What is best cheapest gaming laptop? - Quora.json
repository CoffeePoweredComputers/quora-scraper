            "answer_text": "The kinds are good,which aint cheap, and cheap, which aint good. I\u2019m going to give you the benefit of 21 years of experience of gaming pc\u2019s, the first ten years of which I ACTUALLY THOUGHT THERE WOULD BE HOLES IN THE BANGS PER $ EQUATION in the O.E.M. market. What I found out is,. . . TA DA !!!!!!!!! A) I am overly optimistic, and B) There \u2018isnt\u2019. A gaming laptop costs roughly 200%of the money I can build a gaming desktop (same performance) for. The Laptop will maybe last 65% as many hours running,(if you strip it down and clean the coolers /repast the cpu and gpu chips at 30 months max) in which time it will need a new battery and power supply (if they are still available). It may also need a new kbord and touch pad, the lappy also may get dropped, knocked off a hightable by the cat,stolen, have drink spilt in the keyboard, be sat on while partying or be left on the bus after a beer. The lappy aint generally upgradeable, you cant get shit for the good prts if its broke, you cant rebuild it with newer parts and you get jack for the old ones, if at all. Mechanical hard drives are prone to damage by movement out of centrifugal plane while spinning (how many times you see somebody think it is o.k. to walk about with it? Laptops over heat on soft surfaces like knees or pillows. Gaming Lappies are a tool turned into a toy,if you have to ask about a cheap one you cant afford it when it goes tits up; sh1t, without knowing me its $80 to change a fan. I recommend TechYesCity for advice on used pcpart gaming builds ( $350 +) Enjoy a sensible gaming rig to your budget, leave the expensive lappies to big heads in suites, they can spend 2k every year. Yeh, check out my profile. ",

            "answer_text": "If you prefer cheap as shit, I have some great options. The Dell 3468 has i3 7th gen at just 26K with 4GB RAM and 1TB, it can run most of the games that you might think of possible with a Intel HD 620. The Lenovo Ideapad 330 Ryzen variant has a Ryzen 5 2500U with the incredible Vega 8, that can run all games at 720p with ease. It costs only 34K with 4GB RAM, you can plug in a 4GB later. The dell variant costs 42K. This is the best cheap price gaming laptop that can run anything you wish (at 720p, keep graphics at low, you might hit the 50\u201360fps limit). The vega 8 is near to a GTX 550Ti, so its pretty good for 720p. Else, if you forget what cheap means and I price up to the 42K, you can get several Lenovo and Dell variants of the MX 150 (i dont remember the models as there are a hell lot of them), it can run games at 720p 60 fps with ease and some at 1080p too. Acer Nitro 5 has an i5 8th gen with the GTX 1050Ti, it can play ping pong with games at 720p. You dont need that, even a 1050 2GB can handle games at 1080p with ease (low-med). The Ti does 2X times better. Else if you ultimately forget what cheap is, Asus TUF FX505 has the new GTX 1650 for proper 1080p performance at 59K. Thats your buy. ",
