            "answer_text": "You could say the same thing about any innovative company. The answer is that it is commonplace that the executive officers of most companies are generally more well known than the company\u2019s individual contributors. Generally, inventions created by employees of a company are considered property of the company, and the CEO and other executive officers are the ones who typically publicize such innovations in their products to customers. So it\u2019s only natural that CEOs are usually more popular. BTW, this question seems like an accidental admission that Apple is indeed a highly innovative company, contrary to the claims from Apple-hating trolls that Apple \u201cdoesn\u2019t innovate\u201d. Good work! \ud83d\ude42\ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffc ",

            "answer_text": "Is he? I think - the last tally I saw, there are about 700,000 iPhones sold, every, single, day. That\u2019s around 500 iPhones every second. If Apple was a sovereign nation - their revenue would put them around 40th in the world on a list of countries by GDP. So Apple alone sells more goods and services than say\u2026 Finland, Egypt, Greece and New Zealand. Seems like Apple\u2019s tech is pretty popular. Laying down $800 for an IPhone is a pretty solid endorsement and it\u2019s happened around 20,000 times while you\u2019ve been reading this answer. Jobs? Yeah he\u2019s revered, sure. He was one of the all time great innovators - and sales people - all packed into one guy. But I don\u2019t think anyone would care about him if Apple\u2019s tech wasn\u2019t the most popular thing on the planet. ",
