            "answer_text": "The theoretical answer is: until it melts and this depends on the cooling and the material. If you want the standard values for electrical wiring in a house, you need to consult an regulatory guide. This can depend on the region.I found something on the internet for probably the US: Wire and Cable at The Home Depot And something for Europe: There are different rules for different countries. If I look at France, the 1.5mm\u00b2 is only for the light circuit and it need a 10A fuse. http://www.legrand.com/files/fck/File/pdf/Guide-International.pdf As I am not an electrician, you can not consider this a legal advice. Consult a professional or obtain the official documentation for your country. P.S.: Please use the correct units. The wires are indicated by their cross section, not by the diameter. I suspect that you talk about a 1.5mm\u00b2 wire. If you have measured the diameter, you need to calculate the cross section. ",

Under the harmonised European regulations, 1.5mm2 wire has the following maximum current capacities depending on method of fixing: Surrounded by thermal insulation including in a stud wall with thermal insulation with cable not touching the wall - 10A. Clipped on the surface - 20A. Above a plasterboard ceiling covered by thermal insulation not exceeding 100mm thickness - 13A. In a stud wall with thermal insulation with cable touching the inner wall surface - 16A. ",
