            "answer_text": "5G isn't going to be around for a few more years, 4G IMO is good enough for everything I need to do. Play games, download stuff, call, send messages, watch videos, just about anything you want to do that requires some sort of connection, 4G is good enough for. I think the development of 5G would more give technology companies a bigger advantage when it comes to self automated tasks, in facilities, or out in public. I don\u2019t think an average consumer would be able to use 5G to its full capabilities. Companies like Baidu, who are creating self automated taxis, are using 5G to their advantage so that it makes it safe for the passenger, and those around them. ",

If all things were equal and I had a choice, which I don\u2019t because my handset auto negotiates, I would prefer 5G to stream video and download files. ",
