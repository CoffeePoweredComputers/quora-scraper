            "answer_text": "Although specialty high tech gadget and gizmo shops were common 10 or 20 years ago these days there are so many new devices and advancements that no one shop could possibly keep up. In general if you are looking to stay on top of the latest new tech and gadgets the best option might be to follow various online sites that specialize in tech news. These sites often can direct you where to buy if you see something amazing. Engadget has been around for a very long time and they try to stay on top of all the new tech and gizmos out there. They often have the deets on most tech before it comes out and can tell you who makes it and where to find it.Gizmodo Although this site leans heavily into geek and nerd culture they often feature great new tech worth checking out.Techradar this site can be a little spammy with paid endorsements but even so they have reviews and features for many new gadgets and tech gizmos.The Verge tends to be a bit more news oriented than featuring new tech. Often by the time things are in Verge everyone has already heard of them but it still has some good articles to help you stay up to date.Kickstarter and other crowdsourcing sites like IndieGoGo are full of some of the most creative and imaginative tech and gadgets on the planet! That being said, it comes with a huge warning; buyer beware. You might find an amazing new thingamawatskajob just like you always wanted but the price might be steep, the project may not get enough interest to be fully funded or they may take your money and never deliver. So be careful! Try to research the backer and find and prioritize those that have successfully run projects in the past and delivered on time! This is the official Quora account for Wondershare Recoverit. ",

            "answer_text": "I first saw this request a day or two ago, and nothing sprang to mind. I think it might be because the \u201cgadget\u201d market is becoming at the same time consolidated to big sellers and broken up into fine-grained niches. While consumers' source of products seems to be increasingly concentrated in giant online marketplaces like Amazon and eBay, curating and promoting products has become something anybody can do. Plenty of other large sites have gadget selections, whether you take \u201cgadget\u201d to mean electronics, kitchen, travel, tools, or all of the above: Overstock, Home Depot, Best Buy, Aliexpress, Wayfair, and so on. If you just want to browse gadgets and explore what's out there, you could plug some keywords into Pinterest (here \u201ctravel gadgets\") and see what the rest of the world has collected and tagged, and who's promoting stuff in a given category. Scrolling past this screenshot, I find multiple titles of pages like \u201c20 essential travel accessories to buy on Amazon.\u201d If you're just wondering what's out there these days, or looking for stocking stuffers, you'll find more than enough things this way.  Handpicked lists abound, too. Time, Esquire, Real Simple, The Spruce. Pick a source or an interest and you\u2019re sure to find \u201cbest gadgets\u201d articles and blog posts of all sorts.  For more of a traditional curated site approach, you might explore any of the following (with which I'm not affiliated): Cool Stuff, Cool Gadgets, Cool Gifts & Things The Grommet: Unique Gifts & Innovative Products by Makers Unusual Presents & Gift Ideas | FIREBOX\u00ae (leans towards the novelties, at least on the front page) https://www.uncommongoods.com/ A little on the handmade/homemade/grab bag side. Inspire Uplift. Fun, Practical & Inspiring Products! Eclectic. American Science and Surplus* is eclectic on the nerdy side. Things you didn\u2019t know existed and now can\u2019t live without. Much of it really is surplus (military, lab, electronic, etc.), not cutting edge trendy. Copywriters have a sense of humor. Plenty of niche shops are out there, too. You may remember names such as Oregon Scientific (weather stations and clocks) and the Vermont Country Store (sturdy household goods, some of which they do still make like they used to). You may enjoy a shop such as Jetpens* if you\u2019re a pushover for pens, stationery, and related doodads. Finally, Sharper Image does still exist, while Thinkgeek lives on as a collectibles-focused corner of the Gamestop website. *For those inclined towards such things, I apologize in advance for the time and money you may be about to spend at these sites. Or the ones that would have your asterisks instead of mine. #SorryNotSorry. ",
