            "answer_text": "Do you want to know something about every field, or do you want to become the expert in one specific field? This vagueness makes your question difficult to answer. I believe the other person answered as if you were in fact asking the former: how to acquaint yourself with the freshest articles, the protocols being used, the big names. I agree with his recommendations- if that was what you were looking for, which I hope you\u2019re not. Because if you are six months from a master\u2019s thesis and don't have a idea which field you want to present in, I'm worried for you. So let's assume you were wondering about the latter: You have a topic you have familiarity with, you know you find it interesting, you want to be able to assess the actual state of the research in the field. How quickly can you become proficient in the current affairs of your field? Immerse yourself in the scientific papers. Read popular science and history of science books about your field and related disciplines that you can find at a used bookstore. Email the people you are starting to get to know as you unearth the state of the research, and ask for their take, their experience, their advice. Always tell people this is what you want to know about, and if you meet somebody who may know about it pick their brains.  Above all, take yourself seriously and show that to everyone else. Even if you haven't yet been honored by the top authors in the field or accepted into the best graduate program, you have expertise if you can do the research, and it is all on you ",
