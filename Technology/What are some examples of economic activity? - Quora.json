            "answer_text": "Resource Management, for example good working roads, railways and waterways. Clean air and water. Soil conservation for agriculture. Education for a skilled workforce. A self sufficient system of energy of differing types. Basically good use and sustainability of your natural and produced resources. Production, being able to design and produce thing of value. Cars, Homes, appliances, electronic devices, food products etc. Distribution, Giving the products that have been produced the location were they are in demand by people who can afford to purchase those products. Consumption, having a populace that has earned or in some fashion has the ability to purchase products either by credit or cash. Very important because without this you really have no economy to speak of. When you look at these four activities you begin to worry about the future of he United States. It is not doing a good job of resource management. It is not producing near enough in its homeland as it outsources this to low wage nations. It is very good at distribution, using giant ships with containers to bring goods from China utilizing computerized loading procedures.  Consumption is becoming a problem and it limits economic growth in a huge way. When you freeze peoples pay or continue to find ways to lower pay scales for almost every job people begin to cut way back on spending. Fewer goods are purchased meaning less demand for products. Jobs are then cut, spending goes down leading to even more jobs being  cut. This is a cycle that can devastate an economy. Tax cuts for people all ready hoarding billions in the Caymens only helps those all ready hoarding billions in the Caymens. Optimizing a virtuous circle type of economy with respect to the needs of both capital and labor and other circumstances that lend itself in over all sustainability. A simple feedback loop that is efficient will outperform a system biased towards giving everything to the wealthy elite ( cotton plantation economy). ",

            "answer_text": "Economic activities take place at both micro and macro levels. At the micro level, individuals make decisions to maximize their utility (or satisfaction) in relation to budgetary constraints while at the macro level firms make decisions to maximize profits while keeping costs low, and governments make decisions to maximize public welfare by allocating scarce tax revenues to programs that would yield the most optimal positive outcomes for the masses. At the very heart of these decision-making processes by these different economic agents are the questions of what to produce? for whom to produce? how to produce? efficiency in the utilization of scarce resources? what to consume? how much to consume? etc. Once the decision-making is out of the way, then comes the fun part, which answers your question: firms produce at the most cost efficient level. So production (of goods and services) is a primary example of an economic activity. Then the product most be distributed to market places where the consumers will come to buy them. This is also another example of an economic activity - distribution. Then the fun part, you in the mall, swiping your credit card and exchanging your fiat money (or crypto-currency if shopping online) for the goods and services produced by the firms. This is another primary example of an economic activity - buying and selling. Economic activities have always been with us. Our survival and satisfaction from life depends on trading with others, we exchange what we have for what we don\u2019t have and/or need. The government giving tenders/contracts to vendors for social and infrastructural projects is also an economic activity. Governments do this mostly to develop their communities but also to stimulate growth and investment. Governments also invest in national security to protect its citizens and assets from foreign aggressors. Google US Military Industrial Complex for example of government investment in national security to protect its citizens and also to stimulate economic activities. ",
