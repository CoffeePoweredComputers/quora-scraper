Algorithm is simple: 1. Your website visitor click on the link or button (any visible DOM element). For example:   2. jQuery (AJAX) sending request to script that will create a video conference on the server using RESTful API, in response script will send a conference link. 3.

HTML5 might make your life less demanding, yet in the event that you're shooting for most extreme similarity, glimmer is the least difficult approach to go for making the client.
