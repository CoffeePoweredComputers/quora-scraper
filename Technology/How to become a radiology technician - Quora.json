            "answer_text": "I recently retired from Radiology-Ultrasound after 47 yrs in Radiology and 43 yrs in Ultrasound . The first thing I will tell you ,We ARE NOT Radiology Technician. The correct name is Radiologic Technologist. You will learn the difference. I know now you must be math/science/physics( not so much chemistry- that is more a nursing thing) heavy in your high school classes. The programs that are out there are quite a bit different from the \u201colden days\u201d . There are 2 year associate degrees and 4 year BS degrees. Depends on where you are if that 4 year degree will make much difference in pay for a staff tech. However, if you want to advance it (BS) would be your best bet. There are a multitude on Registries that you will have to pass, The first is your Radiology, then there is CT, Mammography, Special Procedures, you can also take further courses to enable you to take registries in MRI, Ultrasound-that itself has numerous registries, Cardiac, Pediatric cardiac, OB/GYN, Abdominal, Breast, Vascular, Musculoskeletal, Then if you are interested in Radiation Therapy another possibility. Good luck ",
