            "answer_text": "The two approaches are to use a cloud system with users having basically thin client devices, or users have all sorts of powerful devices and they can each easily access user data, apps, etc. The data may be on a cloud or shared local storage, depending on how ubiquitous the experience needs to be. The problem is platform vendors. Each one wants to be the provider of that experience, so they're not interested in standards, and that means your iPad can't run Windows apps and vice versa, and your Office documents are trapped, etc. When the Web browser came out, they immediately engaged in a multi-browser fight to maintain platform superiority. Even Google created Android to have Yet Another Ecosystem with Different APIs. If you question the vendors, they will scream about providing breakthrough APIs for the best user experience, but it's never the experience of ubiquitous computing. On that, they're dead silent. So we have AR, VR, Quartz, DirectX, cool games\u2026 locked inside each vendor's walled garden. ",
