            "answer_text": "The birth control pill and the day after pill are obviously the most environmentally friendly technological advancements of all time beyond comparison.  No tree hugging bureaucratic corporate hypocrite living in a million+ dollar house, who lied you into donating to the 'global warming' cause and is now coming around looking for money under the 'climate change' banner will tell you that.  We will have another 4 billion humans in the planet within less than 20 years if we have it the way for these Monsanto style environmentalists.  Any movement or even any thought of organizing some sort of policy to limit human population growth is a direct threat against the ZioNazi monetary system monopolizing weapons dealing war profiteering establishment.  Do not try and limit their herd of human chattel by any means, the rulers of the world are a capitalistic cabal. If you take this to be anti-Semitic, you are mistaken, Karl Marx was Jewish and he co-wrote Das Kapital, a critique of capitalistic environmentalism.   ",
