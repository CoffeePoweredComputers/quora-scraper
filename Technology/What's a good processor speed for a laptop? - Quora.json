            "answer_text": "It all depends on what you want the computer to do for you. For example: Lets say you just want to browse the web, watch Netflix, Hulu, create / print documents, pay bill etc then you can get an i3 / A6 (AMD) By the way don\u2019t let people tell you AMD sucks compared to intel because for THIS type of use NO ONE will see a difference in performance. Literally. Regardless of what benchmarks say, it all depends on actual use. 4GB of RAM would be fine for this type of use. For casual gaming / light photo editing or heavy multi-tasking I wouldn\u2019t go lower than an i5 or the AMD equivalent with at least 6GBs which would be pretty decent performance. If you\u2019re video editing though, integrated graphics chips give slow rendering. Although if you\u2019re patient then it really doesn\u2019t matter. For example on my laptop there is an integrated intel 5500. Took about 10 minutes to do render an 8 minute video which\u2026 for me is a bit annoying. Hopefully you get the general idea. It\u2019s not just about CPU speeds alone though. Different tasks require a combination of hardware. So for example if you\u2019re using an i7 but only 4GB of ram with integrated graphics to play games, the performance for something like Call of Duty would suck. BUT if you have an i7 with 8GB and a dedicated graphics chip, the game would play A LOT better and you\u2019d be able to have higher visual quality settings. But if you\u2019re just doing general home use as I mentioned above, getting an i7 with 8GBs and a dedicated card would give you the SAME performance as an i3 with 4GB and an integrated graphics chip simply because you\u2019re not using the computer in a way that would require that extra power. You could have a $3 thousand dollar Apple computer next to an i3 and if you\u2019re just watching Netflix or surfing the web, you won\u2019t see a difference. Hope this helps. ",

            "answer_text": "You\u2019re not supposed to look at the speed so much anymore. That was in the past when performance was linear with speed. Now it\u2019s much more complicated because there\u2019s both single core and multi core performance, and laptops no longer have a single speed, they scale to a variety of speeds depending on requirements. For example my core i7\u20138550U is clocked at 1.80 Mhz which is much lower than even much older processors, but it has turbo of up to 4.00 Mhz, so the processor will dynamically adjust up to 4.00 Mhz when needed. It also has 4 cores and 8 threads which means this will perform much better in multi core tasks, then something with 2 cores, or even with 4 cores and 4 threads. To help you out, manufacturers group processors into categories, like entry-level (core i3), mid-range (core i5) and performance (core i7). I personally would never buy anything less than an mid-range, unless it\u2019s a like a very compact PC for limited use. In the Intel line, anything below an i3, I wouldn\u2019t even buy it for my grandma. ",

            "answer_text": "A good processor speed has nothing to do with the laptop being good overall. A laptop which has a i5 clocked at 3.4Ghz from the 4th generation is still faster than a i5 3.2Ghz from the 6th generation,in your context,but yet,when actual benchmarks start rising,the 6th gen wins. The reason why is because clock speed has now no longer become the deciding factor for how powerful a cpu is,and inthe general context of this question,the laptop. Architectual improvements,along with more efficient processing and new technologies being bolted on means that even if i bulky man who has been stuck locked up inside a gym for 10 years,would be beaten by a man in 5,if,and he will,use the new logic given to him. The concept is somewhat vague here,but if you can decipher it,good. Cause my brain is sleepy,and doesn't want to work. But anyways,for me,i'd at least get anything with a quad core and a minimum of 2.6GHz base. If it can turbo up to 3.6,then that's good. ",

            "answer_text": "Use scenario? (Basic usage, gaming, compression, video editing, scientefic computing,..) There are number of other things that affect the CPU performance alongside the frequency. Number of cores and threads? CPU manufucturer? CPU architecture? Cache size? Also you do you need single core performance or your software can use any number of cores? Intel have better single core performance and lower power consumption than AMD, but AMD will give you more cores for less money. Since you have laptop, you need battery life. More cores = higher power consumption, higher frequency too.  For general usage, you may target newest architecture. Intel Core i3-5xxx (Broadwell) series is maybe what you want. Higher frequency between processors with same architecture and amount of core will give you better performance. Newer architecture will give you better performance than older with same frequency. How much it is between these architectures? Its very specific. Sometimes newer architecture can give you 10% more performance at same frequency, and sometimes its 50%. I cant give you more specific or better answer because you gave me almost no info. ",

            "answer_text": "The processor speed or rather clock speed of the concerned CPU often determines the laptop usage. For instance, if you prefer gaming notebooks or gadgets that can handle insane amounts of 3D modeling and rendering tasks, 3.5GHz-4.2GHz is a decent ballpark. For basic computing requirements, media consumption, and web surfing, 2.0GHz-3.2GHz is a good enough range. However, you need to understand that a CPU exhibits a base clock speed and even boosted clock speed in most cases, thereby allowing you to fulfill demanding tasks, as deemed necessary. Processor speeds declared with the Intel and AMD models often denote the single-core base speeds. Therefore, processor speed for a laptop also takes the number of CPU cores into consideration, as you must look at the single-core speeds and multi-core speeds in cohesion to evaluate performances.

The other case is, if you\u2019re programming lover or doing something heavy than you can go with intel i5 7th or 8th gen and as said earlier SSD is a must.

The thing is... those CPUs belt out a lot of heat. That makes for thicker, heavier laptops, so even though they can deliver the best performance, they may not be the best purchases for you. If you're getting lost in the branding though, keep this heirarchy in mind (at least for Intel chips.) Celeron < Pentium < i3 < i5 < i7, and remember that i7s come in both dual core and quad core versions in the laptop world (quad core is generally more powerful... and more power hungry.) I don't recommend AMD chips for laptops unless you need a seriously budget device... and when we're talking about \"best\" unless it's \"best on a restricted budget\" AMD product is not part of the conversation.

Newer generation proccesors are much more efficient so they can perform well at lower clocks. No of cores also matters, as softwares these days are optimised to work with multi cores.

I wanted it to take up almost no weight or space in a backpack and last all day with no power cord. The 1.8ghz i5 that Apple puts in their MacBook Air is perfect for this. My other laptop is an Alienware beast that is as heavy as a tank and sucks down power so fast the battery is dead in 30 minutes. This PC is running Linux and used for controlling and research on industrial robots. I need the big power hungry CPU and Nvidia GPU for processing sensor data (motor encoders, video camera, IMU,\u2026) and motion planning in realtime. I think in general with notebook computers the reason you have them is for portability and you only need a big CPU if you have a specialized need. For most people battery life and light weight matter more so they should buy a MacBook Air. But on the other hand a few people are doing things like editing 4K video on location. If that is the case then you just can\u2019t get enough power and you will have to put up with sort battery life and keep the power brick with you.

Processors for the laptop are basically offered in four segments: Intel Core i3Intel Core i5Intel Core i7Intel Core i9Intel Core i3 is more for budget-oriented laptops as they are designed to handle normal tasks with ease. Best laptop with the capability to handle all tasks with ease like gaming, editing and many more are offered with Intel Core i5, as these are the best fit for the budget-oriented as well as performance. Both Intel Core i7 and i9 are designed for heavy-duty tasks such as video editing, gaming at 4k 60fps, photoshop, coral and much heavy-duty software. These are usually much costlier than their counterparts. Now depending on a user\u2019s requirement, they can choose their required laptop with the desired processor according to needs. ",

The high budget options are 7700k ,6700k, and 5820k . If you are thinking of getting a laptop \u200bwith one of these, I would advise you to wait for ryzen powered laptops and I have been hearing great things about core i9 underway, so the competition will benefit us by reducing their prices and and thus we get the best money can buy.
