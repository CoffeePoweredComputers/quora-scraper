            "answer_text": " I\u2019m just going to unload and explain everything about smartphone cameras\u2026 I will get to all your questions. Some background will help in the understanding of thse things, too. So let\u2019s take a look at a typical phone. These days, flagship phones often have 3\u20134 cameras on the rear. The Main Camera The standard or main camera has been there since they were sad little 2 megapixel things back in the mid 2000s. The main camera is always a wide-angle camera, these days in the range of a 24\u201328mm lens on a full-frame/35mm camera. Why? Consumer cameras have nearly always had a sightly wide-angle lens, which allows group shots, but isn\u2019t do wide it\u2019s bad for portraits. However, once constrained to phones, these gave grown wider. It\u2019s simple to fit a 4\u20135mm lens in a phone, and being the main camera, these have grown slightly faster (wider aperture) over the years, the sensors a bit larger. This has more or less kept the same 4\u20135mm lens. On an older iPhone with a 1/3\u2033 or so sensor, that delivered a 30mm-or-so lens, but with today\u2019s 1/2.55\u2033 sensor, that\u2019s about a 26mm equivalent.  That\u2019s actually a bit too wide to take a good portrait. Wide angle lenses deliver a bit of perspective distortion that tend to elongate faces. So Apple and others added a \u201cportrait\u201d lens to their phones. Apple\u2019s is actually the full-frame equivalent of a 52mm lens, but you can see the difference between 24mm and 50mm in the above graphic. Pretty much the difference on the iPhone. A professional photographer would probably choose something in the 70\u2013100mm frange for serious head and shoulder portraiture, but they have the creative choice using real cameras. The Portrait/Telephoto Camera Here\u2019s the problem: Apple\u2019s 4.3mm lens would become an 8.6mm lens if they just doubled the focal length. That\u2019s rather impossible to fit in an 8mm or so thick iPhone, eh? But if you go to a smaller sensor chip, you effectively \u201ccrop\u201d the image and get the effect of a longer lens. If Apple cut down to a sensor at 1/4 the area of their main camera sensor, that came 4.3mm lens would now deliver a 2x shot. However, the smaller the sensor, the lower the quality of the image, particularly for sensors this tiny. So they compromised and went to a lens at around 6mm, smaller aperture, and a sensor about half the area. Other companies produced a true \u201ctelephone\u201d camera, as shown in the first image, maybe a 3x magnification by doing that shrink, down to maybe a 1/4\u2033 sensor chip. But that\u2019s about as small as you can go and still deliver a reasonably acceptable image. The Ultrawide Camera The other standard camera these days is the ultrawide camera, first put in a smartphone, far as I know, by LG introduced in 2014. That was actually the second selfie camera on my LG V10, but early the next year, the mainstream LG G6 had a second, ultrawide camera on the back.  What\u2019s it for? Close-in group shots! I didn\u2019t think it was much of a thing when I got my ZTE Axon Pro last fall, but it\u2019s actually my most-used phone camera these days, simply because of this. Or at least it was, until we all got 2020ed by the pandemic. The ultrawide camera doesn\u2019t have a problem with lens focal length\u2026 you\u2019re probably getting a 1.4\u20133mm lens on those, depending on sensor size. There\u2019s so much depth-of-field, these are fixed-focus camera, so they\u2019re cheaper than the others. But they present another challenge: complexity.  Here\u2019s a 12mm f/2.0 Olympus Micro Four Thirds lens I own, which will deliver just a slightly wider image than most of the phone main cameras. In order to build a wide angle lens that keeps straight lines straight, you have a pretty complex optical formula\u2026 this one has 11 element, including one aspherical element and three made of exotic glass. Phone lenses are made of molded optical plastic. They can very easily be aspherical, but pretty much always made of the same stuff. The whole lens has to cost about a buck or two. And in most phone, you can\u2019t fit more than 6\u20137 elements without getting fatter.  The ultrawide lenses on phones today are wider than you\u2019ll find available for most real cameras, other than a fisheye lens. So a big part of the complexity of that 12mm lens is making it rectilinear \u2014 straight lines stay straight. A fisheye lens doesn\u2019t bother\u2026 it allows straight lines to bend, which is the only way you can capture a 180\u00b0 shot. So smartphone ultrawide lenses, demanding a simple lens formula, are all fisheye lenses \u2014 every one of them. They usually deliver 120\u00b0-130\u00b0 shots, but locked into the formula is software processing: your phone \u201cde-fisheyes\u201d the ultrawide shot. This is why Apple doesn\u2019t allow the iPhone 11 (and probably iPhone 12) to be captured in raw. They don\u2019t want you to look behind the curtain! Fake Zoom! I\u2019m betting most readers have used a smartphone, and probably one with multiple cameras. And they pretty much all have some kind of \u201czoom\u201d slider.  In fact, you almost certainly had a \u201czoom slider\u201d on your single-camera phone. Or you could pinch-zoom in the camera app. Either way, what you saw on that single camera phone was \u201cdigital zoom\u201d or \u201csoftware zoom\u201d, not optical zoom. How does it work? Let\u2019s assume you have a 12 megapixel camera and you dial in 2x zoom. That does a 2x crop in both horizontal and vertical dimensions, leaving behind a 4 megapixel image. Then the camera app\u2019s software maybe does a bit of image processing to blow that 4 megapixels up to 12 megapixels. But it can\u2019t magically create information that\u2019s not there. If you open that iPhone 11 camera app, you\u2019ll have a 0.5x to 2x zoom slider. So with this, you have three fixed cameras, of course, none of them allowing optical zoom. When you slide your slider, clever software is switching between real cameras, digital zoom applied to one camera, and perhaps \u201ccomputational fusion\u201d, in which two cameras contribute to the image. It\u2019s still digital zoom, and most people using this do occasionally notice that image quality goes in and out as you \u201czoom\u201d, depending on how close your shot is to a real optical shot. Nothing at all wrong with that. And in fact, if you\u2019re shooting in JPEG, even that 2x software zoom is better than you\u2019d get taking a shot and digitally zooming it yourself, since the in-phone digital zoom takes place on raw image date, before JPEG compression. But some companies have decided to call this thing \u201chybrid optical zoom\u201d, based on the fact you have three different cameras. The problem with that is that it suggests you have any kind of optical zoom. You do not. So, Genius, Just What Is a Zoom Lens? Glad you asked! A zoom lens is by definition a lens that allows for a variable optical focal length.  This is a great example. This is a Nikon 28\u2013200mm zoom lens, and you can physically see the \u201czoom\u201d. The focal length of this lens physically changes as you move across this wide range of focal lengths.  Here\u2019s a diagram \u2014 actually Canon\u2019s similar 28\u2013200mm zoom lens. That\u2019s about 15 elements! Zoom lenses are inherently more complex than fixed focal length (aka \u201cprime\u201d) lenses. You aren\u2019t going to find any decent zoom lens that can fit in the usual 4\u20137 element designs of a lens that will fit in a phone. Physics can be a bear sometimes. The Smartphone Optical Zoom But never let truth, justice, physics, get in the [American?] way of sales and marketing. So of course we have smartphones bragging about \u201coptical zoom,\u201d without having anything even close to \u201coptical zoom\u201d.  So how? Easy\u2026 just lie. But be careful to only say \u201coptical zoom,\u201d to ensure that the internet media pundits all say \u201coptical zoom,\u201d but as in the first diagram here, never actually say \u201coptical zoom\u201d in your documentation. Never lie in a legally binding way!  Alternatively, trade mark a technology that uses the word \u201czoom,\u201d so you get to keep saying \u201czoom\u201d. That said, I give credit to Samsung, if not their pundits, for not listing any of their cameras as \u201czoom,\u201d and telling everyone that \u201cSpace Zoom\u201d is a software technology. And in fact, they actually have a \u201cthere\u201d there\u2026 we\u2019ll get to that in a bit.  A huge-huge-huge part of the problem is the smartphone camera internet punditry and \u201cpress\u201d these days. If you read the press and understand optics and photography, as I do, you\u2019ll come to the conclusion that [a] most of these scribblers and hacks (I have the utmost respect for true journalism, so I\u2019m using my words correctly) don\u2019t have a clue, and [b] they all seem to be using the words \u201ctelephoto\u201d and \u201czoom\u201d interchangeably.  Two big reasons. A zoom lens is optically variable. Period. And secondly, \u201czoom\u201d has nothing to do with \u201ctelephoto\u201d. The lens here, the Olympus M.Zuiko 7\u201314mm f/2.8 PRO, is a wide-to-ultrawide lens. Longer Than There Have Been Fish Out In the Ocean\u2026 Despite all the wrongness in speaking about these things, there has been one actual real innovation. Well, more of a retrovation\u2026 we\u2019ll get to that.  There was all this talk a few years back about phone maker OPPO introducing a \u201c10 optical zoom\u201d to their phones. Here\u2019s what they were actually talking about: a \u201cfolded\u201d or \u201cperiscope\u201d lens. As I pointed out up above, the thickness of your phone precludes the inclusion of a long telephoto lens\u2026 there\u2019s just no room in an 8mm-thick phone for a 20mm lens. But what if we turned the lens on its side? That\u2019s the idea here. You still get a pretty small sensor chip: the thickness of the phone not limits the size of the sensor and the aperture of the camera system\u2026 but not the focal length. So we\u2019ve seen 4x, 5x, maybe even 10x cameras using folded optics.  Meet the Minolta Dimage X from 2002. This is a thin consumer point and shoot digital camera, but an usual one: like a phone, there\u2019s no protruding lens. Whatzup with that?  Well, here you have a \u201cperiscope\u201d lens a good 15+ years before anyone was talking about it for phones. As with phones, this delivered all kinds of room for a long lens going across the body. It also limited the sensor size, but traditionally, cheap digital point and shoot cameras have not had sensors all that much larger than current-era phone sensors. Unlike every phone to day with a periscope lens, the Dimage X actually did have a zoom lens. So to answer one question: if smartphones ever do get an internal zoom lens, it\u2019ll use this kind of design. It will just be for the telephoto camera, and it\u2019ll be pretty nasty, image quality wise, unless they figure out how to sell fat phones to consumers. But so understand in black and white: no smartphone does this. They are all just telephoto lenses with tiny sensors, not zoom lenses. I\u2019m just saying that if they do figure out an in-camera optical zoom, they\u2019ll use something like this lens design for this.  As others have pointed out, it\u2019s been tried. Samsung did two generations of the Galaxy Zoom, basically a low-end P&S camera built in to an expensive but basically mid-range smartphone (and now you know I\u2019m not a marketing person, if you didn\u2019t already guess). The problem is that your wrongly-named smartphone is actually a pocket personal computer. Average consumers may not understand this by name, but your phone is doing a good percentage of the things personal computers did for consumers. And more, because it\u2019s always in your pocket. And the idea of a good camera built-in to a pocket personal computer fails because, while smartphones with an array of tiny, evil cameras on the backs can maintain the necessary form factor of a pocket computer, making a phone be a better camera also makes it more of a camera. Physics revealing its inconvenient truth, as usual. Good camera with zoom or pocket computer: pick one. Don\u2019t Get Me Started on Add-Ons! Can you clip on a zoom lens? Well, sure, you can\u2026 no one\u2019s going to stop you. Then again, you can also stick needles in your eyes, drink bleach, drive off a cliff, listen to Nickelback, live entirely off fast food, or vote for Trump\u2026 no one\u2019s going to stop you, but none of those things are good for you.  Clip on zooms? Bad for you. It\u2019s hard enough to build an add-on lens that doesn\u2019t stink. Think about what you\u2019re doing: your phone has an optical system designed to shoot the outside world, and you\u2019re adding this thing on top of it. That add-on lens doesn\u2019t know the optical characteristic of your phone lens, just a general idea of all phone lenses, and it\u2019s trying to make a lens do things never intended, rather than, as with pro cameras, adding on the entire lens in front of your image sensor. Really, do yourself a favor and stay away from these. I\u2019m not saying everyone who\u2019s used on is disappointed. I\u2019m saying that everyone who\u2019s used one should be disappointed, and if not, they probably just don\u2019t care about quality, focus, color, etc.  I won\u2019t rule out \u201cadd-in-front\u201d lenses entirely. Back in the days of professional 3-chip small sensor camcorders, you usually got a 10:1, 12:1, maybe even 20:1 lens on your camcorder. But usually, that was mostly telephoto. And shooting tight spaces, like events, weddings, etc. you might need more space. So there were add-in front lenses th enable this. But these were not necessarily cheap, and often, they were designed for, or at least qualified for, the specific popular camcorders of the day.  This is not impossible with phones. I\u2019ve heard good things about the Moment series of add-on lenses. But a few things here. For one, they\u2019re not zooms\u2026 each one is designed for one job. And they\u2019re not exactly clip-ons\u2026 Moment is a system. You add a case for your phone that includes a lens mount, so like the Century Optics lens I had for my Panasonic AG-HMC40 back in the day, the case allows an accurate alignment of the lens to the phone. Not having actually used Moment add-ons myself, from what I\u2019ve read, they\u2019ve taken it about as far as it can be taken. If you\u2019re looking at an add-on that the Moment folks haven\u2019t done yet, just make sure you have a good return policy on that purchase.  The other option is a modular phone. The most successful of these has been the Moto Z system. They use a set of magnets in the back of the phone along with a pogo-pin style connector to allow modular add-ons to the phone.  One of these is the Hasselblad True Zoom camera module. This delivers a camera add-on pretty similar in practice to the built-in camera of the Samsung Galaxy Zoom. This is a true point and shoot zoom camera. But don\u2019t let the Hasselblad name fool you\u2026 this is a $250 add-on that basically turns your Moto-Z into a $150-or-so point and shot, 10x zoom camera. Now, I\u2019ve got nothing against Motorola (Lenovo), and actually considered the Moto Z system. I\u2019d pay extra if Hasselblad had actually done something better in this kind of camera, but they didn\u2019t. At 1x, your phone camera is better. At 10x, this will beat most phone cameras, but not any decent real camera. Read More Optical Zoom On Smartphones: What Is It Really? | The Smartphone Photographer ",

Want to take stupid selfies, phone cameras are great, it\u2019s a shitty picture no matter what. Out without a camera, and something occurs and you need a picture. Here is where the genius of a phone camera comes in, you can get a picture with a phone\u2019s camera. But that\u2019s it, you want to take a picture of something that is interesting and/or unique, a real camera is required. Of course this assumes you have any idea about how to take a picture, most people don\u2019t, but those who\u2019ve studied, and practiced know that it takes a proper camera to capture images of the quality they desire.Don\u2019t care about quality, hey, you\u2019re in with most of the people, use your Kodak Instamatic, other crap camera or even a phone camera and snap away. Today, practically all cameras have some kind of automatic setting, they will focus (usually) set the correct exposure (usually) you just have to point it in the right direction for the image you choose. THIS DOES NOT TAKE A GOOD PICTURE (necessarily).People who have studied photography (should) know the proper way to use the many adjustments on today\u2019s advanced cameras. And almost never use these auto settings as if they were using an Kodak Instamatic.",
