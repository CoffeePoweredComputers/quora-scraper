            "answer_text": "Most of the details of your strategy will depend on the market you will be targeting, the actual product or service of your choice and what exactly you'll be trying to accomplish. Apart from this, some key points fit well with any business start initiative. 1. Find something you are passionate about. Whatever will be your choice you are most likely going to stick with that for some time. Initially, there will be a lot of things you won't like, or you don't want to do, but you'll need to. So obviously keeping your motivation high will be easier with doing something you like, something that excites you, this can be anything really, just make sure you are honest with yourself and don't fall for the options that sound too easy. Nothing's easy when it comes to business. 2. Don't overthink but get a solid plan and some help Whenever it comes to do something new, outside of our comfort zone, we tend to procrastinate or even worse to overthink stuff because \"it have to be flawless...\". Here's something for you to think on: at first nobody gives a d*mn f*ck about what you are trying to do, then they laugh at you, then they are mad at you, then you win! (quote from M. Ghandi). Put together a team if necessary, surround yourself with people willing to buy into your idea and get all the help you can, Create a solid plan, a business plan. Do your research, who's in your market, who are the users/customers, who are your competitors and how are you going to outperform them, what's your \"message\" and how you'll execute to get awareness of your brand. Ultimately, what is going to take to make it work and how do you know is working? Set some milestones to measure your progress and try to calculate the costs to cover and your runaway needs. Create detailed spreadsheets with a projection of your costs/profit for at least 2-3 years in advance. 3. Get funds and start \"lean.\" By now you got a product/service, a market, a business plan. You know your audience, and you know your competitors and how to outperform them. Now is the time to go out and pitch your idea. - I'm guessing that by asking this question, you have no business in place and probably no significant funds to invest yourself. Otherwise, you'll probably know how to start a business...- Thanks to your business plan you now have an educated guess on how much you'll need to start and run for a few months to validate your idea and begin to grow. Get some basics together like a great logo, better if it's a whole identity, business cards, and a website could help but social media are a good free alternative for starters. Do not invest too much in the design at the beginning as you might need to pivot or tweak a few parts of your business machine along the way and sometimes visuals needs to change accordingly. Get a pitch deck and put together a sound presentation. Practice your pitch with friends and colleagues and when you feel ready to present your idea, plan, and visuals, finding an investor could be as easy as searching Google for a local VC firm or incubator. If You don't feel like going the \"VC way,\" consider your relatives and acquaintances and if there's no one with much cash to invest, consider asking them to introduce you to anyone they could know would be interested. Don't forget about your former employers, teachers, your previous or current doctor, dentist, banker, etc ... Lastly, depending on where you live, there might be government's funds available for startups and small businesses. For instance, my last effort was built entirely on Government's resources, so check your local government websites as well as your local chamber of commerce, they usually have subscription services to gives you a heads up if and when funds arise. This is just an overview of my way of starting a business, surely enough there's a lot missing, and the same results could be achieved in a billion different ways. I've done this four times, and I've failed spectacularly at least twice, and here's my last advice: do not let failure get in your way, do not let failure scares you or demotivate you. Instead, use it to learn and grow your business and yourself as a better human being.

            "answer_text": "As a small business owner, you may assume the IRS has bigger fish to fry than your small business operations. However, recent reports have cited that the IRS has increasingly targeted small businesses for tax audits. The National Taxpayer Advocate estimates small businesses spend approximately 2.5 billion hours each year preparing tax returns or responding to IRS inquiries about their returns. This is the equivalent of 1.25 million full-time jobs. The study also cited that 70% of small businesses employ tax professionals for tax preparation and to represent their interests before the IRS. To avoid wasting time, money, and resources, pay attention to your potential tax burden when forming your business. The formation stage is vital to maximizing deductions and minimizing your tax liabilities for the future. With the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in full effect, many small business owners are unsure how the new tax law will impact their tax bill. Many business owners don\u2019t even know corporate income tax rates, business tax deductions, or what tax cuts they\u2019re eligible for. Every small business owner should understand these five important things that can affect the business\u2019s income taxes and overall tax situation. 1. Choose your legal structure wisely When forming your business, it\u2019s important to be aware of the different legal structures that exist, since each structure has different tax implications. Sole proprietorships, S corporations, C corporations, and limited liability companies (LLCs) are all different legal structures with different tax requirements. Here are the differences between each. Sole Proprietorships If you\u2019re operating an unincorporated business and are the only owner, then you\u2019re automatically a sole proprietor. This is the most common business entity with over 23 million sole proprietorships in the United States. It\u2019s the easiest to set up and manage, but also one of the riskiest since you personally assume all financial and legal obligations. Sole proprietorship taxes are straightforward since you can report business income and losses on your personal tax return (Form 1040), using Schedule C. Your company profits are added to other income (interest, dividends, etc.) on your personal tax return. With the new tax law, sole proprietors are able to take advantage of the 20% tax deduction, which allows them to deduct 20% of the business\u2019s net income from their taxable income, which reduces their tax liability. S Corporations S corporations may pass income directly to shareholders to avoid double taxation. Double taxation means that a firm\u2019s profit is taxed on a business tax return, and any after-tax profits distributed to owners is taxed again as personal income. But this won\u2019t happen if your company is set up as an S corporation. S corporations must have no more than 100 shareholders, all shareholders must be U.S. residents, and each member is only allowed to own one class of stock. Shareholders report business income, expenses, losses, and deductions on their personal tax returns. S corps are also eligible for the 20% tax deduction, but shareholders pay taxes on business profits at their personal income tax rate. It\u2019s one of the most common types of legal structures for small business owners because they have the same advantages as traditional corporations but with more tax flexibilities. C Corporations Traditional corporations are C corporations (C corps). The organizational structure of a C corp consists of shareholders, a board of governors, officers, directors, and employees. Although Fortune 500 firms are the most well-known C corps, it\u2019s still a viable option to structure your small business this way. It provides legitimacy to investors and clients, allowing you to raise funds faster and land larger contracts. If you anticipate quickly transitioning from a startup to a more established company, then the C corporation structure may be right for you. C corps are the only type of business discussed here that must pay taxes on the company level. The current corporate income tax rate for C corps is a flat 21%. Additionally, in contrast to S corps that lets shareholders report profit and losses on their personal tax returns, shareholders receive dividends (i.e. a share of company profits). Shareholders must pay personal taxes on those dividends. The taxation structure on both the company and shareholder levels is referred to as double taxation. This turns off many small business owners. When starting out, LLCs tend to be a more popular option than C corps for various reasons. Limited Liability Companies (LLCs) Many small businesses tend to form as an LLC. LLC members have two important tax advantages: no double taxation and deductible business losses. Unlike C corporations, where business income is taxed twice \u2014 at the corporate level and at the individual level \u2014 LLCs are only taxed once at the individual level. This means that members pay taxes on business income on their personal tax returns in the same way a sole-proprietorship or an S corp does. This treatment is referred to as a \u201cpass-through\u201d tax treatment. Another advantage of owning an LLC is that you can have an unlimited number of members (i.e. potential shareholders) in your LLC, which makes it easier to raise capital and expand your business. If you have multiple members in your LLC, you have to determine the ownership percentages for each member. With multiple-member LLCs, you can choose to be taxed as a partnership or as a C corporation. If you choose to be taxed as a partnership, then you\u2019ll report your share of the business income on your personal income tax returns. If you choose to be taxed as a C corporation, you will be subject to double taxation. Single-member LLCs, on the other hand, are automatically taxed as a sole-proprietorship. You may pay upfront costs to set up and maintain your LLC with your state. To operate an LLC in California, for instance, small business owners pay $800 in state taxes annually \u2014 regardless of how much money the LLC is making or losing. If you\u2019re in a state where you have to pay annual taxes to operate an LLC, then your job is to grow the business enough to offset that cost. Every state has different annual taxes to operate an LLC and some may not have any annual state taxes, so it\u2019s important to check before you establish your business. But the tax advantages, pass-through profits, and management flexibilities still make LLCs a popular option. Your tax situation depends on doing your research to determine which legal entity best suits your needs. 2. Use tax deductions to lower your tax bill New small business owners have to stretch their financial resources. Small businesses have business expenses that include vehicle expenses, wages, business travel, contract labor (i.e. hiring freelancers and independent contractors), supplies, equipment, depreciation of assets, rent on business property, utilities, insurance (i.e. property, business, health insurance, etc.), and repairs. Fortunately, as a small business owner, you are able to minimize your business taxes by writing off a lot of those operational expenses come tax season. Tax preparation software such as the QuickBooks Self-Employed Tax Bundle with Intuit Turbotax automatically tracks your business expenses to minimize your federal tax burden, which allows you to easily claim your deductions. 3. Write off your startup costs Many brand-new startups make the mistake of thinking initial business expenses aren\u2019t deductible until their businesses are fully operational. However, the IRS allows small business owners to deduct a wide array of startup expenses before beginning business operations. The IRS allows you to deduct up to $5,000 in business startup costs and up to $5,000 in organizational costs, but only if your total startup costs are $50,000 or less. With the help of your tax software or a tax expert, you can write off typical costs associated with setting up a business during tax filing. Typical costs to set up a business include business insurance, office space, real estate, office supplies, business cards, business assets, professional fees (i.e. hiring accountants), and small business loan fees. If you\u2019re operating your business from a home office, you can qualify for a home office deduction. Additional costs can also include employee training, locating suppliers, and advertising to potential clients. While companies cannot deduct licensing and incorporation fees as startup expenses, these costs may be deductible as organizational expenses. It\u2019s important to remember that startup founders can only deduct those expenses leading to the creation of a viable business entity. If you decide against forming your business, the above costs will be labeled as personal expenses, and you may not be able to deduct any of your costs. 4. Pay quarterly taxes According to the IRS, individuals, including sole proprietors, partners, and S corporation shareholders, have to make quarterly estimated tax payments if they expect to owe taxes of $1,000 or more when their federal returns or state tax returns are filed. You can figure out your estimated tax payments as a business owner using Form 1040-ES. It may be helpful to use last year\u2019s income, deductions, and tax credits as a starting point. You can also use your previous year\u2019s federal tax return as a guide. Once you\u2019ve figured out the number and e-file, you can pay the IRS in a number of ways. These include IRS Direct Pay, which takes money owed out of your checking or savings account, and IRS Pay By Card, which allows you to pay with a credit or debit card online. Another option is paying by phone. Quarterly estimated tax payments for each respective quarter are due every April 15, June 15, September 15, and January 15 (of the following tax year). The self-employed and sole-proprietor business owners almost always have to pay estimated quarterly taxes unless their business loses money. Unlike a salaried employee \u2014 where their employer withholds a certain amount with each paycheck \u2014 sole proprietors, freelancers, and business owners assume the full tax burden. Additionally, people who are partners in a business, a corporation, or an S Corporation often pay quarterly taxes if they expect to owe at least $500 in taxes. Business owners who fail to submit at least 90% of the taxes they owe are subjected to severe penalties, so working with a tax professional can be very helpful to double check if the amount owed is correct. 5. Some business taxes you might need to pay Keeping track of the amount of taxes you\u2019re responsible for can come as a great surprise when you own your business. Here are the most common types of taxes to account for as a business owner. Self-Employment Tax If you\u2019ve never owned a business before, then you are likely unaccustomed to paying self-employment taxes. Businesses pay a 15.3% FICA tax, which is used to fund Social Security and Medicare. Employees pay 7.65%, and employers pay the other 7.65%. As a self-employed individual, you\u2019re responsible for the full 15.3%, which is sometimes called \u201cself-employment tax.\u201d However, you can deduct half of the self-employment tax on your personal tax return (Form 1040). Additionally, it\u2019s important to take advantage of all possible startup and operating business expenses to maximize tax deductions. Payroll Tax If you have employees, you\u2019ll be responsible for paying payroll taxes on their wages. Payroll taxes include federal income tax withholding, Social Security and Medicare taxes, and federal and state unemployment taxes. Many businesses hire a payroll agency to file their tax forms and manage their payroll tax liabilities on their behalf. Excise Tax Depending on the nature of your business and industry, you might be responsible for paying excise taxes. Excise taxes are indirect taxes, that are not paid directly by the consumer of a product. Often the tax is included within the price of the product itself, such as with cigarettes, gasoline, and liquor. Businesses that sell products subject to excise taxes are responsible for collecting the taxes and sending them directly to the IRS. Sales Tax Although a federal sales tax doesn\u2019t exist in the United States, the majority of states levy sales taxes. Customers pay a sales tax on goods and services at the point of purchase. Business owners are responsible for collecting and reporting sales taxes to local and state governments. As a small business owner, it\u2019s also important to understand state and local tax rules with respect to sales taxes. Property Tax If you own commercial property, you\u2019ll have to pay property taxes to the city or county where your business is located. Maximize your flexibility as a small business owner Setting up and operating a small business can come with significant initial costs. Whether you\u2019re flying solo or working with partners, the tax system is set up to help offset those potentially high costs for self-employed professionals at tax season. Maximizing tax deductions by writing off startup and operating costs can limit your tax liability in relation to your business income. Having quality small business tax software can guide you. As a new business owner, it also helps to work with a tax professional to avoid common pitfalls like underreporting your business expenses or ignoring an important tax form that can save you money.
