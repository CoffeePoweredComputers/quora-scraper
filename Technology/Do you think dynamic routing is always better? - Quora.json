            "answer_text": "Dynamic routing is not always better. Any routing protocol is used based on the requirement and the network topology. If you have multiple devices and you need to manipulate the path of traffic, then dynamic routing is more likely to be used. Whereas static routing is simple and less complex to implement. However, in case of link failure, we need to configure track with static routing whereas there is already hold timer present in dynamic routing to detect the failure and check for alternate path. For internet traffic, static routing can be preferred to avoid high latency as it has a fixed path. So, you may decide as per your network requirements what routing protocol you want to use. ",
