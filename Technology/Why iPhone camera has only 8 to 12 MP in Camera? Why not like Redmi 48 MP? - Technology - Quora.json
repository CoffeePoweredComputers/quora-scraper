            "answer_text": "Considering a phone camera, Increase in MP does not mean better quality photos. A lot of other factors are also counted for better quality images such as Optical image stabilization and Aperture controls. Most of the people think that if we have higher Mega Pixels they would get better quality pictures. The sensor used in the phone also matters a lot Even though the iPhone has only like 8 to 12 MP, iPhone has the best smartphone camera in the world. . . Hope you liked the content .
