            "answer_text": "I recently got to know about a company 'Oxitec' which cultures and grows transgenic male mosquitoes (A. Aegypti) in an effort to curb dengue. Once these are released into the dengue vulnerable area, these get mated with the female wild mosquitoes there and produces offspring with a modified protein variant which is lethal enough to make the majority die before maturing.  It seems like such an innovative idea and it got pilot tested at Cayman island, Malaysia and came out with appreciable results (96%reduction in the mosquito population). The project already got scaled up and had its field test done in Piracycaba, Brazil (covering 10s of 1000s of people) recently and they are in talks with other municipalities for its expansion. A great initiative for dengue less future!! ",
