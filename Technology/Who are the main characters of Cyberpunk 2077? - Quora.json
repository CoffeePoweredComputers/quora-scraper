            "answer_text": "Well, we do know the most amount of dialogue will belong to the player character, \u201cV\u201d.  And Johnny Silverhand (Keanu Reeves) allegedly has the second most amount of dialogue lines.  So, as wet as water gets, these two will more than likely be two of the most important characters. There are other characters you can see in demos and promotional footage, like Royce  or Placide  or Dexter Deshawn  , but they may or may not be \u201ckey\u201d characters. And yes, all the above images are there to pointlessly extend my answer. ",
