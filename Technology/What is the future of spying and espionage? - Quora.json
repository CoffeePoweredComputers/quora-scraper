            "answer_text": "Damn Dan Holliday, always taking the best answers for himself.  My basic theory is that techniques may change but not the outcome. That is, how agencies collect the data will change, perhaps dramatically in some cases, but in the end, it will always be for the same purpose. There are a couple of points that I want to make, hopefully they turn out to make a coherent point, but if not, I apologise: Some things will be as they always are. The intelligence agencies of most countries operate under a level of secrecy unlike anything else in government. In most Western democracies, they operate under strict oversight by elected officials and courts, but they are still hidden from the general public. This means an enormous amount of trust is placed on government to make sure intelligence agencies are given enough freedom to do their job but also on a tight enough leash to not intrude on privacy rights. This is all on the government though; agencies will take the laws and they will go right up to the limits of them in an effort to do their job, as well they should. Cyber espionage is the obvious big growth area, now and into the future. It isn't just a weapon for the big players either, countries around the world can wield enormous power through cyber espionage. But, like always, the big players will be able to pour just so many more resources into the yawning gap of technology. Meta-data is going to be a massive issue for governments to deal with. It is only now that the debate is being had about exactly what the government is collecting, not just on foreigners but also on their own citizens. Most people are still figuring out the boundaries of their online life (Facebook can have this data but the government can't). Expect this to be a continuing issues, especially in courts. Technology will absolutely continue to transform intelligence collection and analysis. Dan has already spelled out the main points, although I disagree that any predictive model could be more accurate than flipping a coin in some circumstances. Not just more data but more sources of data, collecting everything from telephone records to whatever else they manage to find. Bank accounts, social media, anything that is online or connected to a computer will be fed into the beast. John makes a very good point about the blurring of lines between the different intelligence disciplines. It may already be happening that after acquiring a possible target, analysts and intelligence officers comb through the subject's meta data, pinpointing his routine and probing for weak spots. I doubt that the traditional spycraft will change much. In fact, with the Snowden leaks, you may even see a return to good old-fashioned dead drops and invisible ink. People must assume that the NSA has backdoors into every operating system on the planet (another prediction - this means that countries like Russia and China will double down on creating their own versions of the Internet, clamping down even more on dissent and making it relatively harder to penetrate)This is one of my more speculative points, but I think the US is going to increasingly find it harder and harder to recruit foreign agents. Maybe not right now, but the lure of easy money and freedom will mean a whole lot less to someone in China in a decade than it did in the old Soviet Union. I also believe intelligence agencies in the West will, or at least need to, focus less on counterterrorism, which as bad as it can be, is nowhere close to an existential threat to their countries. Analogous to that: budget cuts. Affecting almost every government agency in the West and despite the promise of politicians to defend the homeland, intelligence will suffer from these. It will be interesting to see how the priorities and money shift if there is another decade without a major attack. Those are the major points in the next 20 to 50 years that I think the West will be dealing with in espionage and spying. This doesn't even begin to look at military and battlefield intelligence, which is something far beyond me. Hopefully those either in or formerly of the military can expand on that. ",

            "answer_text": "Technology.   I lean towards being a singularian, that is:  I think technology will change EVERYTHING from the fabric of our being to the very way we live our lives, if we're even alive at that point.  I'm not gonna' go all Kurzweil and say when it's gonna happen (or even guess), but the moment you make machines that can make themselves, you unlock exponential growth potential that basically takes you to the physical limits of the materials being used. One of the key things to understand about -- for example -- American intelligence is that it is concerned with making predictive models of nations that can generate forecasts out days, then weeks, then months at a time.  It does this by building arrays of supercomputers in numerous sites.  Every single known factor is plugged into the calculus, from weather, to geography, to people, to individuals within that nation.  It's too  chaotic, but what happens when a predictive model can effectively \"consume\" and crunch all the data available on every individual who has an electronic signature of some kind? We know that the NSA is highly skilled at collecting data.  What's the tipping point of having verifiable models (like weather models) of entire nation states that accurately forecast how that nation will behave a few weeks out, crunching every single shred of public and private and secret data that the NSA (or another agency) can hoover-up and crunch into an array of supercomputers? That's an awfully interesting -- and dangerous -- power to have.   That's the future of espionage.  To make it happen, spy agencies like the NSA and NGA need data and petabytes, then exabytes, then zetabytes of it.  The most critical data is easy for the NSA to access: social media, economic, personalities and corporate data.  After significant trial and error has begun generating reasonably accurate metrics, then how the USA behaves and what the US government does (including the risks it takes) begins to be based on these predictive models.  If a government like the USA (and probably one day China) have the ability to know how a nation will behave in X situation, they now have the ability to engage \"asymmetrically\" in that situation, with more potential ability to achieve their desired outcome than the target nation. What happens if that array of computing systems has even a hint of self-awareness and the ability to crunch all of that data with near instantaneousness, using that intelligence to extrapolate the chaotic nature of human engagements?  The potential EVEN without A.I. is massive.  The potential with it scares the fuck out of me. ",

            "answer_text": "I think that spying will follow the technological advancements and get a role more suitable for cyber-warfare. By this I mean that computers will get more powerful, so higher levels of encryption will be made possible. This requires higher level code-cracking and hacking. So espionage will require well-developed IT skills and programming to crack those codes. Whereas espionage used to be to infiltrate the enemy, in the future it will be at a computer behind a desk. That doesn't mean that in-situ recon  won't be neccesary, but even those tasks can be replaced with satellites, drones and robots. So instead of sending spies to steal 'launch-codes' or orders or whatever, the spy of the future will retrieve the neccesary tools for hackers to take down enemy installations. An example of this is the hacking of the Iranian nuclear facility in Natanz. It was infected with a worm called Stuxnet that was developed on basis of the only intel the Americans had on the Iranian IT structure. And precisily those structures of which the USA knew how they were build were infected with Stuxnet (which is why the USA is seen as the main culprit of the famous/infamous ACDC takeover of the facilities). So I think that in the future spies will be used to retrieve data on enemy IT which in turn will be used for cyber-warfare. That's a significant change in the role of spies: from intelligence gathering for ground attacks to intelligence gathering for digital attacks. What will be a change in equipment? Well, some James Bond-like technology may be used by future spies because they will be technologically possible. Not that all of these make sense (like a laser-firing watch), but others, like transmitting devices in shoes and whatnot can and will be used more frequently due to the advancements in energy technology. What will stay the same is the fact that spies will still be used for intelligence gathering. This will still require spies to infiltrate undercover and take on disguises to get into buildings. Spies will still have to pretend to be someone else so the actual spy that is in the field will still have to be James Bond. But now he is being backed up by a huge IT team and he is gathering intelligence for another IT team. ",

It's good for when you cannot use human assets; however there are rarely instances where that's not the case.

Wasn't too long ago that spies had to \"get black\" to physically meet their agents; they had to loose anyone who was following them so that they could meet their agents discretely and safely. Imagine trying to do that in, for example, modern London, where there are thousands of cameras constantly scanning the streets, recorded and probably linkable to satellites or drones overhead, likewise linked to both facial/gait/other characteristics recognition software and fancy analytics to match [what we know about likely spies (legals operating out of embassies/consulates)] to [what we know about possible agents]. Probably make this routine a little tougher! So, this type of communication is changing. But then everything points to other modes of communication, collection and prediction, which points to cyber, lovely cyber and hence the heat rising from the various NSA sites around the world. ",
