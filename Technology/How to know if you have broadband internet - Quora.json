            "answer_text": "\"Broadband\" Internet isn't a type of Internet service in the way the DSL, FIOS, Cable or Satellite Internet services are. Instead, broadband in the context of Internet refers to the speed of your service. Above a certain speed down fom your provider to your router/computer/house and back up from your router/computer/house to the provider is considered broadband speed. Below that is ... not. Generally, the term is only applied to fixed Internet service or in other words, not what your phone gets over its data network, but what your home gets. Exactly what that speed is depends on who you ask and when you ask. In 2015 in the US, the FCC changed their interpretation of \"broadband\" to be at least 25 Mbps down and at least 3 Mbps up. Before that, it was 4 Mbps down and 1 Mbps up. It's likely to change again. You can read the FCC's full report if you like: 2015 Measuring Broadband America Fixed Report. It's actually pretty devoid of government speak; it's quite readable. ",

            "answer_text": "You\u2019ve seen the regulation based answer from Craig Prall, and he\u2019s correct. 25mbps = broadband according to the FCC, but the exact speed has been a moving target. This definition is used in a legal context, such as when applying for government funding to help build a network\u2026..they won\u2019t help you if you can\u2019t provide that 25mbps minimum. There\u2019s also a technical answer which may or may not be of interest. Broadband would be the opposite of narrowband. This refers to the size of the channel being used for the communication. There\u2019s a formal definition and formula for defining a narrowband, and you can read about it on Wikipedia if you care. It unfortunately is not one specific size of channel that I could cite, but basically they\u2019re very small channels. Dialup internet used a channel size of 2.6 kilohertz, and that\u2019s definitely narrowband. From a purely technical standpoint, any other internet connection you\u2019ve ever had was probably broadband if it wasn\u2019t dialup (or maybe baseband if you had a T1!). I\u2019m not an etymologist, but the fact that broadband connections were faster than dialup probably had something to do with the term being being redefined in terms of speed rather than frequencies.
