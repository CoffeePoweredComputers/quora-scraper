            "answer_text": "One answer - CMOS If you want to champ in VLSI, you got to have basics right. If you ask my genuine view, I would suggest, Energy band diagrams forms the basis of VLSI. But that\u2019s too much physics, which you can skip for short term, but curiosity will eventually bring you over there. But you can\u2019t skip CMOS. You can find some very good blogs on my website. You can start from there https://www.vlsisystemdesign.com/cmos-vtc-believe-it-or-not-you-use-it-daily-part-1/ Let me know if you get stuck at this level. Its really important to clarify all doubts you would be seeing at this level, so that your foundation becomes strong. Understanding CMOS logic will help you answer all your queries at any level of chip design, and you become more confident to face challenges in this fast changing VLSI industry ",

            "answer_text": "For digital VLSI, You need strong fundamentals in digital circuits. If you go in front end design, you need knowledge of VHDL, Verilog, computer architecture and protocols. If you go in backend design, it is basically layout and design of standard cells. For this, you need CMOS VLSI design and SPICE. For analog VLSI, you need CMOS OPAMPS, RF ICs. ",
