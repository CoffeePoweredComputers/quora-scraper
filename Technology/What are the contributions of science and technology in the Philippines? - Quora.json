            "answer_text": "There are certain agriculture-related innovations made in the Philippines that I only vaguely remember, such as crops (rice, mangoes, and coconuts in particular) with modifications made for the sake of either resistance or yield. One innovation worth mentioning is the development of Lagundi-based cough medicine. The following quote is from: From Herbal Folklore to Modern Medicine: After successfully scientifically identifying the medicinal properties of each part of the plant, NIRPROMP developed a lagundi-derived formula for a clinically proven cough and asthma medicine in tablet and syrup form. From the article\u2019s title, the medicinal properties of the Lagundi plant was used to develop commercial medicine for the public. For particular names or scientists, I can only remember one person. I encountered her name in a lesson in our class over 3 years ago. Fe del Mundo  This woman founded the first pediatric hospital in the Philippines. Her contributions included research on infectious diseases and dengue. At the time, dengue was not well-researched. Wikipedia also mentions an invention of hers: an incubator made out of bamboo for rural communities in the Philippines. Source: Fe del Mundo - Wikipedia Thank you. ",
