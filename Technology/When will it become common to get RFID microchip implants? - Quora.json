            "answer_text": "It is very much possible that in next few years all citizens of America will eventually be tracked with microchips (inside their body). These chips will be implanted to help identify individuals immediately.The technology will also be used to answer few questions that are stored in a small chip. This chip would be equipped with an antenna to communicate wirelessly with RFID chip or small Electronic device.It can read and capture information stored on a Tag attached to any object. A Tag can be read from up to a several feet away and does not need to be within direct line-of-sight of the reader to be tracked. There is a company called Wisconsin which plans to implant microchips in its staff. The next evolution in payment systems. Roughly 50 employees at Wisconsin-based Three Square Market (32M) will soon have microchips embedded between their thumb and forefinger. Opening doors, logging in to computers, and paying for food in the 32M break room will now be handled by encrypted technology the size of a grain or rice. CEO Todd Westby says all of his River Falls staff will have the opportunity to have devices implanted under their skin starting Aug. 1. \u201cIt\u2019s the next thing that\u2019s inevitably going to happen, and we want to be a part of it,\u201d Mr. Westby told a local ABC affiliate on Monday. The company claims that it is the first in the nation to offer its staff such a deal, which is valued at $300. \u201cEventually, this technology will become standardized allowing you to use this as your passport, public transit, all purchasing opportunities, etc.,\u201d the company said in a press release, Fox News reported. \u201cWe see chip technology as the next evolution in payment systems, much like micro markets have steadily replaced vending machines.\u201d Mr. Westby ABC-5 Wisconsin that not GPS monitoring capability will be included in the chips, which use RFID technology (Radio-Frequency Identification.) Source: Three Square Market to offer staff microchip implants Eventually, this technology will become standardized allowing you to use this as your passport, public transit, all purchasing opportunities, etc. The 3 big takeaways: 1. 32M will become the first US company to offer all of its employees implanted microchips on a voluntary basis. 2. Employees will be able to scan their chips to make purchases in the office break room, open doors, operate copy machines, log into computers, unlock phones, share business cards, store medical information, and act as payment at other RFID terminals. 3. Europe is more advanced in mobile and chip technology than the US, but the market will likely continue to grow worldwide.

These numbers could drastically increase in future because people know that it is not of harmful for body. ",
