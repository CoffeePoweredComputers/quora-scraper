            "answer_text": "Animals purchased for fattening and eventual slaughter?No.Animals purchased for stud or breeding purposes?Possibly. However, using animals for stud and breeding purposes is a business with high risk and occasionally low reward. People may initiate litigation against if the animals that they used your seed or eggs to produce don't have the attributes that they were seeking. Also, the stud animal may produce defective offspring in far greater quantities than healthy ones, leading to its value diminishing. If you don't know much about animal husbandry and unless you can hire competent and trustworthy people to work with you, it's probably best to avoid the business entirely. The chances of losing some or all of your investment is too high to make it more than an expensive gamble for the unexperienced. ",

            "answer_text": "It isn't an investment, it is a business.  Unlike land, cows have to eat, be sheltered and watched. That costs money every day, so you need to a source of funds for that.  After a certain age, cows don't get bigger or better, they start dropping in value.  So you will have to sell the cows relatively soon - you can't wait for a better price, because the money they cost to have will usually be more than any additional profit from the better price. Feedlots that buy cows, feed them until they weigh more and have more meat, and then sell the cows to a meat packer, can be a profitable business. But the cows (also horses, sheep, etc.) themselves are not generally considered a passive investment, like bonds, stocks, real estate, etc. ",
