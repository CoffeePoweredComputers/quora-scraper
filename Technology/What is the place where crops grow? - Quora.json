            "answer_text": "I\u2019m an organic gardener who manages to grow enough food to feed my husband and myself on a two acre plot, which is used year round and manages to feed us 365 days a year. Crops I grow which require full sun, like corn, are in the zero shade half acre. I can grow a LOT of food on half of an acre. The beans, peas and legumes like heat and water, so they are closer to the water source and have shade in the unbelievably hot/sunny part of the day. Crop rotation is a must have component to my grocery growing and I keep meticulous records. (Before retiring, I taught college mathematic courses so I rather like meticulous record keeping.) I never grow the same crop in the same place season after season. To do so would leave the garden wide open for insect and damage from non-beneficial insects. Back acre, full hot sun year round: corn, tomatoes, heat tolerant crops like beans. As the crop in plot \u201ca\u201d finishes up, I will till the leftover plants into the ground, adding soil amendments like home grown compost. (Kitchen scraps, old plants, etc) Southern side, shade half the day (I know, it sounds like that is a typo but it isn\u2019t. My fruit trees shade the brutal sun from more tender crops and lots of delicious berry bushes and plants. When that crop is ready to be tilled in, I\u2019ll replant it in greens like collards, cabbage, kale, spinach and so on. If we are in for a cold snap, I will go to the garden and put a simple PVC pipe with plastic sheeting covering for the plants. It has the advantage of protecting the plants, raising the soil and air temperature in the rows or square foot gardens and serve to give the vining plants a foundation to climb. It also can serve as a deer deterrent (aluminum pie pans, aluminum strips, moving bits and pieces that tend to frighten the timid deer with the exception of the bucks who had been born and reared by their mama does on the property. The wretched critters are so used to the presence of moving things and humans where they want to eat, that I can pet the stinkers. I try to not do that as it would give a human hunter too big an edge over the deer and human hunters seem to forget that if they shoot in the direction of my house, it often goes THROUGH my house (darn near put a hole in me last year. The hunter told the officer he didn\u2019t know I was in my garden or house (I guess he just wasn\u2019t able to understand that TRUCK IN DRIVEWAY + HOUSE + GARDEN = HUMAN HABITATION.) Eastern side, shade in afternoon - tomatoes, tomatoes, tomatoes along with a LOT of assorted cucurbits like yellow crookneck squash, zucchini and several blocks designated for tomatoes. Western side, afternoon sun. More sun lovers and LOTS of assorted beans. We\u2019re lacto-ovo vegetarians and my two planned plant acres grow more than enough for our needs and some for neighbors in need. (Most of the time, until we have a bad drought year or invasion of locusts sort of thing.) My garden produces year round and when one plot is going to seed, I let it go to seed and quickly pull those plants up and harvest the seed for the following crop. Beans (for me if no one else on the planet), enrich the sandy loam we have here and crop rotation returns necessary elements to the soil. At least one crop a year is dedicated to enriching the soil. (Composting works and I truly do grow food 365 days a year or soil amendment crops. I keep a soil journal and have the extension office on speed dial. I am a low vision gardener so I depend a lot on touching the soil, squeezing it together (tells me how much clay is in it), smelling and using whatever other senses I have that work better because of my visual problems. So right now I am half way through harvesting the spring crops (spinach, broccoli, onions, squash, etc) and I already have the next crop for that space (East North East, afternoon shade, tested, repaired with compost and marked out for the next crops. For that spot, it means a half acre dedicated to beans, legumes, lentils and peas. I\u2019ve already harvested one crop of each of the East North East area and have a bean crop planted for food as well as soil enrichment. A half acre near the corn is dedicated to several different kinds of tomatoes which are used to make tomato sauce, tomato paste, stewed tomatoes, seasoning mix (tomatoes, celery, onions, herbs and lots of heat tolerant peas (field peas, green beans, White Whippoorwill beans (an old organic I started growing about 35 years ago here and gives me enough seed to save for the next crop as well as growing from 100 to 200 quarts of peas for canning and freezing. (Oldie but still goodie workhorse in the garden that is very delicious.) Vining beans are planted with corn and once the corn has been harvested (one to two ears per plant - doesn\u2019t sound like much but it is.) then the vining beans inter-planted with the corn use the old plants (corn) to pull itself up and keep it from laying in the soil to possible loss by heat, virus, bugs and deer, So by now, I\u2019ve already gotten a crop of corn (good year, I got 100 pint jars of corn for 4, 150 foot bed. After this crop, which is already close to harvest, I should be able to get one more bean/legume crop and then plant the soil amending plants. (Which are also FOOD.) The next crop will be more beans (depending on my soil analysis) with a rather large cropping of herbs, more tomatoes and whatever else I can stick in that area. The overwinter crop will be something rich in supplemental elements to improve the soil. Organic gardening is more work but after forty plus years of growing organically, I pretty much can tell what that particular plot of land needs grown there in order to enrich it. Then once the late summer crops are harvested or almost ready for harvesting, I\u2019ll put in a lot of onions, some garlic, annual type herbs and veggies that will overwinter well here. So what do I grow. Corn, tomatoes,(fresh eating tomatoes, tomatoes for canning, stewed tomatoes, celery, garlic, onions, and some just plain canned tomatoes as well as some put up in the freezer like spaghetti sauce, soup in a bag - brown the onions and garlic, add herbs, other vegetables and put up in the freezer so if I need mixed tomato/veg, all I have to do is grab a jar from the shelf. Last year I had a good bounty of tomatoes and canned almost 120 quart jars, bagged about the same for freezing and ate a lot of tomato sandwiches - which we love. I also grew a lot of mirepoix mixtures to harvest, clean, prep and bag or use pint jars for when I just need a little bit of add ins. I grew lots of beans, about thirty different cultivars, and will grow more this year as they are our primary protein source. Potatoes are sweet potatoes, Yukon gold potatoes, some bakers and many jars of canned, diced potatoes to toss in the soup or however else I need them used. Basically if I can put it in a bowl on the table for dinner, I grow it. If I use the soil for a crop, I will send out a soil specimen to determine what I need to plant there (one crop for soil amendment). The most garden space goes to beans since they provide the most nutritional benefit. The next large acreage dedication goes to tomatoes, then the overwinter crops (broccoli, collard greens, etc) and corn. I have already harvested 2 acres of cucurbits and resown with many different cultivars of beans. Once the beans/peas/legumes are finished and harvested, I will till compost in, let it sit about 2 weeks, test and put in the overwinter crops like collards, cabbage, broccoli, Brussels sprouts and four more to be decided this week. If only I could grow canning jars. Summation: different crops like different areas of the garden.Some want/need lots of sun, some need afternoon shade, some like dry feet with morning watering. ",
