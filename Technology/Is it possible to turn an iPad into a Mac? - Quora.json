            "answer_text": "Not really. While the raw computing power, memory capacity, and display resolution can make an iPad a decent comp, the two things are fundamentally different deep inside. iPad runs on an ARM architecture processor while a Mac runs on Intel type chipset, Tha means the two things have completely different instruction sets at the machine code level and it is not easily possible to \"port\" macOS apps to iOS apps. Yet, with appropriate keyboard your iPad allows you to much the same things as a Mac would. Spreadsheet, e-mail, all the office stuff, even MS Office on line, but for gaming. ",
