            "answer_text": "I'm sure a few will come along at some point. This technology is very far away though, Like 50+ years In the future far away. Mainly the fact that we really have no clue how to build a display that can project a steriodcopic 3D image ontop of itself with little to zero distortion, flickering and even how to project an image as the only way we understand how this works is with actual projectors and laser light. That's all fine and said if you plan to project a hologram onto a etched pannel to reconstruct the light but without a medium to guide the image there's nothing really to control it. And it's not a matter of adding an extra layer to a display since the light coming out of it with an image has to be essentially stopped at which ever height you would want the height of the image ontop of the display if that make any sense.

            "answer_text": "Will Smartphones ever move to a hologram display? How would this work and when could it happen? There\u2019s all sorts of technical problems that need to be solved. And then there\u2019s the *real* biggie: How big a hit on battery life are you willing to accept in return for a hologram display? For a long time, I had an ancient flip phone that was able to make and receive voice calls, and SMS, and that was about it. In return, it needed to be charge about every 10 days or so. I\u2019ve now got a Motorola smartphone that needs to be charged every 2 days. Will you accept a holo display if you can only use it for 10 minutes a day and need to recharge the phone every night? Or are you willing to have a phone twice as heavy in order to allow enough battery for 20 minutes a day? ",
