            "answer_text": "Well, you could of course just deal with it in an organizational way: There would be no time zones and people would accept that it's dark or bright depending on where you are. In the end, people would calculate offsets themselves and soon you would get an alternative word for the same thing. So let's look at some physical alternatives. One would be to have a planet tidally locked with the sun. \u201cTimezones\u201d would be static, geographic regions then and timekeeping would need to be independent of daycycles altogether. I read a SF/Fantasy novel once with such a world. Basically the night and day regions were uninhabitable due to extreme temperatures and life would gather at the dawn/dusk strip. In that book, the planet was still rotating slowly so cities were built on top of huge animals and everybody else was a nomad. I think climate in such a scenario would be either very violent if the atmospheres ever touch, with huge thunderstorms and thermal conflict, or very still as no corriolis force would exist. That depends on how recently the planet stopped and if other climatic players (vulcanism etc.) exist. You would have ethnies and lifeforms even more specialized than within our latitudes. Next would be platform or ring worlds with uniform lighting. I'm sure you'll find plenty of information on these on conspiracy theorist's or Halo sites on the internet :-) Could also be a \u201cSun ring\u201d all around the planet. Given that all of these are most probably artificial, there would also probably be some artificial daycycle and climate mechanism. This would also be necessary for sunless planets, like rogue planets or Earth dragged to a fresher sun by space truckers. Much of earth's heat comes from nuclear processes in the mantle, but SF power sources like photon fission, cold fusion or black hole pottery or magical/religious rituals are also in order. I remember a short story where Earth was actually an egg, so it could also be warmed by some space bird until it hatches. Last thing I can think of spontaneously would be some kind of perturbed, chaotic daycycle, perhaps due to multiple suns, celestial obstacles (rings, excessive or overweight moons, huge monoliths, light being bent by singularities and wormholes, a caleidoscopic ice prism ring, flickering stars etc. So basically you wouldn't know how long a day or night would be on any place on the planet at a given time, so everyone (people, plants and animals) would need to be prepared to carpe diem whenever given the chance\u2026 Take a look at Pitch Black, take the orrery away and expand your possibilities from there\u2026 Unfortunately, neither of these ideas is new\u2026 ",

            "answer_text": "Personally, I like the idea of unzoned time. Just everybody use GMT. I use it anyway for some purposes. Converting to various local times for events is a big nusiance for astronomy and for coordinatiing intercontinental activities such as online Wikipedia video meetings. That means, here in New York, the Sun would rise several hours from now, at 1111 hours instead of 7:11 AM. Yes, the change to unzoned time would confuse some people, especially people my age who have difficulties with change. But when the world is accustomed, it will make life easier. ",

            "answer_text": "Back before there was much in the way of East/West railroads, every town set their clocks to the local noon (Sun highest in the Sky). Since this made time schedules for the railroads impossible, they came up with time zones. A tide locked planet would be a different problem, as time would not make a difference regarding day or night. Venus has a different problem, the day on Venus is longer than the year. Mercury is a bit strange as it has 3 days for every 2 years. ",
