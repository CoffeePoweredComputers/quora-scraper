            "answer_text": "Just saw a few drawings in person today: really fetching, immediate, and lively \u2014- of a baby or two, an old man\u2019s face, a horse rearing. Juxtaposed with his own master\u2019s work (Verrocchio), which looked stiff by comparison. Masterly, beautiful, but stiff. Leonardo is one of the first Western artists to instill his art with the illusion of breathing, variable, restless life, while avoiding some of the nervous quality you see in Northern European artists before and after him. Though there was no direct connection historically, I see his work picking up some of the same energy one sees in the best Zen ink works preceding Leonardo by a century or two! ",
