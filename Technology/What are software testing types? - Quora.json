            "answer_text": "There are 3 types of software testing, 1) White box testing \u2013 also called unit testing or structural testing or glass box testing or transparent testing or open-box testing 2) Grey box testing 3) Black box testing \u2013 also called as functional testing or behavioral testing 1. White box testing: \u2022 White box testing \u2013 is done by developers. \u2022 This testing is based on knowledge of the internal logic of an application\u2019s code. \u2022 Also known as Glass box Testing. Internal software and code working should be known for this type of testing. \u2022 Tests are based on coverage of code statements, branches, paths, conditions. \u2022 It is the testing of each and every line of code in the program. Developers do WBT, sends the s/w to testing team. The testing team does black box testing and checks the s/w against requirements and finds any defects and sends it to the developer. The developers fix the defect and does WBT and sends it to the testing team. Fixing defect means the defect is removed and the feature is working fine. Types of White Box testing 1. Path Testing 2. Loop Testing 3. Condition Testing 4. Unit Testing 5. Test from memory point of view 6. Test form performance of the program Advantages of Whitebox testing \u2022 Code optimization by exposing hidden bugs. \u2022 Transparency of the internal coding structure which is helpful in deriving the type of input data needed to test an application effectively \u2022 Covers all possible paths of a code so a software engineering team can conduct application testing \u2022 Enables programmer to introspect because developers can carefully describe any new implementation \u2022 Test cases can be easily automated \u2022 Gives engineering-based rules to stop testing an application \u2022 Provides clear, engineering-based rules for when to stop testing Disadvantages of Whitebox testing \u2022 Some conditions might be untested as it is not realistic to test every single one \u2022 White-box testing brings complexity to testing because the tester must have knowledge of the program, including being a programmer. White-box testing requires a programmer with a high level of knowledge due to the complexity of the level of testing that needs to be done. \u2022 Defects in the code may not be detected \u2022 Some conditions might be untested as it is not realistic to test every single one Blackbox testing \u2022 Black box testing is performed by the testers. \u2022 Black box testing is a testing method. \u2022 Black box testing means the testing in which internal structure /design is not known to the tester. \u2022 It\u2019s another name is behavioral, functional, opaque-box testing and closed-box testing. \u2022 Black box testing is the language independent in the black box testing we should have the good knowledge of the functionality, we don't need to have the knowledge of the internal structure in the black box testing. Types of Blackbox testing 1.Functional testing 2.Integration testing 3.System testing 4. Acceptance Testing 5.Smoke Testing 6. Ad-Hoc Testing 7. Regression Testing 8. Compatibility Testing 9. Globalization Testing 10.Performance Testing 11.Security Testing 12.Exploratory Testing Advantages of blackbox testing \u2022 Since the tester and developer are independent of each other, testing is balanced. \u2022 Test is performed from a user\u2019s point-of-view and not of the designer\u2019s \u2022 Tester can be non-technical. \u2022 Test cases are designed as soon as functional specifications are complete. \u2022 Blackbox testing is reproducible and efficient. Disadvantages of Black box testing \u2022 Only small number of inputs can be tested, to test every possible input stream may take more time. \u2022 There is a probability of repeating tests already performed by the programmer. \u2022 Chances oh having the undefined paths during Blackbox testing. \u2022 It is difficult to identify tricky inputs if the test cases are not developed based on specifications. Grey-box testing is a combination of white-box testing and black-box testing. The main goal of the testing is to search for the defects if any due to improper structure or improper usage of applications. A black-box tester is unaware of the internal structure of the application to be tested, while a white-box tester has access to the internal structure of the application. A gray-box tester partially knows the internal structure, which includes access to the documentation of internal data structures as well as the algorithms used. Gray-box testers require both high-level and detailed documents describing the application, which they collect in order to define test cases. For more details follow below video,  ",

            "answer_text": "Types of Testing:- 1. Unit Testing It focuses on smallest unit of software design. In this we test an individual unit or group of inter related unit. It is often done by programmer by using sample input and observing its corresponding outputs.Example: a)\u00a0In a program we are checking if loop, method or \u00a0\u00a0   function\u00a0is working fine\u00a0b)\u00a0Misunderstood or incorrect, arithmetic precedence.\u00a0c)\u00a0Incorrect initialization\u00a02. Integration Testing The objective is to take unit tested components and build a program structure that has been dictated by design.Integration testing is testing in which a group of components are combined to produce output. Integration testing are of two types: (i) Top down (ii) Bottom upExample (a)\u00a0Black Box testing:- It is used for validation. \u00a0\u00a0In\u00a0this we ignores internal working mechanism and \u00a0\u00a0focuses\u00a0on what\u00a0is the output?.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(b)\u00a0White Box testing:- It is used for verification. \u00a0\u00a0In\u00a0this we focus on internal mechanism i.e.\u00a0how\u00a0the output is achieved?\u00a03. Regression Testing Every time new module is added leads to changes in program. This type of testing make sure that whole component works properly even after adding components to the complete program.Example In\u00a0school record suppose we have module staff, students \u00a0\u00a0and\u00a0finance combining these modules and checking if on \u00a0\u00a0integration\u00a0these module works fine is regression testing\u00a04. Smoke Testing This test is done to make sure that software under testing is ready or stable for further testingIt is called smoke test as testing initial pass is done to check if it did not catch the fire or smoked in the initial switch on.Example: If\u00a0project has 2 modules so before going to module \u00a0\u00a0make\u00a0sure that module 1 works properly\u00a05. Alpha Testing This is a type of is a type of acceptance testing which is done before the product is released to customers. It is typically done by QA people.Example: When\u00a0software testing is performed internally within\u00a0the\u00a0organization\u00a06. Beta Testing The beta test is conducted at one or more customer sites by the end-user of the software. This version is released for the limited number of users for testing in real time environmentExample: When\u00a0software testing is performed for the limited\u00a0number\u00a0of people\u00a07. System Testing In this software is tested such that it works fine for different operate System covered under the black box testing technique. In this we just focus on required input and output without focusing on internal working.In this we have security testing, recovery testing , stress testing and performance testingExample: This\u00a0include functional as well as non functional \u00a0\u00a0testing\u00a0",
