            "answer_text": "Marvel technology is far more advanced! And also more real. Take for example Tony Stark. He is what Batman should be in terms of intelligence. We know Tony Stark is a human with an incredible IQ. But his technology allows him to be a superhero, to do superhuman things. And his Iron Man suits makes it all more believable. With Bruce Wayne we got a human that wears a suit that can only stop little more than a bullet. His utility belt is severally limited. And in most cases what he pulls from his belt is clear plot convenience. While if he instead had a batsuit made with highly advanced nanotechnology, then we at least could have a Batman that is actually believable. Not just Tony Stark. In Marvel be it the Fantastic Four, Peter Parker, Beast (X-Men), intelligence and intellectual achievements are much more appreciated and used in the actual fight of villains. While in DC we see more raw power but not that much intelligence. And that intelligence I find the stories to be more enjoyable and actually more realistic. ",

            "answer_text": "If we compare specific times and places, the result varies. 31st century LSH dwarfs the current Earth of Marvel (or DC, needless to say). But so does 21st century Colu, and Oa in any period stretching back millions or even billions of years surpasses both. But 21st century Earth in either universe? That\u2019s a good bit trickier. On the Marvel side, you have Wakanda, Latveria, and Atlantis, not to mention the achievements of Reed Richards, Tony Stark, and other genius inventors. On the DC side, you have the Kryptonian tech of Superman (Fortress of Solitude) and genius inventors like Batman, Mr Terrific, Lex[Luthor][Corp], Doc Magnus, and others. However, excluding Kal-el\u2019s Kryptonian tech, I would give the edge to Marvel on this score. ",
