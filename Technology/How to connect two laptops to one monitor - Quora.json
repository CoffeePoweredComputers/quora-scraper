            "answer_text": "If the monitor has multiple inputs, it should be as simple as plugging in both monitors and using the monitors front panel to switch input device. If there is no multiple input support, you would need to use a device like a hdmi input switcher. To get both displays visible simultaneously, you'd either need to have a (rather expensive) ultra widescreen monitor with pip support, or you could look into installing remote desktop on the laptops, and controlling both from either one of the laptops.

            "answer_text": "Yes, you need a 2-input monitor, and just choose which input you want to display. I got a Samsung 27 inch Monitor / HDTV, for instance (P2770HD). I have connected two desktop computers (one with the DVI and one with the PC input), have a stand-alone DVD recording device with the cable input to cable TV (go to HDMI). Also, have a similar 24-in-Samsung monitor but have only 2 HDMI inputs. I can both have the two computers and the DVD recorder stand-alone and switch from each other with the remote controls. There is also an older (only) monitor with dual inputs. You only have to look at the data and select the monitor you need. ",
