            "answer_text": "Artificial Intelligence, probably the most sought after term in the 21st century. Right from its inception till today, AI has been showing immense progress every single day. From being a convoluted concept all the way till it becoming one of the most trending technology, it has made a strong impact in today\u2019s world. If you are planning to be one among the superheroes in the world of AI, then make sure you keep a structured path to your learning. Artificial Intelligence calls for all things technical. Be it programming languages like Python or R, data handling with respect to distributed computing using Spark or even scaling everything to the clouds using AWS or Azure. There are many programs online which are very well put together to help you master Artificial Intelligence. For example in India, we have many top certification providers. Intellipaat, in my opinion is the one leading here. Their carefully put together curriculum alongside structured teaching, 24/7 support and lifetime access are the highlights. Let us discuss the course program, they seem to cover everything from the basics of AI, neural networks, deep learning all the way to concepts in depth about neural networks, Keras, autoencoders and even concepts such as Time Series Analysis (TSA) I think this is very well put together for you to pick up on the technologies and learn. Here\u2019s a free video from them covering a bit about Artificial Intelligence. Check it out:  Do check them out, they have really good reviews. Have fun learning :) ",
