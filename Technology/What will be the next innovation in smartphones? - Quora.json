            "answer_text": "The next innovation in smartphones, ie: something that draws a solid line under the current generation of smartphones and enters a new generation, will be ones which have flexible/changing form factors.  Flexible Form-Factors / Multiform: Gone will be the days when you could only buy a fixed-size device where everybody debated about whether a phablet was the best size or whether taller was better, or if smaller was better for calls and so on. You will simply buy a small device which can fold out / extend to become a larger device. Your phone will operate differently in each form factor as the device reconfigures it's UI for the new screen size. Screens are already invented which are flexible, roll up, extend in size and cleverly re-configure it's own resolution when folded. Basically what this technology is, is a lattice of separate miniature screens all docked to one another. There are some primitive first-gen examples of these by Samsung and LG on YouTube. You can extend the screen in the same way you extend a projector screen.  So the form factor of future smartphones will be one where all the electronics are actually housed below or to the side of the screen. The screen itself will be durable and extendible retractable, and most likely will have the ability to be fully transparent, only \"blacking out\" when needed.  No distinction between Tablet and Smartphone: Of course, this technology won't be kept just for smartphones. In fact, tablets and smartphones will become one and the same, rather than the clearly separate product lines you see today. The challenges we need to overcome to get there: 1) Battery technology. Our lithium batteries need a serious kick up the arse. In the next 7 years, expect to have batteries that can hold a 10 hour charge but be re-charged to 100% in about 15 minutes. 2) Smaller electronics. Single, integrated chipsets will do more, while using less power and remaining cooler. 3) Screen technology. Improvements in bezel reduction. Improvements in colour/light consistency and accuracy in the corners of these new flexible/foldable screens. More durable screens made out of shatter-proof plastics rather than glass, akin to OLEDs 4) Responsive OS: Windows 8 has the right idea and is the closest UI to date that could easily be used on such devices. Expect iOS8 (not 7) to start showing design changes that show hints that they're slowly guiding users to a future where their OS reconfigures for different screens in realtime, like responsive websites.
