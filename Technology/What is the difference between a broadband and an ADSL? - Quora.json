            "answer_text": "Broadband is any connection to the Internet which is faster than dial up. ADSL is Asynchronous Digital Subscriber Line. ADSL is a type of connection to the Internet. Asynchronous describes the way the total bandwidth has been divided between your upload speed and your download speed. Most people browse the Internet, so most of their bandwidth is used downloading the web pages which they view (along with all of the images, scripts, css, etc). DSL has a total bandwidth available. For easy math, we\u2019ll say 20MBPS. If it is asyncronous dsl, then the bandwidth provider can choose to allow up to 15MBPS download speed while allowing only 5MBPS upload speed because to most users the faster download speed is preferable. I would just add one more thing. Get cable if you\u2019re able. The bandwidth is just way higher, and connections are more stable because they are carried over shielded lines. This is opposed to phone lines used by any flavor of DSL, which may be on a pole and affected by wind or rain or snow or ice which can easily cause breaks and definitely static. ",

            "answer_text": "One is jargon, the other is a technology that fits under that piece of jargon's concept umbrella Broadband describes all forms of internet connectivity faster than, if I remember right, 128 Kbps, which were the last generation of dial-up modems, and the first generation of DSL, or Digital Subscriber Line. ADSL, or Asynchronous Digital Subscriber Line, defines a connection that does not have the same speeds going up and fown; upload speed is almost always lower (like 99.999999999999% of the time). A telephone line, either fully active or on a dry loop connection (data only, no active voice service) is required for DSL to work All forms of modern DSL fall under the Broadband umbrella, along with DOCSIS, fibre and Tx connections (not sure if these are being used anymore, though).
