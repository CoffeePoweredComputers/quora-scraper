            "answer_text": "I\u2019ve used lots of Samsung devices ever since 2015 up to 2019, namely the Galaxy A5, Galaxy S5, Galaxy S7 and Galaxy S9+, and I\u2019ve changed to the iPhone XS. Here are some pros and cons of using a Galaxy and an iPhone in general from my own experience. Samsung Galaxy (Pros) : The cameras on Samsung devices ever since the Galaxy S7 onward, does a great job in low light photography.There\u2019s a headphone jack, so you could use your wired headphones while charging the phone.Adaptive fast charging out of the box.Better external speakers, thanks to its AKG powered speakers.You\u2019ll get a $100 AKG earphones out of the box, which sounds way better compared to Apple\u2019s $30 earpods.There\u2019s an option to use fingerprint unlock if you\u2019re not a fan of facial recognition.LED-notification light, so you don\u2019t have to turn on your screen to see whether you have any notifications (this is removed on S10 though)Expandable storage. (Not a fan of this, it makes the phone slow)Price drops very quickly. Normally you can get the phone cheaper up to 30% from just the first 4 months after launch.The software can be customized a lot. (Personally I don\u2019t customize my phone a lot)If you opt for a Samsung Galaxy Note, you\u2019ll have access to a stylus (s pen) which enables you to do lots productivity features.There\u2019s an \u2018always on-display\u2019 which means you can see your more information of time, date and notification without turning on your screen.Apple iPhone (pros) : Significantly BETTER facial recognition feature to unlock the phone, thanks to its neural engine and True-depth camera system.Noticeably stronger processor. Apple\u2019s A12 Bionic chip outperforms all android devices out there.Extremely refined software, lots of attention to detail which makes navigating the iPhone a seamless experience.A very fluid user interface. I was surprised by the fluidity that it feels years ahead compared to One UI / Stock Android 9.3D touch (pressure sensitive display) feature which makes quick options to be very handy, such as previewing videos or links. It is very integrated with the software.Ability to connect within other Apple devices such as Macbook and iPad very seamlessly.Apps and system features generally look way better compared to Android. Lots of Engineering is put into iOS.Ability to use iMessage within other Apple users. Personally, iMessage is very futuristic given all its features and integration with other Apple devices.More accessories available, and iPhone\u2019s third party accessories look way better compared to Samsung.Supports 5\u20136 years of software updates.A very good and optimized battery life as for the plus models of iPhones and the X series.Significantly higher resale value and lower depreciation is better when you\u2019re planning to sell your phone.Samsung Galaxy (Cons) : The edge display might look good, but it\u2019s very prone to accidental touches.Only supports up to 2 years of software updates, and there are rarely any updates within the year itself.Slower and laggier user interface when compared to iOS.Phone more prone to heating up when compared to iPhones.Software is less refined, with several parts here and there of the user interface lacking of consistency.Bixby isn\u2019t as advanced as SiriLow resale value to sell, which isn\u2019t great if you plan to upgrade your phone every 2\u20133 years due to its high depreciation rate.Apple iPhone (Cons) : Less customization. (Personally I like this as it makes the UI tidier and consistent)You need to pay an extra $75 for fast chargingMore expensive to purchase due to its higher resale value and significantly lower depreciation rate.Considerably more expensive when repairing damaged parts of the phone.Cameras are bad on low-light shots.There\u2019s no headphone jack, so you have to purchase a dongle.Despite having stereo speakers, it has a lesser sound qualityThe earpods included in the box isn\u2019t as good as the AKG included in Samsung\u2019s box.You need to pay extra for expanding your iCloud storage, as expandable storage is not available.Personally as a person who used Android for 4 years and moving to an iPhone, my experience have been way better in iPhone compared to Android mostly due to the iOS experience itself.

            "answer_text": "Q: Which is better to buy, the Samsung or the iPhone, and why? A: iPhone. My consulting company answers this question for our new clients every year when they are working on the annual budgetsiPhonesCost far less to own because they last years longerHave far better privacy than all Androids bar none, which includes Samsung KnoxHave far better security than all Androids bar none, which includes Samsung KnoxiPhones don\u2019t get malwareGet all updates for free for 6 years from AppleAre easier to use, they have virtually zero training costsAre more reliable, they are built to quality standards far higher than all AndroidsAre far more powerful than all Androids bar none, proven by the latest international study which proved that iPhones are 3 to 6 times faster than all Androids bar noneGet the best apps firstGet full featured apps, many Androids are missing featuresAndroidsAre overpriced for the poor performance that they deliverOnly get 6 months of official critical updates from GoogleAre subject to many viruses and other malware200 Million Android users get infected with serious, active viruses, spyware and other malware every yearIn 2019 240 Million Android users got infected with serious, active viruses, spyware and other malwareAll these infections were from apps downloaded from the Google Play Store (which is how we are able to count them so accurately)Google only provides 6 months of critical security updates for each new Android model, then it becomes insecure, regardless of phone manufacturerGoogle is unable to keep Android safeiPhones have the best security and reliability in the worldI have written about this before so I will quote myself here:There are viruses, and hacker attacks, written for the Mac, iPhones and iPads, they do exist but Apple is successful at deflecting them because Apple expends a huge effort in keeping their customers safe, protecting customer privacy via an effective multi layer defense system built into many layers of the operating system (which deflects viruses, hackers and other malware). There is no other OS with anywhere near the protection level that Apple provides. That is why you don\u2019t see any active viruses or other hacks on Mac, iPhones or iPads, regardless of how many new strains are made. FBI Director Comey testified before United States Congress that the FBI, with the help of the other government agencies, cannot hack into iPhones, which also means that there is no way to bypass the Activation Lock/iCloud Lock, at all. He also testified that the FBI can hack all other operating systems and products, regardless of marketing claims. Companies like Cellebrite make false claims about being able to break into iPhones, the fact is that they cannot hack any iPhone that has the Secure Enclave chip, the same is true of the Manhattan District Attorney\u2019s office who has a million dollar hacking lab, they also can only hack (All) Androids they cannot hack any iPhone that has the Secure Enclave chip in it. This is why the FBI is continuously harassing Apple to install a backdoor in to iPhones, which Apple always refuses because Apple is the only high tech company that is actually dedicated to protecting your privacy. Apple responds very quickly to new virus threats, automatically updating all Mac, iPhone and iPad users around the world immediately and invisibly. If you have Automatic Updates\u201d turned on (which is the normal setting for all users), then you will receive updated virus protection, invisibly, the same day that Apple releases it. This is why there is no *Active* virus/malware in the Apple community, so there is nothing to worry about. Apple also avoids hardware exploits in Intel\u2019s CPU (which have multiple security flaws) with the implementation of Apple\u2019s own Secure Enclave, T1, T2, etc. chips that boot completely securely, regardless of all the flaws in Intel\u2019s CPUs. Apple expends a great deal of effort to make its operating systems (macOS, iOS, iPadOS, watchOS, tvOS, audioOS, etc.) secure, safe and private by implementing defenses in many layers of its core OS, which includes but is not limited to: XProtectYara (so you can even add your own rules)GatekeeperSystem Integrity Protection (SIP)Malware Removal Tool (MRT)Core SuggestionsIncompatible Kernel Extensions (KEXT Exclusions)Application Firewall (cannot be disabled)pf Firewall (BSD firewall, optional)FileVault (high grade encryption of all your data)Chinese Word List (SCIM)Core LSKD (kdrl)Flask Security Architecture for flexible mandatory access controlFile quarantineDeactivation of TPM (where applicable) on a hardware levelSafari Fraudulent Sites protectioneficheckMessages (the only text app that is actually secure)iCloud Lock (in addition to Passcode Lock)Protection against \u201cJuice Jacking\u201dT2 OnwardsPasswords are hashed then the hash is stored in an inaccessible hardware encryption chip (T2 and Secure Enclave chip onwards)Cryptographic BootiPhoneiPadMacSecure Enclave (T2, etc.) chipIs isolated so even if a host device is compromised the Secure Enclave remains secureProvides hardware control of FaceTime cameraFIPS 140-2/-3 Conformance Validation Certificate2018 onwards FIPS 140-2 Security Level 12019 onwards FIPS 140-2 Security Level 2FIPS 140-2/-3 Security Level 3 in newer productsmacOS Mojave onwardCamera or microphone access requires user consent prompt (all but the oldest Macs have the webcam hard wired to the green indicator light so the camera cannot be on unless the green light is on); there is also a, physical disconnect that cuts the physical connection when the lid is loweredMoving or reading files in the Trash (by an app) require user consentPlug-in unapproved list, Safari extension unapproved listmacOS Catalina onwardNotarizationMandatory app code signingSystem Extensions (replacing kernel extensions)System files are stored in a separate read-only partitionEndpoint Security frameworkGatekeeper enhanced with random validation checksGatekeeper now requires a User Prompt and approval for changes (anti-ransomware protection)Camera access, microphone access, screen recording or keyboard input monitoring requires user consent prompt (all but the oldest Macs have the webcam hard wired to the green indicator light so the ca cannot be on unless the green light is on)Downloads require user consent prompting for each domainLocked out ROOT account (not even Admin has access to ROOT)Security & Privacy preference panelAccess control settings permissions for functions like Screen Recording, accessing Files and Folders, Input Monitoring, and Speech Recognition.Activation Lock (like on iPad and iPhone)T2 Security Chip-enabled Macs become nothing more than a brick until the proper credentials are verified, to unlock itApple led the industry to require that Safari only accept digital certificates that are not more than 13 months oldAddress space layout randomization (ASLR)Apple statement on privacy/security: \u201cEvery Apple device combines hardware, software, and services designed to work together for maximum security and a transparent user experience in service of the ultimate goal of keeping personal information safe \u2026 Apple is committed to helping protect customers with leading privacy and security technologies\u2014 designed to safeguard personal information\u2014and comprehensive methods\u2014to help protect corporate data in an enterprise environment.
