            "answer_text": "iPhone was an innovative approach, with a reasonable level of new technology. But don\u2019t look back with rose-tinted glasses, it had some flaws and was much, much slower & more limited than today. There have already been products released that are as innovative. iPad had virtually no \u201cnew\u201d technology inside it was a hugely innovative approach to tablets. That\u2019s what flawed everyone and what lead to a lot of criticism. The idea of two products - a phone and a tablet - sharing the same OS didn\u2019t make a lot of sense. Surely that made them the same thing, and as the iPhone came first the iPad was \u201ca big iPhone\u201d. Apple Watch had a lot of new technology: Apple haptic engine, custom processor, digital crown, custom heart-rate sensor, easily interchangeable bands, etc. Yet the concept of a smartwatch was at least familiar to people.
