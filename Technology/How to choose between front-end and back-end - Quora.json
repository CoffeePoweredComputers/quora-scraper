            "answer_text": "Back end is more sane. Front end is a f*cking mess, what with the endless array of JS frameworks like Angular 1-n (I\u2019ve lost count), React, Ember, Backbone, Knockout, Meteor, Mercury, Mithril, Aurelia, Vue, etc., etc., etc. Are you f*cking kidding me??? On the back end, you can use much nicer languages like Java, Python, C#, Ruby, Scala, Golang, Pharo, etc. There is no mess here. Stability rules. ",

I highly recommend doing both as your demand in the tech world will be more sought out. Many employers want to know that you know how to pick up a language or sometimes even the ability to learn a language or framework on the fly. If you pursue both, you'll have a way better idea conceptually & will be able to pick up new technology with greater ease.
