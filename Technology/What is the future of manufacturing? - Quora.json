            "answer_text": "By and large, manufacturing has been conducted by skilled workers for the last two centuries. Man, and machine combined in a way that changed how we work and our notions of how much output is possible. We\u2019ve shortened production timelines, improved quality exponentially and streamlined process efficiency to never-before-seen levels. Industry 4.0 heavily relies on new age technologies like IoT, Automation, Artificial intelligence, and Machine Learning. The future of manufacturing would look something like this with the implementation of industry 4.0.  So how would this Digital factory of the future work? In the digital factory of the future, the Operations & Factory Managers would be able to share information with partners and decision-makers in real-time and adjust on-the-go. Automate \u00e0 Calibrate \u00e0 Optimize is the name of the game as decision-makers can focus increasingly on efficiency and unit economics \u2013 a boon to any industry where the scale is such that a small process improvement can result in millions being saved. With so many tools and machines requiring precise conditions to function, the use of IoT sensors will be help ensure everything is in shape with built-in notifications when anything in the process even inches towards being empirically sub-optimal. This will undoubtedly reduce maintenance costs, wastage, and downtime. Operations Optimization and Safety IoT in manufacturing will optimize everything from raw material sourcing to logistics. This micro-management-enabled process will revolutionize every industry and manufacturing process. Think of inventory tracking on a global level, with each component traceable. At the lowest level, this includes revolutionizing just-in-time systems of stocking materials, which would give higher productivity rates. The most exciting thing about the future of manufacturing is IoT and big data - a marriage made in manufacturing heaven. Imagine if you can reduce injuries, health hazards and eliminate dangerous working conditions on a micro-level while keeping an eye on the environmental benefits and impact on carbon footprint at the macro-level when you factor in the impact of transportation, factory emissions, and waste. Good for people, planet, and profits? It might just be. Customer satisfaction By tracking data at every stage of the product lifecycle, you can reduce production time, product costs and quality issues. IoT integration at every level will allow manufacturers to track a problem or lack of performance the instant a dysfunctionality occurs. This feedback can then be transmitted to the companies without the consumer user needing to contact you. Data tracking can trace product decline from manufacturing to logistics and eventually it's using over time. You can solve a problem before it becomes one and takes all the emotional rollercoasters out of consumer redressals. Surely CRM teams worldwide will find this a goal worth fighting for. What impact will it have on jobs in the manufacturing sector? People do not like change and people do not like uncertainty. That\u2019s just a fundamental truth you can choose to ignore or get on board with and plan for. For progress to take place, both must be overcome. No employee is thrilled about the idea of a technology that might make his/her future job prospects more difficult. Getting their buy-in through good communication and expounding the virtues of this effort is essential. It\u2019s clear that automation will result in a massive reclassification and rebalancing of work. Some sectors and roles, even entire sections of the workforce will lose out, but others will be created. Automation will not only alter the types of jobs available but their number and perceived value. By replacing workers doing routine, methodical tasks, machines can amplify the comparative advantage of those workers with problem-solving, leadership, EQ (Emotional Intelligence), empathy and creativity skills. Those workers performing tasks which automation can\u2019t yet crack, become more pivotal \u2013 and this means creativity, innovation, imagination, and design skills will be prioritized by employers.  In short, a lot. The benefits and future applications of IoT in manufacturing are numerous and inevitable. But in a nutshell: 1) Manufacturers invest large sums of money in technology 2) Operational efficiencies rise due to the minimized impact of \u2018being human. That means no mistakes, no sick days, no training. Just output. Reliable + Scalable + Cost-Effective = Perfect for the Manufacturing Industry ",

            "answer_text": "3D printing is the future of manufacturing! In an extremely short span of time 3D printing has certainly come a long way. Charles Hull built the initial printer way back in the 1980s as a tool for printing basic polymer objects, but in today\u2019s world, that technology has generated remarkable efforts in many manufacturing sectors; right from the building of complex aircraft and car components, to manufacturing human organs and prostheses for clinical uses.In recent manufacturing, 3D printers are been extensively used though their use has so far been limited and restricted to only particular processes. And if you're not excited by the level of waves 3D printing is making, then you're certainly not thinking big enough, because according to the prediction of some technology visionaries life on Earth will in time radically change because of it, and according to these predictors, 3D printing will make life as we perceive it today barely recognizable in about 50 to 75 years. With the idea of a do-it-yourself mode of manufacturing coming to the forefront, just in a way similar to how the Internet leveled the playing field, by solving the problems of reach and allowing everyone to play equally, that is what has been predicted to happen with manufacturing soon. With the larger business world beginning to grasp the potential of 3D prints for efficient, low cost and eco-friendly manufacturing. It is no surprise that analyst firm, Canalys sees the global market for 3D printers skyrocketing to $16.2bn by year 2018. With the increasing level of adoption of this technology manufacturing, supply chain and the logistics processes will revolutionize.Technology has certainly developed to a point where we are rethinking industry. Also, the next industrial revolution is creating chances for manufacturing to the entire world where the populace can partake in the process. This idea though will not be much different from the change computers underwent from a few, large, centralized mainframes to something we can comfortably hold in our hands.A GROWING ECOSYSTEMEvery day, more people have access to 3D printers and technology and thanks to the open source DIY clubs, hackers and maker spaces and Maker Fairies that are popping up in cities around the world. some perfect international examples are the Wevolver in London and Amsterdam, the FabLabs, and more currently, the 3D Hubs network which has grown from coupling a couple of hundred 3D printers to more than 7,000 in less than a year giving room of tech tricks to the users.Many people have started printing in 3D in their own neighborhood due to easy access to top class 3D modeling and design applications and software, such as the 123D Design which is available for PC or Mac, iPhone and also as a Web application making it accessible for interested users. With entrepreneurs betting on a lucrative market to be achieved in the next few years more 3D printing marketplaces and Service Centers are springing up everywhere. Companies like Shapeways and Maker6 are already pioneers in this area in the United States, while iMaterialise is a well-known brand in Europe. A lot of the big companies are already positioning towards a 3D printing consumer explosion as well, with the recently launched Amazon\u2019s 3D printing Store or the UPS Store\u2019s in the United States perfect examples of this.In fact, 3D-printing technology is gaining ground at a staggering rate, and American designers are currently working on 3D-printed cars, while in places like China and Holland, 3D-printers are building complete houses. Heralding the possibility of a man-made food supply the first 3D-printed hamburger was recently printed in England. Companies like Boeing, GE and some industry leaders are currently manufacturing state-of-the-art aerospace equipment using this new technology, while NASA is demonstrating how 3D printers will one day be used in space, using Zero-G technology.In our world of \u2018next-day delivery\u2019 where consumers are known to want products fast, 3D printing will make it possible for various establishments to consistently meet delivery of goods even in tighter time scales. With this technology customers\u2019 growing demands for personalized products will also be met. Personalisation has started happening in the clothing and footwear industry as consumers can walk into a store, customize whatever items they want and take them home the same day. This will lead to the demise of the construction and agricultural industries, thereby making many traditional methods of building and food production obsolete.Although much of what has been said still has some way to go, it\u2019s clear that the potential of increased pace of trade brought about by 3D-printing and recent industry models that are created will certainly need businesses to re-evaluate processes of their supply chain. Manufacturers will then need to make their supply chains far more effective and able to operate real-time in order to be able to cope with faster product design and production cycles. There is a concern that this type of manufacturing, with emphasis on consumer goods will generate greater level of consumption and waste. Since the materials used for 3-D printing of these goods are mostly heat processed recyclable plastic products, thereby making a reverse supply chain approach possible. Therefore, customers can recycle used, damaged and unwanted products by hauling them back to a local 3D-print shop, so that they can be recycled and made into new and useable products once more.Though, it is not all about replacing the procedures of how we create and get a product, it is about making brand new products having entirely new properties which were not a possibility with the old processes. When this happens countries like China which has been the manufacturing power of the world will lose the strategy that has given it such political heft in the future and though it won\u2019t be losers in the new era and like every other nation it will have a domestic market to serve on a local basis. And since not all products lend themselves to 3D-printing, China will have to step down from being the mass-manufacturing powerhouse of the world but will still command a fair share of the economy.The great shift of wealth and employment to the East over the past two decades may have seemed a decisive tipping factor, but this new technology will certainly change how the world leans.

            "answer_text": "Manufacturing companies are turning more to the internet to grow their businesses \u2013 and specifically to marketing automation to build systems that bring leads and sales.  The advent of internet marketing has made the costs of acquiring a new customer much lower.  For a majority of B2B marketers, marketing automation budgets in 2014 stay flat or increase (from the B2B Marketing Automation report by Pepper Global). The fact that running a website is becoming easier also helps. You don't need to know how to code to update your site. I see website operations being done more in-house \u2013 and as a result better messaging in their marketing.   Many mid-sized manufacturers have been turning to inbound marketing (a branch of internet marketing) that works extremely well \u2013 especially with the average size of manufacturing contracts compared to the low costs of inbound marketing.  I wrote about a one-year-old plastic manufacturing company that used inbound to grow by $1 million in revenue each year. You can read the case study, including the steps they used, here: @http://blog.webphenoms.com/how-to-generate-leads-for-your-manufacturing-company-with-inbound-marketing ",
