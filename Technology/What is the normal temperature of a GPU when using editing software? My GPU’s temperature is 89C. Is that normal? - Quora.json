            "answer_text": "How long is a rope? Your question is to vague. Different GPU\u2019s generates different amount of heat and have different safe operating temperatures. You also don\u2019t mention the actual usage of the GPU when you are using your editing software. If we assume it\u2019s at 100% load then your card will get hot, especially if it stays at 100% load over a long period of time. Regarding temperature, most modern GPU\u2019s throttle based on a couple of variables like the amount of current used and the temperature. These variables can be adjusted by the card to keep the GPU safe and stable. It could include raising the current to allow higher clocks stable or lowering the clocks and current to produce less heat. Through tweaking and overclocking you can alter these limits and have the card perform better at the cost of additional power and/or heat output which the current cooler may or may not be able to handle. Without the GPU make it\u2019s hard to say what the limits \u201ckind of\u201d are for your particular card. I say \u201ckind of\u201d since even within a given GPU model, for instance the 1080ti, there are variations depending on manufacturer, cooling solutions etc. Cards from AMD\u2019s R9 290 and 390 series was said to be ok to run at 90C+, although I find that quite high. If we look at a current gen high end card like the 1080ti clocks will start going down somewhere at 55-60C and keep dropping in increments every 8C or so. After reaching around 90C the card will start thermal throttling to keep the card safe and you will notice big dips in performance. Now, without knowing more about your entire system it\u2019s hard to say if this is \u201cnormal\u201d or not. If it\u2019s a small case, a laptop etc. it\u2019s very likely what you could expect from a powerful GPU at 100% load for an extended period of time. But in a big case, with good air flow and a decent GPU cooler it could suggest that there might be some issue with the GPU cooling, for instance a lot of accumulated dust in the fin-array, a failing fan or something similar.

            "answer_text": "Depends on the GPU and if that is full load or idle temperature. But if that is at idle, you have a serious problem. Graphics cards will throttle when the temps get too high which means they won't be performing to their best. This usually happens when people buy a mass produced pc e.g. dell, hp etc and chuck in a graphics card thinking it will be fine. Your case needs ventilation and more fans probably. Airflow is terrible in bog standard cases, that's why gaming cases have loads of vents and spaces for extra fans. If you stick with the principle for air goes in the front and underneath and air comes out the back and top, then that is a good place to start for fan placement. If you have a gaming case or a custom build and these temps are only when the GPU is at full load or under serious use, like gaming or rendering, benchmarking etc, then it's not so much of a problem, just keep an eye as some graphics chips handle heat better than others. You also haven't mentioned what the GPU is which means we don't know if it is passive (no fan) or one with a reference/aftermarket cooler. ",
