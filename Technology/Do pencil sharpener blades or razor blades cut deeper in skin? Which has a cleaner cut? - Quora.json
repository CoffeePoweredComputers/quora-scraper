            "answer_text": "Honestly, I was there. I broke down a few times and I did self harm. As a masochist it was even more enjoyable to me, but I regret it so much and it leads to a vicious cycle of cutting because of that remorse for cutting before. It sounds ironic, but I know. I used neither razors nor pencil sharpener blades to cut, as I collect pocket knives and while that made me happier, it also gave me more access to things when I broke. I know razors are better for cutting human skin, but I hope it isn't for self-harm or torture of another outside of a book. Talk to someone you trust. Odds are they might already know, if you have luck like mine. I would never tell anyone this if I didn't think it would help, but find someone you trust, get help. Even if it's just a friend or someone you have a crush on that is kind to you. I wouldn't have survived my freshman year of high school if it weren't for the love of my life and a girl I had a crush on back then, I still owe them my life and am repaying my debt as best as I can. I hope this helps, and I sincerely hope that you are asking this for research for a book and not to actually harm yourself or another. Or that you're pulling some kinky stuff in the bedroom. If it's for the bedroom or a book, more power to you mate, I wish you luck. If it's for harming yourself, I wish you luck in finding the help you need. I'd offer to help you myself, but I'm not good with emotional stuff and I might do more harm than good when I try to help, but I wish you a happy life ahead. Update: Things are weird in my life, the person I called the love of my life is barely in my life and the friend is my best friend and I have loved her for years. She\u2019s still here for me and does her best and is now pregnant and I\u2019m nothing but happy for her. Find yourself someone who you want to love and support even if they\u2019re pregnant with someone else\u2019s kid(we aren\u2019t together so why would I be hurt?), because that\u2019s where the greatest strength comes from ",

Once I broke apart a shaving razor and took out the 3 blades, and they\u2019re so sharp that when I lightly pressed the blade (not the tip, the whole blade) on my thumb, it instantly got cut. For a pencil sharpener, you need to either press very hard with the whole blade or cut with the tip of the blade. But of course, don\u2019t cut yourself. ",
