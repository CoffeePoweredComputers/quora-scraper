            "answer_text": "What does \u201charder\u201d really mean? I haven\u2019t worked as hard as I have in medicine in terms of sheer hours and effort in my whole life. However, graduate level quantum mechanics was not bad at all for me personally. I quickly understood those concepts and studied very few hours. In terms of sheer effort, I\u2019d say it\u2019s a LOT harder for medicine. Does that mean physics is \u201ceasy\u201d? Of course not. Conceptually, I\u2019d say it was easy to understand anatomy, pharmacology, pathology, microbiology, and biochemistry in medical context. But the amount of time learning everything and applying it in a clinical diagnostic setting is grueling. The body is really a complex system even though it arises from simple concepts. Not only do you have to memorize a ton of material, you have to apply it. It\u2019s called \u201cdrinking from the firehose\u201d for a reason. Differential diagnosis techniques that are applied are heavily based on scientific methods. I don\u2019t get the tiny amount of vocal critics that claim \u201cmedicine is not a science\u201d and thus \u201ceasier\u201d. Is medicine a science? There are parts \u201cart\u201d to it, but then if I were to accept that claim, I\u2019d also have to question whether biology is a science. The closer you go to the edges of medical specialties, the more you realize the heavy science parts that involves what is unequivocally cutting-edge scientific research. Are clinical trials not science? I\u2019d beg to differ. You\u2019ll hear the tiny amount of vocal critics say nurses can do the jobs of doctors. While that is partly true they can take up the main functions, and I welcome nurse practitioners in primary care - I think that is far less true for specialties and subspecialties that require continual education to keep up with exponentially increasing medical knowledge and applications. You\u2019re welcome to ask even the most hardcore nurse practitioners with higher education that this is true - they\u2019re going to refer you to specialists as needed. As for medical errors, it\u2019s very misleading and sensational at best and anyone who uses that statistic really doesn\u2019t know how medicine works. You\u2019re welcome to find a third party expert that does. Here\u2019s a link that dissects the issue and original research paper that made the claim: Are medical errors really the third most common cause of death in the U.S.? Now, let\u2019s look at this using a different angle - if it\u2019s all just memorizing rote facts, you\u2019ll probably see \u201cAI\u201d replacing doctors quickly because of the repetition involved, right? However, if you ask anyone at IBM Watson Health how their project is going, they are far from it, and even top research centers have cut funding for those AI projects because it\u2019s shown very disappointing results. There\u2019s a lot more to medicine than just memorizing the facts. In fact, a lot less can be automated than one can assume and goes completely contrary to that original assumption - the work of doctors are significantly less likely than physicists to be computerized in the next 20 years. So much for being purely repetition. See Oxford study extensive probability calculations for computerization of skills here: https://www.oxfordmartin.ox.ac.uk/downloads/academic/The_Future_of_Employment.pdf (University of Oxford, Department of Engineering Science, no medical researchers were involved) It is simply an attack on medicine that mostly boils down to: we do not have the same degree of certainty for physics in general. But that doesn\u2019t mean we don\u2019t know anything or all the facts we know are not correct. It\u2019s much \u201charder\u201d to fully understand complex systems like the human body than complicated systems like building a rocket. Building a rocket simply has higher degrees of certainty than the human body. (Not a perfect analogy, just used to illustrate a point). This does not mean doctors are better at all. If you don\u2019t think complex systems are \u201chard\u201d, I\u2019d suggest top physicists learn how to solve second order, complex chaotic systems to prove it - by playing the stock market instead of wasting time applying for grant research money, because logically that would not be productive if they really can solve such problems. We don\u2019t even have to wait for the results of this challenge - one of the top physicists Issac Newton lost a lot of his money on the stock market. A mistake equivalent to 3 million dollars today. Funny enough, the man who famously predicted the stock market crash in 2008 using the correct rationale was Michael Burry, MD. He didn\u2019t just predict it, he had skin in the game, where he bet his entire career on it. $200\u2013300 million dollars. I rarely see people in finance actually put all their eggs in one basket while figuring out the sequence of events and rationale. Anyways, my point is not to claim one is better or \u201charder\u201d than the other, because neither is the case. I simply wish to point out the problems being solved are very different, and thus requires very different skills that are difficult to sum up as easier or harder. A genuinely wise physicist would be foolhardy to conclude otherwise. ",

            "answer_text": "Others have suggested it depends upon your definition of \u201c harder\u201d. I generally agree, but the challenges in physics v medicine are very different. Some background: My undergrad degree is in engineering and Physics. I went straight from college to medical school , graduated with my MD and went on to complete a residency and fellowship. That\u2019s 9 years AFTER 4 yrs of undergrad college for those keeping score. By junior year in college I was dipping my toes into the deep end of the physics pool doing original research and taking graduate level courses like tensor analysis and intro to GR etc. It was very challenging intellectually. Lots of time struggleing to grasp concepts that were not exactly intuitive. I intended to go on for a doctorate in physics. But I happened to watch movies of the series of lectures Feynman gave at Cornell (The Messinger lectures) and figured out v quickly , no way was I as smart as Feynman. His ability to simply and clearly describe difficult concepts of physics was amazing and made it clear to me that if i went on in physics i was probably destined for a second tier ( at best) career . So I went to med school. In med school the primary challenge was not intellectual but learning to drink from the proverbial fire hose. The material was not that difficult to understand but the sheer volume of content to be absorbed in the allotted time was off the charts. Anatomy was particularly \u201c hard\u201d probably because i wasted time trying come up with some underlying organization system rather than just memorizing . Pharmacology and histology were equally annoying since they also involved lots of pure memory work. On the othyer hand physiology, biochem, genetics , path, etc etc were more science oriented and relatively easy but still moved along at rapid clip unlike ANY college course. One irony; In all cases exams were perverse fun. For example: i recall an anatomy final question to describe all muscles, bones, nerves, vessels etc required to balance on one leg and jump up and down. Once clerkships started in 3rd year (full time clinical work on the wards , operating room etc) the challenges changed to dealing with exhaustion, the realities of patient care, rounds, endless conferences and scut work while still staying on top of academic demands like researching journal articles etc relevant to what was being encountered clinically. Now, years later, i still try to stay acquainted with what\u2019s going on in some areas of physics. I work at it but I a close friend who is a ph.d theoretical physicist and full professor disabuses me of any notion that I\u2019m anything but a physics dilettante . On the other hand , more than 40 years post med school its not particularly difficult (with a little effort ) to stay on top of trends and breakthroughs in medicine. sorry for the insanely long answer . In sum I\u2019d say : both physics and medicine involve lifelong study. Neither is easy. Both require smarts and persistence. However I think physics is harder intellectually to study while medicine is harder from a discipline , physical stamina perspective, and the ability to recall and integrate vast stores of information and experience. Perhaps the difference is exemplified by the fact that huge gains are being made devising reliable diagnostic and treatment algorithms for medicine while i am unaware of algorithms able to resolve the more persistent and nettlesome problems in theoretical physics.
