            "answer_text": "Hi. its not officially available in india. i suggest you to ask someone from usa to get it here. Google may take 6 to 8 months to release in india. I have bout the google home mini from USA and I have been using it since 3 weeks now. It is fanastic piece of technology. Google has not rolled full services in India but still it can be used for routine entertainment activities. I basically use it for setting alarms, schedules, meeting and reminders. It also gives the weather report and time taken to travel from home to office. It is intelligent as well. It remembers the names of the people related to owner. It plays songs from Google play music in India. But in USA there are various other stores from which it can play music. Overall its wonderful piece of technology. Please go the through following link to have a detailed review of the google home mini in India.  Thanks for reading Amaresh ",
