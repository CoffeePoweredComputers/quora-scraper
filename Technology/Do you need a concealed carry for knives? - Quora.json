            "answer_text": "As far as I can tell, no. There is no concealed carry law for knives anywhere in the world. There are restrictions upon the carrying, size, and construction of knives that vary from country to country (and, in America, from state to state). There are also restrictions on the type of knife it is legal to own (for example, it\u2019s illegal to buy, sell, import, or own a butterfly knife across most of Europe). The law is very haphazard with respect to knives. In Arkansas, for example, you could probably walk around with a samurai sword, whereas in NYC even a Swiss Army Knife would need to be completely hidden from view and never used in public. In more restrictive regions, there are exemptions (the UK, for example, forbids the carrying of any fixed or locking knife blade with an edge length over three inches in a public place, unless the person carrying the blade has \u2018good reason\u2019 for carrying that knife at the time) but these never seem to involve a permit granting an individual an extended right to carry. The law surrounding knives is somewhat different to the law surrounding guns, in part because there isn\u2019t a knife lobby to the same extent there is a gun lobby. ",

            "answer_text": "No, you do not. But your legality to carry a knife is dependent on the state. For example, I don\u2019t need a conceal carry license to carry a knife, nobody really does in the US. However, in order to carry under eighteen (I\u2019m seventeen), I must be at least sixteen years old with a blade shorter than four inches. Look up the laws in your territory to see specific details on the quals to carry a knife. ",

With a GWL one may carry a pistol or weapon openly or concealed. In accordance with OCGA 16\u201311\u2013125.1 only knives of more than 12 inches are considered weapons. NB Justia.com says 5 inches but hasn\u2019t been updated since the passage of HB60 a few years ago. ",
