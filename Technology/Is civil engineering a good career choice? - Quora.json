            "answer_text": "Yes.Civil engineering is oldest branch of engineering. Entire civilization (\u0938\u092d\u094d\u092f\u0924\u093e ) is related to this branch and thus it has got the name CIVIL Engineering. But one always forgets that it is \u201ccivil engineering\u201d rather than BUILDING ENGINEERING. So I would mention some works where civil engineers are required. In building and construction of houses, industries, commercial structures etc which is commonly known to all.In all the geological and geotechnical investigation and site selection for all the mega projects of DAMS, channels and other hydraulic projects.There are N numbers of surveys and planning of cities , townships there you need themExecution of construction of roads,railways, airport runways etc.Bridges, tunnels ,decks etc are some places where you are 0 without civil engineers.STP WTP (Water treatment plant and sewage treatment plant ) believe me here , right from designing of tanks to future regulation of supply and maintenance all is done by civil engineer and NOT CHEMICAL ENGINEER.VALUATION , for urging loans you need valuation of you asset and than only banks give it to you. So valuation is purely done by civil engineer.Every year there are vacancy for government jobs in various fields and maximum vacancy is always available for civil engineers.You can score good marks in Gate and get direct job for PSU , with huge packageBut , the important thing is you cant achieve anything being lazy and simply waiting. Get out of the room do personal survey, and know what exactly is needed to market and where your interest is\u2026 Have healthy discussions with teachers, seniors and parents and finally take decision on your own.. \ud83d\ude04 ",
