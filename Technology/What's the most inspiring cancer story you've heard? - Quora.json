            "answer_text": "When I hear this word it simply takes the heart out of me and reminds me how brave she was! The most dreadful thing I came across. I saw her lying in the bed for two long years but all I could do was nothing at all except watching her suffer. She fought a lot. I could see the pain and her sufferings but still she managed to say \u201c I\u2019m completely fine\u201d It takes a lot of courage to suffer from such a disease. I wasn\u2019t informed about her disease. I was just told that she suffered a minor liver problem! When circumstances became worse and then I saw my mother standing there helplessly crying for her! It merely came as a shock for me. She\u2019s more than a mother to me. How can such a dreadful thing happen to such a beautiful soul. I was completely taken aback after hearing this. I still remember the day when I suffered a minute ear pain and she told me- \u201cCome sleep with me, you might feel better.\u201d Laying down beside her I somehow controlled my tears. There was still a hope within me that everything would end up well ! But unfortunately that was just a hope. I just heard how dangerous Cancer could be but for the first time I saw with my own very eyes the sufferings of the chemotherapies. That too happened with the person I loved the most. And then one night around 3:00 AM I heard some noises. As I woke up, my mother told me that she was not with us anymore. I was totally out of my control and sat in between the verandah screaming as loud as I could ,completely shattered. I tried to deny everything my mother told me.I wasn\u2019t even able to see her for the last time. I miss her. Life ain\u2019t a fairy tale ! It has hard endings. When it comes to her, there will always be an ache in my heart I will never get across.She was that inspiration to me. She was the one with whom I could just, just\u2026It will be better if left undefined. She\u2019s still within me I know. Each time I think of her it ends up leaving me broken. I wish that could have saved. She passed away leaving everything behind. I miss you. [ The most shocking thing for me was that when I woke up before that incident happened I had a nightmare where I saw her leaving everything behind and I was praying hopefully this not to be true. But then there are things which gives you hint before its happening! ] ",

            "answer_text": "In May of 2013, the Stanford University neurosurgical resident Paul Kalanithi was diagnosed with Stage IV metastatic lung cancer. He was thirty-six years old. In his two remaining years\u2014he died in March of 2015\u2014he continued his medical training, became the father to a baby girl, and wrote beautifully about his experience facing mortality as a doctor and a patient. In this excerpt from his posthumously published memoir, \u201cWhen Breath Becomes Air,\u201d which is out on January 12th, from Random House, Kalanithi writes about his last day practicing medicine. I hopped out of the CT scanner, seven months since I had returned to surgery. This would be my last scan before finishing residency, before becoming a father, before my future became real. \u201cWanna take a look, Doc?\u201d the tech said. \u201cNot right now,\u201d I said. \u201cI\u2019ve got a lot of work to do today.\u201d It was already 6 P.M. I had to go see patients, organize tomorrow\u2019s O.R. schedule, review films, dictate my clinic notes, check on my post-ops, and so on. Around 8 P.M., I sat down in the neurosurgery office, next to a radiology viewing station. I turned it on, looked at my patients\u2019 scans for the next day\u2014two simple spine cases\u2014and, finally, typed in my own name. I zipped through the images as if they were a kid\u2019s flip-book, comparing the new scan to the last. Everything looked the same, the old tumors remained exactly the same \u2026 except, wait. I rolled back the images. Looked again. There it was. A new tumor, large, filling my right middle lobe. It looked, oddly, like a full moon having almost cleared the horizon. Going back to the old images, I could make out the faintest trace of it, a ghostly harbinger now brought fully into the world. I was neither angry nor scared. It simply was. It was a fact about the world, like the distance from the sun to the Earth. I drove home and told [my wife,] Lucy. It was a Thursday night, and we wouldn\u2019t see [my oncologist] Emma again until Monday, but Lucy and I sat down in the living room, with our laptops, and mapped out the next steps: biopsies, tests, chemotherapy. The treatments this time around would be tougher to endure, the possibility of a long life more remote. T. S. Eliot once wrote, \u201cBut at my back in a cold blast I hear / the rattle of the bones, and chuckle spread from ear to ear.\u201d Neurosurgery would be impossible for a couple of weeks, perhaps months, perhaps forever. But we decided that all of that could wait to be real until Monday. Today was Thursday, and I\u2019d already made tomorrow\u2019s O.R. assignments; I planned on having one last day as a resident. As I stepped out of my car at the hospital, at five-twenty the next morning, I inhaled deeply, smelling the eucalyptus and \u2026 was that pine? Hadn\u2019t noticed that before. I met the resident team, assembled for morning rounds. We reviewed overnight events, new admissions, new scans, then went to see our patients before M. & M., or morbidity and mortality conference, a regular meeting in which the neurosurgeons gathered to review mistakes that had been made and cases that had gone wrong. Afterward, I spent an extra couple of minutes with a patient, Mr. R. He had developed a rare syndrome, called Gerstmann\u2019s, where, after I\u2019d removed his brain tumor, he\u2019d begun showing several specific deficits: an inability to write, to name fingers, to do arithmetic, to tell left from right. I\u2019d seen it only once before, as a medical student, eight years ago, on one of the first patients I\u2019d followed on the neurosurgical service. Like him, Mr. R. was euphoric\u2014I wondered if that was part of the syndrome that no one had described before. Mr. R. was getting better, though: his speech had returned almost to normal, and his arithmetic was only slightly off. He\u2019d likely make a full recovery. The morning passed, and I scrubbed for my last case. Suddenly the moment felt enormous. My last time scrubbing? Perhaps this was it. I watched the suds drip off my arms, then down the drain. I entered the O.R., gowned up, and draped the patient, making sure the corners were sharp and neat. I wanted this case to be perfect. I opened the skin of his lower back. He was an elderly man whose spine had degenerated, compressing his nerve roots and causing severe pain. I pulled away the fat until the fascia appeared and I could feel the tips of his vertebrae. I opened the fascia and smoothly dissected the muscle away, until only the wide, glistening vertebrae showed up through the wound, clean and bloodless. The attending wandered in as I began to remove the lamina, the back wall of the vertebrae, whose bony overgrowths, along with ligaments beneath, were compressing the nerves. \u201cLooks good,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you want to go to today\u2019s conference, I can have the fellow come in and finish.\u201d My back was beginning to ache. Why hadn\u2019t I taken an extra dose of nsaids beforehand? This case should be quick, though. I was almost there. \u201cNaw,\u201d I said. \u201cI want to finish the case.\u201d The attending scrubbed in, and together we completed the bony removal. He began to pick away at the ligaments, beneath which lay the dura, which contained spinal fluid and the nerve roots. The most common error at this stage is tearing a hole in the dura. I worked on the opposite side. Out of the corner of my eye, I saw near his instrument a flash of blue\u2014the dura starting to peek through. \u201cWatch out!\u201d I said, just as the mouth of his instrument bit into the dura. Clear spinal fluid began to fill the wound. I hadn\u2019t had a leak in one of my cases in more than a year. Repairing it would take another hour. \u201cGet the micro set out,\u201d I said. \u201cWe have a leak.\u201d By the time we finished the repair and removed the compressive soft tissue, my shoulders burned. The attending broke scrub, offered his apologies and said his thanks, and left me to close. The layers came together nicely. I began to suture the skin, using a running nylon stitch. Most surgeons used staples, but I was convinced that nylon had lower infection rates, and we would do this one, this final closure, my way. The skin came together perfectly, without tension, as if there had been no surgery at all. Good. One good thing. As we uncovered the patient, the scrub nurse, one with whom I hadn\u2019t worked before, said, \u201cYou on call this weekend, Doc?\u201d \u201cNope.\u201d And possibly never again. \u201cGot any more cases today?\u201d \u201cNope.\u201d And possibly never again. \u201cShit, well, I guess that means this is a happy ending! Work\u2019s done. I like happy endings, don\u2019t you, Doc?\u201d \u201cYeah. Yeah, I like happy endings.\u201d I sat down by the computer to enter orders as the nurses cleaned and the anesthesiologists began to wake the patient. I had always jokingly threatened that when I was in charge, instead of the high-energy pop music everyone liked to play in the O.R., we\u2019d listen exclusively to bossa nova. I put \u201cGetz/Gilberto\u201d on the radio, and the soft, sonorous sounds of a saxophone filled the room. I left the O.R. shortly after, then gathered my things, which had accumulated over seven years of work\u2014extra sets of clothes for the nights you don\u2019t leave, toothbrushes, bars of soap, phone chargers, snacks, my skull model and collection of neurosurgery books, and so on. On second thought, I left my books behind. They\u2019d be of more use here. On my way out to the parking lot, a fellow approached to ask me something, but his pager went off. He looked at it, waved, turned, and ran back in to the hospital\u2014\u201cI\u2019ll catch you later!\u201d he called over his shoulder. Tears welled up as I sat in the car, turned the key, and slowly pulled out into the street. I drove home, walked through the front door, hung up my white coat, and took off my I.D. badge. I pulled the battery out of my pager. I peeled off my scrubs and took a long shower. Later that night, I called [my co-resident] Victoria and told her I wouldn\u2019t be in on Monday, or possibly ever again, and wouldn\u2019t be setting the O.R. schedule. \u201cYou know, I\u2019ve been having this recurring nightmare that this day was coming,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t know how you did this for so long.\u201d Via Garima Trivedi ",
