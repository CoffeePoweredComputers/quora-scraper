            "answer_text": "Far too long and complicated for a Quora answer. I can recommend an excellent book if you want to pursue it yourself - A History of Fireworks This is a very comprehensive book that covers it from ancient times up to the 1960s, since when the later history of fireworks can be summed up as \u201cthe Chinese took over the entire world market and all the old companies folded\u201d. There are many pictures and descriptions of how fireworks are (were?) made, and some formulae. I found this book in the library when I was a teenager and later purchased it for myself. As you can see, it\u2019s been well read and is one of my favorite reference works.  Sorry, I can\u2019t link to a place where you can actually get it because then Quora will collapse my answer for spamming. But perhaps you too can find it in a library. ",
