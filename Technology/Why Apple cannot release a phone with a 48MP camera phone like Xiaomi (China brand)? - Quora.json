            "answer_text": "You will never be able to see a 48mp image at all in your life. After 12 megapixels, what you gain are image dimensions and not quality. In fact, 48 megapixels is enough to cover your entire house front face wall. The optimal size + quality is around 12 megapixels. Which is the reason why iPhone is sticking to it. And if in the future they increase the resolution, it will be only for marketing purposes. Next the math: Nearly all \u201cscreen displays\u201d for smartphones, computers, and TV sets are around 2 megapixels. Multiply the width and height to reach that number. This means that without zooming a photo, you always watch all your photos and videos at 2 megapixels or even under. Special mention for 4K displays which translates to 8.3 megapixels. The reason why 12 megapixels is the optimal size, is because if you zoom 6 times a 12 megapixels photo being displayed in a 2 megapixels screen, then you will reach 12 megapixels. And zooming 6 times is more than enough to see the pores of your skin. The reason why manufacturers sell more megapixels, is because they take advantage of users ignorance. Is very easy for the human brain to believe that \u201cmore\u201d megapixels means more quality, only because the word \u201cmore\u201d, and a larger number. In the end, nobody cares how many megapixels has your photo., because they will always look at it in a 2 megapixels display. What\u2019s important in a photo is the subject, the content, the idea, and is super size dimensions in case you wish to cover your entire house front face wall. Keep this in mind: more megapixels doesn\u2019t make anyone a better photographer. You can can take the best photo in the world even with 2 megapixels. And never forget that the amazing photos you see in magazines such as national geographic, newspapers, websites, blogs, etc., if you compute their dimensions they are printed at between 0.5 to 1 megapixels.

            "answer_text": "Good afternoon, Apple can release a phone with a 48 MP Camera like Mi or Nokia PureView or the Huawei Mate. However, it may not do it. Why you ask ? Of course, you already did. Here is the answer: Lets see the Flagship phones from top Smartphone makers in 2019: 1. Samsung Galaxy - S10  It has a 12 MP Primary Camera (With 2 other cameras but that isnt the point) 2. OnePlus 6T  It has a 16 MP Primary Camera Enough of examples. My point is that there is more to a camera than just the Mega Pixels. Consider the below sentence: Samsung Galaxy S 10 - 12 MP Camera Moto G5 Plus - 12 MP Camera In your point of view, you would choose a Samsung S10 if i was willing to give you one just like that. Why ? Its because you know that the photos on a Samsung S10 are far better than the Moto G5 Plus. The Camera Sensor Camera Lens Components Autofocus type (PDAF, Lazer etc) Image processing software Flash (LED, Truetone, Simple, Xenon etc) ..and a whole bunch of stuff packed in to that one tiny little Camera unit. The best answer is this: iPhone 7 Plus - 12 MP Camera (Launched in 2016) Would your answer still be to choose a Samsung S 10 ? No, maybe not. Its because the Dual Camera setup on the iPhone is the best you have seen for Portrait shots on a smartphone camera. Nobody could even tell that it was not clicked on a DSLR. In 2016, the other smartphone makers followed suit but their cameras only apply a Filter-like effect which you can get by installing an app on a single camera smartphone too (I mean, Editing apps) 48MP is not a benchmark of the quality of a photograph taken from a phone. Redmi Note 7 Pro doesnt really have a 48MP Camera Sensor. It gives you that output by using Pixel Binning Read more about it here: https://www.digit.in/mobile-phones/explained-pixel-binning-in-smartphone-camera-sensors-43278.html Besides, Apple doesn\u2019t focus only on the Camera part of a smartphone. It takes its time and gets the job done. Quality is what they are after and they do it year after year. Disclaimer: I am not endorsing or supporting any brand, product or logo. It is just a comparison shown in the answer by way of photos of the Smartphone in reference. Have a great day ",
