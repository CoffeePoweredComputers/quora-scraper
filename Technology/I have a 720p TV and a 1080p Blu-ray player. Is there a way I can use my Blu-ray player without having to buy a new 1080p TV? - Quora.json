            "answer_text": "If the two devices are connected with HDMI then your bluray player will ask the TV what format it can accept and output that. Some 720p TVs actually accept 1080p and can downscale but also your Bluray player should happily downscale without much effort. Every device these days has an up-scaler and a down-scaler, not all blurays are actually 1080p and a blu-ray can play DVDs (which are SD) so it can upscale as well. Don\u2019t worry, plug it in and watch the magic. I would be shocked if it didn\u2019t work. ",

            "answer_text": "Absolutely you can. As described by others here, just set your max resolution output to 720p in the Blu-ray player settings. I\u2019ve even used a Blu-ray player with an SD display, which you\u2019d think would defeat the purpose, but the downscaled image was actually very impressive. ",
