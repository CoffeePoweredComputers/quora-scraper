            "answer_text": "How to Switch SIM Cards This wikiHow teaches you how to install a new SIM card in your iPhone or Android. SIM cards allow your phone to work on a specific carrier's network, such as Verizon or AT&T. In order to use a SIM card from a carrier that's different than your current one, your phone must be carrier unlocked. Method One of Three: Preparing to Switch Cards See if your phone is unlocked. Many phones are \"carrier locked\", meaning that they cannot be used with any other carrier's SIM cards. You can unlock your iPhone or Android if you meet the proper criteria, which depend on your carrier. If your phone is already unlocked, you should be able to use other carriers' SIM cards in your phone. Buy a new SIM card. You can usually find SIM cards for specific carriers (e.g., AT&T) in the carriers' respective stores, as well as online and in most tech shops. Your phone most likely takes a specific size of SIM card, so check the SIM card's supported phones before buying it. If you aren't sure of the SIM card that you card: iPhone - Press and hold the Lock button on the side of the phone, then swipe the slide to power off switch to the right when prompted. Android - Press and hold the Power button on the side of the phone, then tap Power off when prompted. Remove your phone's case. If you have an external case on your phone, take it off before you attempt to find the SIM tray, as the SIM tray is integrated directly into the phone's housing. Method Two of Three: On iPhone Locate the SIM tray. On any functioning iPhone, the SIM tray is below the Lock button on the right edge of the phone; it resembles a thin, oval cut-out with a hole in it. If you're attempting to remove an iPad's SIM card, you'll usually find the SIM tray at the bottom of the right edge of the tablet, though the iPad 3 and 4 have the SIM tray near the top-left corner. Eject the SIM tray. Insert a bent paperclip, a needle, or a similarly thin object into the hole near the bottom of the SIM tray and gently push until the tray pops out. Remove the old SIM card from the tray. You can gently lift out the card from the tray, or you can turn the tray over and allow the card to fall onto a soft surface (e.g., a towel). Make sure that you don't touch the gold connectors on the bottom of the SIM card. Place the new SIM card in the tray. The SIM card should only fit one way into the tray: the angled edge should be in the top-right corner of the tray. Insert the tray back into the phone. It should click back into place, at which point the back of the SIM tray should be flush with the body of the phone. Turn back on your iPhone. Press the Lock button to do so. After your iPhone finishes restarting, you may be prompted to enter your Apple ID password. If you set a SIM PIN for your phone, you'll have to enter it before you can use your phone on your carrier's network. Method Three of Three: On Android Locate your Android's SIM slot. Android phones tend to have SIM card slots in different locations depending on the manufacturer, so it's best to research your specific model of phone to determine where the SIM slot is. Common spots include the following: Samsung - Top edge of the phone. Huawei - Bottom-right or bottom-left edge of the phone. LG - Top, left, or right edge of the phone. Some LGs, such as the G4, have the SIM card buried below the memory card, which is below the battery in the back of the case. Remove the battery if necessary. If your Android requires you to remove the battery, do so by removing the back of the case and then gently prying up the battery. The SIM card may be hidden below the memory card in the back of the case. Eject the SIM tray. Insert a bent paperclip, a needle, or a similarly thin object into the hole near the bottom of the SIM tray and gently push until the tray pops out. If your SIM tray is in the back of the phone, use your fingernails to gently pull it out of its slot instead. If there isn't a hold near the bottom of the SIM tray, try pressing the SIM tray into the phone and then releasing it to prompt it to pop out. Remove the old SIM card from the tray. You can gently lift out the card from the tray, or you can turn the tray over and allow the card to fall onto a soft surface (e.g., a towel). Make sure that you don't touch the gold connectors on the bottom of the SIM card. Place the new SIM card in the tray. The SIM card should only fit one way into the tray: the angled edge should be in the top-right corner of the tray. Be sure to consult your specific phone's manual or online documentation if your experience here differs. Insert the tray back into the phone. It should snap back into place, and the back of the tray should be level with the body of the phone. If your SIM tray is located below the battery, the tray will lock into place after it reaches its proper depth. For phones with internal SIMs, you'll also have to replace the battery (and sometimes the memory card) and the back of the phone before proceeding. Turn back on your phone. Press the Power button to do so. Your phone should automatically begin working with your carrier, though you may have to enter a password or your SIM PIN (if you set one) before you can start using your phone.         ",
