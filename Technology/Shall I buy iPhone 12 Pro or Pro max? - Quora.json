I will be getting the iPhone 12 pro max because I have large hands so having a bigger phone will make it easier for me to use my phone. so it just depends on your personal preference and what your comfortable with some people prefer a larger phone some prefer a smaller phone it all just depends on personal interest. my advice to you is to do your research you don\u2019t want to pay hundreds of dollars for something you don\u2019t like. so take your time and view the other answers.

            "answer_text": "1st priority -Your Budget 2nd - Processor 3rd-Display (Camera quality has not much difference) If you compare 4G and 5G then there will be not much development in speed as there was in 4G after 3G . So Choice is yours if you want iPhone 12 or 11 pro max Overall iPhone 12 pro max is now best in the market with 5G and not big changes as Compared to 11 pro max But the flat edges looks great and nothing much difference So Choice is yours depending on the budget I do suggest you to watch some comparison videos on YouTube Channels :- Everything apple pro ,Unbox Therapy,etc. PURCHASE from Apple Online store or apple reseller store .It will be good else choice is Yours.
