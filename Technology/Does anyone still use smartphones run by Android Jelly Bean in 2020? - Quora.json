            "answer_text": "NO. We cannot use jelly bean in 2020. Because : Generally, apps on android are run by Java virtual machine. ( Which is developed by Oracle). and this Java virtual machine consists the set of libraries which supports the app to run. Since marshmellow was released, the older versions of android used \u201cDalvik Virtual Machine\u201d and later from marshmellow, android used New and updated virtual machine called \u201cAndroid run time\u201d . So, when the developers code for the apps past marshmellow, they uses old version SDK(Software Development Kit) and newer version of SDK for newer android version apps. Also, On the later versions, google introduced a new permission API so that, when ever an app is installed, it prompts user permissions for accessing storage, camera and etc. But, there is so such kind of feature in older versions. In a nutshell, if a developer uses the older set of libraries and Older SDK version in their app, it can be run on Older version. I hope I cleared your doubt. ",

            "answer_text": "What ! Who the heck wants to use an outdated version of the android OS, Which is now running on version 10, manufacturers are building their android versions to push update on their devices . The answer is No . This is primarily because even if one wants to use android jelly bean in phone with latest hardware , this will be just nonsense , the hardware will be under-utilised and the security for the phone will be very crucial and apps will not be supported , even you will not able to download and run apps , as developers are now developing apps from future perspective so that they can update them faster.when we are going for android 10, why would someone care about the version of android, that is outdated and has no- scope to get updates.
