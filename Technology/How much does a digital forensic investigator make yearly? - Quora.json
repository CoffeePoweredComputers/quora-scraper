            "answer_text": "You need to look at compensation tables like Glassdoor, Payscale, in your target area to get a better understanding of your particular market. Sites with \u201cfree information\u201d tend to be overly generous while sites that involve pay as you go or subscription services such as ADP are highly accurate because they track career pay by actual employer payrolls. Nothing like going to the source. Keep in mind that digital forensics is meost likely going to be found in major metropolitan cities and state governments where salaries may appear at first glance quite respectable until you break down the cost of living. Always take into consideration the local market in IT as living in a major metropolitan area like Chicago or New York comes at a significant expense when your looking at hundreds, if not thousands in additional hidden costs, such as the 120 dollar annual fee in Chicago to own your own vehicle types of taxes, etc. Using the investigators favorite tool of all, the \u201csearch engine\u201d, I immediately found a site that should answer your remaining questions.
