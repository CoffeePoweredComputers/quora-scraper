            "answer_text": "To build the Great Pyramid of Giza today, would be extremely expensive. It would also be a complete waste of time and money. It would certainly be doable. It could possibly be completed faster than the original pyramids. However, the cost would be astronomical. Material Cost The Great Pyramid was originally constructed with about 8.2 million limestone blocks that weighed 6\u201310 tons each. The pharaohs who commissioned the pyramids owned the quarries where the blocks were being cut. They owned the boats that were taking them up and down the river. Today, you\u2019d have to purchase all of that material. How much do the blocks themselves cost? According to Ali Baba, you can purchase wholesale limestone blocks for $220-$240 per ton. Let\u2019s assume that\u2019s $230 per ton, and the blocks are an average of 8 tons each. That\u2019s $15,088,000,000 just for the raw material of the blocks. Over $15 billion just for the limestone blocks. There was also 8000 tons of granite and 500,000 tons of mortar. Labor Cost The original pyramids were mostly constructed by peasant farmers during the off-season. There\u2019s some argument about how much slave labor was used to build the pyramids. However, it is clear, that there was at least some slave labor. Do you know the hourly rate of stone masons today? Stone masons make about $19 per hour in the US on average. The stones in the pyramid are cast together almost perfectly. The measurement of error is about 1/50th of an inch, or half a millimeter. That\u2019s probably better than the average stone mason. That\u2019s a master of stone masonry. Plus you\u2019ll need several crane operators and other machinery specialists to transport and lift these stones. That\u2019s a pretty penny. Plus there are the quarry workers, the supervisors, the engineers, the project managers, the mortar/cement pourers, the contractors, the inspectors, and a whole host of other workers. Cost of Land The Great Pyramid is about 570,000 square feet at the base, or 53,000 square meters. That\u2019s over 13 acres of land. If you\u2019re putting it in downtown Giza, that\u2019s prime real estate. Why it would be so pointless The pyramids were an engineering marvel. The Great Pyramid was the tallest building in the world for almost 4000 years. That\u2019s amazing. However, the pyramids were also insanely over-designed. The ancient Egyptians didn\u2019t know nearly as much about structural engineering as we do today. They didn\u2019t have access to calculus or differential equations, let alone calculators or structural analysis finite element models. They didn\u2019t have cement or high strength concrete or structural steel. They didn\u2019t even have iron. Today we can create buildings that are almost 6 times as tall for a fraction of the above cost. We can use significantly less materials, and take up significantly less land. We can design buildings with oscillators to work with the frequency of an earthquake. We can design skyscrapers whose shape deflects wind, instead of big heavy buildings that resist the wind with it\u2019s sheer mass. Back then, they had the labor, materials, and time to build an engineering marvel. Today, we have the technology and engineering knowledge to build structures that are just as marvelous, but in a different way. Why would we waste labor, materials, and time trying to replicate something that civilization has already moved past? Why try to recreate the past when you can try to improve upon it? ",

            "answer_text": "There\u2019s a good study that\u2019s worth a read at : https://web.archive.org/web/20070608101037/http://www.pubs.asce.org/ceonline/0699feat.html This study applies critical path analysis to estimate the methods and length of time involved in building the Great Pyramid with ancient Egyptian technology - the authors suggested that a figure of around 10 years would be achievable. The pyramids themselves are relatively simple structures, with some complex architectural elements, such as the pressure-relieving chambers above the burial chamber (and possibly above the Grand Gallery, according to the recent Muon studies). The process of building was a triumph of organisation, and relied on skilled work gangs rather than the apocryphal \u201cslaves\u201d that are ever-present in 20th-Century dramas. If anything, the massive projects for Pyramid-building shows how powerful, organised and technical ancient peoples were, how as modern humans they are similar to ourselves in their ability to innovate, create and organise, even at lower levels of technology (Egyptians hadn\u2019t even mastered iron smelting until very late in their history). Technically it would be relatively easy to replicate the Great Pyramid - cutting blocks using mechanised tools, transporting them to the construction site with mechanised transport, and positioning them with cranes. However, it wouldn\u2019t be cheap - the cost of the machines, labour, fuel and logistics would be enormous. The time taken, and ease of construction, would of course depend on the amount of resources invested in the project, but we can say with confidence that with a similar level of contemporary resources thrown at the project compared with the original construction, the time taken would be considerably shorter - however, that doesn\u2019t account for factors such as the level of bureaucracy associated with modern construction compared with the ancients. One could argue that we would simply never be allowed to build a structure like the Pyramids today ",
