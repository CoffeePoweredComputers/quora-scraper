To learn a foreign language is something absolutely wonderful, and if you are an American, it will help you get out of this crazy America centred idea which is so common. (Just to avoid you getting me wrong, I adore this country and go there every year.) Sorry, I got a bit off the subject. English is obviously the language. Other languages could be useful if you want to move to the language area or find clients there. ",

            "answer_text": "If you would learn computer languages you should learn a 2nd or 3rd human languages. It only helps you learn concepts/words/phrase placement/efficiencies everything to do with a computer language becomes easier when you learn another language. I learned a couple of languages as a child, then a number of computer languages learned in college, then five more human languages as a consultant/living and working in foreign countries for a few years at a time. Every language was easier as worked in different foreign counties. There\u2019s your marching orders -learn as many languages (computer and human) as you can while young. Good luck ",
