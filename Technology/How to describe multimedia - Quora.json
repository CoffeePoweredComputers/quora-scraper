            "answer_text": "Multimedia, or Multi-media is literally many mediums. Multi, meaning many or at the very least more than one. And media meaning medium, meaning the thing, or things you use. For example: Ink, clay and paint are different mediums or media, and if you can paint a picture, sculpt in clay, and do calligraphy with ink, you are able to work in or on Multi-media. In today's world this term generally is associated with the many digital media technologies and design and development skills needed to work across all those platforms. A multi-media designer should therefore be able to work across many disciplines of design and media. ",
