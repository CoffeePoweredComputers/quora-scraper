            "answer_text": "Some satellites are used for communications and some of these communications satellites actually do provide internet connectivity. If you live far out in the back woods back country, like in the mountains of Colorado or Wyoming or Utah, you might not have land-based internet services available. In that case you could purchase Internet service from a satellite company. If you purchase from a satellite company, you would get a dish, like the dish for Dish Network satellite TV service and that would hook up to your computer providing internet service that is transmitted through a relay on the satellite. Many more satellites provide television and voice communication. There are satellite phone services you can purchase that will allow you to talk over a satellite phone anywhere on the globe \u2014 far out to sea or in the deepest rain forests of South America or out in the middle of the Sahara Desert. Other satellites take various forms of images from space, pictures as you see when you use Google Earth. These imaging satellites are used to do scientific research and watch changes on the Earth. These are vary valuable sources of pictures because from some satellites you can see most of a hemisphere of the Earth in one picture view. They use those to look at cloud patterns. So when you see a weather map showing a hurricane from above, that picture is likely from a satellite. There are lots of other specific technical and research oriented uses for satellites. There are so many satellites in orbit that the geostationary belt, an equatorial ring around the Earth at a high altitude is so full of satellites that they have to park them and arrange years ahead to obtain a place for a new satellite in the Geostationary belt. See the picture here which shows how tightly parked are the Geostationary satellites -> What Is a Geosynchronous Orbit? ",

            "answer_text": "Weather forecasting, resource monitoring, communications, TV broadcasts, surveillance, other military programs and scientific research. That covers most of the options at a very broad level. There are quite a few astronomy satellites up there. There are 4 at least partially complete GPS-type constellations from USA, Russia, China and Europe. Lots and lots of military programs covering photography, comms, monitoring for missile launches, various SIGINT payloads and specific weather satellites. There\u2019s a coral monitoring program using Dove satellites, other satellites keep track of ice levels and breakaways at the poles as well as floods, major fires, rainfall, sea levels and crop coverage and quality. There are geostationary satellites available for 1-way or 2-way comms (Australian ambulances have a distress system linked to geostationary satellites) and for TV transmission. There are satellites monitoring the sun to give early warning of CMEs (coronal mass ejections) that could damage power transmission systems on Earth. There are satellites that carry out research on the effects of zero gravity and radiation on insects, plants and small animals. And now we have the beginnings of satellite based Internet which has authorisation to launch up to 42,000 satellites. It\u2019s not a subscriber service yet, but it will be at some point. ",
