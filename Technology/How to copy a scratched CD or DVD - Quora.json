            "answer_text": "How to Repair Scratched DVD The foremost way to repair minor scratches is by using soda toothpaste or wax. Remember to apply the baking soda toothpaste instead of gel-based toothpaste. Gently apply a small amount of toothpaste or use wax to rub the scratches, after which you can rinse with warm water and keep it dry naturally. Secondly, you can consider using eyeglass cleaner to remove the scratches on a DVD. I suggest you use a glass moping cloth to conduct the job as it is microfiber and will not leave any textile on the DVD after you wipe it. Also keep in mind that you need to rub the scratches from center outward instead of in a circle way. The last but certainly not least, you can try metal polish. You can apply a small amount of the polish to a soft, lint-free cloth and gently rub on the scratched areas of the DVD. Wipe off excess polish and allow the rest to dry. This can be done to make some scratches shallower. CD Recovery Toolbox can recover the data on a scratched DVD. Then you can use a DVD copy software to copy the scratched DVD, such as Leawo Blu-ray Copy. From: Copy from Scratched DVD ",

            "answer_text": "I cannot answer for DVDs but the way with CDs is . The actual information is in the reverse side of the aluminium label,and not in the perspex disk at all. It is just the transparent carrier. If possible polish the disc to remove the scratch using a metal polish like brasso ,which contains a fine abrasive. This might be sufficient. Even nail varnish remover, which is actually acetone ,and disolves perspex might help fill a deep gouge. Then you can play the disc in a computer drive and run the program Exact Audio Copy available free for PCs. This reads and re reads the disc and can recover a lot of the data. CDs have error detection data built in and this program examines the bit patterns. ",
