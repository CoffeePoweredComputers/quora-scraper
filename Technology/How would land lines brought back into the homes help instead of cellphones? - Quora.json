            "answer_text": "As other people have answered the redundancy side I\u2019ll pass on that. However, the other benefit could be to reduce the amount of traffic from devices, which is often the issue when people are trying to use their phones in mass gatherings such as marches or venues.A less likely, yet more worrying benefit is that a wireless signal can easily be tapped into if the person intercepting knows what they\u2019re doing. Having your landline wire-tapped is possible but very unlikely as its more of a physical process rather than a digital one. ",

            "answer_text": "Maybe a landline could help combined with cellphones. A landline could provide redundancy, if a car crashed into your local cell site or was destroyed by a wildfire, you could still receive calls via landline. Or your cellphone drops, disabling it. A landline would be of more use in remote areas where cell reception is poor or nonexistent. ",
