            "answer_text": "A computer in the modern meaning is a programmable automated computing device. What I mean is that even if it is not truly general-purpose and/or its instruction set is not Turing complete, in order to call a device \"computer\" I would require it to be reasonably multi-purpose (to be able to automatically perform a large number of different computations according to its programming). In that regard, things like the Antikythera mechanism are not really computers (but incidentally, the Antikythera mechanism is the oldest known machine using gears). Blaise Pascal's pascaline is also \"just\" a mechanical calculator. I think the earliest designed real computer in the modern meaning would be Charles Babbage's analytical engine, which uses programs stored on punched cards and supported things like loops and conditional branching. It was never built due to funding problems but Babbage had drawn complete blueprints and there is little doubt it would work if it were to be built. The earliest actual computers which were actually built and used are probably the first electrical computers (both digital and analogue) in the 1940s. ",

            "answer_text": "It depends on what you consider a computer to be. Early devices such as the Antikythera Mechanism, the slide rule, and Pascal's adding machine were actually calculating devices. They could only do one thing and could not be reprogrammed to do anything else without taking them apart and rebuilding them a different way. They were precursors to the modern computer. Charles Babbage devised the first programmable computing machine, called the Analytical Engine. His friend Ada Augusta Byron King, Countess of Lovelace, wrote the first program for it. He got the idea from programmable Jacquard looms, which could be programmed with punched cards to weave different patterns in cloth. Babbage's cards could be changed to make the Analytical Engine calculate different things. Unfortunately, the machine was never built in his lifetime. In the 1930s, more sophisticated analog computers were built to work on more complicated calculation problems. The Manchester Analyzer was built to solve differential equations. But like the slide rule, these devices could really only do one thing The modern computer, in which the program code is stored in the same memory as the data, was devised by mathematician John von Neumann during World War II. All modern digital computers are technically called \"von Neumann stored-program digital computers\" to distinguish them from earlier kinds. Personally, I believe the Analytical Engine was the first \"real\" computer, but I recognize the contributions of those who built calculating machines before that. ",
