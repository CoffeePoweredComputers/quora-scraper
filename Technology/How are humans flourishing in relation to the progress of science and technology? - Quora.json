            "answer_text": "I\u2019d say the professional and business relationship has flourish handsomely while the personal relationships has become very ugly and hard to maintain in this age of science and technology. That\u2019s because unlike back in the day, personal relationship is no longer necessary for maintaining life. Back in the days, you can\u2019t just go to a restaurant to eat or go to a car dealer to fix your car. You need someone who knows how to cook and fix things. That is the reason why marriage was so successful back then because it was a necessity. Cause back then, money can\u2019t buy everything. Nowadays, money can. Why? Because nowadays, the world is run by industry. From things like fixing your car to things like cooking, the industry world has created survives for everything on demand. All you have to do is pay. Which is why money has become so important today than before because it allows you to do more things today than before. But because people no longer need their personal relationship to survive, they more often than not, will leave it as soon as there is a sign of discontent. That is why marriage has failed miserably over the past few decades. Cause marriage is no longer a necessity but a luxury. If you ask me though, I think it is a good thing. No longer are we required to stay with someone we hate out of necessity. Marriages that last are marriages that are truly meant to be and not simply out of necessity. It is paved the way for people to pursue their desire instead of settling because of scarcity. ",
