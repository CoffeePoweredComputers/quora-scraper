            "answer_text": "Publishing encompasses a number of very diverse activities which in the past were tied together by the common thread of printing and binding something on paper. Starting from there and considering last 10 years, following are the major innovations: Blogging (Easy production and distribution) Blogging is publishing. Consider what a single person looking to bring out a small booklet for his community would do in past. He would typeset it, print it and distribute it by hand. Now he can blog it and disseminate it all over the world. Starting a newspaper of your own? Vertical/niche magazine? Blogging has brought a major change in all those publishing ventures. Print on Demand (Easy production) Digital printing and print on demand has been a major change for publishing. It has made publishing a much less capital intensive business by removing the need to print excess inventory. It has also allowed for a lot for experimentation by making the production part flexible. see http://lightningsource.com http://createspace.com Online Retailing (Wider distribution and easier discovery) Online retailing started with books and has changed the shape of the industry. It allows a much wider reach, breaks down the stronghold of distributors (replacing them with retailers though!) and also makes the backlists a lot more useful. Combined with print-on-demand, it allows for a ever living backlist which can be easily discovered by people. E-readers (Kindle) and Tablets Kindle for the first time made the e-books viable. There were e-readers before it but combining its huge presence in physical book market and its prowess in technology, Amazon was able to create a unprecedented smooth experience for e-book consumption. As a result they have finally taken off. Digital replacements Many of the publishing domains have been overtaken by their digital counterparts that no longer look like books. Maps, encyclopedias are two examples. Cookbooks are getting there. eBooks The elephant in the room. But given the gradual development and the fact that eBooks are essentially HTML/CSS wrapped up with some metadata, it is hard to pinpoint an innovation here. As the web standards have matured and devices for consumption have proliferated, eBooks have seen good uptake. Till now there have only been occasional efforts to build eBooks that are not simply a copy or spruced up versions of physical content. Self Publishing Self Publishing is not an innovation in itself since it has always been around but self publishers have been the early adopters of many of these innovations and have reaped rich benefits. e-books and print-on-demand have made it possible for individuals to publish books at no cost at all. Result have been a huge surge in the number of self published titles. Many of them have seen good success as well thus fueling the trend further. See http://lulu.com http://smashwords.com http://pothi.com (I'm a co-founder) Innovations in production tool chains Given that the content is now consumed in variety of formats, a flexible and efficient tool chain is required to produce all those formats. At the minimum you want PDF, Mobi, ePub. Then you may also want a web version for reading in browser. A chunked version for selling in parts or for serializing.  XML has been one of the solutions - you mark up the content in XML once and then let the tools generate all the formats. Many technical publishers have been early adopters of this. However XML authoring is painful and requires trained manpower. Since most ebook formats are HTML and CSS underneath and CSS has been getting better at the print related stuff as well, there is a new crop of tools that allow direct authoring in HTML/CSS. This has the advantage that you can lean on all the cool web technologies and have much nicer authoring environments. This reduces the need of upfront training and the need for the error prone conversion to XML. Corrections and revisions are also easier since editors and authors can also work on the same formatted manuscirpt. See http://pressbooks.com  http://inkling.com/habitat  http://instascribe.com (I'm a co-founder) There is also a new crop of tools for creating interactive e-books. Children's books are getting funkier and have animations, audio, video and more powerful authoring tools are a must. See http://mangoreader.com/ http://www.talespring.com/ These are the broad trends I see. There are of course a lot of very cool startups trying everything from crowd funded publishing to e-book lending to subscription based services for e-books to marketplaces for publishing services. Most of them are trying to fill in one or the other need generated by one of the broad trends above. ",
