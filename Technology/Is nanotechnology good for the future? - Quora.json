            "answer_text": "Nanotechnology is a broad term that covers many areas of science, research and technology. In its most basic form, it can be described as working with things that are small. Things so tiny that they can't be seen with standard microscopes. In the last decade, nanotechnology has advanced and is finding practical applications. Some teams are developing nanoscale patterns on medical implants that can stimulate bone cell growth and positive gene expression. Others are working to make guided nanoparticles that detect (and even destroy) cancer cells. Many benefits of nanotechnology depend on the fact that it is possible to tailor the structures of materials at extremely small scales to achieve specific properties, thus greatly extending the materials science toolkit. Using nanotechnology, materials can effectively be made stronger, lighter, more durable, more reactive, more sieve-like, or better electrical conductors, among many other traits. In many ways nanotechnology going to bring changes in the future. It's in our hands how we make the good future with nanotechnology. future of nanotechnology will be good. From start it's always been in our hands how we choose to use technology for better. ",

            "answer_text": "actually nanotechnology is the future. every core engineering is now going to nano level for enhancing there output. in case of materials the material strength were so much high at nano level. similarly the structure were also very fine at nano level. basic examples came to our mind will be of mobile phones batteries which were compacting day by day and there capacity were enhancing because of nanotechnology.
