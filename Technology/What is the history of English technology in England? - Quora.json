            "answer_text": "Where does one start? This is such a vast subject that it cannot be done justice in a standard Quora response, it needs several books! You ought to refine your question, including not simply what types of technology, but also what you mean by England and English? The English settlement started in the fifth century and became fully established by the seventh. England was not fully developed as a polity until the tenth to eleventh centuries. Some, wrongly, attribute the nouns of England and English, and the adjective English, to mean the place and peoples of either (or both) the Island of Great Britain or the sovereign nation of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. These definitions are incredibly important if you wish to receive a response which is factual, accurate and/or useful. ",
