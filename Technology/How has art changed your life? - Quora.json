            "answer_text": "Before I can speak about how art has changed my life, I must share something about art which stuck with ever since I heard it: art makes life bearable. As for how it has changed me, first I have to admit it has always been with me just as it is with every child. Every child is an artist. But unfortunately we lose it mostly because of the disciplinarian trend in education we are subjected to. So it would be fair to say art actually shapes us to start with. Later in life some re-discover it and I think they are enormously richer for having done so. As for me, I realised I was artistically inclined at a very young age, and continued to sketch and draw throughout my teenage years until finally I joined the art college. So you can guess everything in my life has had to do with art well into adulthood. But since then, it got interesting. After a few years being a full time painter in my early twenties, I finally began to expand my professional life and went into editing, design, journalism, you name it. At this time I was introduced to computers which to my surprise I actually took a liking to. In a few years I was into web designing and had already learned a few languages, yes, programming languages. Now, this is where anyone would say, stop, what can art possibly have in common with programming. Believe it or not, it has everything to do with programming. I learned programming on my own looking at it as any other language with syntax and grammar and so on. But overall, when you think of computer programs you are essentially creating a system. This is where the parallel with art comes in. For a system to work it must have an internal logic. Turns out it's the same for a work of art. The form and content of a work of art has to complement each other and there's always an internal logic, however outlandish it might be, it's the one that makes a work of art \"click\" in the viewer's mind. This is equally applicable for any other form of art: literature, movies, music and so on. So if you are asking me how art has changed my life, I will say it has not only changed me, it has made me who I am today! ",

            "answer_text": "As a child denied the use of crayons after age 10 to become an adult, and a young adult who was married and had sick children and an abusive husband, no art never impacted my life that I felt. Oh, I had pictures around the house, I encouraged my children in school in their art endeavors and hung all their achievements; refrigerator first, then walls. Then I divorced, and went to college at age 35 and had to take Art History as part of my curriculum. And lo, the gobbledegook the Prof spewed on the meaning of this piece and that sculpture did a high burn in my temper and I found myself arguing with him, in class and after. The man did a number on my homework, demanding papers he didn\u2019t from others about meanings of all sorts of things. The internet was still new, but I got on it and researched, went to the library and did more. And slowly I learned that art did have an impact on my life, I just didn\u2019t realize it. Let me continue a minute and then I\u2019ll wrap up. After graduating, I developed a heart condition that prevented me from working in the field I studied for, so I opened an in-home daycare. And one of the biggest, most welcome activities for the group was Art. We did all sorts of things; painting, color, drawing, sculpting, working with goop, glitter, string and glue. And more. I discovered letting these young souls, from age 6 months to 12 years experiment in their own way or follow instructions to put together a specific work of art was freeing and lovely, and the children were proud of their achievements, usually. Spurred on by their encouragement, I began coloring again and found I was filling a space in me that was empty. I began hanging my pieces to enjoy, and even purchased a few pieces of regular art; a poster or flowers, a wreath I made in blue and white with purple and white flowers in it, a celtic hanging and dozens of windchimes of all types that I put up in the ceiling. Dreamcatchers too, loving their form and feathers, especially the double ones. Now - and back then even - I began to look at art in appreciation. I read Angels and Demons by Dan Brown and learned more about art - yes, the book is full of it - and find myself buying clothing with art on it, not just the plain things I used to. Art has an impact on me by filling my life with color and shape. Without it the world would be just boxy and square, unimaginative and dull. My apartment would be beige; now it is purple and blue and yellow, red and green with celtic knots and moons and suns and mandalas and dolphins and coloring pictures, some cattails and even a paper mache sculpture of Stitch from the movie, made by my granddaughter. I would not live without art in my life now. ",
