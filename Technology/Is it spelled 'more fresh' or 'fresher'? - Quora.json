            "answer_text": "The most correct one to use would be \u201cfresher\u201d. To turn adjectives with one syllable into their comparative form, you just have to add -er. Therefore, it's reasonable that it should be \u201cfresher\u201d instead of \u201cmore fresh\u201d. But it doesn't mean \u201cmore fresh\u201d can't be used. If you want to emphasize, you can use \u201cmore fresh\u201d instead. Both still convey the same messge. ",

            "answer_text": "It should be fresher, but English, especially American English, is moving toward more in place of -er. Frankly, there is no rhyme or reason to which words get more and most versus -er and -est. I was surprised to learn remoter and remotest are considered correct, not more remote and most remote. ",
