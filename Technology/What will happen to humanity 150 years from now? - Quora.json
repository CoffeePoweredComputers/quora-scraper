In reality, a wide range of possible futures that evolve with the rhythm of the times opens up before us. The future of humanity is conditioned by the evolution of multiple factors. The most important strategic factors are those that depend on the actions developed by the human beings themselves. In 150 years, we can expect almost everything. It is up to us to prepare the future in advance so that later we do not have to suffer it, as our mediocre leaders accustom us. ",
