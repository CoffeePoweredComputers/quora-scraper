            "answer_text": "Isaac Newton said it best: \u201cI do not know what I may appear to the world, but to myself I seem to have been only like a boy playing on the seashore, and diverting myself in now and then finding a smoother pebble or a prettier shell than ordinary, whilst the great ocean of truth lay all undiscovered before me.\u201d A bit overstated, especially these days, where we have learned an enormous amount about how the world works and how to adapt that knowledge into useful technology, but still makes a good point. We know a lot, but there are things we don\u2019t even know we don\u2019t know. Think of science as a body of knowledge expanding irregularly into the universe of the unknown, some gulfs of ignorance still remaining, some voids of ignorance remaining even within the main body. We can really only identify things that \u201chaven\u2019t been figured out yet\u201d that are within sight of what we know. So we can name things like cures for cancers, complete cures or preventions for many infectious diseases, meaningful extension of healthy human lifespans, reliable genetic engineering, cyborg implants better than the original, easy space travel, easy interstellar travel, unified theories of physics, room temperature superconductors (including whether they are actually possible). The list is enormous. I would not, however, include \u201chow people can live in peace\u201d like another respondent mentioned. We already know how to do do that: just respect each other\u2019s individual rights to live by their own judgement, free from the initiation of physical force. Though we haven\u2019t yet figured out how to persuade the entire world of that simple principle! ",
