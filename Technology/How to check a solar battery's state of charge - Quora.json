Charge your battery full, inform the meter the battery is at 100% and tell the meter how many Ah your battery holds. The meter monitors the flow of current into and out of the battery, and adjusts the bar graph to show 0\u2013100% full. There are many similar devices on the market. The generic name for this kind of meter is a \u201ccoulomb counter\u201d or \u201ccoulomb meter\u201d ",

            "answer_text": "As a first approximation, the state of charge of a solar battery (a chemical battery for storing electricity generated by solar panels) can be checked by using a volt meter or multi-tester, as any battery would be tested for what its voltage is, how well it holds its charge etc. It would depend on the battery technology in question: lithium, lead-acid, matrix, or one of the newer exotic batteries. How do I check a solar battery's state of charge? ",
