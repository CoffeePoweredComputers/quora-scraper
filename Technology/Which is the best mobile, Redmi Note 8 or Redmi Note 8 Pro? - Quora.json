            "answer_text": "Redmi has been able to steadily and constantly create a solid consumer base for itself through the years since its inception. They were able to cement their presence with the release of their Note series. The Note 4 was a huge hit in the Indian markets and with their regular updates, Redmi was able to not only retain the original consumer base but increase it to exponential extents as well. Their recent successful launch with Redmi Note 8 and Redmi Note 8 Pro led to the question of which was the better smartphone of the two. Even a cursory glance at the specifications of both the phones will show a distinct difference between the two. The Note 8 Pro has better features in almost all aspects compared to its predecessor.  One of the major winning points of Note 8 Pro is the MediaTek Helio G90T processor. This chipset known as the Hyper Engine Game Technology for smartphones among other things boasts of vivid visuals and rapid sensing touch screens. The technology used in this chipset will allow for an extremely smooth experience for mobile game enthusiasts. This processor will support heavy-duty games for a long period of time which is a huge plus for the Note 8 Pro. Note 8, on the other hand, will not be able to deliver the same gaming experience to its consumers with the Qualcomm Snapdragon 665. Note 8 Pro has a (68 MP+8MP+2MP+2MP) quad rear cameras), 20MP front camera along with a 4500 mAh battery compared to the Note 8\u2019s (48MP+8MP+2MP+2MP) quad rear cameras, 16 MP front camera and 4000 mAh battery. Note 8 Pro also has a better RAM at 6 GB which is an upgrade from the 4GB RAM that Note 8 is equipped with. Overall there is no uncertainty that Redmi Note 8 Pro is the superior smartphone compared to Redmi Note 8. ",
