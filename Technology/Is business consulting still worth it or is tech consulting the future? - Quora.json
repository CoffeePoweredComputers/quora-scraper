            "answer_text": "Let\u2019s attempt to answer this with data and the assumption that the market is a fair predictor of worth. The image below shows that a big-3 consultant draws about a maximum of $600k revenue per year. Assuming a partner level at a healthy 80% utilisation comes to about $2,777 per day or roughly $350 an hour. A principal L7 at AWS Professional services or principal engineer at Google usually bills at $450-$500 an hour, with about 20 years of experience, sometimes less (anecdotal). The global tech firms in the image refer to the Accenture\u2019s and ATOS\u2019 of the world, not FAANG.  Image Source:Fees & rates ",
