            "answer_text": "No matter what type of business you run, if you handle any sort of data on a computer, you will have to think about electronic data destruction or hardware data destruction. If data wiping or shredding is not done correctly, it may result in a data breach or data leak. Many people believe that if a file is deleted, it\u2019s gone for good but the data from your deleted files stay on your computer and is very easy to recover. So, it is very important to hire a professional for the destruction of your electronics. E-Waste companies don\u2019t just ensure safer and more secure data destruction for their clients but also prevent our planet from getting harmed in the long run. ",
