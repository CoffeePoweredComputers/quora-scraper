            "answer_text": "Any answer to such a question can only be opinion and speculation. That said, science will continue to progress until there is a breakdown in what humans have come to rely upon as complex society. When the social-dependent-structure crumbles - population will drop rapidly - humans as a species may disappear\u2026if there is a survival element, certain technologies such as the miniaturization of electrical devices, information storage and processing, will likely be lost forever. Much will depend upon the rapidity of the collapse - and what trigger\u2019s it - one does not need to be a sage to appreciate the fragile nature of the present state of mankind. Previous generations have made it through difficult times by clinging to the hope of a better tomorrow. Many young parents now fear their children\u2019s lives may be short and harsh. The efforts of individuals and the accumulated knowledge of the last 100 years, will be largely lost when society breaks down. Those now in the later years of life, have witness unimaginable technological advances. We are still in our technological adolescence, there is much yet to discover, but it will likely be by a successor species. I am glad to have lived when and where I did, life has been a bounty - a prize worth living\u2026. it\u2019s been a good show, but it can\u2019t continue. The size and resources of the planet are limited, human fertility and greed are not. You and I are living in the last great days of a scientific apex. Once before, the grand human experiment built upon the free association of ideas, reached a peak \u2026about 2200 years past - reason and logic then gave way to book burning, ignorance and the oppression of ideas contrary to faith. Fortunately some of the great works survived - the Arab scribes had reproduced by hand copy a small fraction of the contents stored in the great library at Alexandrina. These were later available to the Western world, to evidence what had been lost. The destruction of our present way of live will be a much greater shock - consequently rebound to anything like the present complexity will be unlikely. ",

            "answer_text": "So\u2026 there are two opposing factors behind the development of new technologies. The first is an exponential growth in the number of humans (in particular educated humans), and therefore the number of humans who are doing research. As is often quoted there are more scientists alive and working at this moment than in all the history of humans before now put together. This increases the growth of science and technology (for as long as it lasts at least). The second is that it gets harder to make new discoveries as we go deeper and deeper into things. This is mitigated by the fact that new areas tend to open up, but this must eventually become an issue. It is doubtful that new physics is going to change our technology in the future as radically as the development of electricity an electronics have done, for example. It is possible that there could be radical new but easily applied discoveries in physics waiting to be made, for example, but we wouldn\u2019t expect it. These factors tend to limit the growth of new technology. Don\u2019t get me wrong \u2014 there are lots of new discoveries to make and areas to explore. There are going to be major discoveries in, for example, materials science, biotech, medicine and potentially quantum technologies for years to come. Technologies now coming on line will reshape things in ways we don\u2019t begin to grasp. We have far from drained science. The world in 50 years will be largely unrecognizable to us (for good or ill or, of course, both). But in 100, or 200, or 500 years we might start hitting diminishing returns in practical ways. But that is where the first factor might also let us down. There are exponentially increasing people in the world\u2026 though that has to level off (or catastrophically fall) in the not too distant future. And a smaller and smaller fraction of these people (especially in the so-called \u2018developed\u2019 countries) are deciding to study science and fewer and fewer resources are being devoted to pure research. If those trends continue then that growth too will wane at some point. I suspect that at one way or another we will see what we have seen in the past. A period of expansion ends with a period of plateau or collapse and reorganization. At some point society will change to the extent that our current drive to develop new technology will ebb. And perhaps start up again at some later point! Or we may just vanish, either wiping ourselves out or dropping out into virtual worlds which are so much easier to reshape! Nothing is certain except change. ",

Unlikely because - in a nutshell - the universe is like a sandbox in which you can always create ever larger and more complex things. I mean, in the future, as soon as we are able to create our own stars, we can try to make our own galaxies, and then more. \u2190 This is probably the answer you were looking for?We are unable to further technology because it is getting too hard. I don\u2019t think we\u2019d ever voluntarily stop developing technology for a different reason, because it is both useful and interesting.We are unable to further technology because the human race has died out. This is probably the most probable end-game here, since furthering technology probably also means furthering technology that has the potential to wipe out all humans. And once you\u2019re there, you know, you only need one nutcase to finish the job\u2026 (or maybe we go extinct because we can't spread to other planets fast enough and our planet eventually gets eaten by the sun)",
