            "answer_text": "Before answering if history could be changed with time travel, we need to be clear on what time travel is, the nature of time to be changed and if time really needs to be changed or simply moved. The nature of time itself appears to be relative to the observer.Changing the past assumes that time has a forward, back and present.We observe the past as fixed events that have occurred in the present, and the future as events yet to occur.This view appears to preclude time travel into the past, as the past events are fixed.Traveling to the future is simpler, if you were able to move close to the speed of light (in a space vessel) time would slow for you yet continue as normal outside your speeding environment allowing you to travel to the distant future. As physics phenomena are observable in nature to some degree or another, if time travel into the past were possible its effects would be observable across the universe at the macro or micro level.At the macro level there have been no observations of odd changes occurring across stars, galaxies and larger groups, that could only be explained by a naturally occurring time changing phenomena. Due to this there appear to be no macro time changes occurring in nature that we have yet observed or understood to be such. Looking at the micro scale may provide a different route to time travel.At subatomic quantum scales the nature of energy exhibits effects that are unstable, random and difficult to predict. Particles are created and vanish randomly. Quantum mechanics has been created to attempt to provide answers to the phenomena found at this scale. Naturally occurring time changing events may help to explain some of the effects found at this level, but would need to be proven in the lab and suitable theories developed therefrom. Currently this is conjecture. If a time traveling device were constructed, before it could be used to attempt to change history, the nature of time would need to be clarified to allow the time traveler to arrive at the correct point in the past. The paradoxes of time travel imply that traveling to a fixed point in time, changing something (killing your grandfather) and traveling back to the present is impossible because you would not have been created in the first pace. However, the impossibility of this is based on there only been one time line. Using the notion of infinity allows for an infinite number of time lines, and as infinity is not a singular unit, the boundaries between timelines would be blurred with the events of a time line slowly changing between timelines.If this were found to be the case, the time traveler would not be traveling to a past, present or future, they would instead be moving to any of an infinite number of timelines encompassing all times.Whatever events the time traveler attempted to change in their current timeline would simply place them in the time line those event have already occurred in. As this sounds too much like the cheat code found in numerous computer games, it points to two philosophical outcomes of time travel: why are we here and what should we be doing? Time is relative to the observer, history appears to be relative to where the observer is on a give timeline. ",

            "answer_text": "Why can a time traveler not affect the past? Because affecting the past would ruin the scruiptwriter/author\u2019s plot line. If they need the character to alter the past and create a new timeline, thats what happens. If they need the character to alter the past and dork up their own timeline, that\u2019s what happens. If they\u2019re doing a story where self-healing of the timeline works, the character goes back and makes sure Hitler gets admitted to art school - and some other crazy takes Germany down that long dark path. If they want to do a story that involves a self-sustaining paradox, then that\u2019s what happens - usually the inventor goes back and gives himself the plans for a time machine. But Heinlein\u2019s \u201cAll You Zombies\u201d took it to a whole new level\u2026. And so on through all the different ways time travel could work. Time travel always works the way it needs to for the plot to keep moving. What an amazing coincidence. ",
