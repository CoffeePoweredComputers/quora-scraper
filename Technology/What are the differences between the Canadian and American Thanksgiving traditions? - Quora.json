            "answer_text": "Canadian Thanksgiving has an older history than the American one. The first Canadian Thanksgiving came 40 years before Plymouth Rock. Sir Martin Frobisher: the First ThanksgivingCanadian Thanksgiving is more tied to authentic cultural practices of harvest festivals and less freighted with national mythos. It has no reference to natives or claims (authentic or not) of proof of foundational values. Canada\u2019s Thanksgiving is the first and the best | The StarCanada's Thanksgiving comes soon after harvest is completed in almost all of the populated parts of the country. I have been to US Thanksgiving celebrations in northern tier states where people speak of \u201cbountiful harvests\" and the ground has been frozen solid for a month.Canadian Thanksgiving is a statutory holiday on a Monday. Everyone (with very few exceptions) gets a three day long weekend. I have been to American Thanksgivings where some people sitting down to the table get (on a Thursday?!) only that day off, and have to show up on Friday. Some get no time off at all. Some get Friday off as well. Some get a week off. In Canada it is much more equitable.Despite encroaching bad habits, there is no connection to \u201cBlack Friday\" style consumer frenzy. No overnight lines and door crasher riots the day after Turkey day in Canada.Our football games have more passing, bigger fields, and better looking cheerleaders.",

            "answer_text": "In addition to Derek Hodges' comments with respect to the timing of Thanksgiving there are a few other differences.  Likely the biggest difference is that Thanksgiving here is not nearly as big a deal as it seems to be in the US.  Few Canadians will hop on a plane and fly across the country to enjoy a meal with family (we may drive a couple of hours but that's about it).  There are no Thanksgiving TV specials, school plays, etc.  Some towns will have parades.  The lack of Thanksgiving themed entertainment is likely because there is no national mythology around Thanksgiving in Canada... it's a harvest festival and that's it.  As a harvest festival you will often find that family farms on the outskirts of cities do fun things for kids; like hay rides, corn mazes, animal displays, etc. and there are often agricultural fairs around the same time although they are not generally styled as being specifically related to Thanksgiving.  Finally, there is no widespread agreement on when Thanksgiving actually is.  By law in most provinces it is the second Monday of October; however, families will have their Thanksgiving feasts on the Saturday, Sunday or Monday (I had all three this year... YEAH BIG FAMILY... all though we styled one more as an Oktoberfest dinner... YEAH SCHNITZEL).  I'm sure if I were more in tune with what the American traditions are then I could give more examples of differences but the above are the most notable that I am aware of. (of note, we also tend to eat turkey, root vegetables, drink more than we probably should and watch football... but our football is better). ",
