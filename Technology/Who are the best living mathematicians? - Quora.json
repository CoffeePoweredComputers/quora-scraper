            "answer_text": "Dear John, I think that the most accomplished and definitely the most unusual and the noblest living mathematician is Grigori Perelman (see How Grigori Perelman solved one of Maths greatest mystery). In May 2006, a committee of nine mathematicians voted to award Perelman a Fields Medal for his work on the Poincar\u00e9 conjecture. However, Perelman declined to accept the prize. Sir John Ball, president of the International Mathematical Union, approached Perelman in Saint Petersburg in June 2006 to persuade him to accept the prize. After 10 hours of attempted persuasion over two days, Ball gave up. Two weeks later, Perelman summed up the conversation as follows: \"He proposed to me three alternatives: accept and come; accept and don't come, and we will send you the medal later; third, I don't accept the prize. From the very beginning, I told him I have chosen the third one ... [the prize] was completely irrelevant for me. Everybody understood that if the proof is correct, then no other recognition is needed. On 18 March 2010, Perelman was awarded a Millennium Prize for solving the problem. On June 8, 2010, he did not attend a ceremony in his honor at the Institut Oc\u00e9anographique, Paris to accept his $1 million prize. According to Interfax, Perelman refused to accept the Millennium prize in July 2010. He considered the decision of the Clay Institute unfair for not sharing the prize with Richard S. Hamilton, and stated that \"the main reason is my disagreement with the organized mathematical community. I don't like their decisions, I consider them unjust.\" In June 2006, the Asian Journal of Mathematics published a paper by Zhu Xiping of Sun Yat-sen University in China and Huai-Dong Cao of Lehigh University in Pennsylvania, giving a complete description of Perelman's proof of the Poincar\u00e9 and the geometrization conjectures. The June 2006 paper claimed: \"This proof should be considered as the crowning achievement of the Hamilton\u2013Perelman theory of Ricci flow.\" (Asked about the paper, Perelman said the pair had not contributed anything original, and had simply reworked his proof because they \"did not quite understand the argument\".) In November 2006, Cao and Zhu published an erratum disclosing that they had failed to cite properly the previous work of Kleiner and Lott published in 2003. In the same issue, the AJM editorial board issued an apology for what it called \"incautions\" in the Cao\u2013Zhu paper. On December 3, 2006, Cao and Zhu retracted the original version of their paper, which was titled \"A Complete Proof of the Poincar\u00e9 and Geometrization Conjectures \u2014 Application of the Hamilton\u2013Perelman Theory of the Ricci Flow\" and posted a revised version, renamed, more modestly, \"Hamilton\u2013Perelman's Proof of the Poincar\u00e9 Conjecture and the Geometrization Conjecture\". Rather than the grand claim of the original abstract, \"we give a complete proof\", suggesting the proof is by the authors, the revised abstract states: \"we give a detailed exposition of a complete proof\". The authors also removed the phrase \"crowning achievement\" from the abstract. ",

            "answer_text": "It's a travesty that no one so far has mentioned John Tate:  In roughly chronological order, here are some of his groundbreaking achievements, all of which revolutionized number theory and continue to have ramifications (no pun intended) to this day. His 1950 PhD thesis (under the supervision of Emil Artin) reproved Hecke's theorem that the L-functions associated to Grossencharacters have an analytic continuation and a functional equation. (These simultaneously generalize the Riemann zeta-function and Dirichlet's L-functions, which come up in his proof of the theorem on primes in arithmetic progressions.) More important than the result was the method: he introduced the technique of obtaining arithmetic results by doing harmonic analysis on adelic algebraic groups, arguably initiating (in embryonic form) what eventually became the famous Langlands program.With his advisor Artin, Tate reworked the foundations of classfield theory using group cohomology. In addition to introducing important techniques in homological algebra, his work greatly clarified (in my opinion) the proofs of the main results of early 20th century number theorists. The Artin-Tate notes on the subject (from the early 1950s) remain a definitive reference in the field.He invented the field of p-adic analytic (\"rigid analytic\") geometry, with the so-called Tate parametrization of an elliptic curve. It was a remarkable leap of imagination to realize that although the p-adic numbers (and algebraic varieties defined over the p-adic numbers) form a totally disconnected topological space (a Cantor set), one can still carry over the techniques of complex analysis to this realm; in particular, a notion of \"analytic continuation\" makes sense, despite being nonsensical from a naive perspective.His paper on p-divisible groups from the mid-1960s arguably began the subject of p-adic Hodge theory, another instance of porting results from geometry over the complex numbers to the p-adic realm. This subject remains vibrant and is a crucial input into the deep results on the Langlands program from the last 20-30 years, in particular into \"modularity lifting theorems\" such as the one Wiles proved in the course of proving Fermat's last theorem.With Lubin, Tate conducted some important early research into formal groups. In addition to applications to classfield theory (the content of the first famous Lubin-Tate paper), their study of moduli of formal groups has led to important (and I think surprising) applications in homotopy theory, a branch of algebraic topology seemingly far-removed from the initial number theoretic context.With Honda, Tate made a definitive study of abelian varieties (e.g., elliptic curves) over finite fields, and especially their endomorphism algebras.All of the above is really only the tip of the iceberg. For a survey of his work, illustrating its awe-inspiring breadth and impact in both number theory and algebraic geometry (as well as abstract algebra, more generally), I refer you to Milne's writeup: The Work of John TateAnother striking omission from the current list is Pierre Deligne:  In addition to the foundational work he did on algebraic geometry (in the SGA seminars of Grothendieck in the 1960s), especially crucial work on etale cohomology... He proved the (hardest part of) the Weil conjectures, completing a program initiated by Grothendieck. At the same time, he proved the Ramanujan-Petersson conjecture on the growth rate of the Fourier coefficients of modular forms.He revolutionized Hodge theory in a famous series of papers, in particular introducing the \"yoga of weights\".With Mumford, he introduced the idea of algebraic stacks, a generalization of algebraic varieties which is now the lingua franca for studying \"moduli problems\" in algebraic geometry.He has a number of deep results on algebraic geometry in characteristic p (and its relation to characteristic 0 algebraic geometry), e.g. on K3 surfaces, and on the \"Hodge-de Rham spectral sequence\".With Lusztig he made major contributions to the study of finite groups; especially, they gave a geometric construction for the irreducible representations of a finite group of Lie type (which comprise \"most\" finite simple groups).(While this list is shorter than the one for Tate above, that's mostly because of my own lack of expertise on Deligne's work. In particular, it is difficult to overstate how influential all of the items above have been.) ",
