            "answer_text": "Not sure where you are, or what sort of government you have, but understand the parameters of COVID-19 contact tracing: If you are near a person who is infected but does not know it, they may not ever develop symptoms. Unless you are in a country doing complete periodic testing, they may never know it. The only hope there is for that person to be connected with multiple infections, and that takes time. Meaning records of persons being in contact must be kept for many weeks, if not months.If you are infected, you won\u2019t be feeling or showing symptoms for two weeks. For the 2nd week of that, you are capable of infecting others. So all tracing records must be kept for at least two weeks.Without randomized or complete testing, people simply aren\u2019t going to know if they are infected or not. It is presumed that the count of \u201cknown\u201d cases in the US is around 10% of the actual infections, counting asymptomatic people. So you might not find out you were near an infected person for a long time.The distance droplets travel from a sneeze is 40 feet or more. You need to know where people are and who is with them even well beyond Bluetooth range.The information about where people go and what they do, as well as who they are doing it with - even if this is anonymous - is extremely valuable. So valuable that it will be a gift of unimaginable size if contact tracing is done in the US. It is going to be pretty valuable anywhere, so any government saying these records are private and only in government hands may just not understand. If the data isn\u2019t sold, it will leak out. Based on the above, I don\u2019t believe contact tracing will ever be implemented in the US. I cannot imagine the fallout from it being disclosed that Google made 100 billion from the data. The other part of this is that for contact tracing to work the US (or any country) needs to test everyone every few weeks. Testing people that want to get tested or go to a hospital is pointless - it shows nothing about the disease and at best gives people stupid statistics that mislead. Finding out that someone is infected after they have been walking around for three weeks spreading the virus is pointless. Even a country the size of the US can have everyone exposed through a network of people in a couple of months. The fact that the SARS-CoV-2 virus is relatively hard to get is why the entire country hasn\u2019t been sick yet - we have all come into contact with infected people. The blather about how this is dangerous belies the truth that if it was as easy to get as, say smallpox or influenza, we would all have had it by June. This virus is very slow moving and because of this has the capability to utterly destroy the economy and life as we know it. For example, if it wasn\u2019t for government blocking evictions Las Vegas alone would have over 100,000 people evicted now with no where to go. That is around 1/5th of the population. But all that has happened is delay - the evictions are coming unless the government takes over housing, which is frightening all by itself. Unless we stop the panic in its tracks, the economy isn\u2019t coming back for average people. Oh sure, the stock market is doing fine. Amazon is doing fine. But your neighborhood restaurant isn\u2019t doing fine. If they are still there, which many are not, they may not be by the end of the year. We could be wearing masks and avoiding being near other people for 5 or 10 years. ",
