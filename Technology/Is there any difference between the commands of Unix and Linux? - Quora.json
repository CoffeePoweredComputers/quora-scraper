            "answer_text": "There are not much differences in terminal command wise but Linux follows many of the base principles of UNIX, but it is not a certified UNIX derivative. That said, a specific effort has been made to be as compatible as possible with the POSIX standard that describes, among other things, the behavior of the command-line utilities in UNIX operating systems.. Its almost the same . Each distro has its own way execution. for example if u take debian version we use apt-get to install. and that if you take CentOS , RHEL etc then we use yum . ",

            "answer_text": "There are variations in shell commands even between versions of the same Unix variant. However those are mostly a matter of the upgrade (or sunset) of options\u2026.also some command output will vary. One thing that one might notice is that what is and is not a shell builtin differs. By and large, though, there is a determined effort to keep Linux as close to Unix as reasonably possible. Note that as far as POSIX compliance is concerned, that is more about internals than presentation by a shell. ",
