            "answer_text": "The polarization in economic ideas may exist in all countries. There could be people who think that there should be no taxes, and there are others who are for taxing a major part of personal incomes as taxes and using these for a variety of public services. This polarization does not affect the governance, since even if the two political parties take two extreme positions, these would finally come down to a moderate position through competitive democracy. Let us the take the following example. There are 11 voters in a country (it can be any number but we take 11 for the convenience). We may arrange these voters in the decreasing order of income. 1 is the Richest and 11th is the poorest. Let us take that there are two parties - one is Poor Person\u2019s Party (PPP) and the other is Rich Person\u2019s Party (RPP). When RPP competes with PPP, voters 1, 2, 3.. may vote for RPP and voters 11, 10, 9,.. may vote for PPP. However for RPP or PPP to win they should get not only the votes of their loyal supporters but also people at the middle, that is 5, 6, 7 or 6 specifically. That would mean that the competition would make both RPP and PPP to focus on 6 in shaping their agenda. However the polarization on some social issues is worrisome. My sense is that the life situation of many US citizens (living in rural areas as farmers, influence of specific churches, and so on) do not enable them to acquire certain liberal values. This is making the US somewhat different from a typical developed country like those in the Western Europe. ",

            "answer_text": "Who knows? It just popped up, like mushrooms on the lawn. No way anyone could have seen it coming. Right. If you believe that you probably also believe there's a pedophile gang operating out of the basement of a pizza parlor somewhere. Up (down) for an archaeological dig? Let\u2019s burrow through the layers. Tea Party and Trump: 2008 marked the birth of the Tea Party when simmering conservative frustration over their inability to halt or reverse liberal social changes boiled over. News flash: a significant fraction of the populace really, really, really, really hates the social changes of the last half century. The Sixties: Let me count the ways. Vietnam: We had protestors openly cheering for the enemy in time of war. What else do you need? I seriously don\u2019t think you can overstate the impact of Vietnam in convincing conservatives that liberals were traitors and the media were in their pockets.The Supreme (Warren) Court: Engel v. Vitale, 1962, official school prayers forbidden. This is the day the Culture Wars began. In comparison, Roe v. Wade merely \u201cmade the rubble bounce.\u201d Then there was Brown v. Board of Education and Miranda, widely seen as pro-criminal.The Social Unrest: Campus and ghetto riots, rejection of the prevailing sexual ethos, general disrespect for authority. Contrary to the impression you might get from an Internet search today, public opinion just after the riots in Chicago in 1968 was overwhelmingly on the side of the police.To be blunt, a lot of conservatives want to reverse the changes of the 1960\u2019s. The time to worry about \u201cjudicial activism\u201d was 60 years ago. The McCarthy Era: Communism had taken over Eastern Europe and China and was actively instigating rebellions in Greece and elsewhere. Intellectuals in the West who were even mildly critical of the U.S. were accused of sympathizing with them. Causes like civil rights and unions were tainted by Communist support for them. The New Deal The Civil War and Reconstruction: The South admitted defeat on the battlefield but not morally. And while it\u2019s not fashionable to admit white supremacy today, there were no such niceties in the 1860\u2019s and 1870\u2019s. In the words of Benjamin Tillman, governor of South Carolina and later Senator: We of the South have never recognized the right of the negro to govern white men, and we never will. We have never believed him to be the equal of the white man. If you try gripping something tight in your fist, your hand will get tired and finally slip. And it happened with the Union grip on the South. In the 1876 election, in return for Southern Electoral votes, the Union ended military occupation of the South. In 1878, Congress passed the Posse Comitatus Act, restricting the use of the military in law enforcement. Forget all that pious twaddle about how sacred civilian control of the military is, just look at the dates. 1876, Reconstruction ends. 1878, Posse Comitatus Act. The posse Comitatus Act was passed to prevent the military from being used to interfere with lynching and white mob violence. Barron v. Baltimore, 1833: The most important Supreme Court ruling you never heard of. When Barron\u2019s wharf silted up due to street repairs, he sued, claiming his property had been taken for public use. The Supreme Court ruled that the Bill of Rights restricted only the Federal government, not the states. And so, for a century, The Bill of Rights could be (and often was) ignored at the State and local level. States and local government could censor speech (\u201cbanned in Boston\u201d once meant exactly that), prohibit meetings, and so on. Within living memory, States and localities could ignore the Bill of Rights. And the reactionaries want it back. The Bill of Rights: Most of the debate over the Constitution we read about today revolves around a strong versus weak central government. The debate over a Bill of Rights was over the question whether one was even necessary, or whether the Constitution drew such a sharp line between the Federal and State governments that one was unnecessary. If there was any organized opposition to the rights enumerated in the Bill of Rights itself, it\u2019s hard to find any record of it. Since the original wording banned Congress from interfering with rights, probably most people were in favor. But you can bet lots of people thought speech and religion should be sharply curtailed locally. Lots of states had religious qualifications for office, indifferently enforced but there for virtue signaling. As the preceding point explains, until well into the Twentieth Century, States and local governments were free to ignore the Bill of Rights. 1619\u20131776: 1619, of course is the year slaves were first imported into what would be the United States. The following year, the Pilgrims landed. They were not searching for, but fleeing, religious liberty. they had lived peacefully in Holland for a decade but left because they found the climate too liberal. They wanted to establish a theocracy in America. So in the 1700\u2019s, two toxic streams merged in American culture. There were pathological Protestant cults from Britain and sadistic West Indian slaveowner society. Unraveling all these threads backwards, it becomes apparent that ",
