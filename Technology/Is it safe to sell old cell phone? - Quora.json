            "answer_text": "Totally safe. I\u2019ve sold my phones a bunch of times on craigslist, and other places over the years. The main thing you want to do is take a few precautions. You have two things to think about: Data securityPersonal safetyData Security Older androids and some argue newer ones as well don\u2019t have the same level of data security when you reset your phone. By this, I mean doing a factory reset does not mean someone with some tech know-how wouldn't be able to retrieve the data. So before you sell your phone, make sure you do a factory reset, and use random picture data you can download off the internet or 4K footage. Load it up and reset it again. This process removes old data that was personal to you. For iPhones, you don\u2019t have to worry as much. Just make sure you complete a full factory reset and you should be good. Personal Safety If you\u2019re selling your device privately through craigslist, make sure you take simple measures to protect yourself as there have been stories of scary things happening to sellers. Don\u2019t let this deter you. Here's what you can do: Choose a safe and open meeting zone. Like a police station parking lot.Meet during daylight hoursMeet during busy times of day like 5 PM\u20136 PMLet a loved one know when and where you're going to meetSafer alternatives If you don\u2019t feel comfortable meeting or handing over your phone to strangers, then you can trade-in your phone to GizmoGrind or Gazelle Their service is more professional and simple, but they pay a little less. Hope this helps :) ",

            "answer_text": "First of all it is totally safe to sell your old cellphone. And it is not EMI number that the pgone has it is called as IMEI number. The IMEI number won't bring the cops to you.  The IMEI number is used by a GSM network to identify valid devices and therefore can be used for stopping a stolen phone from accessing that network. For example, if a mobile phone is stolen, the owner can call his or her network provider and instruct them to \"blacklist\" the phone using its IMEI number. This renders the phone useless on that network and sometimes other networks too, whether or not the phone's SIM is changed.The IMEI is only used for identifying the device and has no permanent or semi-permanent relation to the subscriber. Instead, the subscriber is identified by transmission of an IMSI number, which is stored on a SIM card that can (in theory) be transferred to any handset. However, many network and security features are enabled by knowing the current device being used by a subscriber.Source: Wikipedia ",
