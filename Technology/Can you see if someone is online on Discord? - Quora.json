            "answer_text": "You can tell if someone is online on Discord by looking at their status indicator (small coloured dot next to avatar). By default, if someone is online, the dot will be green. Over a certain period of inactivity, the dot will automatically turn into a yellow crescent. Keep in mind, however, that users can also manually choose this status. A red dot symbolises Do Not Disturb. Chances are, the user is on Discord but is mainly inactive. Do Not Disturb turns off any notifications from Discord. Users can also set their status to invisible, meaning that they are still online but appear offline. In this case, you can\u2019t really tell if they are online or not, hence the term \u201cinvisible\u201d. ",

However, if you are referring to terms of when they are Offline(or just pretending to be, besides being Idle or Do Not Disturb), there is no way of knowing if they are. That\u2019s why the feature is there. Though, most do tend to find out if they are if you message them and if they respond back in short time. ",
