            "answer_text": " AMIMOTO-AMI Managed Wordpress Hosting. It\u2019s mind-bogglingly fast. After a month of experimenting with the self-hosted builds they offer, this I finally pulled the trigger and my company is coming on board with them for fully-managed AWS hosting. For the last 4 years, my we\u2019ve been on the fastest dedicated server that Dreamhost offers, running a standard LAMP stack. It\u2019s a big machine: a 16-core Xeon processor with 64 gigs of RAM and a 512 gig SSD hard drive. It\u2019s fast, too - in fact, I did comparison testing and it beat a comparable offering by Rackspace for about half the monthly price. In late August, Dreamhost got hit by a massive DDOS - probably in retaliation for the disruptj20 issue back in August: \u201cDreamHost hit the headlines earlier this month when the US Department of Justice demanded 1.3 million IP addresses of people who visited disruptj20 dot org, a website organizing protests during President Trump's inauguration that was hosted by the biz. The warrant also demanded the contact information, submitted comments, email content, and photos of thousands of people who used the site.\u201d Whatever inspired the attack, it knocked us out of commission and pushed us into action - looking for a secure, stable cloud-based hosting platform with a provider big enough to withstand DDOS attacks. Dreamhost is good, but we wanted something better. Our choice was simple: we\u2019ve used Amazon Web Services for our CDN for a while - so why not go the distance and move everything over? Why screw around with mid-sized hosting providers when we can take everything into the cloud with the biggest, fastest, most scalable network available? After a bit more research, we found AMIMOTO-AMI, which runs 100% on top of Amazon. What makes this company special is that they launch & manage custom-built instances of an NPP-Wordpress stack, and they offer both self-managed and fully-managed options. NPP means that it\u2019s using the Nginx web-server, PHP 7, and a tuned Percona database - along with some custom caching tools that AMIMOTO threw in. The most important part is the stack, though, which literally just eats standard LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP) servers for lunch. I spent about 2 weeks tinkering with the self-managed option, and was literally stunned by the speed comparison. Our fastest sites, implementing all the latest technologies, served literally 3x faster with AMIMOTO on an AWS M3 server. They cost more than Dreamhost, but less than WP-Engine, and since they\u2019re a newer organization they\u2019ve bent over backwards to help us migrate. So far, zero complaints! ",

            "answer_text": "Its not exactly new but as it\u2019s usage has not been gone rapid, I am sharing an interesting technology here agreeing with Revanth Vemuri that its all about cloud technology. Few years ago people were used to save their important data in Hard drives, DVDs or USB Storage devices. But now they are using cloud storage. Similarly advanced technologies are being more flexible, reliable and smooth using the cloud technology. Here, I am going to share about the Cloud Based Biometric Technology which makes the technology faster. Here is the brief description of the technology I\u2019m saying about: CloudABIS\u2122 \u2013 Cloud API for biometric matching system Scalable, Cloud-Based Biometric Matching System. Superscalar, biometrics-as-a-service (BaaS) matching system for fast deployment and lower costs. CloudABIS\u2122 is our highly scalable, cloud-based biometric matching system. Built with over 15 years of experience in large-scale biometric technology projects, CloudABIS\u2122 removes the burden and cost associated with building and maintaining a reliable biometric identification system. CloudScanr\u2122 \u2013 Application for Biometric Device Integration Application for Biometric Device Integration. Eliminates the headache associated with integrating biometric hardware into Windows applications and various Web browsers. CloudApper\u2122 \u2013 Easily create your own enterprise cloud application Easily create your own enterprise cloud application with this revolutionary rapid development toolkit. CloudApper\u2122 makes biometric software development quick & simple. HyperDeduplicador\u2122 for High-Speed Multi Biometric Deduplication Superscalar, One-To- Many Biometric Deduplication Server for Large-Scale biometric Deduplication of fingerprint, finger vein, facial and iris biometric data. Bio-Plugin\u2122 \u2013 Biometric SDK Bio-Plugin\u2122 Appserver and Webserver enable software developers to rapidly integrate and deploy a scalable, server-based biometric software system, eliminating the development headache associated with a biometric SDK.
