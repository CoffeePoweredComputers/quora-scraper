            "answer_text": " As a former web developer, I don\u2019t think that it\u2019s particularly bright - especially for those who don\u2019t have expert-level skills. I\u2019m absolutely open to the idea that I can\u2019t predict the future and could thus be saying this while a web developer renaissance is about to begin. But, as of right now, I don\u2019t see that being likely. For one, there are boatloads of people who are now either employed as web developers or actively working on getting hired as web developers. The sheer number of people in the market is already driving down salaries. Secondly, now that web programming is a well-established profession, the barriers to entry are much, much higher. It\u2019s not unusual for companies to expect CS/math/whatever degrees and a high level of competence to boot. Contrast this with the early 2000s, when all you needed to get into web development was a basic understanding of computers and a willingness to learn. Third, there is an extreme incentive on the part of code-heavy businesses to get rid of programmers (since programmers are expensive) - and there are lots of companies working to solve that problem. SaaS solutions for both backends and frontends are popping up every day and replacing dedicated programming staff. Related to the last point is the shifting landscape of technologies that are being used in web applications. Historically, a large portion of paid web dev work revolved around basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete for you non-programmers out there) tasks that could mostly be described as \u201cgrunt work.\u201d But it was well-paid grunt work because companies didn't have tech that could replace human labor. This lack of tech also meant that it did require some level of skill to do the work - everything had to be created from scratch, which not everyone could do. There are now boatloads of tools out there that either make programmers obsolete or greatly diminish the skills required to build certain pieces of an application. So companies can either not hire programmers or hire entry-level programmers and pay them a garbage wage because it\u2019s easier to find people to do monkey work than it is to solve real problems. Making all this even worse is the introduction of machine learning. In order to effectively build machine learning solutions, you need to have a very strong technical and mathematical background. This is changing to some degree with the introduction of ML frameworks, but to understand what\u2019s going on under the hood you still need to know what you\u2019re doing. Machine learning changes the game in some significant ways. For one, it\u2019s no longer about solving problems with traditional, discrete CS thinking. ML solutions revolve around gathering boatloads of data, cleaning said data and then allowing ML algorithms to \u201clearn\u201d from it to come up with their own solutions. In other words, programming is becoming less about structuring and building code, and more about teaching machines how to interact with data. They\u2019re two very different skillsets, and they both require different types of training. These ML programs can then generate programs themselves from the training data they\u2019re given, which can then be used to replace programmers or other personnel at a company. Once again, companies have a huge incentive to get rid of programmers and ML companies are drowning in money satisfying that demand. ML and other extremely technical specialties are also creating a serious skills gap in the market. Right now there aren\u2019t too many people who really understand ML at anything more than a superficial level - that\u2019s why Google and other big tech companies are paying ML experts boatloads of cash to join their teams. The people who do understand it are in high demand and capable of building programs that replace less-capable programmers. This means that we\u2019re creating a situation where a wide base of programmers are replaced or forced to take big salary cuts, while simultaneously giving the people at the top of the skills pyramid a giant boost. If you\u2019re already deep into a web dev career, then you have a chance at survival. You can still pick up some math textbooks, dive into ML and AI, and probably be OK. If you\u2019re just starting out, I\u2019d recommend finding another profession. Web dev is not going to be a particularly attractive profession in the near future, and there are plenty of other ways to make large amounts of money in tech (product manager, growth marketing, VC, etc.). This is the topic of a free online book that I wrote called The Automation Survival Guide. Check it out if you want to know how to avoid getting automated! ",

            "answer_text": "Web development is currently insanely saturated with developers and websites, while tech companies like Apple and Microsoft are pushing towards native apps. Google is the only company that seems like it wants to continue evolving the browser. That being said, web development is still growing and evolving much more quickly than native app technologies. It seems that native app technology cannot overcome the browser because of competition among the device vendors. Everyone can hate client side development, but it evolves crazy fast. Web sites have become web apps, and web development has become somewhat synonymous with server software development. Web API\u2019s and more specifically REST calls have become an integral part of almost every digital company\u2019s core services. Most services on cloud platforms like AWS and Azure are completely web driven, even when offering services for developers that have nothing to do with web development. Hosting code, data, etc. in the cloud will involve working with a web API. So far, the browser has stayed ahead of the curve compared to other choices for UI & internet focused services likes mobile and desktop apps. The fact that the browser is universal across all operating systems and devices, always using HTML, CSS, and JS (ECMAScript), means it\u2019s not going anywhere anytime soon. As I explained earlier, even if the browser and websites went out of style, web technologies are here to stay. If you are a full stack developer, your skills will be in demand regardless of whether or not the browser and websites have a future. As a side note, if anyone is getting into web development because it has the most jobs, think it through more thoroughly. Yes, there\u2019s a ton of web development jobs. There\u2019s also a shitload of applicants. There\u2019s a lot less jobs, but a lot less developers to compete with, writing kernels and firmware. Those aren\u2019t going anywhere either. ",

            "answer_text": "The Future Of Web Development The Web Developer bears the responsibility for the coding, design, and layout of the website according to the company\u2019s specifications. A website is more important than anything for every business when it comes to reaching clients online. Every business knows today the need to have a website and is trying to design and create the best website to take its products or services online. With incredible progress in launching websites, businesses are searching for people who can build outstanding designs and platforms for their online presence.  Web developers and designers bring their technical skills and experience to the creation and production of exclusive websites capable of attracting the crowd. They are striving to create more reliable sites through all-new frameworks, tools, and advancements. With the technical expertise widespread today, we are on the road to a technologically transforming future. The technology landscape is evolving with artificial intelligence, computer education, the Internet of Things, and quantum computing. And this is even down to their website relationship. Experts from Clever-Solution evaluated the current patterns, listed the most viable ones, and estimated the time expected for their implementation. Let\u2019s explore how more space will be created by web weave, with new trends in web development and new trends that will capture or dominate soon. 1. Artificial Intelligence Artificial intelligence does not need to be introduced. Every article on technology, which we read on the web, reflects the need for AI and how it would be the next thing on the web. Several companies and institutions are already implementing AI to meet their needs. Some have reaped the benefits of AI for their businesses. AI is the future trend of web space development. It is justified as a lot of progress and advancements have been made in the field of Artificial Intelligence. Leading corporate companies like Google and Microsoft have launched their AI technology for the public, you can build your custom websites with the power of AI. One of the latest AI implementation is the grid, which allows web development a simple process, and initiates content-based development. There are no templates or codes \u2013 all you need to do is provide instructions, and it will lay out what you want. ADI tools emerge that allow the process of websites to be fairly automated. The important components of a website are Artificial Design Intelligence (ADI) that can build and offer developers options for customized software. In the future, the way websites are created can make a major impact. Going forward in the future can have a major impact on how websites are created. Now is the time for AI web developers who know more about the future, where web development is more likely to give users what they need and not simply to give them what the developer can make. AI should be on your list if you\u2019re looking for what capabilities or skills would add to make you a successful web developer. 2. Internet of Things (IoT) The Internet of Things, or IoT, refers to the billions of physical devices, objects, animals, or individuals with unique identifiers that are distributed across the network are now connected to the Internet, all of which collect and exchange data, without requiring human-to-human or human-to-computer interaction. It\u2019s a technology that is emerging at a faster rate than imagined. IoT is a future technology that makes our lives in management easy and efficient. Web developers are not directly linked to IoT, but will soon be involved in developing web applications that are needed for analysis and data for their operations. Few companies have started using Application Programming Interfaces, which are used by web developers to communicate with IoT. It would involve a connection between applications and physical devices that would require flexible developers. The IoT developer needs to demonstrate a wide range of skills, including software, hardware programming, networking, systems engineering and user interface, mobile app development, machine learning, and tool knowledge as an individual. If you think that you have all those skills, then you move to achieve a better job as a web developer and with higher pay. 3. Virtual Reality Virtual reality is the long-awaited dynamic that many thought would take the world by storm, affecting everything in its path. Virtual reality is designed to affect many different elements of web design for a variety of different reasons. VR is sculpting a web path and is set to affect web design in many interesting new ways. Some MNCs and giants, such as Google and Microsoft, have already implemented virtual reality or web VRs. Virtual reality can simply be defined as the process of implementing computer technology to create a stimulating environment. VR can put users into an experience that can not be observed in any of the existing traditional interfaces. Instead of accessing a screen placed in front of them, users can engage and interact with the 3D world in real-time. VR can help you with virtual tours and other interactive experiences that allow users to experience something before buying a product or service. Industries are looking for developers who can create web apps for businesses that allow potential customers to have virtual experience with a business product or service. This would include taking on responsibility for research, evaluation, implementation, and testing of new and innovative VR methodologies in the context of the web experience they are developing. 4. 360-Degree Video The 360-degree video offers a significantly enhanced user interface that leads to the creation and growth of websites. The 360 degrees are guaranteed to draw more attention, thus enhancing interaction for more views. It enriches the user\u2019s experience as if he or she is genuinely present. The video clips cover a view of the spherical scenario in 360 degrees, while the camera captures a view of all possible angles to a seamless future experience. The ultimate objective is to provide end-users with high-tech features. It becomes easier to create a 360-degree video experience if you have sufficient and enough experience in VR technology. If you have experience and expertise as a web developer with the new and best modern technologies, it helps to increase the visibility of a company\u2019s brand. 5. Voice Command An example of artificial intelligence implementation. This wasn\u2019t so amazing before, because this technology just worked poorly. High-quality voice input items were extremely expensive. But it\u2019s one of the trends now. In several smartphone and web applications voice commands are actively implemented. You can call Uber, too, by voice. You don\u2019t have to spend time using your application, so life is much easier. Voice input is another technique to enhance user experience. Voice search must be taken seriously in the development of the website. Web designers are now trying to figure out ways to incorporate this successfully into their websites. They must even be able to record user activity from voice searches for people involved in digital marketing. A third of internet users already think that voice searches are relevant and this trend will expand further. That is why web development shapes the future. 6. Motion User Interface Motion design helps to make user interfaces attractive and intuitive. When correctly used, motion can guide your digital product user experience by conveying a message about your brand. To add value and enhance many aspects of their interaction, you can align animation to the preferences of your users. As you might know, the Motion UI is a SaaS library used in custom CSS, Web developers also can create attractive designs that enable unique transitions and animations that contribute to boosting website appearance and generate user interest. One of the interesting features of a motion user interface is that it provides a lot of simplicity which users love. It\u2019s easy to understand and comprehend. Take the skills needed for the motion interface and you are on demand. Web development is a field that is constantly evolving. If you choose a career in web development, you would need to keep up-to-date with the latest trends and technologies. Always remember that a website is the face of a business, and if you\u2019re part of a project, make sure you give it the best. Also, the future of web development depends entirely on the desires of users. There is enough technology today to satisfy these desires. Because the \u201cfuture\u201d is already here today. We\u2019re just going to see his improvement. ",

            "answer_text": "Nobody knows, but more people than ever are trying to find out. I think its pretty certain that web development is going to be taken much more seriously than it is now. Changes are happening so fast at the moment, that the vast majority of developers can't keep pace. Copy and paste and googling for solutions is very popular and the number of people with a deep understanding of HTML, CSS, Javascript and Browsers is a small percentage of the web development community (I still try to get there). A lot of Universities can't offer high quality courses because there simply are not enough qualified teachers around to cover all aspects of web development adequately. In short, its a bit chaotic out there at the moment. But since a lot of logical thinking people that are not on best terms with chaos work in the industry we are going to see clarifications at least in some areas. Cloud EditorsCloud 9 (https://c9.io/) is already available and Mozilla, Opera and others are working on powerful javascript text-editors that can work in the browser. There is vast potential in better asset management, code sharing (for example jQuery plugins are used for that at the moment, but we can do even better) and other more or less complicated workflows web developers simply got used to over time. A sign for things to come are the indispensable debugging features of browsers like Chrome and Firefox. It's going to take some time before cloud editors become mainstream, but it feels like the web is the proper place for a web editor;) CSS ComplexityCSS development workflows still leave a lot to be desired. CSS Frameworks like Bootstrap show how much we need better solutions. Responsive design, HTML5 and new HTML and CSS drafts introduce so much complexity that CSS development cannot be taken lightly anymore. I think tools like Sass and Less will see higher adoption but i guess chaos will linger here for some time to come. JavascriptThere are still way to many developers not taking the time to learn javascript properly. A lot of job ads treat javascript and jQuery as interchangeable. Maybe we'll see a split between webpage-developers and web-developers. The former focusing on web pages and the latter on the myriad other things one can do with web technologies glued together by javascript. I won't even try starting to list them here. New CMS systemsA lot of the popular CMS systems are around 10 years old (Wordpress was first released 2003) which is what some say is the time for software to mature. That also means its about time for a new generation. I think we'll see similar things happening as in the Database space where No-SQL is breaking the dominance of SQL in a lot of areas. The basic architecture of a lot of CMS systems seems outdated for quite a few use-cases (think for example online newspapers and publishing). I don't use CMS systems since I'm mostly developing web-applications, so lets call this one a hunch... CoverageHTML, CSS and Javascript are so pervasive that that the term web-development is hardly adequate anymore. Websites, Web-Apps, Mobile, Desktop, Windows 8 Store... There seems to be no stopping in what you can do and will be able to do with your web-development skills. I certainly can't keep track anymore. So the future of web development is hopefully a bunch of more precise terms, so we have a better chance of finding answers to this question. Or in short: expect everything to change. ",

            "answer_text": "I have my own ideas some times. But, I would say that the HTML format and the form entry methodology is a really based on really old ideas from forty years ago. AI is an avenue for browsers to go down. People have researched things such as question answer systems for years. And, speech and vision or getting better support in browsers, slowly. So, there can be a browser that sort of knows you and you can talk to it. Maybe the idea of browsing is a little archaic. I was thinking of fusion points. Maybe no one makes a web page any more. Maybe the browser in its great desire to please its user assembles information that the user might like in ways that makes the user happy. Maybe the browser introduces you to people who you enjoy or who might do business with you. Maybe it makes formal introductions as if you were at a business meeting. The idea of public domain sim-worlds seems likely. Instead of single organizations owning sim-worlds. The sim-worlds can be shared in a pastiche within a browser, where anyone can own a part of the sim-world in the same manner as owning a web page. Peer-to-peer could become the norm rather than the added functionality. And, single pages might exists only for special cases where definition is required. If HTML and other text were discarded in favor of some grander form of media, then search engines would have to adapt or be replaced. In any event search should progress more rapidly towards semantic search than it is, leaving text oriented search to the history of things such as buggy whips. At any rate, HTML is basically a stop gap for better ways of providing content. It is certainly a pervasive temporary fix. But, eventually, it will have to give way to other things. ",

            "answer_text": "I am inclined to answer that the future is bright for web developers. Not because I am clairvoyant but because I am naturally an optimist. Mind you, it isn\u2019t always easy to be optimistic. I recently attended a workshop with the brilliant John Coyle who said, \u201ctoday is the slowest day of the rest of your life\u201d. The pace at which we are going to have to adapt to change is, admittedly, terrifying. But, here is the good news. The future is bright for those who can adapt, and web developers \u2014 the good ones anyway \u2014 are highly adaptive: We constantly have to refresh our skills.We continually learn new frameworks.Once we learn one programming language, we\u2019ve proven to ourselves that we can pick up another one.We tend to be well informed, can anticipate trends, and can empower ourselves to take the right actions for our careers.Here\u2019s an example: a friend of mine was laid off from her corporate role as an IT manager. She was really burned out at that point and didn\u2019t want to find another corporate job, so she earned a certificate in ethical hacking. Added to her MBA, she is now in high demand as an online instructor and has more requests to teach courses than she can handle. The good news, though, is that you don\u2019t need an MBA to re-write your future. I recently attended a conference on cyber security and learned that there will not be enough cyber security professionals to fill those roles in ten years. Many of the roles in this field have a low risk of automation. The universities in my area are even starting to offer certificates and M. S. Computing degrees in cyber security. I think we\u2019ll continue to see opportunities like these, such as 5-course certificates, that will qualify us for new roles. Cyber security and ethical hacking are just two examples, and they speak to the opportunities that are available to those who are willing to learn new skills and perhaps earn a certificate in a new discipline. The takeaway: With continual change comes new and perhaps even better opportunities. It\u2019s also helpful to arm yourself with facts. Find out what hiring managers are looking for. Which skills will make you most valuable? Talk to recruiters and managers. Find out what\u2019s needed and work hard to gain the right skills and make yourself a valued contributor to a team. If you can do that now and continue to adapt as needs and demands change, your future, whether you are a web developer or you evolve into a new area, will be very bright indeed. ",

            "answer_text": " Web development is currently insanely saturated with developers and websites, while tech companies like Apple and Microsoft are pushing towards native apps. Google is the only company that seems like it wants to continue evolving the browser. That being said, web development is still growing and evolving much more quickly than native app technologies. Here are some of the web development speculations that might rule the web development ecosystem. The web\u2019s constantly evolving. Evolve with it, & you\u2019ll never have to worry about a lack of job opportunities. Progressive Websites These websites should not be confused with native mobile apps. First of all, they are not web applications at all. These websites appear in the form of a tab in your web browser, and if the browser does not support it, its contents are still displayed in the form of a normal web page.There are no issues of downloading and updating the web page, since it gets automatically updated, as soon as an internet connection is made. The X-factor of this website is its ability to be displayed offline.Almost all the dynamic features have been made available to the offline site. The HTML, CSS, Javascript code is all static, and the recent update is cached so that every time you open it in the offline mode, the most recent updated page opens up and is much faster than a web app.Its plus points are the following: Works offlineFaster responseLoads instantlyNot available in the app storeThe latest version is accessed without any downloads.Chatbots Chatbots are the most useful tools on a website. These assure 24X7 customer helpline on the website, that is tailor-made to deal with any online query that a customer comes up with. This ensures that a customer is satisfied after visiting the website since all replies are programmed as per the FAQ\u2019s a customer might have, which covers the length and breadth of the entire service offered by the website. Single Page Websites As long as yours is not a customer service or an -commerce website, single page websites should be the norm.This avoids all the clutter that is to be seen on a website, gracefully displaying the contents on a single page. This even helps a new internet user to access the functionalities of the website. This simple scrolling down process is a user-friendly interface. Push up Notifications Keeping the user engaged is one of the important aspects of web development and that has been achieved by the push-up notifications. Most of the mobile applications have these features and these are slowly creeping into the web environment.Now, when a user has closed the website from its tab, he can still get side notifications on his system, where he can view any recent updates or changes that have been made on the website he had visited, ensuring an engaging experience. Motion UI Static content on websites has stopped being the norm. This vouches for a stale user experience. Now is the trend for a motion UI, which engages the user to click on the websites and view moving animations, whether it be in the form of text, images, video files or music. This will help increase user traffic on the website. Front end and Back End With the introduction of Angular 2 (front end) and Laravel (backend). Coding the entire website has become easier because of the many packages and bundles available right now. Due to this developer now, doesn\u2019t have to waste time on writing long lines of code, and coming up with complicated logic as almost everything available in the packages.Now a developer can delve into a more creative space than he earlier used to, making the websites more modern. Artificial Intelligence This technology has become a viral sensation and the most talked about one in this digital world. Recently, Google DeepMind developed AlphaGo bet a professional Go player. Similarly, in the field of web development, a web developer bot will be created which will learn from new websites as and when they are being developed which would make web development just a click away. Internet Of Things Internet of things is a technology that involved the connection of non-internet connected things such that they can send and receive information. These things can be kettles, toasters, blenders, and sensors in concrete to detect cracks. While web developers might not be directly connected to developing this technology, they will very much be involved in developing applications that help in their operations. They will also be involved in the analysis and display of data collected from these devices. There are companies that have already started working on APIs that will be used by web developers in communicating with these internet of things devices. Though this technology is expected to be on the rise this year, there is a growing concern about security. It is clear that web developers will have to face a number of challenges especially in protecting these devices from hackers. Best Web Design, Digital Marketing & App Development Company ",

            "answer_text": "As the owner of a small web solutions business - Website Development and SEO Services I have wondered the same thing. Especially since the resources available to small business owners continues to grow in terms of DIY website builders. However, I have not seen a drop in my business but I think that\u2019s because I take a very personal approach with building relationships with my clients. My business background started as a sales person working in a used vacuum cleaner and sewing machine store where I was the store manager, the repair person, and the salesman. I really value that experience because it taught me a lot about building rapports with clients. That was 23 years ago and still to this day I use what I learned back then and apply it to my business today. People that turn to a DIY yourself website builder online soon find out that it\u2019s not as easy as it looks that working though a support/knowledge base and calling customer support gets old real quick for a lot of people. I have converted many wix sites to WordPress. But talking to someone on the phone, going by their place of business, or using skype for non-local clients is important to build relationships and those relationships are a strong foundation for your business. You\u2019ve got to work on interpersonal skills and be willing to be more personal with your approach at finding new clients. Scraping the web and sending 100\u2019s of emails is not a sustainable practice. Getting personal with your client acquisitions is very important and developing those interpersonal skills is very much part of the future of website development. Those relationships are your businesses biggest asset and generally your biggest source for generating new revenue. In my opinion, the future of web development from a business stand point should be focused on valuing clients, building meaningful relationships and providing personable and quality service. Because no matter what direction web development is going from a technical stand point, it doesn\u2019t matter if you cannot acquire and retain good clients. ",

            "answer_text": "In this article I explained about future of web development. You can check this link for more details. In recent years, the web has been getting more and more ingrained in our daily lives. We use it for everything, from shopping, to banking, to reading our news. The demand for web development talent is as high as ever, and the scope of what developers can do is huge! 1. Virtual reality Another topic that always seems to surface when discussing the future of technology is virtual reality or VR. This trend has already started to sweep the gaming industry. The Oculus Rift and the Vive bring new and interesting possibilities to the world of gaming, but it won\u2019t stop there. Companies including Google and Mozilla have begun work on APIs to help VR technology transition to the web. As standards develop, we expect more and more applications to be developed using VR technologies. In the coming year, we\u2019ll see virtual reality in various applications, ranging from news coverage, to virtual real estate tours. 2. Internet of Things (IoT) The internet of things is a movement where typically non-internet-connected objects are given network connectivity in order to send and receive data. These objects can range from your toaster or kettle, to sensors on motors or sensors embedded in concrete to detect cracks and weaknesses. Web developers may not be directly involved in the creation of such devices. However, it\u2019s likely we\u2019ll be involved in the development of applications that use, analyse and display the devices\u2019 data. Companies such as Xively and BugLabs have already started working on APIs that can be used by developers to communicate with IoT devices. Though IoT brings a lot of opportunity for innovation, some concerns have been raised, especially around security. No doubt web developers will have interesting challenges to face - helping to protect our fittings and furnishings from hackers.  3. Static website generators Static website generators create websites from plain text, usually stored in files and not in databases. In certain situations, static websites built by generators such as Jekyll, allow for some advantages, such as increased speed, security, ease of deployment and their handling of traffic surges. However, they have no real time content or user content (such as comments), which have become a \u201cmust\u201d on the web today. As Content Delivery Networks and APIs become more and more the way of life of the web and make it easier for content and templates to be deployed, many devs think static site generators might be an interesting area to watch in the coming year 4. Web design evolution If you\u2019re interested in design, here are a few trends to watch out for next year: Movement based interfaces will probably become a staple on the web. Perhaps when combined with libraries such as tracking.js, interfaces that respond to hand movements could be closer than we think. Bolder and larger typography is likely to become more prevalent. People often want engaging and compelling ways to get their information quickly. This will likely elicit a rise in the use of videos and other storytelling visuals. The web is an interesting place, where nothing stands still for too long. Information is always changing and the methods we use to deal with that information will always evolve along with it. I hope now you got some idea.. :) ",

The past The past of the web, for those who experienced this era, seems to have occurred yesterday. Sites flickered, things jumped on screen or screen, we checked with users if their browsers could display images - marquee, blink, image map - web interfaces looked more like a lively party than a place where information and links to more information. After this stage, we entered into another one, which, despite having played an important role in the growth of the web itself, was extremely complicated for development. Who has not seen it certainly heard of the browser war - Microsoft Internet Explorer vs. Netscape Navigator, JavaScript versus JScript. This competition has brought important advances, but also many problems. Among the most notorious is the lack of compatibility of the technologies used. We no longer checked whether the user's browser had a particular feature. We started developing for specific browsers. We checked for screen resolution if the user was using Internet Explorer and the browser version. We have come to the point of restricting access to content, based on the tool that the user used. It was a dark phase. Urgent intervention was needed. It was necessary for the competition to bring advances rather than constraints. It was necessary for an organization to promote standardization. The gift Perhaps the biggest breakthrough in web development was the October 1994 W3C foundation. If we have today SVG, PNG, HTML, XHTML, XML, CSS, DOM, RDF, SOAP, and several others, and these formats work equally on almost any device, we owe this to W3C. The main purpose of the entity, which is to promote standardization and interoperability, has been achieved. Development has become simpler, precisely because of this standardization. If we now have the possibility of an agnostic development, we must thank the W3C for the standardization work done at the time of those 20 years. I wonder how development would be today if we were still developing as before. If we checked whether the user had the Flash plugin installed, or if it had a screen resolution of 1024 \u00d7 768 pixels, how would we do it today? We are no longer able to do this kind of verification. Today, access to applications comes from a variety of sources and devices. If we were to check each one, our applications would be pretty much a gigantic conditional structure, with different paths and branches for each type of access source. No, we do not need it any more. The future Although the semantic web is already a current topic and we are already developing applications with this concern, I believe that much will still happen. Processors like TrueNorth, recently introduced by IBM, will become reality in a short time. Machines will come to understand, in fact, the content we produce. And if machines can understand the meaning of things, they can, for example, increase the accessibility of content. One of the biggest difficulties I see today is offering the content to a user who has a special need. We already have standardizations and specifications in this regard, but how do we produce content for someone who has a different experience? How can we deliver the best experience for those who do not see, hear, or have any other special needs? I believe that when we give semantic meaning to the content and comprehension capacity of the machines, we take a step towards more accessible content. Semantics is already a reality, but I believe that accessibility to content, regardless of the origin of the access, of the difficulties that the user has, will be the reality in the near future. Conclusion By analyzing the past and the present of web development, the technological advances and the diverse possibilities of access to the content that we have today, it is somewhat complicated to predict the future. Much has changed in 20 years and will certainly change much more quickly in the next 20 years. What is easy to notice, however, is that web development is now much easier. And it is much easier, because today we have a much greater probability of the means of access to content to be made by a standardized technology. If we have standardization and a greater ease of development, we also have much better access experiences than we have ever had.There is still a lot to do to make content accessible. I believe that we will have many efforts in accessibility in the future. Regardless of which way we go, I believe it will be a future with standardization. Therefore, as a web developer since a long time, I have much to thank the W3C for the role it has played in the standardization of web technologies. ",

Also, even big websites/companies has a app to support themselves , take Paypal, Nettler, Amazon, etc. Why does Web Development has a future? I have composed here a list of things that use web (Internet) for its application, Even for the shortest tasks. Banks - Every bank has its own network, & web is itself a network. Every computer/ device that is used to make the bank transaction, is connected to the network & uses it.University/Colleges - These institutions has their own websites, that they use to display results of their students, maintain their students as well as employee information and other related task.Business\u2019s - Every big/small business has it\u2019s own website thet showcase, services provided by them, their contact infomaton, prices to be paid (to apply for that service).Public Transport - When you book a ticket for bus, train/metro , airplanes, you use the web iyself in a form/ other.Online Gaming - There are popular games that use web as its interface, the number of games will evolve , web will evolve by itself.Music/Video Streaming - Soundcloud,Last.fm, Youtube, Netflix , etc. are all the companies that provide music/video streaming. services i.e, you can use them only via web.The list is endless & web is evolving, every basic task today requires the web. I guess, if web won\u2019t have a future, what else will? & if Web has its future, web development indeed has. For more, Follow/Share/Subscribe :) ",

            "answer_text": "The web is a moving target, as they say. With new technologies on the rise all the time, trends in web development and design are sure to change as well. Here\u2019s a round up of a few the web development trends to watch out for in the coming year. This is the future! Progressive Web Apps Progressive web apps are websites that act and feel like a native mobile app. Originally proposed by Google in 2015, progressive web apps combine the best of web and mobile apps. PWA Rocks and PWA Directory showcase what progressive web apps are like.  PWA Directory One of the biggest advantages of a progressive web app is its reliability. Enhanced with service workers, it loads instantly, works offline or on low-quality networks and are always up-to-date. Built with progressive enhancement in mind, it works on and is responsive on any device, be it on the desktop, mobile, tablet, or whatever\u2019s next. And because network requests can be intercepted through service workers, a progressive web app is served via HTTPS, making it safe. Single-Page Websites With more websites these days aiming for simplicity and speed, we\u2019re going to see more of single-page websites. A single-page website uses a single HTML page with content accessible in one long scrollable page. Check out One Page Lovefor a showcase of single-pagers.  Shared Text Styles - a single-page site Single page websites offer many advantages. With all content displayed on just one page, you control the flow of information as users browse the site in a linear fashion, instead of clicking from page to page. With this control, you can take the user on a journey as they scroll through. This gives the opportunity to engage visitors in a unique way - you can tell a story, demonstrate a big idea, or simulate an experience. Designed for simplicity, single-page websites are mobile, user-friendly, and great for conversion. For all its strengths, single-pagers are not a great fit for e-commerce sites. Static Site Generators With the dominance of content management systems (CMS), it has been an era of dynamic sites for the web. However, it\u2019s not that long ago when the first websites on the Internet are just static web pages. And now static sites are making a comeback -- with a little help from static site generators, a hybrid approach to web development.  Jekyll - one of the most popular static site generators Static site generators or static site engines take dynamic content and data and generate static files (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) that can be deployed to the server. There is no server-side language or database involved. This gives a static site the benefits of faster and reliable performance, cheap to free and easy hosting, and content versioning. And since there is no database or server-side language to exploit, a static site offers more security. Jekyll, Hugo, GitBook, and Pelican are some of the popular static site generators out there. You can view other options at StaticGen, a leaderboard for top open-source static site generators. Motion UI Background animations, page transitions, scroll-to-animate effects, animated charts - you might have encountered these as you browse today\u2019s edgy websites and apps. Behind these sophisticated effects is Motion UI.  Business Card App design by Tubik featured in UI Movement A Sass library for creating flexible CSS transitions and animations, Motion UI is originally bundled with Zurb\u2019s Foundation for Apps when it launched in December 2014. Adding new effects, the Zurb team eventually released it as a standalone library in 2016. Its newest version features flexible CSS patterns that work with all kinds of JavaScript, enabling a more seamless integration of animations into websites. Adding motion UI elements into your website can boost user engagement as it encourages active user interaction and enhances site usability. Check out UI Movement, a popular design inspiration site that showcases designs using motion UI. Chatbots Discord, the freeware chat app for gamers, has an unofficial official API documentation titled \u201cThe Robot Revolution has Unofficially Begun\u201d. The words capture what could well be the tech zeitgeist of our times. For all we know we\u2019ve been talking with our future overlords 80% of our time. We just don\u2019t know it yet. If you\u2019re using messaging apps, chances are you\u2019ve talked with chatbots. Facebook Messenger alone has 11,000 chatbots. A chatbot is a service that you interact with via a chat interface, such as messaging apps. The service could range from helping you order online or book an Uber to giving you news and weather updates, and even life advice.  Poncho - the weather chatbot Chatbots represent a massive opportunity for businesses. Back in early 2015, the use of messenger apps has surpassed social networks, which is a huge turning point. With messaging apps now the dominant platform, chatbots will be how people will access all sorts of services. Powered by AI, chatbots would radically transform the way companies do business. Startups like Octane AI and Drift have recognized this, building platforms on the concept of marketing through messaging apps and conversation.

            "answer_text": "Hi there, Yes, in my view web development has a future. Every fundamental need requires the web; some of the services which serve for web development are Banks, Public transport, online gaming and much more. Future of web development The future of web development and designing is more progressing at a huge rate. The website has a lot of extent in daily life. Web developer is involved in developing new frames, tools, and techniques to create more sites. It is a quick pace with new technologies emerging promptly. The new trends of web development in 2020 are 1.\tArtificial Intelligence An artificial \"intelligent\" technology is the future of the world. This is displayed in any field for several decades. As soon as physical strength started to be replaced by robots, the greatest minds created to work on the full automation of our livelihood. Smart Home, voice search, home cleaning robots, autopilot, and other such technologies are all artificial intelligence. Each of them already has its embodiment in the market. It helps improve user activity several times. 2.\tProgramming languages The programming languages are utilized for both professionals and beginners. It depends on the framework and languages they work along. The new devices play a major role in the speed of adaption. They need to assume what knowledge they need to get in order to be at the top or to completely overtake the eternity of web development. Javascript, Python, and PHP are the various popular programming languages in recent years. Trends do not change, because the developers are satisfied with the abilities of this trio. The first place absolutely takes Javascript, because I encourage you to study it if you still do not know. Python takes back. But it is very limited for developing mobile applications to the browser web services this language is considered best. Where PHP is very easy to learn and use which means suitable for creating simple web services. 3.\tFrameworks The future is several years in advance because it can create a universal framework. But we already know for sure which sets of tools will be held in high. React and Vue \u2013 the source of all front-end developments. React is today the most wanted-after framework in most companies where it competed with Angular. But the developers maintain that Angular sags is more efficient. Vue suddenly became popular just this year. 4.\tVoice commands Products with high-quality voice input were disproportionately costly. However, now it is one of the trends. Voice search is not as fast as text input because the browser needs time for clear speech recognition. But it takes on a new look and influences the development of most web assistance. By voice, you can contact ola. This makes life much easier because you do not need to allocate time using the application. Location determines exactly where the driver should come. It remains only to wait for the information on the appearance of the car. Voice input is a diversified technology that enhances user vulnerability to the future of web development. 5.\tInteractivity The task of the developer is to secure the most convenient and practical application. Where web services will be more interactive. Such developments did not have elevated popularity due to the large consumption of devices and the prolonged site load. But today technology is much faster. Now it's much faster to wait for the loading of the interactive page, slightly than browse through a few ordinary ones. 6.\tAdaptability This talk about the use of web applications, mobile phones are not inferior to computers. The only difference is the screen area. The efficiency of the use of the site or graphics should not experience because of different monitors. Otherwise, the user simply declines to work with the web page, moving to a more optimized. Any web application must change to any device, from appearance to functionality. It is important not to create two (or more) variants of the site since in this case, inaccuracies will be noticeable. It is necessary to develop one version that adapts to the workspace. 7.\tone-page sites Data on a one-page website enables you to attract the attention of a potential client in a matter of seconds. Much more likely that he will buy a product that interested in 5 seconds than the one that had to study for several hours, allow you to save development resources. Secondly, such pages load much quicker. A modern user really appreciates his time, so he cannot wander around the site for a long time looking for data. 8.\tChatbots If you do not understand how to attract even higher customers and facilitate their work with your project - add a chatbot. This is another highly efficient implementation of artificial intelligence. Chatbot is done to understand how to respond in a given position. 9.\tPurpose - practicality Web development meant to build beautiful content. The role of this element has not become less, but the development of technology allows us to achieve external beauty much faster. It mainly focuses on the practicality of each element. If any button doesn\u2019t work- it should not be added. It will only enhance the download time of the site, but the efficiency will reduce If you want to build your career as a web developer, now it\u2019s your turn to enroll in the web development course.

            "answer_text": "Here I explained future for web developers. I have written a detailed review in this article. Check it out if you want a more explanation. Web developer, a profession born less than twenty years ago. Today ubiquitous in our lives, and at the dawn of the Internet of Things, the latter still has a bright future ahead of him. Fifteen or twenty years ago, the technological context of Web development was different. The variety of connected device types was smaller, the functionality offered was less complex, and the skills needed to develop a website were lower. A job was born under the name we give it today: the web integrator, an expert in HTML developing websites populating the global web. The CSS still had little choice for a complete presentation and supported by the majority of browsers. The technologies and the context have evolved a lot, completely transforming the work of the Web integrator who has gradually turned into a \"front-end developer\". Today, this developer has many skills. He masters at least the HTML, CSS and Javascript technologies. It must anticipate proposals and changes to a website. But what is his future? What does the Internet of tomorrow have for it? Let's return first to some facts demonstrating the evolution of technologies through their own evolution but also through usage trends. By simplifying Moore's law, we know that the power of computers doubles every two years, and with a frequency tending towards 18 months. By extrapolating this law a bit and applying it to the world of the Web, we can see that today's Internet is much larger and more present in our world than it was only four years ago. FACT 1: THE NUMBER OF CONNECTED DEVICES HAS INCREASED DRAMATICALLY AND THEIR USE HAS EXPANDED TO MANY POSSIBILITIES. We notice an evolution of the type of terminals and the type of use. The remaining smart watches are the most widespread and versatile at the moment.  FACT 2: THE USE OF CONNECTED DATA IS BECOMING MORE PREVALENT OVER THE GENERATIONS. Another fact that remains well known to all front-end developers, the multitude of screen sizes tends to make our work flexible to the smallest detail . And the arrival of connected objects, including smartwatches and smart TVs to name just the latest, will not make any difference. The Internet is changing, and for cost reasons, the front-end developer will have to adapt to help his company and its customers to get out of the website. He will have to become a multi-platform developer. For that it will have to take into account the accessibility, to optimize the performances, to make the structure adaptable according to different contexts, to make that the rendering is optimized whatever the terminal used. Although the majority of these requirements are already current whatever the field of development, they will become more and more important as regards the development of the web. A technology watch is now inseparable from a developer profile with a future in the field. We notice one thing since a few months, even years, the languages \u200b\u200bused today on the development \"front-end\" become more and more universal. The proof is the use of hybrid applications since the appearance of HTML5 / CSS3 coupled with Javascript. By using a technology exclusively for the web linked to a language of \"transition\", we manage to create applications for specific terminals. We can find today the use of these technologies in connected watches, connected TVs or the \"Google Glass\" (glasses connected by Google). Nevertheless this opening hides a return of the stick which is that a large number of libraries and \"frameworks\" emerge every year, and to learn to use them at the right moment will quickly become a pre-requisite. The multi-platform developer will have to be very versatile. Nevertheless, a developer can not be expert of all these new \"frameworks\" and so the specializations will always be important, it will be necessary to choose the right combination to be competitive on the market to come. WHAT FUTURE? The developer \"front-end\" will have to leave his comfort zone and evolve. His transformation will lead him to many challenges, both technical and human. Its core business will be merged more and more with that of the developer \"back-end\" to form a versatile business and able to adapt to all the requirements of the technologies of tomorrow. However, the multi-platform developer will not be the ideal Swiss army knife for any business, a complete team will always be more balanced and innovative. In particular, we will find one or more \"Big Data\" experts to make the most of this Internet of Things that is starting to emerge. ",

Brain you, it isn't in every case simple to be hopeful. I as of late went to a workshop with the splendid John Coyle who stated, \"today is the slowest day of a mind-blowing remainder\". The movement at which we must adjust to change is, as a matter of fact, alarming. Yet, here is the uplifting news. What's to come is brilliant for the individuals who can adjust, and web engineers \u2014 the great ones at any rate \u2014 are exceptionally versatile: We continually need to revive our abilities. We ceaselessly learn new structures. When we learn one programming language, we've demonstrated to ourselves that we can get another. We will in general be very much educated, can envision drifts, and can enable ourselves to take the correct activities for our professions. Here's a model: a companion of mine was laid off from her corporate part as an IT supervisor. She was truly worn out by then and didn't have any desire to secure another corporate position, so she earned a declaration in moral hacking. Added to her MBA, she is presently sought after as an online teacher and has a bigger number of solicitations to instruct courses than she can deal with. The uplifting news, however, is that you needn't bother with a MBA to re-compose your future. I as of late went to a meeting on network safety and discovered that there won't be sufficient digital protection experts to fill those functions in ten years. Huge numbers of the parts in this field have a generally safe of computerization. The colleges in my general vicinity are in any event, beginning to offer authentications and M. S. Processing degrees in digital protection. I think we'll keep on observing open doors like these, for example, 5-course declarations, that will qualify us for new jobs. Digital protection and moral hacking are only two models, and they address the open doors that are accessible to the individuals who are happy to learn new aptitudes and maybe gain a declaration in another control. The takeaway: With constant change comes new and maybe surprisingly better chances. It's additionally useful to arm yourself with realities. Discover what recruiting administrators are searching for. Which abilities will make you generally important? Converse with selection representatives and administrators. Discover what's required and endeavor to pick up the correct abilities and make yourself an esteemed supporter of a group. In the event that you can do that now and keep on adjusting as necessities and requests change, your future, regardless of whether you are a web engineer or you advance into another region, will be brilliant for sure.

            "answer_text": "Web development is an entire field in itself. So you can make career out of it. Many of the big computer companies(Facebook, Google etc.) are internet based in some or the other way. In some years you will not have any operating system on your computer. All you will be needed to have a computer(hardware) and internet. So practically everything will be based on internet in the coming years(they are almost today also). But you have to understand something that although these big shots started web company but the work they now do is more on the algorithmic side and system level(for better throughput and efficiency). The algorithm they design affects the system but not changes anything on the upper layer of web except better form of data. Web is just a platform to interact with, so obviously you can be a developer of it as they do need people who can handle the data. I would say start your career as a web developer but go towards the system. Peel the layers starting with the top, web development, and understand through it how system is affecting this layer. If you are interested in web development, sure you will come down to the system level at some point of time because you will like to improve what you will be building. And without understanding the upper layer you cannot understand the lower layer as well and going to the system level will take time as it is dependent on your requirement/necessity.  You can create many things with your knowledge of web development and it might be possible that you will not be needed to understand the system. There are many web developers, obviously web based companies employ them, so you can be one of them. ",

The Need to Know More Languages and Technologies web development framework that I feel skyrocketing popularity in future : Express is quickly becoming one of the most trending frameworks nowadays. It is used by Accenture, IBM and Uber, and many other companies.Django is a Model-View-Template framework that uses Python for web development. It\u2019s used by some of the big names such as Google, Youtube, and Instagram. Django boasts its batteries-included feature, which is the bunch of features such as authentication and messaging that Django comes bundled with. It follows the Convention Over Configuration pattern.React is not a framework, it\u2019s a frontend library, but many developers consider it a framework and it\u2019s usually compared in that context. React was the first to adopt the component-based architecture that Angular and Vue and many other frameworks started to adopt later on. React\u2019s virtual dom makes the dom manipulation much faster and it\u2019s quite easy to pick up, especially thanks to its JSX syntax. React could be used server side or client side. It was developed and maintained by Facebook and it\u2019s used by Facebook and Instagram.Angular is a frontend framework that specializes in building rich Single-Page applications. It\u2019s a very rich framework able to build complete client-side applications and there\u2019s so much to do and learn in Angular. Angular 1.x used Javascript, but later releases adopted Typescript, which is a superset of Javascript. Angular\u2019s main cons are its size compared to other frameworks, and the fact it\u2019s not SEO friendly by nature, though it can be SEO optimized. Angular was developed by Google, and it\u2019s used by Google, Microsoft, and Paypal.Vue is the new rising star, it started as an individual project and quickly grew into becoming one of the most trending JS frameworks out there. There are many cool things about Vue, first, it\u2019s a progressive framework, which means that if you have an existing project, you can adopt Vue for one portion of the project and everything would work just fine. Second, it also brings along the component architecture to play, and the Vue ecosystem can help you build complete frontend applications. Some people are wary of using Vue since it\u2019s not supported by a big company like Facebook or Google, but that\u2019s quickly changing as big names are starting to invest in Vue.Ember possesses the two-way data binding that Angular boasts and it comes with a lot of features and components that you can use out of the box. It\u2019s being used by Google, Microsoft, Heroku, and Netflix. Ember revolves around the developer\u2019s productivity and attempts to maximize it by either eliminating the need for time-wasting activities or adopting some JS best practices in its core design.Backbone is an extremely light frontend framework that\u2019s fit for building rich Single-Page applications. It follows an MV* pattern and partly implements the MVC design.",

            "answer_text": "Most companies seeking an online presence in the early days of the internet needed to use traditional development in the form of old-fashioned waterfall web design. The cascading approach was often slow, sequential, and tedious, requiring every step of the project to be completed separately and individually in a linear, lengthy fashion. Owing to such complications, developers began increasingly adopting agile web development (AWD) methodology. Instead of releasing the entire project all at once, it involves breaking a project into smaller chunks of modules that can be rolled out live one by one. Why Choose AWD Along with increasing productivity, AWD helps in improving website and software delivery success rates, allowing developers to be nimble, and facilitating IT synergy. The agile approach provides the benefit of getting feedback of a small piece of the work from real users in an early stage. It reduces the development risk and helps organizations to avoid the expensive process of redeveloping the project from scratch. AWD is also known for enabling companies to challenge certain challenges regarding a project at every stage of the development process. Making a number of smaller decisions can allow developers to identify if their audience approves of the project. Making Agile Work for the Organization Despite these challenges, industry experts have cautioned organizations about discarding agile methodology. Instead, they suggest trying to tweak and adapt the methodology as needed to work to the organization\u2019s advantage. This hints at implementing a strategy, which is a combination of the best elements of the waterfall and agile methodologies. Such an approach can help companies define the scope of the projects upfront and tackle problems seamlessly. It has become paramount to empower employees with the right tools to succeed and appoint champions who think in an agile manner. Read more\u2026 ",

            "answer_text": "For the next five years, I think yesterday\u2019s weather is the best guide. More of the same. Better APIs that conquer more of the territory that native has had to itself for a while, while retaining the cross-platform, productive, free-platform appeal of the web. That has remained a winning strategy for many/most software users, even at the time when the split between native and web performance was the greatest. And now it\u2019s smaller than its ever been. Have you used the web on an iPhone 7? It\u2019s fucking amazing. I must admit that when we saw what the JavaScript performance looked like in 2012\u20132014, it was fair to have some worries over whether the open web would be able to stand a chance against the walled mobile gardens. But when you look at just how insanely much faster and better we\u2019ve gotten in just the last 3\u20135 years, it\u2019s never been easier to have hope and to invest in that hope. Beyond five years? Who the hell knows. ",

            "answer_text": "For website developers, they will exist for as long as people need websites. Technology is always changing, and the websites we build need to keep up with the technology. AI might eventually become important here, but I can\u2019t see an AI website developer any time soon. I can\u2019t go much further than a few years, because I don\u2019t have a crystal ball. The current trends seem to be towards \u201cmobile first\u201d development. This is where websites are developed to work on mobile phones, then scaled up to fit on larger screens. Previously things were done the other way around; we\u2019d make websites that are built for big screens and then try to work out how to cram them onto a mobile phone. There\u2019s a good reason for this. In 2015 Ofcom declared that \u201cThe UK is now a smartphone society\u201d. There is similar data from most other developed countries. Since mobile phones, and the infrastructure to support them, are cheaper than full blown computers, they are taking off in a big way in the developing world. It looks like mobile first is going to be the default for a long time. A device that everyone in the world can have with them 24/7 is always going to be a good place to start when building a website. What about the future? Well, Virtual Reality is the obvious answer. Whether it will take off in a big way or not I don\u2019t know, but I think it will be close to a decade before VR is anything more than a fancy toy with very low adoption. ",

            "answer_text": "Hi, This is a very sensitive topic and the revolutionary technologies changes day by day. The website is the face and an integral part of any business. The future and scope of web development and design are also growing at a rapid pace. The website is so ingrained in our daily lives. Not surprisingly, no company operates without a website: banks, companies, etc. Web developers are getting used to new frameworks, tools, and techniques to create more robust sites. Web development is growing rapidly with new emerging technologies. In this article, we will discuss the latest trends in web development. Let's explore how the web fabric will create more space, with new trends in web development in 2017 and new trends that will capture or dominate shortly. Artificial Intelligence (AI) Artificial intelligence is the future trend of the web development space. This is justified by the fact that much progress and progress has been made in the field of Artificial Intelligence (AI). Large companies such as Google and Microsoft have launched their artificial intelligence technology for the public. You can create your custom websites with the power of AI. Grid of an AI that makes web design based on its content. It does not imply any template or coding, you just have to tell the grid what you want and use artificial intelligence to create a tabular content. Virtual Reality (VR) Web VR is a new feature of the web browser used by several major web browsing providers, including Mozilla, Microsoft, and Google, all of which help define the functionality and future of how virtual reality can be integrated into the experience. Web navigation. Virtual reality activates web content created with JavaScript and manages the very simple devices available. Web VR is being implemented at the forefront of existing browser technologies, Web VR retains many features that make the Web an excellent platform for content. Easy access, simple URLs without downloading, anyone can create and distribute content without going through an app store. Virtual reality has reached the space of the game and will soon expand to other areas. Internet of things (IoT) The Internet of Things (IoT) is the interconnection through the Internet of computer devices to objects that we use daily, such as industrial machines, devices, objects, digital devices, and even animals, equipped with sensors. Unique identification To collect the data, they are transferred to a network without human interaction or human-machine interaction. Web developers are not directly related to IoT, very soon they will participate in the development of web applications necessary for the analysis and the data necessary for their operations. Few companies have begun to use programming interfaces (APIs) used by web developers by communicating with the Internet of Things (IoT). IoT is expected to grow soon, but web developers facing piracy problems can face serious concerns and serious challenges. 360-degree video The 360-degree video provides an incredibly improved user experience that helps improve web design and development. It is guaranteed that 360 degrees will attract more attention, thus improving the interaction to get more views. MOVEMENT UI (USER INTERFACE MOVEMENT) Motion UI is a SaaS library commonly used in custom CSS. It allows web developers to create attractive designs with a transition and unique animations that improve the appearance of the website and make the user interested in reading. It is compatible with the JavaScript animation library, which is a key advantage. Simplicity is the main feature of the Motion user interface. The new tools simplify the work of a web developer. The days when a web designer used flat designs and flashy animations are over. ",

            "answer_text": "Good Question Actually. Cant explain within Quora. I have added a detailed article here. You can check it out if you have some time  Much has changed in the last 20 years, but few things have undergone so many changes as web development. We go through several phases, often so different, that it is unimaginable that it is the same story. The past The past of the web, for those who experienced this era, seems to have occurred yesterday. Sites flickered, things jumped on screen or screen, we checked with users if their browsers could display images - marquee, blink, image map - web interfaces looked more like a lively party than a place where information and links to more information. After this stage, we entered into another one, which, despite having played an important role in the growth of the web itself, was extremely complicated for development. Who has not seen it certainly heard of the browser war - Microsoft Internet Explorer versus Netscape Navigator, JavaScript versus JScript. This competition has brought important advances, but also many problems. Among the most notorious is the lack of compatibility of the technologies used. We no longer checked whether the user's browser had a particular feature. We started developing for specific browsers. We checked for screen resolution if the user was using Internet Explorer and the browser version. We have come to the point of restricting access to content, based on the tool that the user used. It was a dark phase. Urgent intervention was needed. It was necessary for the competition to bring advances rather than constraints. It was necessary for an organization to promote standardization. The Present Perhaps the biggest breakthrough in web development was the October 1994 W3C foundation. If we have today SVG, PNG, HTML, XHTML, XML, CSS, DOM, RDF, SOAP, and several others, and these formats work equally on almost any device, we owe this to W3C. The main purpose of the entity, which is to promote standardization and interoperability, has been achieved. Development has become simpler, precisely because of this standardization. If we now have the possibility of an agnostic development, we must thank the W3C for the standardization work done at the time of those 20 years. I wonder how development would be today if we were still developing as before. If we checked whether the user had the Flash plugin installed, or if it had a screen resolution of 1024 \u00d7 768 pixels, how would we do it today? We are no longer able to do this kind of verification. Today, access to applications comes from a variety of sources and devices. If we were to check each one, our applications would be pretty much a gigantic conditional structure, with different paths and branches for each type of access source. No, we do not need it any more.  The future Although the semantic web is already a current topic and we are already developing applications with this concern, I believe that much will still happen. Processors like TrueNorth, recently introduced by IBM, will become reality in a short time. Machines will come to understand, in fact, the content we produce. And if machines can understand the meaning of things, they can, for example, increase the accessibility of content. One of the biggest difficulties I see today is offering the content to a user who has a special need. We already have standardization and specifications in this regard, but how do we produce content for someone who has a different experience? How can we deliver the best experience for those who do not see, hear, or have any other special needs? I believe that when we give semantic meaning to the content and comprehension capacity of the machines, we take a step towards more accessible content. Semantics is already a reality, but I believe that accessibility to content, regardless of the origin of the access, of the difficulties that the user has, will be the reality in the near future. Conclusion By analyzing the past and the present of web development, the technological advances and the diverse possibilities of access to the content that we have today, it is somewhat complicated to predict the future. Much has changed in 20 years and will certainly change much more quickly in the next 20 years. What is easy to notice, however, is that web development is now much easier. And it is much easier, because today we have a much greater probability of the means of access to content to be made by a standardized technology. If we have standardization and a greater ease of development, we also have much better access experiences than we have ever had. ",

It is used for doing lots of activities such as shopping, banking, information gathering and lots more. Due to higher access of websites, the demand of web development witnessed a major boost. We are going to discuss here some cutting edge technologies that are taking web app development to the next level. IoT Internet of Things has emerged as an important technology involved a great connection of certain non-internet connected things like they can send and obtain information. These important things are blenders, kettles, toasters and lots more. So, the web developer concentrates on developing apps that can provide support in their operations. Though the technology seems to witness a major boost, security is its core concern. SPWs SPW (Single Page Website) is in a huge trend nowadays and gaining a major attention from visitors. A large number of websites nowadays follow these concepts to develop simple, effective and responsive websites. Such website in fact uses a single HTML page with full accessibility of content in a long scroll-able page. Chatbots Chatbots offers some great opportunities for businesses to grow adequately. Earlier, the use of messenger was limited only to social media networks. With immense popularity of messaging feature, a large number of websites adopted it to refine the experience of visitors. AI & VR AI (Artificial Intelligence) brought a big revolution in web app development. The technology is easy to access, which prompts numbers of developers use it efficiently to reap numerous advantages. VR (Virtual Reality) is mostly used in developing gaming world is expected to grow further in this industry. It is expected that VR will be utilized efficiently to make apps more effective and providing a unique experience to visitors. ",

Every big company is building their own technology for web development internally and releasing to public, later. Angular js was developed by Google and made public, and become popular because the advantages. Later they released angular, which is server side Javascript framework. Same way Facebook also developing react js. New technologies are coming, that means one need to update even with out the help from employer, otherwise might be difficult to survive in future because of following reasons : Nowadays companies are looking for self learners, do not want to spend much in learning process.They want to recruit with work experience in that technology, if you already upgraded, you can take that project and become center point in company.There is no scarcity for web developers, if you want to lead, learn new things and try new things.From few months, when I start knowing about automation, I doubted programming also get automated. But programming can't be automated, but may be certain parts of it is automated and every client have requirements in his own way. So nobody can build complete automation for web development. We are safe. For example, Wordpress can be used by clients to build their own websites because of themes and plugins available in market. But why they are looking for developers? They need new features and customization, which can't be just created using plugins. They need help of developers. :-) Coming to AI, if you know web development, you can survive working in AI industry. Python can be used for web development and machine learning also. Don't stick to single technology, learn different technologies and try them to get experience at least to survive in future. ",

The web development services is evolving at such a rapid pace that it\u2019s far more practical to focus on developing a strong foundation. This obviously doesn\u2019t mean the future scope of web development isn\u2019t important. So long as you\u2019re thinking about it for the right reasons, it can be fun and exciting to look ahead and make bold predictions about the future of programming. I mention this in other answers, but here are a few things I see on the horizon: ES6 is the future of web development. With JavaScript now dominating the lives of tons of web developers, its future is bright. ES6 is a superset of JavaScript, and it\u2019s pretty clear that ES6 is the future of the internet. It supports a lot of features that make it a really enjoyable programming language to use. It includes a lot of forward-thinking ideas in addition to concepts that are easy to understand from a traditional object-oriented programming background. Reacts will start a revolution. React and Flux have sparked a conversation around the idea of components, or small, reusable widgets of web applications that are easy to build out. In the next couple years, developers will experiment with ways to accomplish componentization, which could fundamentally change web development as we know it. Learning development skills will become easier and more accessible than ever. Technology has only made education more and more accessible and optimized. It\u2019s becoming easier than ever to learn new skills from world-class experts, get personal and individualized instruction at your convenience, and find a community of people with similar aspirations and struggles.

Serverless architectures will also grow hugely, resulting in consolidated providers of such infrastructures. The API approach will further grow and expand, more and more services will be restful and we will see more and more products combining APIs to deliver functionalities they would have coded themselves in the past Machine learning will continue to gain ground and improve, but not to the point where it drives much - rather as an auxiliary in increasing domains. Accessibility will become increasingly significant as a design criterion. JavaScript will continue to dominate, and innovate, and in conjunction with the Web Api will increasingly power lower level applications (think Web Assembly, PWA mobile access, etc) Socio-political expectations, regulations and concerns will impinge increasingly on how we architect our apps Specific technologies PWAs will gain a lot of ground as the Web Api increases its reach and reliability, but native will remain No-code platforms will continue to grow and innovate, from website building to chatbot scripting to machine learning design and training. Chatbots and conversational agents will become more powerful and voice will be a bigger part of them The context and politics of web development The opportunities and ethical challenges of behavioural engineering and persuasion technologies will gain much more attention in the public mind, privacy, influence operations, and the partial monopolies of the Big companies will come under yet more scrutiny. Regulation will increase for web giants, in both volume, depth and geographic spread, offering new protections, creating new burdens and both stifling and stimulating innovation and competition. Digital inequalities will become more and more impactful. The Global South, and Africa in particular, will drive significant innovation in mobile applications. Digital natives, now in their teens, will lead the next wave of innovation, particularly in social technologies Web based political activism and participation will increase not just in quantity but specially in sophistication, and the web will facilitate the emergence of significant political movements that are not party based or party focused yet have electoral impacts. We will see more independents winning elections on the back of viral media and participatory technologies. ",

There will always be a need for problem \u2018seers\u2019 and solvers. You need anticipate, be ready and able to CHANGE. I remember when our grocery store upgraded to its first computerized cash registers. The older cashiers were absolutely lost. I was a bag boy at the time and since I was getting into computers they asked me to help do the training. I was quickly promoted to cashier and then into a management position. I was at another company and they implemented a new software which would encompass all of the operations. Sounds good right? Well\u2026. the software was built by a very brilliant engineer and it could manage any type of industry-related business, and it was NOT user-friendly. Since it was so \u2018flexible\u2019 it had minimal built in reports and forms so I was tasked with learning Crystal Reports in order to create new templates and forms for everything our company did. The manual for CR was the size of a college text book! Now, being in the web design/marketing industry a big part of maintaining a successful company is keeping up to date with developments. Social Media took off then Mobile devices took off and now Voice Search is taking off and\u2026 what\u2019s next? Bottom line: You should know your strengths so compliment those with a solid understanding of business along with at least a BS degree in your field of choice. ALWAYS be learning something new and in all types of subjects. ",

            "answer_text": "I have my own ideas some times. But, I would say that the HTML format and the form entry methodology is a really based on really old ideas from forty years ago. AI is an avenue for browsers to go down. People have researched things such as question answer systems for years. And, speech and vision or getting better support in browsers, slowly. So, there can be a browser that sort of knows you and you can talk to it. Maybe the idea of browsing is a little archaic. I was thinking of fusion points. Maybe no one makes a web page any more. Maybe the browser in its great desire to please its user assembles information that the user might like in ways that makes the user happy. Maybe the browser introduces you to people who you enjoy or who might do business with you. Maybe it makes formal introductions as if you were at a business meeting. The idea of public domain sim-worlds seems likely. Instead of single organizations owning sim-worlds. The sim-worlds can be shared in a pastiche within a browser, where anyone can own a part of the sim-world in the same manner as owning a web page. Peer-to-peer may become the norm as opposed to the included functionality. And, single pages might exists just for special cases where meaning is required. If HTML alongside text were discarded in support of some grander as a type of media, then search engines would need to adjust or perhaps replaced. The point is search should progress faster towards semantic search than it really is, making text oriented search to your history of things such as for example buggy whips. At the very least, HTML is actually an end space for much better means of providing content. It is certainly a pervasive temporary fix. But, eventually, it will have to give solution to other stuff.

Artificial intelligence.The \u201csmart\u201d technologies are the future of the whole world. It has been displayed in any field for several decades. As soon as physical strength began to be replaced by robots, the greatest minds began to work on the full automation of our lives. AI facilitates simplifies any action very much. First of all, it will be widely used during the development of web services. Programmers know that most of the actions can be safely transferred to the robot without loss of quality. However, the deadlines will be significantly reduced. Additionally, AI will be implemented in finished products with user orientation. Frameworks. For the web service to work perfectly, good \u201cground\u201d is needed. Its part is the developmental environment. React and Vue are the foundation of all front-end development. React is today the most requested framework in most companies. For a long time he competed with Angular. But the developers claim that Angular significantly sucks in efficiency.Svelte.js is a framework that is almost unknown today. But many developers express a desire to work with it. It is likely that he will shoot the same as Vue. Adaptability. We are using smartphones and tablets more and more, because their functionality and performance are much higher. If we talk about the use of web applications, mobile phones are in no way inferior to computers. Any web application must easily adapt to any device, from appearance to functionality. It is important not to create two versions of the site, because in this case, inaccuracies will be noticeable. It is necessary to develop one version that adapts to the workspace. Single Page Sites. We notice the effectiveness of single-page sites constantly. As soon as such sites have appeared, users said that this was due to the indifference of developers to their projects. However, over time, the benefits of such sites have been recognized. First of all, they allow you to save development resources. Secondly, such pages load much faster. A modern user really appreciates his time, because he can\u2019t wander around the site for information for a long time. Single page sites are not a new trend. But it is gaining more and more popularity. If you implement other trends on it, such as interactivity and voice search, you can achieve a huge conversion. Therefore, this is the future of web development. ",

Everyone is all caught up with technology this and technology that. We knew in the 1980\u2019s that the communications infrastructure would not support the full capabilities of the internet and we had to wait until it caught up. Well, smartphones and the wireless technology has caught up. FINALLY You will see consolidation and centralization of technical services. All websites do the same thing so why not consolidate. EXAMPLE: In the beginning all companies had their own payroll department that was not cost effective. ADP now does most of large corporations payroll. We are moving to a service based structure, you pay for the services you need. It costs less than doing it in-house. AMP technology is simplification of web development. No need for these high priced developers. Cutting payroll cost tracks straight to a company's bottom-line. AMAZON has the datacenters that are the backbone of the internet. You buy time based on usage. Cost cutting again. Last point, remember the internet bubble burst. That\u2019s where this is headed. ",

This would let the site owners design an incredible immersive experience for their customers, and customers would have a way better idea of what they are ordering. Perhaps there could even be shopping malls where you walk into stores, see other customers shopping, and meet up with a good friend. It could also be a future generation of Google street view ;) Then site owners could collaborate/compete to give the customers the best virtual experience. Dating sites would definitely find a use for the technology. I believe VR is likely too computationally expensive for this to happen in the next 5 years, but somewhere down the line, it seems plausible. Perhaps it will come with brain-machine interfaces at some point. We would float in and out of worlds, blurring the line between virtual and reality. ",

Thing is, a business website still holds its importance; therefore, is still far from becoming an obsolete trend in the tech world. Web development will continue to hold importance in following areas in near future: 1) Google AMP: Mobile usage of the internet is increasing constantly, and the concept of Google\u2019s AMP-based mobile website has come forward to deliver a lightning fast mobile usage experience. However, its implementation is still not widely adopted (due to SEO related concerns). As the AMP platform will become more SEO-friendly, we will continue to see web development opportunities in this segment. 2) SSL and HTTPS: SSL (Secure Socket Layer) and HTTPS (Hyper Text Transfer Protocol Secure) hardly need any introduction today, but will continue to stay relevant to make website secure against future\u2019s unforeseen threats. So, further improvement in that regard will continue to be necessary. 3) JavaScript: JavaScript is the current trending framework. JavaScript sub-frameworks (Angular and Node) are expected to additionally become more adaptable and capable in the years ahead. 4) Ecommerce Web Development: Ecommerce website development has kept on growing - especially through third-party feature & technology integration. And it will continue to stay a hot web development area in coming years. 5) Multilingual Websites: Businesses are finally beginning to unlock the true potential of world-wide-web \u2013 a global reach through their website; thus, are increasingly implementing the multilingual feature on their website. In near future, development of multilingual websites will continue to become more and more mainstream. ",

As you will see from the two graphical representations, in 2017 there are more applicants than there are positions in the Web Development industry (according to Job Search | Indeed ). While this means that over time more and more people have embarked on the Web Development career path and positions available within the industry have slowly declined, this should not discourage you in your pursuit. A great number of industries have this trend - where applicants far outweigh the available positions in the respective industry. But at the end of the day, if you are good at your profession & can convey your skills through working examples I think you will be fine. Build a Portfolio of all your projects !!! An added benefit of this profession is that you can work remotely as a Freelancer - in this scenario your Portfolio becomes even more important. Hope this helps & Good Luck ",

Google is the only one company that seems like it really looks forward to continue evolving Browser. Web development is still growing and evolving more quickly than native app technologies. It looks like those native app technologies cannot overcome the browser because of competition among device vendors. Everyone can hate client side development, but it evolves crazy fast.

But what exactly is its scope, salary, how to get started as a web developer is all blurry with so many languages,frameworks and tools out there. This blog is meant to answer all the questions linked with being a web developer in India. What exactly is web development? Web development simply means creating websites. Now, this web development also involves two part - front end and backend development. Front end developers are responsible for all the things a user sees when he opens a website (more on this below) and backend is what actually makes front-end possible and where the data is stored. Full stack developers on the other hand are one who knows both front-end and backend. Now, its still shady so let's look at it in bit more detail. Front-end web development: Whenever we visit any website- images, links, login forms etc all comes under front-end web development. Though there are basically three languages to build them HTML(Now HTML5)- to build basic components of a webpage like table, forms, insert images, CSS(Now CSS3) for pure styling purpose, and Javascript to include every logical thing i.e code. But creating a website from the scratch using them would be a lot more complex. So we have frameworks to ease out this process. Some of the most famous and in demand front-end frameworks are: Bootstrap, Angular Js, React.Js Back-end web development: Backend coding is a technique used in web development which involves employing scripts on a web server which produce a response customized for each user's (client's) request to the website. Some of the most in-demand server side frameworks are: Laravel, Node js, ruby on rails, .Net Framework . Database: This is where actually the data received by user and in other backend operations is stored. Some of the commonly used databases are: MongoDB, NoSQL, MySQL Content Management System and other designing tools: Wordpress, Joomla are two most commonly used cms to create a website and are in demand too. SEO, content writer, adobe photoshop expert are some of the additional tools a web developer should have. Web development as a career in India: Web development has a huge scope in India and has equal opportunities across the country. As an intern (college intern or 6 month intern in a company) starting would be between 5k to 10k per month(which is pretty low). After 6 month-2 year you can get around 15K-30K per month. And after 3 -4 years anywhere around 6lpa-10lpa. So, yes starting is indeed slow and requires a lot of patience but still is a great career option and if you are good and land up in product based company one can get 7 digit figure too.

And I expect this to happen soon\u2026 I\u2019m referring mainly to the request - response cycle. Modern complex applications are quite hard to develop - AJAX, web sockets & push technologies and whole bunch of JavaScript frameworks & libraries are all trying to work around the limitations of the current web paradigm. This leads to unnecessary complications and limitations, when implementing feature rich apps. I expect that web applications will work more like desktop / GUI apps in the future, or at least the networking protocols will change to support easier & transparent communication in both directions - server to client and client to server.

One of the latest implementations of AI is Grid, which makes web development a straightforward process and kicks off content-based development. Now, a web developer should have what it takes to build innovative, out-of-the-box websites, and applications. While it is possible to have a career in web development in 2020, the process is more complicated than you might think. however, it is easy to learn and use, which is why it remains an option for some developers.  Web development is constantly evolving with the advancement of technology. While we can't see this on a daily basis, it's easy for us to look back and see how things have turned out. But given the fast-paced nature of this industry, and of course the competition, it's important to stay on top of the latest technology and tools to always look your best. ",
