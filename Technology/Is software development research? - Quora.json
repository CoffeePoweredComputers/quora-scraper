I believe that good software that enables research is required, important and not as well appreciated as it should be, so we need more software people.  If you're implementing algorithms then you're probably on the research end of things.  You are part of the research effort, even if strictly you are not solving any specific biological problems. One thing you can do, if you are interested, is do some research projects on the side, e.g. developing some new algorithms, or using the software you are developing to do some small scale research.
