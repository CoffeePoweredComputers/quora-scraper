            "answer_text": "Coding is just the implementation of problem solving. Learning a syntax in itself isn\u2019t meaningful or hard. Since a 4 year old can\u2019t read or write particularly well, typing correct syntax on a computer is not really an option. As the mother of a 4 year old myself, I\u2019m just trying to get her over her distaste of lower case letters, never mind tracking down a missed semicolon or cryptic compiler errors. Teach problem solving skills. Don\u2019t solve their problems for them that they are capable of solving for themselves. Ask them to try different solutions. Discuss why one worked and the other didn\u2019t. Question assumptions they are making. Don\u2019t ever tell them their idea is stupid, ask them why they think it will work Often, the underlying logic is sound. Be very patient. They are amazing little logicians. I have found the issue is not usually their logic, but their underlying assumptions and lack of experience. Problem solving is a hard and frustrating skill to learn. Help them move past that frustration. That\u2019s 90% of the battle, managing that frustration (even as adults). Allow them time to walk away and come back to it. I can\u2019t tell you how many times my daughter has emerged from her room, finger in the air declaring, \u201cI have an idea\u201d in response to a problem we had discussed earlier in the day. The kids that end up in computer science are the ones that become obsessed with solving a problem, won\u2019t let it go until it\u2019s solved just for the joy of solving it and won\u2019t get discouraged by the repeated failures. In a lot of ways, kids are already like this because they know there is so much of the world they don\u2019t understand and have a primal need to figure it out. We just have to nurture it and more importantly, model it. Let them in on your attempts, failures (most important), lessons learned and eventual successes. It will be annoying. Think putting together unfamiliar, complicated IKEA furniture with the help of a small child kind of annoying but that\u2019s what\u2019s required. You are showing by example that there aren\u2019t people who just \u201cknow\u201d things, and figuring things out is a skill that anyone can learn and then let them watch you do it. After that, coding constructs aren\u2019t hard to learn. Binary logic lessons can be accomplished through everyday communication. You\u2019d be surprised how quickly they realize that if you say, \u201cIf it is sunny today and you clean up we will go to the park otherwise we will stay home\u201d and they see it is not sunny, they won\u2019t clean up because why bother or try to turn the and into an or. Teach sequences of steps; recipes are great for that. It becomes quickly obvious why instructions need to be done in the right order. Loops are also easy. Do something until, do it 10 times, etc. You can extract reusable instructions to solve other problems. Recipes are also great for that. Pie crust is a subroutine of pumpkin pie. It has its own recipe and is used by other recipes. Start describing solutions as a combination of these constructs. At this age, you don\u2019t need to teach coding as much as create a curious, problem solving environment so that when they do learn the basics of actual coding, it will seem intuitive to them and give them the skills to approach new problems. On the down side, \u201cbecause I said so\u201d will never work again. ",

            "answer_text": "It\u2019s probably early for coding, but you can expose them to key concepts they can build on. Here are some ideas: Get a simple electronics kit that will allow them to wire up simple circuits with LED lights and motors.Let them have a cheap toy PC they can bang on and run simple apps for drawing, making music, etc.Let them take apart broken electronics and appliances.Train tracks and road toys instill the concept of circuits and objects that work within a system.As they get older, let them program stuff around the house, like the thermostat, sprinkler system, refrigerator, toaster, over, etc. Many appliances are programmable now.Let them order and arrange your closets, pantry, etc. Teach them how to fold and sort laundry. Being able to sort and categorize is an important fundamental skill.Encourage them to invent solutions to their problems, even if the inventions are silly. This is the essential work of any programmer.If there is anything in your house that can be customized, encourage them to customize it. Let them pick colors and designs, decals, arrangements, etc.If your car has removable seats, let them experiment with different arrangements.Teach them how to operate machines.Teach them how to use the remote control. Show them how you can turn your phone into a remote control.Encourage them to play with physical toys that explore cause and effect. Especially toys when something falls or moves and causes some other action to happen.Teach them how to follow a recipe.Explore every nook and cranny of the house together. Talk about what each part of the house is good for or could be good for.Teach them how to use a lock and key.Teach them how to pick a lock.Get a simple bike combination lock, the kind with three wheels, and show them how to discover the combination by trying all the numbers.Take the cover off an old printer so they can see what it does when it prints.Take apart a hard drive to see what is inside.That\u2019s all for now. The basic idea is to encourage them to explore beyond the boundaries of what they are \u201csupposed\u201d to do. Computer programmers have to be creative all the time. ",
