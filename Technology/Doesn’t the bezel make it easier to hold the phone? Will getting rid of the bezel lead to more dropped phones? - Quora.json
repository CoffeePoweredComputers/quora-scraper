            "answer_text": "To a certain extent, yes. Bezels provide vital surface area to hold the phone without creating spurious input. In today\u2019s world of increasingly tiny bezels, device manufacturers have compensated for the difficulty with gripping the device with some software that prevents the device from interpreting your grip as erroneous input. Having a good case will mitigate the issue of touching the display inadvertently and will make it more difficult to fumble. ",

            "answer_text": "How do you hold your phone. If its held with the fingers rapping around the edge then there needs to be a dead zone. Also you need the microphone and speaker on the front, its a phone after all. If they made the entire front live then I think you are correct that there would be dropped phones unless you put one of those popup rings on the back or have it in a covered case, oh wait how does it stay in the case?
