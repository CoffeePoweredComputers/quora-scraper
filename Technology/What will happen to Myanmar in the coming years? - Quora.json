            "answer_text": "In my recent visit to Myanmar, I finally came to understand why all Burmese would \u2013 one day \u2013 want to return to their motherland, despite being able to find work/jobs in highly developed societies: The air was clean, fresh and great outside of the capital of Yangon, away from the roads, which were frequently dusty and noisy.Myanmar has a variety of geograpgical features ranging from mountainous highlands and plateaus, to a rather impressive coastline of beaches and plains.Food was naturally organic, fresh, pesticide free, and genetically unmodified. The selection of local fishes was great, especially with the plethora of side dishes served with a meal that could rival the side dishes served along a Korean meal.The society was rather insular, with their own unique language, national dress and culture, and somewhat similar to Japan.Myanmar is their home and will always be their home in terms of identity, and Myanmar has everything to be quite self-sufficient for that idealistic lifestyle which makes a great place to retire.And with the wave of new knowledge acquired, it is possible that Myanmar can be developed the right way without the expense of its natural resources and national identity, with the homecoming of millions of overseas Burmese. The future is hence bright, as developments and investments pour in at break-neck speed. Hopefully though, Myanmar will learn from the shortcomings of other nations\u2019 development and its future would be: Without pollutive industries that release an unlimited amount of pollutants into the atmosphere as Myanmar develops, leading to health problems of its local population.Without the exploitation of its forests and waterways in the quest for energy.Without bias to the external world where foreigners are to continue to pay more, nor xenophobic with much of its population exposed to life overseas.Without aggression for supremacy in the region in terms of defense and economics.With a high regard for the natural and the built environments.With absolute transparency, accountability in national developmentWith frequent dialogue and cooperation with its neighbors for peace.It could be this way or the opposing other, should the balance be tipped, and when that happens, Myanmar risks losing what Myanmar now has, turning a short term utopia into a long term dystopia.

            "answer_text": "It\u2019s hard to tell. Too good or too bad. Depending on cooperation or selfishness. It is ok to differentiate among ethnic groups. Myanmar is diverse. Sometimes (always), its people are not able to make its diversity as strength but turn it into weakness. It is believed to be a hot bed of bio diversification and created mordern human. It is located between South, East and South East Asia. Myanmar has over 100 ethnic groups. Ancient inland human dispersals from Myanmar into interior East Asia since the Late Pleistocene A New Primate Species From Myanmar Points To \u201cOut Of Asia\u201d Myanmar is also a home of the second largest population of Asian elephants. Not only that human species are different, there\u2019s many species of banana and mangos . (I missed eating Burmese mangoes and bananas. They smell and taste good. :)) The diverse landscape and weather create a home for many species. Common people are ok. But, there\u2019re leaders, ethnic leaders and armed forces leaders who have a little bit selfish mind. Today\u2019s world is connecting each other, not separating. As long as one group or another group want to be dominant, there will be fighting. You can\u2019t imagine over 100 ethnic groups are fighting. Nonetheless, Myanmar is an important region. It connects South, East and South East Asia and have access to Indian Ocean. It also bears burden of diversity. It is hard to unite the country. At the same time, it needs to be strong and balance the interest and needs of surrounding countries instead of jumping to one side. There are/will be many powerhouse countries around Myanmar. The combination of Myanmar\u2019s neighbor population is equal to half of world\u2019s population. Myanmar is either genetically, linguistically, culturally or historically linked to South, South East and East Asian countries. During World War II, there were British soldiers, U.S soldiers, Indian soldiers, Chinese soldiers and Japanese soldiers inside the country. Just want to point out it has so many history with other countries one way or another. :D It is an important region for many ways. It is also one of a few countries that preserve non theistic religion called Buddhism. Not only that Myanmar is diverse in ethnic groups, plants and bio species, it has diverse mixed of mineral resources due to varying regional tectonic settings. The downside is the very same Indian plate which came and attached Eurasian plate 25 million years ago is still pushing under Eurasian plate and that creates North to South run fault line under Myanmar. There\u2019re earthquake prone zones and many ancient cities were ruined due to earthquakes throughout history. Overall, Myanmar is a beautiful and unique country. Many decades of isolation, there\u2019s many things need to be sort out as well. The future depends on the willingness and intelligence of its leaders both government and non-government as well as its people and secondly the intention and interest of other countries - whether it is a helping hand for newly emerging hybrid democratic country or pushing back to authoritarian government. The survival of Myanmar is not only important for its people alone, there are many biospecies and ecosystem to protect, and it is a link between South, East, South East Asia in many ways. ",

But, anyone having an interest in this SEA country would be thinking so much positive way in every aspect because this country was one of the last places to be just opened her economy toward the outside world around 2010. The peculiar long-time isolation was caused by the military junta which had the world recording long-term authoritarian rule over a half-century. The Junta had focused on the united federation for sustain nation building and then kept long term civil war against secessionist of minor ethnic groups. This is a straightforward question about Myanmar's future economic and political situation if only internal peace will be sustainable under the civilian government in the long run. Myanmar located in the perfect place where maximize its strategical power and role in the world economy, between India, China, and ASEAN. If the Myanmar government will play smart and strategical thinking for their future prosperity, there is no reason not to be the strong and powerful community in itself in the region. It has enough young and talented generation, and the plentiful natural resources and even many neighboring countries hope to support their success for the further regional stabilities. Of course, there are lots of uncertainties would be threatened its bright future. Too much strong nationalism, conflicts between religions, political disaccords concerning the distribution of natural resources, and growing China's power and other powers intervention would be shaking Myanmar politics in various ways and threaten its future. But basically, most experts have a positive viewpoint on this developing country. ",
