            "answer_text": "Is the electrostatic force strong enough to bring nano sized objects together in space? Well, the electrostatic force is strong enough to bring NaCl salt ions together into a crystal in air, so the answer to this question must be yes. Since Na and Cl have the same magnitude charge as a single electron, the same must be true for any ions in space. That\u2019s the simple answer. Here is the complicated answer. To think about this problem, consider what it would take for two nano-objects with the smallest possible nonzero charge to not come together. First, there are two factors that prevent salt ions from coming together in solution. Your material may be at a sufficiently high temperature that electrostatic forces are too small to hold them together, and the electrostatic forces may be reduced because your ions are in a medium with a high permeability. It turns out that salt dissolves in water for both of these reasons. First, water has a permeability of about 80, so electrostatic forces in water are 80 times smaller than a vacuum. Second, water is at room temperature, which is strong enough to counteract the electrostatic attraction of Na and Cl. For nano-objects, temperature effects may still be important at room temperature. However, in space, the temperature is only a few Kelvin. Second, electrostatic attractions are relatively unscreened. So there seems to be hardly anything that could keep objects of any size apart, even if they have charges that are in the ball park of one electron or one protons charge. But the crucial question is this: is the electrostatic energy of the two nano-objects together more than or less than the energy scale associated with temperature. In other words, [math]frac{q_1 q_2}{4 \\pi \\epsilon r} < k_B T[/math] for the objects to not come together, where [math]r[/math] is the separation between charges when they are at their closest distance, [math]\\epsilon[/math] is the permeability, which is nearly 1 in space, and [math]q_1[/math] and [math]q_2[/math] are the charges of the objects, and [math]T[/math] is the temperature. This isn\u2019t an exact equation but it does give a ball park figure for when temperature can overcome electrostatics. So, if not temperature, what could keep two nano-objects apart in space if they both had tiny charges of opposite sign? The only possibility to keep them apart is to put them on trajectories such that electrostatic forces don\u2019t bring them together. Just like for objects in a gravitational field, objects will have an \u201cescape velocity\u201d for electrostatic interactions. That escape velocity might be quite small for nano-objects in space.

A: The electrostatic force can be used to aggregate particles in an air-conditioning duct and many of those particles are quite large as particles go. But particles less than 1 micron diameter which we can call nano particles are moving in a comparatively viscous fluid and take longer to collect on a charged wire or plate. ",
