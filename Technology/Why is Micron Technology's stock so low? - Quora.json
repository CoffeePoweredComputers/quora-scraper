            "answer_text": "Micron's stock has stayed nearly flat this year, and its fourth quarter report in late September didn't meaningfully tilt the scales in either direction. Let's take a fresh look at Micron's tailwinds and headwinds, and see if the stock is worth buying at these levels. Micron is a leading DRAM and NAND memory manufacturer, whose products are used by most major memory device manufacturers in their flash and hard drives. Some of the price rise of the last 2 years is justified by How to buy micron technology stock the roughly 15% growth seen in Micron\u2019s revenues from 2017 to 2019, which translated into a 25% growth in Net Income. Micron saw a 50% growth in revenue and an 85% jump in net margins in 2018, due to higher selling prices for its latest memory chip technology. However, the semiconductor supply glut in 2019 led to a 25% drop in revenue, and sent earnings margins back to 2017 levels.  Finally, Micron\u2019s Price-to-Earnings (P/E) ratio rose from 9x at the end of 2017 to 9.5x at the end of 2019. The P/E dropped to 3x in 2018 due to a drop in semiconductor and memory demand, but as the supply glut started clearing out and demand started improving, the P/E rose to 9.5x by the end of 2019. While its P/E has dropped to 8x so far this year, given the volatility of the current situation, there is significant possible downside for Micron\u2019s current multiple, especially when compared with previous years: 6x at the end of 2015, and 3x as recently as 2018. Shares of computer memory maker Micro Technology (NASDAQ:MU) dropped to close 4.6% lower Thursday. You can probably blame the analysts at Needham & Co. for that -- and here's the strangest thing: Needham actually likes Micron stock. The second is the loss of a major customer for the company, Huawei. American companies have been prohibited from selling chips to the Chinese tech giant. This has hit Micron particularly hard, as roughly 10% of the revenue in its latest reported quarter came from the Asian company. As a result, Micron proffered very cautious guidance for the Q1 Ho is optimistic about. The company forecast its non-GAAP (adjusted) per-share earnings will land at $0.40 to $0.54 for the quarter -- very short of the average $0.66 estimated by analysts. ",
