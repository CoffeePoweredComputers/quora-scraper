            "answer_text": "For a Raspberry Pi, you will want a microSD card in FAT32 format. You CAN run it on different formats, but the things you can do are VERY limited and you will have high chance of corrupting your SD card. (You can get a solder-mod for your newer Pi if you want it to support the standard SD card. Vice versa if the Pi you are using has the standard SD slot)  Image taken from Google Images. It is possible to run the Pi off of a USB hard-drive or USB disk, but you will be required to do some setting up before hand, requiring you to need an SD card and the USB drive/disk also needs to be in FAT32. (I could be incorrect about the set-up, please correct me if I am wrong) This can also vary depending on the image you use for your Pi. ",

            "answer_text": "As others said: get a FAST card. This is important, more than space.I'm a debian user, and even on big instalations, 32gb of space can handle almost every interesting package on Debian.For raspberry, no idea of space, but sure 16Gb is enough. Get a fast card, class 10, and read the specs of each card. If the rasp is going to make lots of use of the card, you can even try sd cards suited for video recording; those have even bigger I/O rates. If you already have de Raspberry, and you just want to fiddle a bit, put inside any sd card you have spare; 4gb should be enough. If you feel is not enough, you can always spend your money later on a better sd card. ",
