You should have tag clouds and categories. I mix up some of my personal opinion on life with my software engineering posts, and people don\u2019t complain. It\u2019s my blog anyway! I say \u201cgo for it!\u201d I personally do not mind seeing a really good photo after reading a lot of code and computer science or software engineering posts. In fact, I probably prefer that. The only reason I don\u2019t do that is it seems too difficult to do so consistently, and regularly. Short answer: it\u2019s OK. Experiment. Ask feedback, but most probably would not mind reading a blog if they actually care about reading everything you have to say. I like Mental Blabberings blog. It\u2019s chopseuy and halo-halo. I am sure you know what it means. For the benefit of those who do not know, these are popular Filipino food that use a variety of flavors and ingredients. ",

            "answer_text": "It\u2019s completely up to you. For the most part, it depends on the purpose of the blog in the first place. Typically, it\u2019s better to be clear and concise, but if those are two topics you are passionate about, I would say that\u2019s more important than anything else, mainly because it will help you remain consistent (which is, by far, the most important consideration when starting and maintaining a blog). Personally, I decided to focus my blog, The Imperfectionist, around helping others make their ideas happen. As general as this is, it allows me to share my various types of experience (branding, web, UX/UI, financial materials, writing, social media, and content marketing). One last bit of advice: if you haven\u2019t already, I would definitely check out Medium. It makes drafting, editing, publishing, and sharing your writing easier than anything else out there. If you do, don\u2019t forget to say, \u201cHi!\u201d Hopefully, this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions about blogging in general. Cheers! ",
