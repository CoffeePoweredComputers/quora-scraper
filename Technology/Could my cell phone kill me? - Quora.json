Let\u2019s think about it in a different way. You could die in a road accident or fall off from stairs while texting and walking.Probably if you are busy updating status while there is a fire or earthquake, not a good consequence my friend.When you are travelling exotic places like mountains and waterfalls and sea beaches and you don\u2019t realize the possibilities when a single brave selfie could take your life.Using mobile phone while driving is the biggest risk of all times. You might be really busy in your life, but missing a deal is fine than your family missing you forever.2017 was shocked by a furious game (You-know-who) which started because of a cell phone.Cell phone is the fastest medium of cyber crime, eventually taking lives in either side.Imagine you are using your stylish metal phone in your bath tub a while connecting it with a charger. Well, please DO NOT ever try this.Let\u2019s not get started about AI (artificial intelligence) harming us. Let\u2019s admit it that we are in such an era that our smartphone already knows more than us about what\u2019s happening in the world. If you observe closely, our smartphone knows a little about us and slowly it is trying to know us better (Assistants on Smartphone) which can prove harmful.I hope all these points help everyone out here to prevent these small mistakes and be careful whenever we try to use a smartphone.

I recommend having a relatively plain phone that isn\u2019t worth killing you. ",

            "answer_text": "It isn\u2019t the phone, but the charger. Certain defects in a phone charger (or any other line operated switchmode power adapter) can result in the output floating at a high voltage relative to earth ground. This is particularly true of cheap knockoff chargers sold at gas stations, convenience stores, etc. The unit can appear to be working just fine (the phone will charge), but if you become part of a path between the phone and earth ground, you can be shocked or electrocuted. The manufacturers of these cheap chargers cut corners on insulation, clearance and creepage limits, and component quality to squeeze the last few pennies of profit out of their product. They don\u2019t bother to submit devices for safety certification, and may even affix fake UL/CSA/CE labels to them. ",

Excessive use fills the mind with useless passive content and lulls the intellect into a state of stagnation and atrophy. Cell phone overuse is similar to drifting through life as in a dream, where nothing actually gets done. It also promotes group-think and peer pressure to think according to the latest viral image and video sensation. It is a poor substitute to getting on with the real business of living and making your dreams come true. ",

As the voltage the charger provides between its pins in still low the phone does not fry from the voltage. Here sis one such device that passes mains through and possibly deliberately:  In some cases in countries where sockets are not polarized the orientation of the plug can determine if it passes mains. A properly designed device should never do that. Just do not buy charges from eBay. ",
