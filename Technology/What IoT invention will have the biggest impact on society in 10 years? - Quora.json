            "answer_text": "The biggest impact in terms of market value and society will be in connected cars. probably autonomous. 10 years could be at the short side, but in 25 years young people may very well not learn how to drive any more. Cities will be completely car-free, and fret will be moved between cities by autonomous container platforms without driver, reporting road bumps automatically to a centralised control system for repair. Then the second biggest impact will be in health monitoring. Your watch will tell you when you should consult your doctor, because some changes in your data (temperature, pulse, blood pressure etc.) are out of the pre-recorded expected schemes. But that kind of change asks for more than 10 years to realise. Remember the web was created in 1993. It needed 25 years to connect everyone on Facebook, and many people don\u2019t know yet about Quora ;-) So if you insist on the 10-year framework, that would probably be connected autonomous (electric or not) fret carriers, limited to several pre-defined roads where the risk of accidents is low. with or without a real driver. And only in some countries. On demand point-to-point person transport could also develop quickly. Think of a kind of generalised Uber with 100% of drivers participating. Hitchhiking 2.0 if you prefer. ",

            "answer_text": "\u201cHow Did It Go Off Early?\u201d you think, waking up to your alarm at 6:30 am instead of the 7:00 am that you had set it to. What has happened is your smartphone has collected data from the weather app stating that it is raining, which means you have to drive slower than your normal speed (data collected from your car\u2019s speedometer and shared with your phone) and for that, you have to wake up and leave for work early. So your intelligent smartphone has decided that you need to wake up half an hour early to be on time at work. This is IoT for you! This article offers great insights on how the Internet of Things (IoT) will eventually define and transform the way of life as we know it in the coming years. Why IoT is Such a Big Deal and the Inevitable Trend in Coming Years? ",
