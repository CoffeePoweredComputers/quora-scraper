            "answer_text": "Okay, Inkjet printers. Yes, they include \u201cstarter\u201d cartridges. Usually good for about 400 prints, depending on what you are printing. Buying a new printer every time you run out of ink may seem like a wash, price wise, but as one other answer pointed out, the generation of \u201ce-waste\u201d would be substantial. Printer prices are kept low, and often on sale, because the ink is relatively expensive. I don\u2019t have any figures on cost of manufacture but it is your continuing to purchase ink that the manufacturer counts on. As to purchasing re-filled ink cartridges. Don\u2019t. More often than not you will ruin your print heads and wind up buying a new printer. The ink formulations are not consistent with the manufacturers standards and will void any sort of warranty for parts replacement. Bottom line. Keep your printer for as long as you can and do not buy a new one just for the starter cartridges. Use the manufacturers ink. DO shop pricing. You can often find deals through the different office stores, Amazon Prime, Walmart, Target, etc. (OD will match pricing for you. We also are now offering a subscription service that includes further discounts. Check with your local store.) Thanks for asking! ",

            "answer_text": "hello first of all thanks for asking this question. my answer will be a message to the world to save it from E-waste. This is something I never appreciated personally, we are into printer support business. This is one reason we never recommend our customers to buy black or color inkjet printers for home use or office use where you need less color print-outs. These big companies always use this strategy to make customer go for new product and discourage using the old. That is why they always keep parts & service cost so high that customer has to throw the old one and buy new one. if you every time buy new printer means you are creating more E-WASTE on this planet, imagine buying one printer every month, which is not a good idea. I recommend NOT TO BUY INKJET PRINTERS for HOME use. In electronics Inkjet printers have the biggest share in e-waste generation. always discourage people around you to buy color inkjet printers for this I suggest you to buy monochrome laser printers where the cost of printing cost is very low, very user friendly and long lasting. Even we don\u2019t recommend color laser printers for home use. For color print-outs you can get from any shop which still be cheaper than the cost of inkjet cartridges or printer. you will also save on money. Help us to save planet by creating less E-WASTE ",
