            "answer_text": "Ah say thar, now hold on a minute and let me unpack this a bit. Technologies span many disciplines - software, computers, chip design, bio-tech, industrial etc. so which technologies are you interested in and what weighting would you give to each technology arena if you wanted to compile a weighted average index? It should be obvious that the US leads in software, chips and most industrial designs, or why else would China run so hard to steal them. Japan has been known for decades by its focus on applying Demmings Quality Methodoligy to industrial processes - particularly in the auto industry - but we don\u2019t buy too many Japanese appliances - we buy Korean - and they are not on your list. Clearly China has tremendous advantages in Bio- tech as they apparently have no constraints on experimentation with human germ technology as witnessed by their recent efforts to develop designer babies. Which do you value more, natural blue hair and orange eyes, and air bag that will kill you or software that can cripple a nuclear plant? ",
