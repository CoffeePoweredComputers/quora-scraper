            "answer_text": "No, they aren\u2019t overrated. They just don\u2019t charge, keep disconnecting, easy to lose, won\u2019t charge past 60%, sometimes won\u2019t even connect, and don\u2019t have that great of sound. I mean, if I had god like internet all the time, then maybe AirPods are worth, $50? I\u2019m not speaking for myself, I\u2019m speaking for myself, my sister, my mother, my father, my best friend, and like 10 different acquaintances. The only pro to AirPods compared to regular wires is being discreet. Yes, this is good for school so you can listen to music without being caught by the teacher. That\u2019s it, literally the only thing. In my opinion, I\u2019d get a good headphone that connects to an average audio jack, then get an adapter. This would cost less than like $50. It\u2019s a quarter of the price to AirPods, and 10 times better. AirPods are overrated the same way that supreme is. It\u2019s expensive, and a lot of middle class you tubers flex with them from a promotion. ",

            "answer_text": "I came from the old school wired ear buds and keep two pairs handy. I own the AirPods Pro, the reliability is not as good as wired earbuds. Pros can present to the person you are talking to a scratch sound and vice versa. They can drop calls and depending where you are in downtown building for instance the reception can be every other word. To my knowledge Pros are not compared to the wired earbuds because it is an apples to oranges comparison. You cannot lose one wired ear bud. Hardwire earbud set up to this day is more reliable because of overall less exposure to outside interference unique to the headset. Not so with AirPods Pro now famously one ear bud may not work on the Pros because of bugs that have to be worked out. To me over-rated is to assume dominant routine performance well beneath potential as advertised. AirPods and Pros are as good advertised with a lot of upward potential, if you don\u2019t loose either bud nor case. The reason why they are not over-rated in my book, is because of stiff competition from Samsung, Bose , Sony and other audio brands whose specialty is music. Apple AirPods Pros are nice to have but are not a must product. As a matter of fact, Apple performance is best with additional Apple products on the same network of iPhones, iPads and computers. \u02c6If any hype occurs about AirPods the only reason is because of what it seamless works. Apple\u2019s AirPods underscores performance and reliability as a near goal, soon to be perfection. ",

            "answer_text": "If you buy the AirPods 2 not the Pro model, no, they work extremely well integrate easily, especially with a Apple gear, sound very good. All Bluetooth earbuds are susceptible to the same loss/damage/drop call issues. Fiio makes an inexpensive audio device, BTR1-K that allows you to Bluray connect to 6our phone, and connect wired earphones/earbuds so you are not directly connected to your phone. Or just use wired earphones, as I do, using the Apple dongle for my iPhone 7 Plus(excellent audio quality by the way). Many people like the Pro, but I think they work bes5 with iPhones despite the universality of Bluetooth. I do not use my earbuds to make or receive phone calls! Or, you can buy a discreet DAP for music. Or try Jabra 65t. ",

But don\u2019t feel too bad. Lots of people who don\u2019t buy Apple products have a really hard time understanding why people do buy them. That\u2019s because you have to experience them to know they provide a superior overall user experience - it\u2019s not something you can see from the outside. ",

            "answer_text": "No, they are not overrated. Currently, the chipset solution W1 that Apple has engineered is simply superior to the other available solutions from Qualcomm, Realtek and Airoha. These are the chipsets that allow pairing, keep the two independent ear pieces paired and other functions such as battery level, etc. Apple does not sell these chips and so all other makes and models use one of these other solutions. None of these are inexpensive and so this means that compromises must be made such as quality of the driver (sound quality), battery size, output level, etc. and so you see that some higher quality units are as much or even more money than the Apple units. While some of the other brands and solutions may sound better to you, currently in terms of connection and ease of use, none of them match the Apple. This may change as new chip solutions emerge, but this is also seen in the massive share Apple has in the market. In these cases, the numbers tell the tale. That does not mean you may not be happy with lower priced solutions, nor does it explain the vitriol some use in terms about Apple. The choice is always for the consumer. ",

IF you have other Apple products, they have features that allow them to stand out from the competition. If you do not have other Apple products, I am not sure why you would care to even consider them in the first place. ",
