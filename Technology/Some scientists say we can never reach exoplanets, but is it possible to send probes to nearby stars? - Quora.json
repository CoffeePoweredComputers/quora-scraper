            "answer_text": "We have sent a probe to nearby stars. Both Voyagers are on their way. (Notice I didn\u2019t say \u201cwell on their way.\u201d) Voyager 1 is going 38,610 mph. That\u2019s 11 miles a second! Pretty fast, huh? As of Feb. 2018 it was 13.2 billion miles from the sun. Since the craft was launched in 1977, that means in 41 years, it traveled that far. 13.2 billion miles. Pretty far, eh? Now do the math. At its rate of speed, if it travels 13.2 billion miles in 41 years, the distance to the NEAREST star, Proxima Centauri is 4.244 light years from our sun. A light year is about 5.878 TRILLION miles, so Proxima Centauri is about 24.9 trillion miles from our sun, or in billions of miles, it\u2019s 24,900 billion ) So if Voyager has gone 13.2 billion miles in 41 years, to go 24,900 billion, it would have to travel 1,886 times further, and 41 years X 1,886 is approximately 77,326 years. And Voyager isn\u2019t even traveling near our closest star. So unless we can get a probe to go A LOT faster*, anything that we did send to our nearest star wouldn\u2019t get there until the year 79,345. (and then, if it sent a signal back, we\u2019d receive it in the year 79,349 give or take 3 months. *cheer up, anything is possible. The way computer chips\u2014-and technology in general\u2014\u2014 are shrinking, we may, someday soon, be able to create microscopic probes that can ACCELERATE to close to light speed using some kind of exotic, microscopic power source that can accelerate it over a long period of time. (That\u2019s the key to approaching light speed, not to go at a constant speed, but to constantly accelerate, which takes a LOTTA LOTTA fuel.) I know you didn\u2019t ask this, but I have to add, that a microscopic probe may someday be possible, but I doubt if a full-sized probe would be, unless there is a way to utilize some new technology/fuel that is capable to accelerating an object to near light speed. So humans will never reach the stars unless this occurs. (Or we send out generation ships that travel for 77,000 years +) ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, it is! At least according to a proof-of-concept study done a few years ago: Breakthrough Starshot - Wikipedia According to the study, we could send a fleet of tiny probes, consisting of nothing but an electronic chip, some minuscule instruments and transmitters and a power source, all weighting one gram or so. Each probe would be attached to a solar sail, a few square meters in size, and equally lightweight. The probes would be released from a launch vehicle in low Earth orbit and send on their way, one by one, by a powerful ground-based laser capable of delivering a boost of some 60,000 G for a long enough time to accelerate the probes to 10\u201320% the speed of light.The probes would be directed at Alpha Centauri A - a possible Earth-like planet - and report their findings back as they did a fly-by of the system. The study did prove that such a feat is permitted by the laws of physics, but no attempt was made to illuminate the options for actually doing it! More conventional probes can also reach the stars - the Pioneers, Voyagers and New Horizon probes are on their way - but current technology does not allow for the speeds we need to make it worth the while for star-studying purposes. It could very well be that if we sent a probe at 300 km/sec now, we would see it overtaken by another one sent in a hundred years at 1000 km/sec. ",
