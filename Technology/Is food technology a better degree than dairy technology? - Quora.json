            "answer_text": "Hi! Firstly, i would like you to know that dairy technology is a part of Food Technology. To be specific, under Food technology you gets a chance to know about dairy, bakery, fruits & veg processing and meat processing as well, whereas dairy Technology is a specialization in milk and milk related products. Both have their unique advantages, i.e. If you go for dairy tech you will be a specialist in dairy but if you opt food tech you can master any of the studied course and will have a chance to open up your career with wide range of sectors. For UG level my recommendation is to go for Food Technology. I hope you may get clarity now. Thanks. ",
