            "answer_text": "The thing is you really don\u2019t need \u2018Any Intelligence\u2019 to manipulate people. Manipulation and reinforcements have been happening forever. Religions and cults were invented for this very purpose\u2026 to tame people. To keep them docile and merry by giving them fears, false hope and unrealistic practices. To thoroughly engage them so that they don\u2019t bring out their animal nature. It has worked very well I must say. And yet it\u2019s absolutely ridiculous for someone who has realized their true nature. Such people don\u2019t need morals or ethics to conduct themselves as they have well functioning brain cells. And it is very difficult to manipulate such people. Even in 21st century no AI is really being used to manipulate people. People get hypnotized so easily by a random ad or a celebrity. What they endorse must be the best right! People don\u2019t realize they are getting paid for these promotions. Actually most people do know this fact, but still they subscribe. The sight of spicy and crusty chicken wings floating in the air is just irresistible to some! When you find CR7 looking all confident and powerful with a new pair of Nike the very next moment you\u2019ll be scrolling through Amazon or you are at the store already! Nothing\u2019s more important than posting countless pictures of your unrealistic face on Instagram with all that glossy and greasy color paints from Lakme or best from the Kardashians! How else would you prove that you are the greatest fan! These days one false news report is enough and you\u2019ll see people turning against their own kind! I want to say this is all marketing and media but it\u2019s not even that! There is hardly any effort made by companies these days to convince people. They just have to place their product on a celebrity and their products will be sold! And products are not always physical. Sometimes they are ideas, very crude, controlling and hateful ideas. Now tell me where is the role of AI in all this! Why do we even need A.I for the same I wonder. People are already willing to accept whatever comes. Google is already controlling people and the business ecosystem with their search engine and ad recommendations on a global scale. Needless to mention Facebook here as we all know what they do. From here on it only gets worse. Tomorrow even if you just stare at something for more than 3 seconds, that thing will be added to your cart right away! Pray it\u2019s not a human being! And the tech will inch much closer to you every year until it reaches the level of your mind when even if you just have a random thought then\u2026 I have no doubt in my mind that this will happen!

            "answer_text": "AI algorithms (as of today) themselves are not capable enought to manipulate humans. So basically no AI algorithm can really by its own mind creep into social media and try influencing human behaviour. No Skynet yet, maybe for not a very long time in future. Skynet (Terminator) - Wikipedia However, what current AI algorithms can do is automate tasks that humans take a few seconds to do. Basically get a rough look at your web history and understand what are your general interests or looking at a video and keeping of track of what persons appeared in it or searching information related to a term in search engine. These are trivial tasks, but an AI algorithm performing them can vastly reduce effort for people who want to influence someone\u2019s personal touch on issue. That is because a personal \u201cnudge\u201d can be given to a person on an issue (what baby diaper to buy, what car to buy or what party to vote for) only after processing a lot of information about them. What AI algorithms can enable is massive information processing about different people. Surveillance capitalism - Wikipedia That said, if you really think that humans have not been led by a few before AI\u2019s invention and this is something of a new dystopian phenomenon, you probably need to understand the entire business of mainstream media (MSM, for purpose of this answer MSM = TV + newspapers + Movies + Other non-scientific Publications, some scientific ones even) and advertisement better. Behavior of humans in a society is controlled by creation of a \u201cwindow of discourse\u201d by mainstream media using emotive cognition and limited handouts (That basically means cleverly creating good and bad images about things and focusing majority of discussion on less important things). Most people dont really know what they want and so they are made to want things which satisfy them and also helps the people who are putting resources to influence them. Humans are not actually as rational and smart as what economics classes teach us. This phenomenon has been alive since Indus Valley, Mesopotamia and Ancient Egypt. Initially the power was held by clergy, then marketing executives and media professionals, and they still continue to hold some of the power, but internet is the new gangsta. What AI enables in combination with internet is instead of influencing the group think by controlling the narrative, personal information of people can be analyzed to shape their personal world view. This effects humans more deeply. A lot of us now think very differently from what the MSM wants us to think due to these modern ways to influence opinion (So for example, MSM continues selling us soft drinks as feel good happy drinks which popular sports people drink, but many many people are not drinking these now). This personal touch can enable sale of products and maybe even effect your views on nuclear energy, solar energy, global warming, free college or even any new faith or MSM outlet, things which had absolute control on such influence earlier. As you can see, this is much more powerful than old groupthink control mechanism employed by Mainstream Media like movies, televisions and newspapers and that is why they create a lot of noise criticizing it. Its effecting revenues and influence of erstwhile influencers and they dont like that a lot. No surprises about the dystopian hit pieces around \u201cAI is coming for you\u201d and \u201csocial media needs to be controlled\u201d. If you are even 1% tensed or worried about this, you first need to ask yourself : What is society ? Isnt it animals whose behavior is controlled by some narrative ? Its just a debate about who runs the narrative, who sits on top of the pyramid, that is all, no big deal for most of us followers. Chill. Note to self : Dont rewatch Black Mirror for the third time :-D . ",
