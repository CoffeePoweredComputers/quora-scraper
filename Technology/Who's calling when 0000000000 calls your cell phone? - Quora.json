            "answer_text": "Now a days most of user thought telephone number which displayed on incoming call is related to caller who called the number. In reality CLID (Caller ID Display) is optional and useful tools for user to know from where calls did orginited. As now a days almost all call contain caller information, most of network is configured such way so that any incoming call with caller ID in header is processed with calling process and display on callee\u2019s display. There are hundred or thousand network operator (Telephone Company) around world and this is virtually impossible for receiving company to add CLID tag on incoming call. So this is expected for call originating company to attach valid subscriber ID with any call for identification and CLID generation on recipient end. This systems works in past because there was limited number of Telephone Company and they have dedicated connection with each other which automatically create liability of attaching valid caller ID with any call outgoing towards other company. But this Internet connected world, there are lots of carrier, network operators and telecom company shearing vast amount of network and resource dedicated connection between company become rare case. Every telephone company has multiple path for same call due to load sharing or cost effecting service. In this scenario even it is expected for call originating company to attach caller ID ether for technical reasons or by mistake or even intentionally caller ID got removed from call envelope. Normally company\u2019s do configure their network to honor incoming ID with calls pass towards callee without change anything. If any call somehow not have CLID attach or error on CLID like alphabet instead of number trigger empty ID. For subscriber device when got empty field instead of ID, it by default shows long chain of 0000 or other predefined strings create confusion amount non-tech user. Treat incoming call as latter via post, if sender didn\u2019t write his/her name and address on envelop, you will have no idea where it came from. Same if sender name and address is wrong. Now in electronics world, calls reach on your phone without sender information will trigger some kind of predefined pattern by default which is long 0000 in most of case\u2026 ",

            "answer_text": "My business sells software to the government and law enforcement. Every once in a while we get a call from a number that displays like this and it is from some government agency. Sometimes, they will only say they are a part of the Department of Defense. You can guess who this is, If you aren\u2019t getting calls like this, likely it is a telemarketer that is using VOIP. You can put any caller ID number in you want in those systems. So they picked all zeros. With the advent of widespread use of VOIP for telemarketing, caller ID is no longer assured to be accurate. If is your friend calling, it is probably correct. If it looks like it could be your friend but isn\u2019t, a telemarketer just plugged that number in. This can work in your favor, if you have the right setup. My cell phone number is from where I used to live in Arizona. Almost nobody calls me from there, but I get lots of calls where the first 6 digits match my cell phone number, This is easy to identify and is telemarketers faking what number they are calling from.
