            "answer_text": "My late husband (who passed away in 2005) has a mother who is still living at age 95. She\u2019s sharp as a tack and one of the most amazing ladies I\u2019ve ever met in my life. We talk every Sunday (haven\u2019t missed a Sunday since we both suffered the loss of her son) and we have often discussed technology for people her age. This woman is not afraid of anyone or anything. She\u2019s battled multiple bouts of cancer, brittle bone disease, unimaginable pain and the loss of two husbands, her entire family and her two sons. I\u2019m the only pseudo relative she has left. She\u2019s not afraid of technology. No, that\u2019s not the issue. Her true unwillingness to jump into the technology pool is reluctance to tangle with potential scammers, hackers, disreputable businesses and the general lot of unethical people the average person may encounter in the technology sphere. Cyber crime is escalating. More applications are leading to more vulnerabilities and network breaches jumped by 350% from 2015 to 2016. See: 9 Key Takeaways From the Mary Meeker 2017 Internet Trend Report Even as an older woman who lives in a retirement community, she is constantly bombarded by phone solicitors. The callers claim to be her long lost grandchild who needs a plane ticket home, a pretend tax agent trying to frighten her into sending money for unpaid taxes (she has a long time CPA and never misses filing her taxes) or you name it - phone scam of the week. She and I discussed whether or not she should get a notebook computer, a smart phone and/or Internet service. This is a woman who didn\u2019t just fall off the turnip truck. After some serious consideration she decided since she doesn\u2019t need technology for her career or livelihood (she\u2019s 95 after all), she was going to pass. Ironically, when she wants something Internet related (shopping, looking up information or even product reviews) she calls me on her landline and asks me to take care of it for her. Of course I gladly do. I shop for her on Amazon, buy blue ray movies for her, give her phone lines to call if she has questions about shopping and suggest programs for her to watch on her DVR. The lady is very tech savvy in the areas she chooses to be, but just doesn\u2019t want the risks and hassles of opening up her life to more complications. I totally get it. If I didn\u2019t have to have all the technologies I use for my career and livelihood, I might go dark as well. While I think some older people do fear technology, I think there are a lot more who don\u2019t, but fear the people they might encounter if they open up that portal. Best wishes to all.

            "answer_text": "I am 86. Technology can, and does frighten older people my grandmother was frightened of using the telephone Like many people of her age, she kept the wind-up clock ten minutes fast, on the excuse she was never late. She rarely left the house. It made me lose trains as I assumed they had gone My mother\u2019s friend would never get dressed in front of the TV as she assumed the people on it could see her A friend of my age only uses one channel on her TV set as she has never mastered the remote control. She is not stupid. She has a BA, give public talks on History, and hosts successful parties Another friend of my generation has mastered using the computer to buy things, but has yet to get to grips with the printer. She pays a techie to come and print pages for her. Luckily she is wealthy She, like several others of her age I know, have music centers (combined radio, CD player) which she only has the radio working, as she has never worked out how to switch from radio to CD. She makes out it is broken when I offer to show her how to use it, and won\u2019t allow me to touch it This is not a new problem. I never learnt to drive until I was 52. I was 25 when I saw a TV for the first time, and older when I bought one. It was fine when (in the UK) there were only four channels, but even I - who studied technology - never got to grips with recording TV programs It is more than techno-phobia. It is the language that goes with new technologySo an elderly person may have a mobile phone, but can\u2019t remember the terms for the services they want to access. They also fear asking for help as it makes them feel stupid In all of history, there has never been a bigger gap in the life of a person, than of my generationWhen I was born in 1930 children normally played in the streetsWe very rarely saw planes in the sky, and those planes would be biplanesMy father delivered beer on a horse drawn cart. Horse troughs were common, and street lighting was by gas.Milk was delivered at the door, and the post came four times a dayWe worked a 48 hour week, and included Saturday mornings. We weren\u2019t paid for tea breaks My house had gaslight, but only in the main room. We used oil lamps and candles. Most house did not have bathrooms (we used a tin bath that was hung up in the garden). The toilet was outside, and we had chamber pots in the house, kept under the bed. Cooking was done on a coal or wood burning stove When I first had a phone it was installed in the hall, the same as everyone else I knew, because phones were not used socially, but for emergencies, and necessities Each new shiny button, dial, switch, and plug that came along to make life easier, put the necessities of life in black boxes with warning notices on them, and distanced the elderly from their belongings No sooner had we mastered the operation of these beasts that challenged us, than a new version came out, and at some point we surrendered to our fate of isolation Is life better now than fifty or a hundred years ago?In comfort yesbut as a child we had spare time. Now everyone is busyNeighbors visited us; now they text us or phone us, if we are lucky We lived in towns and cities, but we had horizonsNow some people rarely see a horizonThe news tells us that those suffering from mental breakdowns has greatly increased, and it is partly due to spending their days and nights between four walls My generation grew up with a sense of wonderWe sat up to see the Moon landingWe won\u2019t live to see the Mars landingand most won\u2019t sit up to see it Yes, the elderly fear new technologyand so should the younger ",

My mom said it simply, \u201ctoo many buttons.\u201d She came from a world where you turn on a radio with one knob and it might control the volume too. Then you turn another knob to find a station. Tell me it\u2019s that simple now. Most older folks are not looking at robots to control their eating etc.; they looking at the things they have always done and the new stuff might look better, sound better, cook better, but are a hassle to set up. My stupid car has a full set of buttons that I never use because some idiot techie thought they shouldn\u2019t use the ones another media feature used. There is a point where a person has \u201clived a full life\u201d and it\u2019s then I doubt very much anything in the tech world scares them, if things related didn\u2019t scare them before. \u201cNO! I don\u2019t like surgery, it scares me.\u201d New technology won\u2019t change that fear to \u201cmore fear.\u201d ",

The older generation are used to simpler protocols, where lower tech was more accepted and understood -All being said I would say this only counts for a small segment of the population though. I was once in a mobile shop and a guy had just purchased a new phone, apparently according to the shop assistant he had been in a few times - I overheard the gentleman say my old phone had these symbols on it here, he meant apps, but my new phone does not. The assistant said it's an android phone and totally different to your old phone. I have also heard many people say - oh yes my son/daughter helped me load/ change the software on my new device. If you see the wider technolog\u00edes used by all generations now - We have mobile devices, lap top, and sat-nav systems, what a mine field for a technophobe\u2026\u2026.. ",

Fear is the most motivational emotion we can have.It only exists in the realm of \u201cunknowable consequences\u201d\u2026.and yet, how many people know what is going to happen in the next hour? In other words, it is an irrational emotion and only comes about in proportion to the lack of confidence people have in their ability to adapt. It is also a very creative force..The more people are fear, the more likely they create the very situation that fuells the fear, and are often hear to say \u201c I told you I was right\u201d  ",

However, nowadays I think all people are pretty accustomed to technology, and doubt it causes much of a fuss anymore. ",
