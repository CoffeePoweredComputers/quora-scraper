            "answer_text": "Yes most definitely technology use is making people depressed for we do not know the optimum usage. If we follow a few precautionary measures we should be fine like 1. Never let technology rule your life. You rule the technology. You decide when to use what and when to remain tech free for only then it works. 2. Getting attached or addicted to some gadget again means you would want to spend every waking moment and even sleeping moment with it. So definitely not OK! 3. Technology gives you a lot of options and only a firm strong person can use these options wisely. The other general people would just go with the flow and get addicted. 4. Technology gives too much information at too little time and people are required to make decisions and rethink on the decision within a span of minutes. As a result people just react more and don't respond to situations more and everything has become very transparent. 5. There is certainly a lack of privacy when people use technology. Everybody seems to know what money you have, how much you bought something for or which girl you went out with and where you spent time with her etc etc. Even if people have moved foward in life, technology keeps pushing them back and forth in time which again is a sure recipe for depression. 6. Being unsure of what to think at all times and how to do something itself is confusing. A person who has a grasp of technology does not have a core competency. So people have to depend on each other more for very simple things like return filing etc which was a 5 minutes job previously.  ",

            "answer_text": "If this is your opinion of technology then I feel sorry for you. Here is my opinion and understanding of these issues. 1. I talk more to my parents and in-laws in the last few years than I ever did thanks to Skype, Facebook and personal blogs. I don't live in the country I was born and raised up in, been living for 15 years in Norway. My best friends are still my best friends. They visit me, I visit them. We talk all the time. Because of technology I still keep in touch. If I did not have it, I would have disappeared, been forgotten, because I don't want to live in my home country right now. 2. I don't get any euphoria from my phone or tablet. I read more books on my tablet, see more videos and have more fun now than I ever had. I have pretty much stopped watching TV, meaning TV stations and scheduled programs. 24 hour gluttony, RedBull station, youtube, Netflix and others where I just watch what I want. Play games. Learn cooking tips. Even the whole family competes in many games. I have 4 joysticks hooked to my Wii and we regularly compete in Mario Cart. We do more as a family and share more than my family did when I was a kid. 3. My relatives know more about my kids because of social network than I did with their kids that are now in their 20's. Thats all thanks to social network. I feel closer to people now than ever. People use social networking to talk about issues, sharing experiences. That is not narcissistic, thats sharing your life, thats fantastic. 4. I could not disagree more. Tech is just getting cheaper and more distributed. People in poor countries are connecting to the internet and learning. Computer technology no longer costs $2000-$3000 for basic stuff. You can get a raspberry Pi with keyboard, monitor and network up for less than $100. How wonderful is that ? Teachers no longer have to travel to distant places of the earth for a long periods of time to teach. Now you can learn from home. Group people in front of a screen, allow them to ask questions, all live between continents. People get clean water and much needed help much more easily now. All thanks to better communications. My kids don't think twice to call my mom up in a different country to complain about me when they think I am unfair, which I think is very cool. When I was a kid, I would not call my grandmother/grandfather for any reason unless on sunday evenings when it was cheaper. And I grew up in a western country. My brother is a captain who fishes in deep sees, and I can call him just as easily as I call my wife, thanks to satellite phones. No, things are getting so much better, so fast that it is a privilege being here, right now. People born with no legs are beating trained athletes in a 100 meter dash, running marathons, swimming. Blind people can read. Getting cancer is no longer a death sentence. People don't have to die from HIV anymore. Just think back 30 years how things were, issues we did not hear about and how open they are now. How much closer we are to getting equality than ever. People who don't want equality or racists get called out in their vile acts. News travel faster today than at any point in time. It is fantastic to be here today. It could always be better, and it keeps getting better. ",
