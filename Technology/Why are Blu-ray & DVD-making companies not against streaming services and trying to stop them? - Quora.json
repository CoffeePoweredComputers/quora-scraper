Remember, the movie production companies just hire Blu-Ray and DVD making companies to make the disks. The movie production companies are the ones who can decide whether or not to allow streaming, and they much prefer a model where people have to keep paying over and over to view a particular movie, against one where people can buy a copy and watch it whenever without having to keep paying.
