            "answer_text": "If you hate your Internet Service Provider (ISPs), you\u2019re definitely not alone. Not only are ISPs among the worst-rated companies when it comes to customer service, but they\u2019re also often guilty of deliberate misdeeds like slowing your service and giving away your personal data. As Jordan Spencer Cunningham of Nerdology.org put it, \u201cAll ISPs are evil. Finding the least evil ISP is the trick.\u201d Unfortunately, many areas don\u2019t have a lot of options when it comes to picking and choosing your ISP. That\u2019s because the required infrastructure and local regulations create natural monopolies, and often act as a barrier to competitors. Some say that the resulting lack of consumer choice is why ISPs get such bad ratings. They just don\u2019t put in the effort to provide a good service because they know their customers have nowhere else to go if the want to go online. But consumers are becoming more and more determined to uncover alternatives \u2014 and even create their own. You\u2019ve probably heard of Google Fiber, which can offer speeds up to 100 times the speed of basic broadband. But at the moment, the service is only available in a handle of cities across the United States. While Google does have plans to expand the service, there\u2019s no telling exactly how long it will take before it comes to your area. Some towns are taking hold of the reins for themselves, passing laws to build their own broadbandinfrastructure so they can get high-speed internet without having to deal with the big ISPs and their slow speeds, bad customer service, and high prices. If you\u2019re determined to escape from your local big ISP and start your own service, it is possible, and you\u2019re not the only one. You don\u2019t necessarily have to own a big company or have access to millions in funding to start your own ISP \u2014 these two entrepreneurial brothers, for example, started one on a rooftop in Brooklyn.

            "answer_text": "ISP (Internet Service Provider) License is necessary to run the business of Broadband in India. Any MSO can apply to obtain the ISP License UL (Unified Licensing) System. UL License is given by DoT and it is valid for 20 Years. An Internet Service Provider (ISP) is the industry term for the company that is able to provide you with access to the Internet, typically from a computer. If you hear someone talking about the Internet and they mention their \"provider,\" they're usually talking about their ISP. Your ISP makes the Internet a possibility. In other words, you can have shiny computer with a built-in modem and could have a router for networking, but without a subscription with an ISP, you won't have a connection to the Internet. An ISP is your gateway to the Internet and everything else you can do online. The second your connection is activated and set up, you'll be able to send emails, go shopping, do research and more. The ISP is the link or conduit between your computer and all the other \"servers\" on the Internet. You may feel like you're talking to your mom directly through email, but in reality it's more \"indirectly.\" Your email goes from your computer, to the ISP computers/servers, where it's sent along to its destination through other servers on the network.
