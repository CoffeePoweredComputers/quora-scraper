            "answer_text": "I see everyone here is recommending iPhone SE 2020. I just want to mention that it has its own set of problems. That screen is outdated. 720p screen with HUGE bezels.The design Is from 2014 iPhone 6, in other words outdated.It has 1800mAH battery. Yes, tiny, puny, 1800mAH. And, A13 is very powerful chipset, so is power hungry too. Just check battery reviews of iPhone SE 2020, they're horrible. Don't even imagine playing games, with normal day to day usage will last upto 7\u20138 hours max.So in short, iPhone SE 2020 is a handicap essentially. It maxes out one stat, namely chipset, but overlooks every other depertment, or stat. You could still daily drive iPhone SE though, just make sure you're okay with those bezels and your usage case isn't much battery dependant. I'd honestly only recommend this one if you're gifting it to mom/dad. Now coming to actual recommendation, Apple is rumoured to launch iPhone 12 lineup on October 13th 2020. One phone in that lineup is going to be iPhone 12 Mini. It's speculated that it will launch at 649$ tag for 64GB, and 699$ for 128GB, latter being my recommendation. iPhone 12 Mini shell body is already sent out to case makers and some youtubers have them at hand. From the looks of it, iPhone 12 Mini is going to have a 5.4 inch bezel-less OLED display. The overall footprint of the phone will be even smaller than iPhone SE 2020. So wait for this event, and get iPhone 12 Mini (128GB). ",
