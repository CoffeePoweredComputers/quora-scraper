            "answer_text": "YES. few points - Price. currently priced at 42,900 for few days (13th\u201317th as Apple Days) on Amazon right now, with \u20b92000 extra cashback on HDFC cards.Battery. here, XR wins the battle hands down. i am currently using iPhone 11 and this i am telling you very straightforward that XR is miles ahead of 11.NOTE - i am not a heavy user nor i play games so i expect my cell to last at least three days and XR was right on the money but with 11 i have to charge it every second day. Display. LCDs are better for our eyes but to be honest i didn\u2019t saw much of difference when i kept XS for few weeks. the point was worth mentioning because it may be helpful for heavy users. but OLEDs have its own pros. it\u2019s too good to not mention that many researchs believe that actually OLEDs are better for eyes compared to LCDs. this cruel internet!XR was my first iPhone and we all tend to have special place in our heart for our first! wether its phone, bicycle or anything. so that also contributes few teddies to my love for XR.i never used Pro models but apart from those, if i have to rank best 03 iPhones to purchase right now, it would be - iPhone XR then iPhone 11 and then finally iPhone X. although i never used it personally but i have mentioned iPhone X for those who prefer very less bezels bcs XS is a shame!NOTE - i suggest you to wait for SE2. if rumours are to be believed, we will get latest processor and many more latest features in just 28\u201330k. just like its predecessor, SE2 will be game changer kind of smartphone i believe. it is likely to be released in march. another important thing is that my sample size is very small but i am surrounded by many iPhone users and most of them keep same view as mine.

            "answer_text": "The iPhone XR has a 6.1 inch screen, 12MP rear camera, 3GB of ram with Apple\u2019s A12 Bionic chip and a 2942Mah battery. The battery life is the best of the iPhones released in 2018. The iPhone XR is a great budget phone for 2020, if you really want an iPhone. If you don\u2019t really need an upgrade, you might want to wait until September, where Apple will either release a new budget phone or at least decrease the price of the iPhone XR and also the iPhone 11, which is only \u00a3100 more than the XR. If you desperately need an upgrade right now and you\u2019re on a tight budget, I\u2019d recommend the iPhone XR. If you need an upgrade but are willing to spend \u00a3100 more, I\u2019d suggest the iPhone 11 for the upgraded dual camera system and the newer A13 chip, which will be supported for a year longer. If you don\u2019t really need an upgrade and aren\u2019t so desperate, I\u2019d just wait until September for the new budget phone or the price drop in the xr and the 11. ",
