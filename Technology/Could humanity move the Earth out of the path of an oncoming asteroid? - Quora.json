            "answer_text": "I dislike this question because at its core, it\u2019s asking whether or not humanity has the technology to alter the trajectory of a massive object in order to save humanity. Fundamentally, an asteroid must be smaller than a planet (otherwise the asteroid IS a planet) and therefore less massive. So in essence, this asks: Can we alter the trajectory of a massive objectIf yes, can we move the MORE massive object out of the way of the smaller object?If the asker was concerned about the welfare of humanity, this question should read- \u201cCan we alter the path of an asteroid headed for collision with the Earth?\u201d That aside, the answer is most likely no- but not certainly. Depending on how far it is away, even a small objects gravitational attraction over a long enough period could alter the trajectory sufficiently to cause avoidance. There is also the option of weaponry, in which nuclear warheads or similar could create a large enough impulse if detonated close to the surface of the asteroid to alter the trajectory as well. Ultimately though, humanity would do nothing until it is too late. Look at climate change! Doom lurks on the horizon for humanity and we do nothing because of \u201ccost\u201d (as though cost is relevant when the alternative is literal extinction). In reality, if scientists detected an oncoming asteroid and proposed a plan to avert it, humanity would go thru the following: It\u2019s a hoaxMaybe it\u2019s real, but it\u2019s too expensive to deal withThe window of opportunity has passed so we can\u2019t avert it in time anymore anywayEveryone Dies\u2122",

            "answer_text": "Right now? No way. In the not so distant future? Not the Earth, its not only way too massive, you would also risk completely screwing up the delicate balance related to our orbit, the Sun and Moon, causing ecological disaster. And even if we could control that, it would take a huge amount of accessible material (Earth\u2019s crust) to create enough \u201cequal but opposite\u201d force to move it, even though the material you might use could be going very fast. The better option is to detect potential asteroids ahead of time, get a moderate propulsion system (which would work better anyway, becausem you dont have to deal with any noticeable atmosphere), and slightly deflect its path from a long distance away, whete a small amount of acceleration amounts to a big position differenc over time. And, you wouldn't have to worry about ecological issues, up to and including possible radiation. ",

            "answer_text": "Not with our current technology, and, I imagine, never. But the question itself is backward: as asteroids are vastly smaller and less massive than the Earth, we'd try to deflect the asteroid, even were we able to move our whole planet. Also, moving the world would likely have severe effects on our climate and geological stability. ",
