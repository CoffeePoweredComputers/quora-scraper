            "answer_text": "Session management is just a generalized term for how a remote computer keeps truck of data that is relevant to you when you come back to the computer. It can get immensely complicated, but that is really all it is conceptually. If you shop at Amazon or another web site and you are creating a shopping cart of goods that you might purchase,the shopping cart would typically be stored in a session. It is difficult to generalize what would be in a session - that is up to the developer of he software.
