            "answer_text": "I believe the man-made device you are referring to is the Diamond Anvil Cell (DAC). Here is a schematic of this small device:  A DAC is constructed with two opposing diamonds that can be compressed together. The sample is placed between the polished tips ( called cutlets) of the two diamonds which is then compressed together. The uniaxial pressure supplied by the DAC is transformed into uniform hydrostatic pressure using a pressure-transmitting medium such as a gas or liquid. The transmitting medium is held in place with a gasket as the opposing diamonds are compressed together. The structure of the sample can be interrogated in situ using X-rays or visible light. Thus a host of spectroscopic methods such as X-Ray diffraction, Raman, photoluminescence, etc can be used to interrogate the sample when subject to high pressures. One might ask what pressure level can be achieved in a DAC. The typical pressure levels in a DAC are around 100\u2013200 gigapascal ( GPa) although it is possible to achieve pressures up to 770 GPa. For reference the pressure at the boundary of the Earth\u2019s inner and outer core ranges from 300\u2013360 GPa. Note I GPa is 9869 atm! ",
