            "answer_text": "Artificial intelligence (AI): IT is the simulation of human intelligence processes by machines, especially computer systems. These processes include learning (the acquisition of information and rules for using the information), reasoning (using rules to reach approximate or definite conclusions) and self-correction.  Scope of artificial intelligence in different areas In the field of educationEducational software can be adapted to student needsArtificial intelligence can automate basic activities in education, like gradingIt can point out places where courses need to improveStudents could get additional support from AI tutorsAI-driven programs can give students and educators helpful feedbackData powered by AI can change how schools find, teach, and support studentsIt is altering how we find and interact with informationLanguage understanding - The ability to \"understand\" and respond to the natural language. To translate from spoken language to a written form and to translate from one natural language to another natural language.Speech UnderstandingSemantic Information Processing (Computational Linguistics)Question Answering Information Retrieval 5. Language TranslationLearning and adaptive systems - The ability to adapt behavior based on previous experience, and to develop general rules concerning the world based on such experience.CyberneticsConcept FormationProblem solving - Ability to formulate a problem in a suitable representation, to plan for its solution and to know when new information is needed and how to obtain it.Inference (Resolution-Based Theorem Proving, Plausible Inference and Inductive Inference)Interactive Problem SolvingAutomatic Program WritingHeuristic SearchRobots: A combination of most or all of the above abilities with the ability to move over terrain and manipulate objects.ExplorationTransportation/NavigationIndustrial Automation (e.g., Process Control, Assembly Tasks, Executive Tasks)Security 5. Other (Agriculture, Fishing, Mining, Sanitation, Construction, etc.)MilitaryGames - The ability to accept a formal set of rules for games such asChess,Go, Kalah,Checkers, etc., and to translate these rules into a representation or structure which allows problem solving and learning abilities to be used in reaching an adequate level of performance.For emergency services - When we allow handling emergency to A.I then it is more beneficial for us. Because when some emergency come likeFire and Flood: - then we can send metal or silicon firefighters to save people because they have no danger to loss life, machines can also defy higher temperatures and can tolerate smoke easily and can search easily in close-quarters by using lasers and radar where as people may not be able to seeFor Entertainment- We can apply artificial intelligence to the world of music, can make artificial director which see the real world and can generate the stories.For providing services to customers - Now a day\u2019s, for providing services to the customer artificial intelligence is using in place of human being. When any person does calculation like preparing bill, handling account information he can do calculation error but machine do calculation properly and no mistake is done by the machine.Searching techniques in artificial intelligence - The main characteristics expert system is to collect information from many sources and collect at one place.",

            "answer_text": "The topic is so vast that probably it needs few books to cover the whole matter, rather than just a few paragraphs that we usually write on quora. Today we have AI in our life, without our conscious realizations as we have salt in our food. We experience the lack of existence of salt only when it is not present. Pick up any topic and you will see AI benefiting our life in a much deeper way. Starting with Quora where we are communicating - AI is helping the system to rightly reach right content to concerned person. You and I are able to connect only because of AI software, where the system connects us because of our interest matching. Likewise, pick up any of the shopping e-commerce site. The system is able to create a much bigger market place for anyone in the country, and reach to wider set of audience. Shoppers and vendors are able to connect with each other as per their exact serving needs and offers due to AI software. Among the list of millions of product choices, the system is able to present to you, the very customized list of your product needs and all this has happened because of AI. Pick up accomodation, hotel booking or home booking apps like airbnb, AI is helping millions of travellers to find the right accomodation of their choice in a completely unknown place. As we come to search, the google search, AI is powering its capacity to offer precise results as we need or we are looking for in millions or billions of contents available around the world. Look at the maps and navigation - AI is helping us finding the right route and reach our destination in minimum time, as per our choice of preferences - whether you want to save on the distances, save on time, save on toll or likewise. We have heard of smart cities, smart governance etc. AI will be the centerpiece for all of these systems. ",
