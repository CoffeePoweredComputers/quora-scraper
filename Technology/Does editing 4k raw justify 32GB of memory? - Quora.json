Perhaps you will be best served with a 40\u201348 inch 4k monitor on thunderbolt / dp / minidp ver. 1.2 or more, and a minimum of 60 hz refresh rate on both screen and graphics card. More often than not they only manage 30 hz, witch sucks bad. Seems like moderne HDMI 2.0 capability on both monitor and screencard or the new USB connectors cope 4k 60 hz out of the box, but I would not beat on it. ",
