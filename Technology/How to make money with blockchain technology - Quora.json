From using a remote for controlling devices to using voice notes for giving commands; modern technology has made space in our regular lives. Technologies like augmented reality and IoT that have gained pace in the past decade and now there\u2019s a new addition to the pack i.e. Blockchain Technology. Blockchain \u2013 The revolutionary technology impacting different industries miraculously was introduced in the markets with its very first modern application Bitcoin. Bitcoin is nothing but a form of digital currency (cryptocurrency) which can be used in the place of fiat money for trading. And the underlying technology behind the success of cryptocurrencies is termed as Blockchain. There\u2019s a common misconception among people that Bitcoin and Blockchain are one and the same, however, that is not the case. Creating cryptocurrencies is one of the applications of Blockchain technology and other than Bitcoin, there are numerous applications that are being developed on the basis of the blockchain technology. What is a Blockchain?  In the simplest terms, Blockchain can be described as a data structure that holds transactional records and while ensuring security, transparency, and decentralization. You can also think of it as a chain or records stored in the forms of blocks which are controlled by no single authority. A blockchain is a distributed ledger that is completely open to any and everyone on the network. Once an information is stored on a blockchain, it is extremely difficult to change or alter it. Each transaction on a blockchain is secured with a digital signature that proves its authenticity. Due to the use of encryption and digital signatures, the data stored on the blockchain is tamper-proof and cannot be changed. Blockchain technology allows all the network participants to reach an agreement, commonly known as consensus. All the data stored on a blockchain is recorded digitally and has a common history which is available for all the network participants. This way, the chances of any fraudulent activity or duplication of transactions is eliminated without the need of a third-party. In order to understand blockchain better, consider an example where you are looking for an option to send some money to your friend who lives in a different location. A general option that you can normally use can be a bank or via a payment transfer application like PayPal or Paytm. This option involves third parties in order to process the transaction due to which an extra amount of your money is deducted as transferring fee. Moreover, in cases like these, you cannot ensure the security of your money as it is highly possible that a hacker might disrupt the network and steal your money. In both the cases, it is the customer who suffers. This is where Blockchain comes in. Instead of using a bank for transferring money, if we use a blockchain in such cases, the process becomes much easier and secure. There is no extra fee involved as the funds are directly processed by you thus, eliminating the need for a third party. Moreover, the blockchain database is decentralized and is not limited to any single location meaning that all the information and records kept on the blockchain are public and decentralized. Since the information is not stored in a single place, there\u2019s no chance of corruption of the information by any hacker. How Does a Blockchain Work?  Source: Fuat \u015eanl\u0131 (Dribbble) A blockchain is a chain of blocks that contain data or information. Despite being discovered earlier, the first successful and popular application of the Blockchain technology came into being in the year 2009 by Satoshi Nakamoto. He created the first digital cryptocurrency called Bitcoin through the use of Blockchain technology. Let\u2019s understand how a blockchain actually works. Each block in a blockchain network stores some information along with the hash of its previous block. A hash is a unique mathematical code which belongs to a specific block. If the information inside the block is modified, the hash of the block will be subject to modification too. The connection of blocks through unique hash keys is what makes blockchain secure. While transactions take place on a blockchain, there are nodes on the network that validate these transactions. In Bitcoin blockchain, these nodes are called as miners and they use the concept of proof-of-work in order to process and validate transactions on the network. In order for a transaction to be valid, each block must refer to the hash of its preceding block. The transaction will take place only and only if the hash is correct. If a hacker tries to attack the network and change information of any specific block, the hash attached to the block will also get modified. The breach will be detected as the modified hash will not match with the original one. This ensures that the blockchain is unalterable as if any change which is made to the chain of blocks will be reflected throughout the entire network and will be detected easily. In a nutshell, here\u2019s how blockchain allows transactions to take place: A blockchain network makes use of public and private keys in order to form a digital signature ensuring security and consent.Once the authentication is ensured through these keys, the need for authorization arises.Blockchain allows participants of the network to perform mathematical verifications and reach a consensus to agree on any particular value.While making a transfer, the sender uses their private key and announces the transaction information over the network. A block is created containing information such as digital signature, timestamp, and the receiver\u2019s public key.This block of information is broadcasted through the network and the validation process starts.Miners all over the network start solving the mathematical puzzle related to the transaction in order to process it. Solving this puzzle requires the miners to invest their computing power.Upon solving the puzzle first, the miner receives rewards in the form of bitcoins. Such kind of problems is referred to as proof-of-work mathematical problems.Once the majority of nodes in the network come to a consensus and agree to a common solution, the block is time stamped and added to the existing blockchain. This block can contain anything from money to data to messages.After the new block is added to the chain, the existing copies of blockchain are updated for all the nodes on the network.Blockchain Features  The following features make the revolutionary technology of blockchain stand out: Decentralised Blockchains are decentralized in nature meaning that no single person or group holds the authority of the overall network. While everybody in the network has the copy of the distributed ledger with them, no one can modify it on his or her own. This unique feature of blockchain allows transparency and security while giving power to the users. Peer-to-Peer Network With the use of Blockchain, the interaction between two parties through a peer-to-peer model is easily accomplished without the requirement of any third party. Blockchain uses P2P protocol which allows all the network participants to hold an identical copy of transactions, enabling approval through a machine consensus. For example, if you wish to make any transaction from one part of the world to another, you can do that with blockchain all by yourself within a few seconds. Moreover, any interruptions or extra charges will not be deducted in the transfer. Immutable The immutability property of a blockchain refers to the fact that any data once written on the blockchain cannot be changed. To understand immutability, consider sending email as an example. Once you send an email to a bunch of people, you cannot take it back. In order to find a way around, you\u2019ll have to ask all the recipients to delete your email which is pretty tedious. This is how immutability works. Once the data has been processed, it cannot be altered or changed. In case of the blockchain, if you try to change the data of one block, you\u2019ll have to change the entire blockchain following it as each block stores the hash of its preceding block. Change in one hash will lead to change in all the following hashes. It is extremely complicated for someone to change all the hashes as it requires a lot of computational power to do so. Hence, the data stored in a blockchain is non-susceptible to alterations or hacker attacks due to immutability. Tamper-Proof With the property of immutability embedded in blockchains, it becomes easier to detect tampering of any data. Blockchains are considered tamper-proof as any change in even one single block can be detected and addressed smoothly. There are two key ways of detecting tampering namely, hashes and blocks. As described earlier, each hash function associated with a block is unique. You can consider it like a fingerprint of a block. Any change in the data will lead to a change in the hash function. Since the hash function of one block is linked to next block, in order for a hacker to make any changes, he/she will have to change hashes of all the blocks after that block which is quite difficult to do. Types of Blockchains  Though Blockchain has evolved to many levels since inception, there are two broad categories in which blockchains can be classified majorly i.e. Public and Private blockchains. Before heading towards the difference between these two, let\u2019s keep a check on the similarities that both public and private blockchain have: Both Public and Private blockchain have peer-to-peer decentralized networks.All the participants of the network maintain the copy of the shared ledger with them.The network maintains copies of the ledger and synchronizes the latest update with the help of consensus.The rules for immutability and safety of the ledger are decided and applied on the network so as to avoid malicious attacks.Now that we know the similar elements of both these blockchains, let\u2019s learn about each of them in detail and the differences between them. Public Blockchain \u2013 As the name suggests, a public blockchain is a permissionless ledger and can be accessed by any and everyone. Anyone with the access to the internet is eligible to download and access it. Moreover, one can also check the overall history of the blockchain along with making any transactions through it. Public blockchains usually reward their network participants for performing the mining process and maintaining the immutability of the ledger. An example of the public blockchain is the Bitcoin Blockchain. Public blockchains allow the communities worldwide to exchange information openly and securely. However, an obvious disadvantage of this type of blockchain is that it can be compromised if the rules around it are not executed strictly. Moreover, the rules decided and applied initially have very little scope of modification in the later stages. Private Blockchain \u2013 Contrary to the public blockchain, private blockchains are the ones which are shared only among the trusted participants. The overall control of the network is in the hands of the owners. Moreover, the rules of a private blockchain can be changed according to different levels of permissions, exposure, number of members, authorization etc. Private blockchains can run independently or can be integrated with other blockchains too. These are usually used by enterprises and organizations. Therefore, the level of trust required amongst the participants is higher in private blockchains. Popular Applications of Blockchain Technology  Source: Sumeet \u2013 Evontech Though Bitcoins and cryptocurrencies are the first popular application of Blockchain technology, they are not the only ones. The nature of Blockchain technology has led businesses, industries, and entrepreneurs from all around the world to explore the technology\u2019s potential and make revolutionary changes in different sectors. While the basic idea of trustworthy records and giving the power in the hands of users has enormous potential, it sure has raised a lot of hype in the markets too. The magic of this technology sure has the power to transform industries given the usage is planned and executable in actual senses. Let\u2019s separate the wheat from the chaff and find out how Blockchain can be useful in actual implementation. Smart contracts Different businesses deal with each other in order to exchange services or products. All the give and take terms and conditions are signed by the involved parties in the form of agreements or contracts. However, these paper-based contracts are prone to errors and frauds which challenges the trust factor between both the parties and raises risks. Blockchain brings forward an amazing solution to this problem through Smart Contracts. Smart contracts perform similar functions as paper-based agreements. The differentiating factor about smart contracts is that these are digital as well as self-executable in nature. Self-executable meaning that when certain conditions in the code of these contracts are met, they are automatically deployed. Ethereum, an open source blockchain platform has introduced smart contracts in the Blockchain ecosystem. Smart contracts can be used for different situations or industries such as financial agreements, health insurances, real estate property documents, crowdfunding etc. For example, Blockchain smart contracts can be used in healthcare to manage drug supply. Once the name and quantity of a drug is shipped from a manufacturing company to be delivered ahead to the pharmacist, a smart contract with all the valid data like the information of the drug, the quantity of supply etc. can be created. This smart contract will be responsible for managing the entries throughout the entire supply chain between different intermediaries. Since the smart contract works on certain defined conditions, no one can alter them or make any changes in the contract thus, ensuring trust and authenticity of the drugs. Government Elections No matter how secure government elections are made, the chances of frauds through anti-social elements always persists. The current voting system relies on manual processing and trust. Even if security breaches and frauds are eliminated, the chances of manual errors cannot be ignored. In such cases, the best solution is to automate the overall process with the help of smart contracts. Blockchain smart contracts provide a modern system through which these common issues can be easily eliminated. Entries in the smart contracts will allow transparency and security while maintaining the privacy of the voters thus, enabling fair elections. Identity management The world is getting more digitized with every passing day. Consider financial transactions happening online for instance, you can easily login with your credentials and security pin in order to access your funds. However, in this case, no one can ensure the identity of the person taking out the money. If your username and password are hacked by someone, there\u2019s no way to secure your money. The need of the hour is to have a system that manages individual identification on the web. The distributed ledger technology used in blockchains offers you advanced methods of public-private encryption using which, you can prove your identity and digitize your documents. This unique secure identity can work as a saviour for you while conducting any financial transactions or any online interactions on a shared economy. Moreover, the gap between different government bodies and private organizations can be filled through a universal online identity solution that blockchain can provide. Intellectual Property Protection Digital content or information can easily be reproduced and distributed with the aid of the internet. Due to this, people from all around the world hold the power to copy, replicate and use it without giving credits to the actual producer of the content. There are copyright laws to protect such issues but in the current scenario, these laws aren\u2019t appropriately defined according to common global standards. Meaning that any law which is valid in the US might not stand true in Australia. Even if there\u2019s any copyright applied to any intellectual property, people easily lose control over their data and suffer on financial terms. With the aid of Blockchain technology, all the copyrights can be stored in the form of smart contracts which will enable automation in businesses along with the increase in online sale thus, eliminating the redistribution risk. Blockchain for IP registry will help the authors, owners or users to get clarity of copyright. Once they register their work online, they\u2019ll own the evidence which will be tamper-proof. As blockchain is immutable in nature, any entry once stored on the Blockchain cannot be changed or modified. The owner of the work will have the overall authority over the ownership as well as the distribution of the content. Conclusion Other than these few examples, the revolutionary technology of Blockchain holds a high potential of applications in many different industries and sectors. While some industries have already started adopting blockchain in their businesses, many are still exploring the best possible ways to start with. Blockchain is a new name in the world of technologies but it is definitely the one to last. Even in the early stages, the technology has gained huge popularity starting with their very first application of cryptocurrencies. More areas of applications are being discovered and tested with each passing day. Once the technology is adopted and accepted on a global level, it\u2019ll transform the way we live today. ",

            "answer_text": "IF YOU READ FULLY THEN YOU'LL UNDERSTAND CLEAR CONCEPT OF THE BLOCK CHAIN TECHNOLOGY IN INDIA Let\u2019s think of it this way and keep it very simple: There are 100 Zoozs out there. Each one is worth $1. There are 100 network participants. 50 drivers and 50 riders. Each ride costs 1 Zooz. As word gets around that La\u2019Zooz is cheaper than Uber, more people want Zoozs. So they trade their dollars or Bitcoins for Zoozs, which increases the price of a Zooz to $2. So now everyone who has a Zooz has $2 worth of value instead of $1. The purchasing power has doubled, so you can afford 2 rides for 1 Zooz instead of 1. So you sell half a Zooz to someone who needs one and keep the other one for buying rides. The drivers who were charging 1 Zooz now see the value of the ride they gave in the past go from $1 to $2 (retroactively) and are more inclined to accept Zoozs because they expect more people to join the network. In effect, by taking these tokens, you are getting value today AND getting value in the future. Instead of Uber capturing the value that accrues, the owners of the network (the token holders) capture the value. Whoa! This is what will happen in all kinds of networks: identity networks, reputation networks, social networks (why should Facebook get all the value that you create by posting? You should), and many more. This is precisely what has happened with Bitcoin over the past nine years. Block chain technology 1)The blockchain is a digital technology for recording and verifying transactions. It is a key concept behind innovations related to cryptocurrencies in general, and OneCoin in particular.The blockchain was first introduced as an alternative mechanism for the trust between two parties that make transactions that differentiated it from the way traditional institutions like banks or escrow agents processed payments. 2)Most recently the blockchain is considered a powerful tool that can provide new products and services, and improve traditional ones. The number of financial institutions and firms across industries that are using the distributed ledger technology as a secure and transparent way to digitally track the ownership of assets is constantly increasing. This is a move that helps companies to speed up transactions and cut cross border remittances while lowering the risk of fraud. 3)The language may be technical but the concept is simple. Proof-of-work is what safeguards the blockchain. Nakamoto says that PROOF OF WORK is used to implement a peer-to-peer distributed timestamp network (mentioned above). The process scans for a value that when hashed, results in a certain numerical expression. The timestamp network must reconcile this value with a block\u2019s hash. CPU power is needed to satisfy the proof-of-work, and the block cannot be changed without redoing the work. Later blocks are chained after it, and to change the block would require redoing all the blocks after it. 4) Today this technology is finding uses in many other industries apart from cryptocurrencies. Blockchain is called the trust protocol and has application in all the areas where markets are inefficient with very low trust. The data is difficult to hack as it is distributed across computers. The technology is expected to change the way education, government and corporates work. MOST IMPORTANTLY THE VALUE OF BITCOINS IS INCREASING DAY BY DAY AND YEAR BY YEAR ENORMOUSLY ESPECIALLY IN OUR COUNTRY NOW COST OF 1 BITCOIN=MORE THAN 11 LACK'S BUT BEFORE IN 2013 IT'S COST NOT MORE THAN A LACK VERY LESS PEOPLE WHO PURCHASED THIS AT THAT TIME WILL BE GREATLY BENEFITED FROM IT AND NOT ONLY THAT APART FROM BITCOINS THERE ARE ALSO OTHERS CRYPTO COINS SIMILAR TO BIT COIN APPROXIMATELY MORE THAN 800 COINS ARE TRADING DAILY ?

In summer 2016, the company unveiled their new blockchain-based private and public equities trading platform t\u00d8, which allows instant and secure share trading online. Unlike Nasdaq stock exchange company, which has experimented with blockchain-powered trading as well in partnership with Chain, t\u00d8 founders initially confirmed that their company does not plan to use bitcoin blockchain for issuing stocks. Openbazaar startup has embarked on a new mission to introduce a fee-free online marketplace similar to eBay, which is powered by blockchain. They promote an active exchange of goods and services between two parties without relying on a risky centralized authority and hence, enabling more people to start their e-commerce business without paying for additional e-commerce tools. A number of blockchain startups have emerged to cater P2P micro-payments. Sentbe offers a 60% less expensive service for sending money abroad and offers cash pickup locations as an alternative to card/bank transfers \u2013 a good selling point for attracting the unbanked population to their service. Abra is a similar app aimed at US-consumers, which also allows conducting free P2P money transfers and receiving payouts either to your bank account or in cash by using only a person\u2019s phone number.

The best superlative thing is when you can make money out of it. Let us see how can we do that. First and foremost, you can money with it when you are a professional developer. A successful professional developer who can use, function and integrate that service of the technology to whoever needs it.A real-world facing project, as a research project, which has a large amount of data, information, transactions, and transfers happening. So ideally if you are a professional developer you can help them integrate their software\u2019s, their databases and their network systems with blockchain technology. The technology is upgraded, best and wonderful to use. And certainly, a service given for any business has a cost involved to it. You can make money here, when you a developer, you handle these things and provide a service for the same. If you are a professional developer, you are authorized and capable of earning an amazing amount of money with blockchain technology. You have a designated profile and work of functioning the technology for businesses and its processes and you basically work for them. So, you charge for it, and that\u2019s the step where you gain money out of it. Also say, if you are already working in the field of some other field of information technology, you can be a freelancer and earn money by providing these services to the business.But very importantly, you need to very well versed with the skills, and essentially have that desired skill set to function the technology.After researching and understanding, because when you have to make money out if it, you need to be clear that how can it be done. So, you or even I would take the efforts then require to do that.For being a professional developer, a person who functions the program professionally you need to certainly do a professional course, a degree or say a certification in the field of the topic so that you get relevant for working in the industry. So for blockchain technology also, you need to pursue a course which is best fit for you. And when you see, nowadays we need flexibility and quality together. So that\u2019s the reason I invested a huge time in researching for myself and then suggesting that how do you make money out of the technology.The great idea is to do a paid online course in the field of blockchain technology. The paid online course has the amount of flexibility that you need, and they have the best of quality and approach for learning. One of the courses that my friend has done, and even I enquired about the same because even I am wailing to learn it. The course is done from an institute named upGrad. They have courses for both freshers as well as professionals. But what was best suited for him, and for me will be the beginner course that is offered by them. The beginner course will teach me from scratch and give me extensive knowledge about blockchain technology. The course name is \u201cSoftware Development Specialisation in Blockchain,\u201d It is nearly an 11 months course and has 500+hours of learning. To mention some of the few overview details and program highlights, the course is designed for working professionals, they have one to one with industry mentors, they have a lot of projects and assignments for the same. They have a practical hands-on workshop. You should check out more highlights if you are interested in the program When you do the course, you lead to be a professional developer. And that is what is important for you to make money with the technology of blockchain. Also, to add, something that I read somewhere, though I am not having more of details for the same, it seems the businesses also make money with blockchain technology, your blockchain wallet will generate a unique bitcoin and bitcoin cash address every time you want to receive funds. To request funds using an address, simply click request at the top of your wallet. I hope my views were of help to you. ",

A lot of people are into Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies in order to make a quick buck and we all know it is not that easy. I did some personal research myself on google recently while I was trying to invest and make more money with cryptos. I found this bitcoin miner on google (cryptojacking.worm AT gmail com) and I saw some excellent reviews so I contacted the team, I negotiated with them for a few days and started making a lot of money daily from their mining services. Truth be told I had a very wonderful experience with them and I\u2019ve introduced them to few family members and friends that believe in the new currency. I promised to publish a review for them because they have changed my life for good and I believe that the world would be a better place if we often help each other.

            "answer_text": "Staking is becoming more popular than ever before in the cryptocurrency world. It is with this in mind that KuCoin has announced the launch of their new soft staking feature. The purpose of this new variation is help eliminate some of the risk involved with traditional staking by removing the need for your coins to be locked up. Instead, the KuCoin soft staking option will allow users to access their staked coins as and when they please. Describing the new service as offering a \u201clow-risk, passive profit generation from staking, while maintaining full control of your tokens.\u201d How Does it Work? This means that if the market dumps or you see a new investment possibility, you can make use of the coins you are staking. Thus, allowing you to simultaneously earn via your tokens and react to a fluctuating market. With no set time period for the staking, you will gain rewards while being able to enjoy two main characteristics of cryptocurrencies, independence and freedom. Via soft staking by KuCoin, you will also manage to keep the two core factors of staking intact. Security and technological capacity. In the blog post announcing the launch of soft staking, they explained, \u201cKuCoin is able to take advantage of the infrastructure already in place and use it to function as a secure network to enable Soft Staking, providing returns on staked tokens while maintaining a fluid system to allow users to remain in control of their assets.\u201d Which Coins Can I Soft Stake? The soft staking option on KuCoin is already in place, with a selection of tokens already available for users to partake in soft staking with. These include: Cosmos\uff08ATOM\uff09 EOS\uff08EOS\uff09 Tron\uff08TRX\uff09 Internet of Services\uff08IOST\uff09 Neblio (NEBL) DeepOnion (ONION) Energi (NRG) NULS (NULS) TomoChain (TOMO) EOSForce (EOSC) Loom Network (LOOM) Loki (LOKI) V Systems (VSYS) WAN (Wanchin) IoTeX (IOTX) Tezos (XTZ) No doubt, you will be familiar with at least a handful of these tokens already and may already be staking them elsewhere. Thus, KuCoin can aim to improve your staking experience with that token in question. This list of tokens at the moment might not be as extensive as perhaps some users may be looking for but the concept is an altogether new thing and that list is like to be subject to growth in the near future. What About Returns? KuCoin notes that in terms of your returns, they will be based on \u201cannualized return rate based on each project individually\u201d. As opposed to perhaps more impressive returns other staking methods offer. This is the price of the freedom it offers However, if it saves you in the case of severe market fluctuation, then it is a small price to pay. Although the concept is all new and it remains to be seen whether it will pan out as well as it sounds, it does initially look like a beneficial option. Particularly for beginners to staking, looking to benefit it with fewer strings attached. Let\u2019s see if it catches on. ",

            "answer_text": "There are three ways to make money with cryptocurrencies. TradingMiningbuy and holdI am not a fan of the first 2 and base most of my beliefs in the fact that most people who accumulate wealth do so through long term investing versus trading. The have done so through stocks (Buffet), Real Estate, Start ups, and most likely cryptocurrency! Other than crypto being a very young industry the basics are the same. Get behind a few good solid cryptocurrencies that really have something of value to offer the world and you will do well. Banging in and out of trades in my opinion eventually leads to losing your money. Mining is a different beast and has many variables that can lead to losing money. The technology can change almost over night requiring further investment. The cost of electricity can increase or the value of the cryptocurrency can dip effecting profit. ",

            "answer_text": "Have you every considered how you make money off crypto? Most retail investors adopt a HODL mentality, the strategy of holding a coin for long-term growth. Whilst this is a solid approach, there are other ways to make money in crypto which every investor should explore. Think of it as diversifying your money making mechanisms. So how do we \u2018make money\u2019 in a bear market? How can we make money in the cryptocoin market? The key lies in diversify our money making strategies. How Do You Make Money? Take a second to analyse your portfolio. How do you look at your holdings? Do you group by their market cap? (ie. micro, small, mid, and large-cap)Do you group by category? (ie. platform, utility, currency, security, or DEX)Do you group by investment term? (ie. short, medium, and long-term)Apart from these, there are another ways to make money every day in crypto. Passive Income Passive income is income received on a regular basis requiring minimal to no effort to maintain. ARK ARK is a 3rd generation blockchain platform utilizing a Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS) consensus mechanism (DPoS). ARK has one of the best Desktop Wallets which is easy to use and fully compatible with the Ledger Nano S, making it an attractive option to set up for staking. LISK (LSK) LISK is a similar blockchain project utilising the DPoS mechanism and delegate voting. In LISK, the top 100 delegates stake coins and LISK holders can similarly vote for a delegate based off the payout they are offering. NEO NEO holders receive their dividends in the form of GAS. GAS is the cryptocurrency used as the fuel on the NEO blockchain, and is given to all NEO holders with the generation of each new NEO block is generated. At the time of writing, dividends on holding NEO range between 4\u20135.5% p.a. VeChain Thor If you\u2019ve been in the cryptocurrency space recently, you\u2019ve probably heard of VeChain. It was shilled so much that mentions of VEN were banned from the subreddit r/cryptocurrency for a month. There are two types of tokens used on the VEN (to be renamed VET) ecosystem: \u00b7 VET: VeChain Tokens are used as a smart payment currency. This provides a user with the rights and priority to use the VeChain Blockchain \u00b7 THOR: THOR Power is the fuel of the VeChain blockchain, similar to what GAS is for NEO. THOR is consumed or burnt when smart contracts are executed or when VET is transferred between different addresses. To Sum Up Generating passive income is an important strtegy to consider when setting up your cryptocurrency portfolio. Look to diversify your holdings by including projects which pay dividends so that you can still build your stacks in a down market. ",

            "answer_text": "There are many things to consider when cashing out Bitcoin. Here are a few: Do you want the easiest method or the cheapest method?Do you want the money deposited into your bank account or PayPal?How long do you want to wait to receive your cash?Which currency do you need to change your Bitcoin in to?These are some of the questions that you will need to ask yourself. So, read through the following methods on how to cash out bitcoin and then decide which is best for you. Coinbase is the most popular broker exchange for buying and selling Bitcoin. They process more Bitcoin transactions than any other broker and have a massive customer base of 13 million. Withdrawal Methods: Coinbase lets you sell Bitcoins for cash, which you can then withdraw into your bank account. You can only cash out your Bitcoin into a bank account that you have already used to buy cryptocurrency on Coinbase. So, if you haven\u2019t done this yet, I recommend purchasing a small amount of cryptocurrency first.Fees: The fees depend on the country that your bank is located in. For example, if you want to sell Bitcoin for USD, a wire transfer is $25. If you are located in the EU and have SEPA, then this costs just $0.15!Cash out times: Withdrawal times also depend on the country that your bank is located. US withdrawals normally take between 4-6 working days, while EU withdrawals take 1-3 working days.Contact Us To Find Perfect Blockchain Technology Solutions For Your Business ",

            "answer_text": "Three ways that you can use the blockchain technology in order to profit are the following: Invest in some digital currencies that you believe that have potential and wait for their value to increase in the long run. Some things you may want to do if you go this way:Go through the whitepaper of each one and understand what is the value proposition, and what problem are they trying to solveCheck on the team: Past achievements, areas of expertise, etcCheck if there is a prototype for what they want to buildTrade digital currencies frequently: This has to do with being able to predict short term fluctuations in the value of a coin and make the appropriate buy/sell decisions in order to profit from the value difference.Study decentralized application platforms like Ethereum and NEO and create a decentralized application that addresses an existing area/problem.I would say that #2 involves the most risk if you are new to trading and cryptos. #3 is more like creating your startup and going for funding through an ICO. Please note that as there are chances for you to profit, there are chances that you lose money when investing into cryptocurrencies either short, or long term. ",

I found this Crypto expert/miner via his mail address at\u2026 [ cryptojacking.worm (at)gmailcom ] I just didn\u2019t know enough about it until I contacted him. The thing I like, is that he made this crypto trading easy to understand, he also mined bitcoins and some other cryptos for me after i subscribed to his daily mining investments plan. I have seen giant gains in few days more than i ever made in stocks and I will forever remain indebted to this genius because we have only worked for a couple of months and I am a millionaire already.

But these Dapps should have a high quality and good creative ideas so that they could be widely used by people and be famous among the Internet users. When these Dapps are widely used, you can make a lot of profit from them and the tokens will rise rapidly. As is know to all, there are not any Dapps that change our lives obviously. Once there are some, I believe the price of bitcoin will rise to a new high level. I hope someone could develop one. You can do it if you are good at developing.

Blockchain technology is a new job sector without a tried and true path to success. Kids haven't grown up hearing about the technology while fostering ambitions to work on this novel tech. Therefore, the road to a career in blockchain is as new and innovative as the technology itself. => Firstly, it is going to take time and you will need to dedicate your time and resources to your education. Secondly, do not expect immediate results, becoming a blockchain developer is not a magic pill. Study the underlying computer science fields that gave birth to blockchain technology. These fields are Cryptography, Distributed Computing, and Mechanism Design. => The blockchain is unlike any other technology available. Understanding its unique value proposition is a critical building block of a blockchain education. Features like decentralization, smart contracts and Dapps are more than just buzzwords. They are the essence of the blockchain, and any successful blockchain professional will intimately understand them. => Assets are increasingly moving online, underscoring the importance of cryptography. Blockchain is renowned for its ability to protect and secure these assets, and it relies on cryptography to make this possible. Failure to appropriately employ cryptography can have devastating consequences for companies that depend on it for security. => Distributed computing is no longer a theory. In an age where reliability and security are two of the most pressing issues facing tech proliferation, distributed computing is the blockchain's solution. You need to study these issues so you can, later on, start to develop solutions to the problem. => Blockchain and the cryptocurrencies that it powers are unique for their active communities that help encourage their growth and popularity. There are hundreds of new cryptocurrency projects, and they can function as an on-the-job training mechanism for blockchain students. It's clear that those looking for a career in blockchain technology will be following a different script than tech entrepreneurs who came before them. With that in mind, what's the best way to strategically establish a career in blockchain technology? The best way to get started with Blockchain is to make sure you are well versed in how it works and how it applies to business. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes there is potential to make some serious money in cryptocurrencies. But they are high risk / high reward. There are two main ways these days to make money out of crypto. ICO investment. Usually an ICO has a set price for their token (i.e. 1 ETH = 2,000 of their token). The idea is that the price of the token will grow and you will be able to sell it on an exchange later in the future. (For example ETH = 469 USD, if the token you bought raises to 0.50 USD and you sell, you have made a profit of 531 dollars.) Of course this depends on how successful the ICO is, when it hits an exchange and the token flow is good. There are many pitfalls to get to the this stage and you have to be careful in choosing the right ICO. If the ICO isn\u2019t great you risk of losing your money. So only invest once you believe the project is good, and invest only what you can afford to lose.Offering services / other free ways to get hold of some crypto. I would recommend that if you want to start investing into crypto, invest your time rather than your money. There are many ways to earn cryptocurrencies. Below I have attached an article that points out some ways you can earn crypto without investing your money or buying mining equipment.How to earn Cryptocurrency without Investing or Mining Once you know the crypto sphere, you can invest into altcoins / bitcoin or ICOs. You can find ICOs on Bitcoin Forum - Index (as every ICO is pretty much listed there and has a thread where you can ask questions), here and also can use ICO rating websites (although only use this as a way to find new ICOs, don\u2019t take the ratings too seriously).I hope this helps and good luck out there! There is tones of potential in crypto, its just getting your head around it. Hope this helps and if you have any questions, feel free to ask me. ",

It is a good time to buy altcoins.Regarding your question HOW ? Create your account at any exchange poloneix , bittrex, cryptopia or any famous exchange out there.Buy btc, look into altcoins (research is required). Buy altcoin.Hold.
