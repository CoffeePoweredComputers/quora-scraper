            "answer_text": "This depends on what you mean by \u2018the next level\u2019. There are several major technologies that could have a profound effect on humanity. One, naturally, is fusion power. A near infinite, non-varying source of clean energy for the planet. Pollution? No longer a thing. Too much carbon, we need to capture it? We\u2019ve got a bucket of clean energy to do that with. Running out of Helium? Guess what the reaction produces. It would allow hunanity to stop worrying about how to reduce the amount we\u2019re screwing the planet up by, and start working towards actually fixing our mess - while allowing us to scale up our energy production without fear of making things worse. The lack of need for oil and coal would also result in a major shift in geopolitics, as countries relying on their export and import start to lose that market. Another gamechanging tech would be truly successful genetic modification. It ain\u2019t gonna turn us into Captain America, or give us the eyes of a Hawk, but what it will do is allow us to eliminate genetic diseases and conditions. Got a genetic predisposition to heart failure, cancer, obesity, diabetes, dementia, anything? We could fix that. Someone has a genetic resistance to various diseases that are common and harmful? We can add that to everyone in the next generation. This technology would come with a host of ethical issues, which is why generally its somewhat avoided, but if achieved its potential uses would result in a healthier human populace, relatively without fear of disease. A technological revolution we\u2019re going through at the moment, known as Industry 4.0, is the automation revolution. Its still developing, but its not inconceivable that within a few decades a huge portion of jobs could be replaced by automation. Hell, to some extent its already happened. What happens when cars don\u2019t need drivers, factories and warehouses don\u2019t need workers, disaster relief and analysis is done via automated hardware rather than boots on the ground. Logistics and production no longer need human input, and they\u2019re a huge portion of jobs globally. What happens to all the people who depend on them for their livelihood? Society would need to change. Ideally, this automated production and logistics could be used to drastically increase the productivity of our species, providing a baseline amount of resources every human could have without work, and thus without fear of starvation or death without a home, and every human focused on greater endeavours; creating new ideas, helping to solve problems within societies, and interacting with other people. With the basics taken care of, we could all focus on moving forward as best we can. Of course the flipside of this is we don\u2019t change as a society and we end up with massive slums of people unable to afford goods, as they can\u2019t earn money from a job that doesn\u2019t exist, while companies that pay no wages charge ever higher prices for products produced for increasingly lower prices, aiming to make enough money to justify their huge existence from the few people rich enough to buy off them. I\u2019ve got hope for the former, but there are definitely those trying to push towards the latter. The biggest game changing tech, however, would be a true artificial intelligence. Its what\u2019s known as the singularity; we invent a machine more intelligent than we are. After that, we don\u2019t know what could happen. Maybe, if its handled poorly, Skynet and we all die. The other possibility is it unlocks research that would take us decades within months, and advances all aspects of human technology faster than we possibly could. We enter a golden era where a near perfect intelligence is able to perfect technology to make us happier, healthier, more productive, and unlocks new horizons for us to explore should we wish. We have no idea what could be possible, what an intelligence greater than our own could do and achieve, but it would almost certainly involve all of the aspects listed above. Society itself would also need to change, and our reaction to the existence of such an intelligence could also be anything, and lead anywhere. This discovery is the true horizon, beyond which things change in an inconceivable way, much like the invention of Electricity allowed changes inconceivable to people before its invention to occur.

            "answer_text": "Fusion power, or a battery storage Breakthrough. An that would have to be a big breakthrough. Fusion is always 30 to 50 years away, but at least they\u2019re building a large test reactor in France. I remember when the US was The place for giant physics experiments. The Republicans in the 90\u2019s prefered bombs to science. Sigh. ",
