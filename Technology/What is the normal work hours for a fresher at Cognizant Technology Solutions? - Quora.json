            "answer_text": "To be precise, Not only Cognizant Technology Solutions, in every corporate, working hours entirely depend on you and your manager\u2026 See how\u2026 Corporates are concerned with output (target within deadline) and not time for output (unless you are taking excessive time)\u2026 So, faster you complete your work, faster you can go\u2026 Even, some corporates allow you to do work from home\u2026 If your reporting manager actually has good managerial capabilities and provided, you are giving output on time, he/she will never mess up with you for short working hours. Rather, he/she will stand by you for all odds\u2026  So, don\u2019t worry\u2026 No need to go through the conventional 9 hours (9 am to 6 pm), but put in your efforts to complete the work as soon as possible\u2026 Trust me, Corporate Life is Coool\u2026 So, Enjoy it to the fullest!!!

But again! it could be possible, that you haven't been assigned any task. If this is the case, then you needn't worry. The maximum that you'd have to stay in office would be till 6 in the evening. :D ",
