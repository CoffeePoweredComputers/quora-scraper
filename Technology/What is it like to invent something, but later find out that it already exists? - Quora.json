            "answer_text": "Deflating but sometimes oddly relieving. Deflating in the sense that images of fame, grandeur, and being the next Steve Jobs are quickly dissipated, but relieving because there's already a solution to the problem I was experiencing. An example: A little while back, I had an idea for a website that connected people who were experts at a certain skill or hobby with people eager to learn a new skill or hobby. For example, if you wanted to learn how to skateboard, you could find someone nearby who could teach you. Like tutoring, but not exclusive to academic learning. This idea came out of my own desire to find a new set of activities aside from the typical happy hours/gym/movies, etc. I drew up mockups and spoke eagerly with friends about the idea before a few days later a friend of a friend told me about a fairly new website called Skillshare that already \"took\" my idea. (Skillshare has since grown immensely and done fairly well.) I was initially deflated because I thought I had an original idea that would make me millions. However, as reality set in, I realized I was relieved for two reasons: 1. I failed fast, saving me much time and emotional energy and investment in a product that was already invented. 2. I now had found a solution to my original problem. I've found that the key to avoiding initial deflation is to conduct market research as soon as possible before you get too invested into the idea. This requires googling multiple variations of keywords on your idea and looking beyond the first page of results. Talk with friends and others knowledgeable in the field to see if they know of anything already in the works. Talking with as many people as possible also helps to validate that your idea actually fulfills a market need and not just your own. I luckily haven't ever gotten too far into an idea before discovering a suitable alternative, but I can imagine that the deflating feeling is even greater the more you invest into your idea. In sum, do your market research and fail fast. You'll be relieved you did.  ",

            "answer_text": "Weird. Really weird. I guess if it\u2019s same math question it would be a downer, but what I had in mind was anime. Yes, I invented Japanese cartoons in my head and I\u2019m not even remotely Japanese. You see, during the early nineties the internet had yet to become popular and thus there really was only tv, and you live in a small European country, you will only get western animation, which was geared heavily towards elementary school children. At 14-years of age I felt that the cartoons aimed at teenagers where severely limited. It was mostly MTV stuff like Beavis & Butthead, Ren & Stimpy, the Head and the Maxx. Each and every one of them felt deliberately ugly and even more, it was very much geared towards this dark, ugly & edgy style. If there are women/girls in it, they are trampy or cute but extremely self-centered or on her girlfriends. And I wanted to see something wholly different. One day in 1996 I was cycling with my friend and he said: \u201cAll premises for movies and tv-shows has been thought about already. There\u2019s nothing original left to make.\u201d \u201cNo, I can think of something.\u201d I told him \u201cLike what?\u201d he asked \u201cI don\u2019t want to tell. I think it\u2019s truly original though.\u201d I said So here\u2019s what I thought: The main character would beA teenage boyLet\u2019s give him a fighting hobby of some sort, like kung fu or karate or something, or all of them for that matter.He lives with another family somehow with a girl or two or three of similar age.All three of them cute of course. One would be domestic, the second one would be a trickster and the third one a bit of a hothead.There\u2019s no way that what I have in mind will be accepted by actors/actrices who just won\u2019t get what it\u2019s all about. They\u2019ll very likely think that when I want a lot of light/bright/pastel/rainbow colours in my show and have my main character be a somewhat of a pretty boy, that this is going to be all about homosexuality by the whole population, including gays. Or the actors/actrices/crew members will try to twist and turn the show into something more familiar to them. That\u2019s not what I want to, so it will have to be a cartoon. A cartoon aimed at teenagers and adults.Better artwork and very colorful artwork. Light pastel colours.Especially humans should be depicted as beautiful looking. I\u2019d give them big eyes.Also, it would be more nature themed, with accompanied music, like David the Gnome. Classical music needs to be used to set the tone and feel of the cartoon. Show the characters just enjoying themselves, like a slice of life, instead of this roadrunner style of animation and music.Make it look more cinematic, realistic, but also keep the cuteness.The main character would beA teenage boyWho is not some jock, but also not feminine. For some reason Americans/Europeans thinks that light colours equals homosexuality by the entire population including American/European homosexuals. I don\u2019t get that.So let\u2019s give him a fighting hobby of some sort, like kung fu or karate or something, or all of them for that matter.He lives with another family somehow with a girl or two or three of similar age.All three of them cute of course. One would be domestic, the second one would be a trickster and the third one a bit of a hothead.The premise: One day the main character boy is able to turn himself into a girl. Instead the usual \u201cI go to the mirror to feel up my boobs\u201d, the boy goes to an ice-cream parlor and asks for as much free ice-cream as he likes by flirting with the store owner and takes as much abuse as he can as a girl.I hadn\u2019t put much more thought to it, but I really thought I had hit a gold mine. A truly super original premise. It had never been done before. In essence, this new cartoon genre will be more cute, more sophisticated, more humorous, more beautiful. Certainly not in 1996. I\u2019ve invented a completely different genre for cartoons, with a completely different art-style in mind. Plus the look and feel of the cartoons would be completely different too. I should consider my So to answer the question what it was like to hear the word manga for the first time in your life and then rush home to the late nineties internet, search for anime and then the sceond anime you come across is Ranma 1/2? Here was my reaction: \u201cWOOOOOW! WOWWOWWOWWOW! WOOOOW! THIS IS AWESOME! IT\u2019S LIKE A WHOLE COUNTRY WAS ABLE TO LOOK INTO MY MIND, TAKE IT OUT, STUDY IT, AND THEN DECIDED TURN ALL THOSE THOUGHTS INTO CARTOONS! THIS IS SO COOL!\u201d \u201cThis is exactly what I had in mind. The artwork, the style, the humor, the sound effects, the music. Everything. Especially what the girls characters are like. That was the most important part.\u201d It was amazing! I couldn\u2019t believe it! Is this real? I always felt like I was missing in life and it had to do with cartoons. This is it it! In every single way. \u201cWell, I guess I no longer have to worry about whether I want to become a programmer or a cartoonist. A whole country is already doing it for me. Domo arigatou Nihon!\u201d I can just watch all the shows I\u2019ve had in mind by a whole country that has dedicated itself to this and has the same viewpoints as I do! Wow! I had three more premises in mind. Magic Knight Rayearth was the second. The third and the fourth I\u2019ve only seen in erotic mangas. The fourth being that some guy ends up in a world where the attitude of women and men towards sex are opposite. Teen girls read dirty magazines and teen boys are calling those girls perverts. The erotic manga played it exactly how I had it in mind, with lots and lots of humor. The third one however I\u2019ve only half-seen in an erotic manga. It was a drama and didn\u2019t do exactly what I still have in mind. I think it should be more of an action-romance thing. \u2026 I think I will tell the premise. A lonely teenage boy dies in an accident and is reborn as a girl in the same world in the same time period as he was born into. Thus he/she relives his past as a different gender. He actually know who this person is. It\u2019s one of his classmates during high school and so she eventually ends up in the same classroom as him. Thus the story will raises several questions: Maybe she always was him? But if so, why did she not save hime? Is he still her former self? Did they switch? Will she fall in love with her former self? And if she does, will it be a good relationship? And how does he now compare to other boys in the class? How does she see the girls in his class now that she is a she? ",
