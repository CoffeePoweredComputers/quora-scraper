            "answer_text": "As with modern high speed Internet services, it took a long time for electric utility power in in 1880\u2019s to move from big cities to rural parts of the United States. Many deeply rural areas of the United States did not finally get utility power until the 1940\u2019s. For early power generation companies, it was far more profitable to supply power to high density residential homes in cities. The rural customer was considered to be unprofitable to service due to the many hundreds of miles / kilometers of electric poles and wire that had to be installed to service these customers. Rural people away from the city grids could use electricity, but it was more expensive to use, because they would instead have a private power generation system on their property. They could have light bulbs and appliances but they had to run an small combustion engine to power those devices. This small on-site power generation system was generally known as a light plant. It was often very low power, perhaps only 100\u2013200 watts of output, producing direct current at a low 12 to 48 volts.  (Image is in the public domain in the United States. From the Hawkins Electrical Guide - Volume 3, Chapter 45, Page 989, Figure 1198, Nehemiah Hawkins, copyright 1917, printed in the USA.) A fully automatic light plant would usually also include a group of rechargeable lead-acid batteries using lead plates in glass containers (on the wall shelf in this illustration), which would supply a continuous voltage to lighting circuits when all the lights and the generator were turned off. When the first light circuit was turned on, it would complete a current path for the batteries and the lamp would light up. As the batteries ran down, the generator would be automatically started to recharge the batteries and keep the lights illuminated. Some automatic light plants would start the generator immediately when the first lamp was turned on. , In the end, corporate America was unwilling to spend the money to provide power to rural farmers and homes. Rural electricification did not really begin to happen until a government organization was formed in 1933 known as the Tennessee Valley Authority, which used taxation to fund and organize the formation of publicly-owned non-profit rural electric cooperatives in the eastern United States. Tennessee Valley Authority - Wikipedia This work spread further, through the Rural Electricification Service of 1935, which worked to promote rural electrification, and the Rural Electrification Act of 1936, which provided federal loans to rural electric cooperatives formed across the rest of the United States. Rural Utilities Service - Wikipedia Rural Electrification Act - Wikipedia These rural electric cooperatives continue to exist today, and are still non-profits with the cooperative members primarily paying for upkeep and maintenance of the rural electric services, and buying generation from outside suppliers to the local grid. , Also, ironically, as of 2018, due to the continued lack of interest of commercial telephone and data service providers to properly wire rural areas for high speed Internet, it is likely that the formation of non-profit cooperative electric utilities of the 1930\u2019s may need to be repeated again for all rural residents of the United States to finally get the high speed 100\u20131000 megabit data services that have become essential to (sub-)urban living.

            "answer_text": "The previous answers to this question are all over the place in answering this question. How long has electricity been used in homes? When was it first available? The theories on electricity were published in the 1600s, but the reality of bringing electricity to our homes started in the late 1800s. The defining moment of bringing electricity to our homes in the United States was known as the War of Currents which took place in the 1890s. A brief history of electricity Benjamin Franklin is often credited in various books and websites as having discovered electricity in the 1750s. The story of Franklin flying a kite to discover electricity makes for a cool story, but the truth is that William Gilbert and Robert William Boyle began documenting the concept of electricity long before Franklin's experiments. William Gilbert was the first scientists to document the concept of electricity in his book \u201cDe Magnete\u201d published in 1600. Robert William Boyle also began documenting the concept of electricity long before Franklin's experiment. In 1675, Boyle published \"Experiments and Notes about the Mechanical Origine or Production of Electricity.\" Bringing electricity to our homes started in the late 1800s American inventor Thomas Edison was influenced by the work of many inventors in Europe moving forward in the 1870s such as Pavel Yablochkov, a Russian electrical engineer who introduced his lighting system to the world during the Paris Exposition of 1878. Edison perfected the lightbulb, he made it practical. Not only did Edison make a practical lightbulb, he realized what good is a lightbulb if people did not have electricity in their homes to use them. Another American inventor, George Westinghouse began studying various European inventors for ideas and inspiration for AC power designs. A power transformer developed by Lucien Gaulard and John Dixon Gibbs was demonstrated in London in 1881. Westinghouse purchased the American rights to Gaulard and Gibbs patents for AC current transformers. The battle between Edison and Westinghouse, known as the War of Currents, started not long after Westinghouse created the Westinghouse Electric Company in 1886. Edison thought DC (direct current) should be the way to deliver electricity to our homes. Westinghouse Electric perfected AC (alternating current), it was more efficient, and that became the standard. Edison lost the business and technology battle known as the War of Currents to Westinghouse Electric, but Edison's push to bring electricity to our homes was the catalyst for the modern electrical utility industry. Learn More: The above history of electricity information was gleaned from the following pages of my GeekHistory website: Who discovered electricity? Who contributed to the development of electricity and AC power George Westinghouse wasn't the inventor of AC power, but he had the vision to bring it all together. George Westinghouse proved to the world the concept of AC power distribution by winning the bid to provide lighting for the World's Fair Columbian Exposition of 1893. Any history of electricity in our homes needs to cover the work of George Westinghouse. George Westinghouse a unique mix of inventor and industrialist George Westinghouse used Tesla power to defeat Edison in Currents War ",

            "answer_text": "A Brief History of the Light Bulb \"The first electric light was made in 1800 by HumphryDavy, an English scientist. He experimented with electricity and inventedan electric battery. When he connected wires to his battery and a piece ofcarbon, the carbon glowed, producing light. This is called an electric arc. The electric light, oneof the everyday conveniences that most affects our lives, was not \u201cinvented\u201d inthe traditional sense in 1879 by ThomasAlva Edison, although he could be said to have created the firstcommercially practical incandescent light. He was neither the first nor theonly person trying to invent an incandescent light bulb. In fact, somehistorians claim there were over 20 inventors of incandescent lamps prior toEdison\u2019s version. However, Edison is often credited with the invention becausehis version was able to outstrip the earlier versions because of a combinationof three factors: an effective incandescent material, a higher vacuum thanothers were able to achieve and a high resistance that made power distributionfrom a centralized source economically viable. Early Light Bulbs In 1802, Humphry Davy invented the firstelectric light. He experimented with electricity and invented an electricbattery. When he connected wires to his battery and a piece of carbon, thecarbon glowed, producing light. His invention was known as the Electric Arclamp. And while it produced light, it didn\u2019t produce it for long and was muchtoo bright for practical use. \"Over the nextseven decades, other inventors also created \u201clight bulbs\u201d but no designsemerged for commercial application. More notably, in 1840, British scientist Warren de la Rue enclosed a coiled platinum filament in a vacuum tube andpassed an electric current through it. The design was based on the concept thatthe high melting point of platinum would allow it to operate at high temperaturesand that the evacuated chamber would contain fewer gas molecules to react withthe platinum, improving its longevity. Although an efficient design, the costof the platinum made it impractical for commercial production. \"In 1850 an Englishphysicist named Joseph Wilson Swancreated a \u201clight bulb\u201d by enclosing carbonized paper filaments in an evacuatedglass bulb. And by 1860 he had a working prototype, but the lack of a goodvacuum and an adequate supply of electricity resulted in a bulb whose lifetimewas much too short to be considered an effective prodcer of light. However, inthe 1870\u2019s better vacuum pumps became available and Swan continued experimentson light bulbs. In 1878, Swan developed a longer lasting light bulb using atreated cotton thread that also removed the problem of early bulb blackening. \"On July 24, 1874 a Canadian patent was filed by a Toronto medical electrician named HenryWoodward and a colleague MathewEvans. They built their lamps with different sizes and shapes of carbon rods held between electrodes in glass cylinders filled with nitrogen. Woodward and Evans attemptedto commercialize their lamp, but were unsuccessful. They eventually sold theirpatent to Edison in 1879. \"In 1878, Thomas Edison began serious researchinto developing a practical incandescent lamp and on October 14, 1878, Edisonfiled his first patent application for \"Improvement In ElectricLights\". However, he continued to test several types of material for metalfilaments to improve upon his original design and by Nov 4, 1879, he filedanother U.S. patent for an electric lamp using \"a carbon filament or stripcoiled and connected ... to platinum contact wires.\" Although the patentdescribed several ways of creating the carbon filament including using\"cotton and linen thread, wood splints, papers coiled in variousways,\" it was not until several months after the patent was granted thatEdison and his team discovered that a carbonized bamboo filament could lastover 1200 hours. This discovery marked the beginning of commerciallymanufactured light bulbs and in 1880, Thomas Edison\u2019s company, Edison ElectricLight Company began marketing its new product. \"Other Notable Dates 1906 - TheGeneral Electric Company were the first to patent a method of making tungstenfilaments for use in incandescent lightbulbs. Edison himself had known tungstenwould eventually prove to be the best choice for filaments in incandescentlight bulbs, but in his day, the machinery needed to produce the wire in such afine form was not available. 1910 -William David Coolidge of General Electric improved the process of manufactureto make the longest lasting tungsten filaments. 1920s - Thefirst frosted lightbulb is produced and adjustable power beam bulbs for carheadlamps, and neon lighting. 1930s - Thethirties saw the invention of little one-time flashbulbs for photography, andthe fluorescent tanning lamp. 1940s - Thefirst \u2019soft light\u2019 incandescent bulbs. 1950s -Quartz glass and halogen light bulb are produced 1980s \u2013 Newlow wattage metal halides are created 1990s \u2013 Longlife bulbs and Compact Fluorescent bulbs make their debut.\" The Future of the \u201cFirst\u201d Light Bulb? Modern incandescentbulbs are not energy efficient \u2013 less than 10% of electrical power supplied tothe bulb is converted into visible light. The remaining energy is lost as heat.However these inefficient light bulbs are still widely used today due to manyadvantages: . wide, low-costavailability . easyincorporation into electrical systems . adaptablefor small systems . low voltageoperation, such as in battery powered devices . wide shapeand size availability However, legislation inmany countries including the US have mandated phasing out the incandescent bulbfor more energy efficient options such as compact fluorescent lamps and LEDlamps, However, there has been much resistance to these policies owing to thelow cost of incandescent bulbs, the instant availability of light and concernsof mercury contamination with CFLs. http://www.bulbs.com/learning/history ",

            "answer_text": "I had a house in Winnipeg, MB, Canada that was built in about 1908 or so.  After it was built, electricity came to the area and the house was retrofitted with electrical lights and plugs.  There was a central ceiling light and one plug in each room.  This was a high level and expensive retrofit.  The wiring was knob and tube wiring where bare wires were run through the building and the hot and neutral wires were kept apart by a series of ceramic knobs as insulators.  Whenever a wire went through a board it was slid through a ceramic tube to keep the wood from burning.  In the late 1960's someone recognized that the old wiring was getting dangerous and upgrade the entire house to, then, modern wiring.  Unfortunately, at that time, modern wiring was made of aluminum which is considered dangerous enough to be banned in most residential applications since the late 1970's.   I purchased the house in 1990 and any renovations that I did had to be done with copper wiring and any connections to existing wiring had to have isolating fixtures because copper, aluminum and electricity are not a good mix.   After I sold it, the house was taken down in a build out and is no longer a fire trap. ",
