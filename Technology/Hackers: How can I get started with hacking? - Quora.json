            "answer_text": "When I was a young teen, home computers had just started to appear. Modems were specialist kit, dial up at a mere 300baud! Hacking then was simply a case of finding out a modem number (social engineering) and dialing in. Often this was it, you were in. Sometimes you had to guess a password; almost always the usual worked: admin, password, God, letmein, etc. Few knew cyber security, most IT workers were mathematics grads, or bright employees, sent on courses to learn a role like COBOL or IMS or cabling etc. Few companies had networks, just mainframes or minis with terminal access. Non IT employees could be coaxed into giving out info like modem number and password with a spoof phone call...they did not understand the implications. Why I am telling you all this? Well, because most of the great hackers you have heard of came up from these times. They got great because they rode the wave of cyber from the inception. Today it is so much more complex and you have to know so much detail that it is incredibly difficult to get beyond ddos (not hacking at all!) or screwing with website html of poorly set up sites (using the tried and tested ways of old - Unix fundermentals). Today it would be like taking a masters programme in 2D-signal fourier transorms without having had more exposure to maths than adding and multiplying\u2026or perhaps advanced avionic engine design with just the know how of changing a tyre. What I\u2019m trying to say is it is a difficult world to get in to in any depth unless you just want to be a script kiddie and/or happy to settle for just what is available in your Kali destro. If you are serious, then take a course in cyber security - they can be found online (take a good one that costs money, otherwise you will be learning obsolete trash of which there is much). Put Kali on an old laptop and several VMs with different OSs to try and attack. There are also specific sites that are designed for pen testing - you will not be arrested for playing with these. Install TOR browser and do some research down there in the shadows - don\u2019t expect to become a master from reading a few blogs and homemade text files found on forums though, most that is public is decades out of date, and forum elites generally sneer at noob questions. They expect you to learn like they did rather than be handed to you, plus answering everyone who asks just gives cyber security bods info on what holes to plug\u2026hence you have a whole lot of proving to do before they will start to share anything useful with you. Be warned that most countries have extreme, even overboard, legislation that could put you away for longer than a murdering rapist might get! USA especially. ",

            "answer_text": "Hacker has many definitions, i think most people asking this question. I\u2019m not going to teach you about condone cracking, stealing, breaking, or otherwise illegal cyber activity. However, a hacker may also be defined as someone with an advanced understanding of computers and programming. If you want to learn more about this side of hacker, see the suggestions below. Computer basics - Having a good understanding of a computer, its components, and how it works is essential for anyone, not just hackers. Books - Make it a goal to read computer books that cover your interests. Visiting popular online bookstores, such as Amazon, and browse through the top 100 books on your subject is a great place to start. Audible has an enormous selection of e-books, if you prefer that method of reading. Know the jargon - The computer industry has thousands of acronyms and terms, visit the Computer Hope dictionary to find the ones you are most likely to run across. Online news - Visit the Computer News pages at least a few times weekly to keep up with all the latest computer news. Visit our computer news links for a list of great news sites. Participate in forums - The Internet is full of online forums, where thousands of other users participate with each other in answering questions or talking about what they love to do. Participating in these forums will not only allow you to test your understanding of the subject, but also learn from others. A great example of an online forum would be the Computer help forums. Build a computer - If you want to learn more about the hardware aspect of a computer, there is nothing more educational than putting one together. Not only will this help broaden your knowledge of computer hardware, but can help with diagnosing hardware problems, and teach you more about how computers work. There are plenty of websites with instructions on how to build your own machine. Pick up a programming language Learning how software works by studying a programming language is an invaluable tool. It teaches you how to create your own programs, and how to debug them. It also gives you a better understanding of how programs work. Our programming language definition lists many of the more popular programming languages. Also, learning scripting languages such as Perl and PHP and even the basics ofHTML web design, are advantageous for anyone interested in setting up and tweaking websites. If you need more experience with programming, creating your own open source project or helping with another open project can be a helpful learning experience. Creating your own website can also be another great learning experience as it shows the details behind website design and setup. Learn alternative operating system Many people today run some version of Microsoft Windows, which is fine for home and office use, but it is also a good idea to learn alternative operating systems such as Linux. Learning a Linux distro not only helps broaden your experience, but is a necessity when wanting to navigate Linux based servers running websites and other web services. If you have access to a server that is hosting your website, you may have access toSSH, which allows you to connect to a server and is another good way to learn the Linux command line. If you are new to Linux, Ubuntu is a good distro for new users to try. This Distro of Linux can also be run by booting it off of a CD. However, if you want a full experience, it is better to install Ubuntu or another distro on the computer. Also, having a good understanding of the Linux command line commands is also a must. See our Linux page for a full listing of commands and the syntax for those commands. Learn more on networking Networks run the Internet and connect home or office computers together. It is important to know as much as you can on how networks operate, including basics like anIP address, OSI, port, protocol, router, and subnet mask. Also, setting up your own home network, especially a network with multiple computers and different operating systems, can be a very helpful. ",
