            "answer_text": "One huge area of Big Data leverage is in the fight to cure cancer. Back when President Obama was in office, he enacted a Cancer Moonshot program which aimed to accomplish 10 years worth of progress towards curing cancer in 5 years. This program established a panel which would give official recommendations. As part of this panel\u2019s recommendations, they stated that cancer-fighting institutions throughout the United States should attempt to share their research and clinical databases with each other. The motivation? When using large swathes of data, it\u2019s possible to spot trends that could hold clues to solving cancer. For example, researchers can look at tumors held in biobanks that have different treatment records associated with them to see what treatments lead to the best patient outcomes.

From a research perspective, this is a great place to begin surveying the field.  At CliniCast, we have been using Big Data for a while specifically within oncology: Measurement of Quality of Care from perspective of Clinical Outcome, Cost of Care, Adherence to Guideline, Quality of Life, and Patient SatisfactionRisk Stratification of hospitalization, complications due to chemotherapy, mortalityBenchmarking patients in terms of care and costPersonalization of care pathways, particularly when deciding between surgery, chemotherapy and radiation.",
