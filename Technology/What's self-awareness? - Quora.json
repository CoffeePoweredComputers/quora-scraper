            "answer_text": "Self-awareness is exactly what it says it is. It is awareness of something you consider to be a self. What is a self? That\u2019s a bit more complicated. Generally, people think that a human being is a self, and that the self contained in that human being\u2019s body is whatever they consider to be part of themselves. The problem comes when you consider something to be a part of yourself that you are not aware of, or you are aware of something within your consciousness, but you don\u2019t consider it to be a part of yourself. For example, there are thoughts that individuals have that they are not aware of. These thoughts often motivate actions or even take control of the body for a while. Are those actions part of the self, even though the self is not aware of the thought processes that motivate or manage those actions? Behaviors such as addictions are a good example of automatic behaviors that many people consciously don\u2019t want to engage in, yet they do despite their will. Then there is the awareness of other entities within the self. Often these other entities are perceived as intruders within consciousness. Are they a part of the self because they are only perceived by the individual, or do they represent an awareness of outside entities that have somehow, psychically become evident to the individual\u2019s consciousness? So a self can contain parts that the person is not aware of and can also exclude consciousness that appears to belong to a different self that only that person is aware of. My definition of self includes all that I am conscious of and also parts of me that I am not aware of but can infer by observing my behavior. So all my behavior that I do not consciously want to do, but my body does, I consider to be part of my self, even though I am not aware of the thought processes that motivate and manage those behaviors. Self-awareness is then awareness of the parts of myself that I can consciously observe. There is more to myself that I cannot be aware of. I do my best to try to infer the motivations and to understand my own behavior by observing my actions, but much of what I consider to be myself is mysterious to me and can\u2019t be directly observed. I also have experiences where I feel like I am channeling some other entity, but I believe these experiences come from the other parts of myself that I am generally not aware of. It feels like something else is controlling me, but I believe that the something else is actually parts of my brain I cannot observe. Self-awareness includes both direct observation of my thinking processes as well as indirect observation of my thinking processes that I cannot directly observe. I observe my own behavior to get information about my thinking processes that I cannot directly be aware of. I consider all the actions and behaviors of my body to be a part of myself. I think of my life as an attempt to integrate the different thinking processes that occur within my body, even though I can\u2019t directly observe all those thinking processes. My self-awareness includes both direct observation of my thinking as well as observation of my behavior in order to infer the thinking processes contained within my body that I can\u2019t directly observe.

            "answer_text": "There are three major ZONES of awareness that we, as SELVES, can have: Exteriorceptive AwarenessSight - the awareness of a visual field outside of our bodies and all that we can recognize as familiar or unfamiliar gestalten. Sight uses a projection area in the posterior brain wherein interpretations of images are made.Hearing - the awareness of words, vibrations, music, noise and random sounds that come though our ears in recognizable or unrecognizable ways. Hearing has a projection apparatus as does sight.Smell - the most primitive awareness that goes straight to the rhinencephalon without and projection area in between. It is the most accurate of the senses in that a single smell of isopropyl alcohol can make us feel like we are sitting in the kitchen while mommy puts this burning liquid on a boo-boo we have from falling off our rollar skates. Smell gives us the true \"taste\" of food because, taste is quite limited.Taste - taste only has 5 of all gustatory sensations.SaltySweetBitterSourUmami (a flavor found in meats)Touch - not only does everything we touch with our fingers give us tactile awareness but skin is the largest organ of our body. Everything that impacts or grazes or rests against the skin must be \"sensed\" to be aware of adjusting position of our clothing for maximum comfort.Interiorceptive Awareness:All thinkingAll paranoid thoughtsAll beliefs, in including Religion all the way to Atheism, are parts of mental awarenessSubconscious drivers about which we have little to no awareness have to be brought into awareness through psychotherapy or hypnotherapy.FantasiesImagined things about others or about a sensory input (like a creak in the floor boards is a ghost). Imagining is the most frequent thing our brain does and the problem is that we accept it for truth. Right now, I'm imagining that you wanted all this detail but that could be my tendency to give as much information as possible.Proprioceptive AwarenessAll feelings exist in the body and are imagined as being in your head. In American Sign Language, most feelings are made across the chest. The chest and stomach are the most common place for feelings to be. Even deep crying uses belly and diaphragmic muscles to let the sadness up more powerfully. The primary feelings are:Love (Chest, face, lungs\u2026 emptiness in chest when being blocked)Sadness (felt in eyes and stomach (women can feel sadness from their uterus\u2026and in pains in the stomach, throat and behind the eyes when being blocked).Anger (fists, tension in the trapezius, scapulus, pectoantibrachialis muscles\u2026. chest pain and pain in the temples, scintillating scotoma, and Migraines when being blocked).Fear (shoulders, throat, lungs, legs\u2026 pains in stomach, throat when blocked)Guilt (integumentary, tension in the head, eyes, wringing of hands, decreased depth of breathing and raised shoulders\u2026 projective rage and shame to others, with comfort in previous body areas when blocked).All sub-dermal, physical pain is found in proprioceptive awareness. I am an amputee. I suffer from phantom pain all of the time, even as I type this on my cell phone. I would have to have an electronic nerve blocker installed in the dorsal root ganglia of my spine in order to put an end to this pain. I can't afford the surgery AND I refuse to take strong pain meds because they cloud the mind that I use as a Certified Life Coach and in answering these questions. Internal pains allow us to be warned of illness or injury, just as skin (the sense of touch), lets us know that we've been burnt.All pleasure is a part of proprioceptive awareness. I needn't point out the areas for comforting others or providing sexual stimulation right to the level of the orgasm reflex arc.Now this relates to SELF AWARENESS only and not to the larger awareness of the self in the contextual surroundings or how we perceive (theoretically imagine others) or correctly perceive physiognomic Isomorphism (look this up). INTUITION in its truest is a congruent internal awareness in all three zones about a person or action in the environment. People say, \"Think about it!\" But this really means, \"Fantasize and imagine what is happening.\" People say, \"Trust your senses!!\" But this means, \"Even if something is an optical illusion you should head toward that 'oasis'.\" Lastly and famously, people say, \"Trust your feelings!!!\" But this means, \"No matter how paranoid or delusional or untrusting or suspicious or jealous or hurt you feel that your feelings are 100% trustworthy.\" In fact, trusting our feelings during a fight is something we seldom can do. INTUITION is the King / Queen of Self Awareness. ",

            "answer_text": " Self-a\u00b7ware\u00b7ness (noun): conscious knowledge of one\u2019s own character, feelings, motives, and desires. This is a phrase that is rarely talked about in our culture and it is tremendously important! \u201cWay too many people are going to spend 30\u201340 years of their life trying to check the boxes of the things that they\u2019re not good at and waste a fuck load of time and lose.\u201d ~ Gary Vaynerchuck. When someone asks who are you? can you honestly answer that question? Deep in your core, deep in your soul and deep in your heart do you know who you are and why you do what you do everyday? Most people don\u2019t know who the fuck they are and in the chaos of their lives they stop caring about figuring it out. The above quote by Gary Vaynerchuck exemplifies the first reason you should. Most people end up chasing positions, accomplishments and dreams in fields they are innately weak at. Some people truly believe the path they\u2019re on is the best one for them, and a large percentage have mistakenly deluded their perception of themselves and the reality around them. Everybody has a certain skill set and expertise, yet we all think we\u2019re Dorothy from the Wizard of Oz and end up going down a path that looks pretty and fascinating, but really isn\u2019t right for us. This has become the biggest lie we ever tell is to ourselves. After 5 years of hustling and grinding through basketball I became relatively successful within that field. Eventually, I moved away from the sport and stopped playing. I did some self reflection and decided fashion and design was the path I was gravitating towards. Some months later I figured out that I was fucking delusional. I was chasing a dream and passion that wasn\u2019t even mine. I love clothing and have a deep appreciation for design and architecture, but after truly seeing where my heart lay I saw it was a field that I had no experience or skill in, and:Didn\u2019t want that badly, thus making it a weakness.I realised this through a conversation with a very close person in my life\u200a\u2014\u200amy mother. She reminded me of who I was and what I was great at. With that, I went all in on my strengths. That is how you are reading this, because one of those strengths happens to be is right here on this page\u200a\u2014\u200aattempting to empower people to positive change through creative written content. I honestly believe with all my heart and soul I can change your life right here on this page, right now. But how did I figure that out and how can you do it? Find the 5 people who you trust and know very well and get them to tell you the truth. Confide in them your feelings, problems and aspirations, then shut up, and listen. If that doesn\u2019t work, or your still unsure. Go all in and do those personality tests and buy that book. STUDY WHO YOU ARE. Before I conclude this piece I want to address a common misconception in our society. A lot of people think travel is a necessary prerequisite to figure out who you are. I think that\u2019s total bull shit. All you need to do is find a mirror and look in it. On this road to self discovery I found my mirror, and then I found a computer. You can do the same. \u201cGo all in on your strengths and don't give a fuck about what you suck at. Self awareness isn\u2019t just betting on your strengths, it\u2019s accepting all your shortcomings. When you actually accept your shortcomings deep in your brain and heart that is the second your life goes on the offence\u201d ~ Gary Vaynerchuck ",

            "answer_text": "Self awareness comes in three distinct levels. None at all, some, perpetual. I count myself as one of the perpetually self aware people. After all, who doesn\u2019t? Definition time required here otherwise we\u2019re all pissing in the wind \u2026..were you even aware of that? Am I aware that I\u2019m patronising you right now? Nope, so I see the problem as yours, your projection onto me. God, I\u2019m so highly self aware of you right now. Back to me. So here\u2019s an actual real definition from an actual website\u2026Self awareness\u2026 \u2018an awareness of one's own personality or individuality\u2019 Merrium Webster dictionary. Did you understand that or do I need to explain it to you? I\u2019m so self aware that you might not be as intelligent as me :-) It\u2019s ok, it\u2019s normal. I\u2019m so in the zone right now! Here\u2019s Daniel Goleman, he was the godfather of self awareness (I take it to a whole new level though\u2026false modesty serves nobody, especially you so hang in there.) \u2018Psychologist Daniel Goleman, has proposed a more popular definition of self-awareness in his best-selling book \u201cEmotional Intelligence\u201d, as \u201cknowing one\u2019s internal states, preference, resources and intuitions\u201d. This definition places more emphasis on the ability to monitor our inner world, our thoughts and emotions as they arise .\u2019This is an extract from\u2026What is Self-Awareness and Why Does it Matter? [Meaning + 5 Tips]\u2026.. Ok so if you were able to notice yourself there you probably observed in yourself that you do this. You are able to watch your mind reading this answer and at the same time having a mental judgement of me\u2026.the superior self aware guy. I don\u2019t blame you for having this level of self awareness. You\u2019re a beginner so you\u2019re bound to be aware right now of your inferiority to me. Where do you feel it in your body? You need to ground yourself. Bring your awareness into your body. Where is the honest inferiority manifesting in you right now? In your heart? In your shoulders? In your little testicles (well relative to my massive ones obviously) ? Embrace the feeling of inadequacy where-ever it is. It\u2019s to be expected and it is just what it is. This is self awareness. This is reality! If your feeling of inferiority and anger causes you to project faults onto me (that are not there btw because I\u2019m Enlightened and therefore immune) then just notice this anger and annoyance too. You\u2019re welcome. I\u2019m here to hold the mirror and serve. Service to others is my only purpose in life. You probably won\u2019t reach this level of service and self awareness but I wouldn\u2019t expect you to tbh. You don\u2019t understand non-duality and no-self so you can\u2019t even begin to relate to my humility. In fact it\u2019s not even humility. It\u2019s the absence of even humility. It\u2019s just pure self awareness without the self bit. I know\u2026profound aren\u2019t I. It\u2019s not even me. It just comes through me. I don\u2019t like to use the word \u2018channeling\u2019 but yeah it\u2019s channeling for sure. You might call it Atman or Brahma or Godhead or \u2018I am-ness\u2019 or \u2018no-self\u2019 or \u2018consciousnes\u2019 or \u2018awareness\u2019 whereas I just keep it simple and call it\u2018\u2019no-self awareness\u2019 I know great isn\u2019t it. I channeled it. You\u2019re welcome. It\u2019s a non dual gift from me to you ;-) ",

            "answer_text": "The first building block of emotional intelligence is self-awareness. Self-awareness is our ability to recognize our own emotions and their effects on us and others. Without being aware of and understanding our own emotions, it will be difficult for us to move into the other emotional competencies like self-management, social awareness, or team leadership. Self-improvement is also referred to as personal-development can be said as the improvement to one\u2019s own mind and character through one\u2019s own efforts. It is a conscious process where one decides to take oneself in hand and change their life for the better(introduction to self-improvement). Self-awareness is being aware of oneself that includes one\u2019s traits, feelings, behavior. It is quite difficult in today\u2019s time to find time to think about who we are, what are our strengths and weaknesses, personalities, our habits, and values. Besides, many of us are not just inclined to spend much time on self-reflection. Consequently, many of us have a low level of self-awareness because self-awareness is an essential first step toward maximizing management skills. It can improve our judgment and help us identify opportunities for professional development and personal growth. For example, I consider myself to be a combination of the hidden self and open self-personality. I consider myself to be in (need a better word here or another approach to the sentence \u201cMy hidden self responds to situations based on\u2026) hidden self because with me it depends on what mood I am in. It is all the things about me and of others that I keep to myself (this is a definition. You should lead your ideas with the definition and cite where the definition was found). When interacting I keep things to myself that I do not want to be revealed. When I do not care for a person they will never know because I stay neutral with them and still associate and speak to them. I may express how I feel about that person to someone else but not to that individual. I try to avoid confrontations. The hidden self in myself is also when I keep certain things about myself and other people private. For example, my friend disclosed a secret about her boyfriend that I pretend I never heard about when I come in contact with him. ",

            "answer_text": "To simply put, self awareness is becoming aware of yourself. Duh! That sounds pretty straightforward, right? But in practice, it isn\u2019t anywhere near that. You would probably think, \u201ci am aware of myself!\u201d. Let me ask you this. When was the last time you felt your scalp without any stimulus to it? When was the last time you felt the sole of your feet against the ground as you walk on them? Can you identify what part of your body you feel an emotional stimuli? If you can\u2019t answer any of these in the affirmative, you don\u2019t have self-awareness. My explanation is coming from what the self really is. What Erkhat Tolle called the \u201cinner body\u201d in his enlightening book (The Power of Now). You already know what awareness is, the \u2018self\u2019 is that energy that animates the shell (body). To put it mathematically, Self (or you) = The alive you - the dead you. In essence, to be self aware is to bring your awareness to the field of energy within you. Passively paying attention to thoughts. Paying attention to your breaths. Knowing what caused you to get angry. Analyzing what part of you the anger started from. How you know it is time to get angry, cry, laugh, smirk, etc. All these are what a self aware person does. So, if you want to describe self-awareness, you can simply say that it is \u2018watching the thinker\u2019. Emotions are the physical manifestations of our thoughts. It is those emotions that lead to actions. So, if you you are aware of what is being thought in your mind, you can stop it from turning into emotion and hence, action. This is why a self-aware person is often a calm person. ",

Due to consciousness, they are aware of their environment and themselves by five senses (and imagination as the sixth sense- not the western sixth sense). They are self-aware by means of feeling - e.g. hunger, itch, pain, fear, hearing, sight, etc. If you\u2019re after self-recognition, a concept is based on mirror that if an animal can recognize itself in the mirror, it is self-recognition Some scientists view a successful mirror test as a sign that animals have self-awareness, linked to complex concepts like empathy. And if an animal can't pass the test, well, then it simply can't be self-aware. ... The scientists modified a testgiven to human infants.Apr 12, 2017 New elephant intelligence tests reveal body awareness, self-understanding | Toronto Star Once the animal understands how mirror functions, it can understand the reflection is its own; however, the concept might have missed this point - i.e. the knowledge of the animals about mirror. Many species, including fish, birds, lizards, cannot understand how mirror function. Usually, some small birds are given a mirror to make them think they are not alone. The real problem for them is they all look alike so when they see themselves in a mirror, they would think the reflections are not themselves. Here we have to understand how each species recognize their own members. Consider this - you see an ant among many. You turn your head and lose track of that ant for five seconds. You turn your head and look for it. Would you find it? How about a parrot or a starling? bird flock - YouTube I think many kinds of birds and mammals can become to understand how a mirror functions.

            "answer_text": " ADHD this is not a joke. What is understood to be a psychological disorder is actually one of the reasons your ancestors were not surprised by a bear and her Cubs. This one trait of humans that is mis understood due to the compulsory education system designed to indoctrinate an individual for the collective was created from the Prussian, Modern Germany, system whose aim it was to produce a population of just literate enough but not critical thinkers so that the ANARCHY, or natural state if being, live and let live. Which always results in an opposition to authority, would be put into submission incrementally thus with each passing generation the population would be more \u201cdomesticated\u201d easier to Govern and less likely to Revolt even under the most detrimental of circumstances to ones own self. Well ADHD, ADD, ODD were finally created to make the WILL to rebel against authority an actual psychological disorder. Then if it is a disorder there must be a therapeutic remedy such as the greatest gift Petro Chem ever gave humanity. That would be Pharmacology, and all the Wonder drugs like Adderall, Ritalin, any Stimulant which took the ALERTNESS level or SELF AWARENESS STATE OF EXISTENCE and essentially made it susceptible to being programmed. Which is why they used to say \u201c oh they eventually grow out of it with the aid of this stimulant [x] which forces a positive feedback loop of Dopamine being over produced resulting then in a fixation effect. If you are fixated then what happens around you appears to not exist and you are thus susceptible to being conditioned. So being SELF AWARE is not the same as being CONSCIOUS. 2 completely different things. SELF aware is essentially understanding your present state of being BEING conscious is basically understanding the way and why you arrive at certain conclusions and choices, then can reflect and adjust and or adapt. This is my own interpretation and I could easily read 30k words in science journals and new Neuro Science but I like to keep things understandable and basic because science although useful is often wrong due to the Agendas which exist as a result of having your Science Foundation responsible for awarding grant being basically created by the Daddy of the CIA, the CIG and recommended for funding to congress by the CIG. SO one can conclude that you do not produce a kid then walk away at its birth in theory and moral practice. This is why our system of science is regressive not progressive, if it were progressive then it would not be compartmentalized and secretive. It would be open source and the peer review process would not include those whose science you are opposing. To determine the outcome of your hard work. When choosing between a lifes work coupled with ego, then confronted with blow which bruises said butt, it is also an accurate conclusion to state that ACCURATE SCIEMCE NEVER SEES THE LIGHT OF DAY AS ACCEPTABLE UNTIL THE SCREWBALL DIES. Not to mention you have an agency who literally wants to control the minds of every US CITIZEN AND FOREIGN ADVERSARY being the gate keepers or scientific advancement meaning I create a workable antimatter drive and it may never be used as intended nor my work publicized so the people who paid for it can also enjoy its benefits. Instead it is collected under the fake silk sheets of NATIONAL SECURITY And only 75 to 125 yea later depending on some important and fragile policies it could be indefinitely top secret never to be revealed or heavily redacted If so not to protect security or the nation but the egos, lifes work or lies, and corruption of those involved and free them from the sword of lady justice. I know i ranted but one has to do with the other and ehy you may not understand the question you are even asking due to their being a problem in the definition because of secrecy and illegal appropriation of funds and DECIEVING of the public. All for profit and power. Be amazing if more people demanded transparency and accountability and just researched all the declassified documents ",

            "answer_text": "Numerous things are part of the human experience, and having inner wounds is considered one of them. It doesn't rely on how properly a person's early years have been or how correct their person-years had been, they may have bags.  Although, despite the fact that having internal wounds is part of the human revel in, it doesn't mean that that is something that is widely diagnosed. This statement won't appear accurate, given the truth that mental health is receiving lots of interest these days. A massive distinction However, on the subject of mental health, the focus is usually on what is taking location up pinnacle, within the mind. converting one's mind and behavior is then the most crucial aspect and cognitive-behavioral remedy is frequently the remedy of desire. At other times, this might now not take the region and one may want to become being put on medicine. What is going on at a deeper level is unlikely to be seemed into with CBT and it nearly virtually might not be looked into if the remedy is prescribed. A Surface Level Approach What is taking location at the floor is then going to be seemed into and the signs and symptoms might be treated. this could, at the least, cause a short-term alleviation however it won't do a lot else. It'll be very just like a gardener whose simplest cuts weeds off at the pinnacle, simplest for them to develop again a little while later. Or, in the event that they do not develop returned wherein they were earlier than, they could grow lower back somewhere else.

Am I clear on how things make me feel? Is there a degree of separation between how I feel and how I react? Can I distinguish my voice from my ego? Am I comfortable spending time alone? Then, an ability to see myself from the outside. To move past how I see me, and see how others perceive me. It\u2019s me, looking at me through the eyes of others. Who is that person you see? Am I able to detect if what you see matches who I think I am? Do I believe everything I think? Am I comfortable changing my mind? Can I see when I\u2019m wrong? Self-awareness is related to empathy, to confidence and to creativity. It\u2019s how firmly I place myself in the world. ",

            "answer_text": "To understand what Self awareness a.k.a self actualisation is you need to first understand Maslow's hierarchy of needs.  This five stage model can be divided into basic (or deficiency) needs (e.g. physiological, safety, love, and esteem) and growth needs (self-actualization). The deficiency, or basic needs are said to motivate people when they are unmet. Also, the need to fulfil such needs will become stronger the longer the duration they are denied. For example, the longer a person goes without food the more hungry they will become.One must satisfy lower level basic needs before progressing on to meet higher level growth needs. Once these needs have been reasonably satisfied, one may be able to reach the highest level called self-actualization. Every person is capable and has the desire to move up the hierarchy toward a level of self-actualization. Unfortunately, progress is often disrupted by failure to meet lower level needs. Life experiences including divorce and loss of job may cause an individual to fluctuate between levels of the hierarchy. Maslow noted only one in a hundred people become fully self-actualized because our society rewards motivation primarily based on esteem, love and other social needs. The five-stage model includes1. Biological and Physiological needs - air, food, drink, shelter, warmth, sex, sleep.2. Safety needs - protection from elements, security, order, law, stability, freedom from fear.3. Love and belongingness needs - friendship, intimacy, affection and love, - from work group, family, friends, romantic relationships.4. Esteem needs - achievement, mastery, independence, status, dominance, prestige, self-respect, respect from others.5. Self-Actualization needs - realizing personal potential, self-fulfillment, seeking personal growth and peak experiences. 'It is quite true that man lives by bread alone \u2014 when there is no bread. But what happens to man\u2019s desires when there is plenty of bread and when his belly is chronically filled?At once other (and \u201chigher\u201d) needs emerge and these, rather than physiological hungers, dominate the organism. And when these in turn are satisfied, again new (and still \u201chigher\u201d) needs emerge and so on. Maslow offers the following description of self-actualization:'It refers to the person\u2019s desire for self-fulfillment, namely, to the tendency for him to become actualized in what he is potentially.The specific form that these needs will take will of course vary greatly from person to person. In one individual it may take the form of the desire to be an ideal mother, in another it may be expressed athletically, and in still another it may be expressed in painting pictures or in inventions'(Maslow, 1943, p. 382\u2013383). Characteristics of Self-Actualized People In addition to describing what is meant by self-actualization in his theory, Maslow also identified some of the key characteristics of self-actualized people: Acceptance and Realism: Self-actualized people have realistic perceptions of themselves, others and the world around them. Problem-centering: Self-actualized individuals are concerned with solving problems outside of themselves, including helping others and finding solutions to problems in the external world. These people are often motivated by a sense of personal responsibility and ethics. Spontaneity: Self-actualized people are spontaneous in their internal thoughts and outward behavior. While they can conform to rules and social expectations, they also tend to be open and unconventional. Autonomy and Solitude: Another characteristic of self-actualized people is the need for independence and privacy. While they enjoy the company of others, these individuals need time to focus on developing their own individual potential. Continued Freshness of Appreciation: Self-actualized people tend to view the world with a continual sense of appreciation, wonder and awe. Even simple experiences continue to be a source of inspiration and pleasure. Peak Experiences: Individuals who are self-actualized often have what Maslow termed peak experiences, or moments of intense joy, wonder, awe and ecstasy. After these experiences, people feel inspired, strengthened, renewed or transformed. ",

            "answer_text": "Self-awareness comes easily if you accept yourself \u201cwarts and all.\u201d Only when you accept yourself as you really are, can you be free and clear of self-delusion, grasping for things you will never get or deserve, and ego-motivated thoughts and actions. Accepting yourself in this way is not denigrating yourself for your imperfections, missteps, and mistakes. Everyone does these things, and it is important to realize that these are part of being alive, and do not deserve negative judgement as a result. Only things that we can improve about ourselves, and fail to do so in a timely manner, deserve our self-criticism, in which case, we can do better, and we know we can (as opposed to dreaming that we can, which is delusion). These are the parts of our personality and character that give us stress, anxiety, and depression. When you accept yourself as you really are, you are able to ascertain how, when, and why such things have no real, lasting value or importance as part of our lives. ",

Regardless of the defintion, we are never completely aware \u2014 each of us is imperfect \u2014 and the degree to which we are aware is never static. I suggest what I consider to be the following crucial distinctions: Normal people are self-aware. This means that they are aware of their personal identity characterized by their own private thoughts exclusive to their subjective mental domain \u2014 and which existentially separates them from other phenomenal entities with whom they share temporal experience.Few people are Self-aware. This means that they are aware of their transpersonal identity characterized by unified thoughts inclusive of all objective mental domains \u2014 and which projects into the phenomenal world from eternity, subsuming the self-awarenesses of all temporal entities.",

            "answer_text": "All you have to do is watch yourself. Do not change any aspect of your life deliberately but allow any slowing down changes which happen of their own accord. From the moment you wake up just watch your own activities throughout the day. How long does it take you to get out of bed in the morning; what do you do next; how long do you spend in the bathroom; where do you have your breakfast; what do you eat; etc.? The point of self watching is to begin for the first time to look at what you actually do; to become aware of the semi automatic and automatic processes which you have become adapted to over the years. You get up at the same time every morning, or if you sleep in on certain mornings you tend to sleep in for a certain amount of time which is the same every time. So is it really sleeping in at all? You sit in the same chair, eat the same food, greet people with the same words, walk at the same speed, miss the same bus, and get angry at the same things every day. When you are self watching imagine you are undertaking a scientific experiment. The scientist does not allow his or her emotions to interfere with the experiment and so must you not influence your own actions in any way. Just watch and record what you do. At first you will keep forgetting to watch yourself and will slip into your automatic living style. Do not worry about this at all because it will only hinder your progress. Just start self watching again when you remember. You must be very aware when you self watch, remembering to look at yourself, listen to what you are saying, feeling the things you touch, smelling the environment around you, and tasting the food you eat. If you find it difficult to self watch properly, just concentrate on certain activities. A simple example is in eating. Prepare the food you usually eat as normal. Before you start eating look at the colours of the food. Become intensely detailed in your observation. The colours start springing out at you. Look at the shapes, the consistency. When you taste the food put all your attention into the taste buds. Bite into the different sizes and thicknesses. Internally watch the food as it enters your body. You have been eating for years but have never really observed what you eat. Fill the stomach and get on with the race of life! In the same way you have been living the rest of your life in an automatic functional way. Self watching is designed to make you start realising what you do. You will find that as you self watch regularly, you will start to slow down. When you listen to what you are saying to other people you will begin to realise that most of your talk is just chit-chat, often based on no or little knowledge; you will begin naturally to resist the urge to talk so much. Try an experiment. Ask someone you know about a topic which you know they do not know much about. Almost all people will give an opinion and some people will suddenly become experts. We all do it, but when you self watch you begin to realise that it is ridiculous. No one knows something about everything, and the first step to slowing down is to recognise that you don't have to have an opinion about everything. Self watching often leads to a person dropping certain activities from his or her previously normal behaviour. Remember, do not force yourself to drop anything. Just watch yourself and let those things go which seem ridiculous or no longer necessary. ",

            "answer_text": "Can I answer this question by showing how self-awareness appears and disappears and by seeing how it can exist or not then one can get a sense of what it is? Does self-awareness have a frequency threshold?  I like the idea of the threshold for something to become aware to the observer. In deep meditation, the mind can disappear when the meditator disappears in mind and only to return in mind to know one had lost consciousness and do not know where one\u2019s mind had been. These are usually in the lower operating frequencies of the mind. I think this also happens when we slowly fall asleep at 4 hz. I think thinking also follows the same path, verbal thinking 42 hz to silent mind pictorial thinking approx 8 hz to 4 hz. I think when the mind loses conscious awareness during meditation it is like you switching off your internet router and the body-mind loses its connection to its environment or to the Universe. The brain gets disconnected. So the question to ask is are you your body-mind or is your True Self really the Universe. Are we just a sliver of the Universe?  So when the brain receives the spark from the environment then the body-mind becomes aware of itself. When you reduce the brain frequency low enough the brain gets disconnected from its environment and consciousness fades away and we lose awareness.  Also threshold levels here in the road map of the thinking mind:  Why were we designed this way? We can experience True Love and Compassion from our source the \u201cintelligence\u201d of the Universe when we are one with the Universe with our minds. Eternal, True love and Compassion cannot be realised by the thinking mind.  ",

            "answer_text": " We all have a sense of self-awareness. It influences everything, from how you view the world and your place in it to how you relate to others and impacts your behavior. Because of self-awareness, people rely on habits and routines. It makes them feel comfortable and in control, but it is an illusion. For a long time, I was waking up every day and doing the same thing over and over again. I felt like a hamster in a wheel. Sticking to the same routines may make you feel like you are safe and in control, but no matter how hard you try, life has a way of catching up. You can\u2019t avoid loss or negative experiences, so let go. Accept that you can\u2019t control everything. Life is full of uncertainties. You\u2019ll find that what\u2019s meant to happen will, and you may be better for it. Take note of the different roles that it takes in you. Are you playing the role of victim, blaming everyone else for your problems? Are you judging others based on your own insecurities? To get perspective, dedicate an hour each day to observe without making judgments. Pay attention to your moods and how you react when someone says or does something that you don\u2019t like. If you find yourself frequently judging others, redirect your thoughts so that you view the situation from a different perspective. In other words, put yourself in another person\u2019s shoes.

            "answer_text": "First of all I love you. Imagine you are a TV camera. You take in light, you convert it to an electromagnetic signal, and pass that signal through a wire to a memory device of some kind, like a video tape for example. The camera works just fine, but it doesn\u2019t know what it is doing, it doesn\u2019t even know it exists, because there is no \u201cknower\u201d in it. Well, what if that camera were invisible too? Even if there was a knower inside it, a consciousness of some kind, how would it know itself, being invisible and all? Well this is exactly the problem we encounter as Spirits. You, your deepest self is your spirit. It has always existed in the eternal Godhead, you share his being with him, and so you, an aspect of God, are co-eternal with Him. The light comes in, the information about the world is passed on to God, but YOU miss out on all the fun, because you don\u2019t see yourself. God wants you to become self aware, that is, to sense and identify with the spirit you actually are! To do this, God placed your spirit in a material body, as contrast. You seem to \u201cbecome\u201d something you are not, a material body, in order to discover what you actually are, an eternal spirit. Perhaps you incarnated a million times as inumerable animals to first gain a physical awareness, and then many incarnations as a human to develop your mind so that you may finally discover your true spiritual nature as a piece of the spirit of God. In a word, your deepest essence is simply God discovering himself! Thanks for the question my friend! Blessings! ",

With that understanding we change from a selfish beings to lovable and compassionate ones. We change our way of life from ego centrism to humbleness. We stop fighting people or thoughts and we stop feeding the bad wolf. We realize that we can use our minds and not our minds use us. With all of these said we become free from the cages of our minds that our egos created. When love is taking the major role in our lives we cannot do or understand wrong and evil. We become the beings who once descended here on earth, the pure that is the spark of God\u2019s energy. That is self-awareness. One more thing we should mention here. Everything here can make sense or not but that does not matter, because self-awareness does not come from others words but from in within. We must let the light grow inside to come to that realization. Everything what we hear or see is meant to give birth to the curiosity that will give the impulse. We can consider it the spark that light the fire. Read on my blog How Can We Fight Evil? ",

It is hard to imagine the spectacular powers, capacities and attributes of the kind possessed by human beings absent the control center of self-awareness. How else, for example, could one conceive of the near-miraculous creativity exemplified in the inventions we call art, science, and philosophy, and everything in the world such disciplines have transformed, or more, brought into existence? Some contemporary philosophical-neurological thinkers and book-writers like Tufts University professor Daniel Dennett seek to explain self-awareness. Judge for yourself. I believe, like the historic quantum physicist of the last century, Erwin Schrodinger, that we will never \u201cexplain\u201d self-awareness or even the more subsidiary phenomena of human consciousness. Explanation is about applying the methods of science to objects and their motiveless behavior. \u201cWe\u201d are not objects but subjects. The short book is \u201cMind and Matter\u201d, highly recommended. ",

That \u201cself\u201d is really a story that the inner storyteller tells itself. The other is when the attention focuses on the physical sensation of the body, a sensation which has nothing to do with the so-called five senses (or however many you count). It\u2019s the direct attentional awareness of the mass of the body, the pull of the Earth\u2019s gravity on it, and the electricity in the muscles which resist that downward pull. That self awareness floods the attention with so much information that it is basically impossible to sustain the inner talk for that moment. One feels one is no longer a \u201cperson\u201d, a social being; one feels one is a quivering blob of vibrating cosmic energy, a complete unknown, and unknowable (but you won\u2019t care because the experience is far more captivating than knowing what it is you\u2019re experiencing). Then the inner talk starts again and the experience slips back into the first version of self awareness, which is that mix of words, images and nostalgic emotions. ",

It is a level of consciousness, where a person is aware of what is happening to them, what their responses are and by knowing these things one is able to control them. An animal eats and a man (or woman) eats. An animal will eat until there is no more food. A man will eat the amount that will be the most beneficial to his body. One eats without self awareness, one with. Man is a machine. Predictable, determined, and based on what he is exposed to, so his reaction is predictable. But a higher level of man, one with self awareness, acts differently. He sees and knows how and what he is exposed to affects him, and this gives him free will to act. Self awareness is remembering yourself, Knowing that you are being pulled constantly in all directions, and so have the ability to choose. ",

What are these skills that allow me to thrive, instead of just survive? Self-awareness is one; watching myself thinking, and seeing the repercussions of those thoughts and how they affect my feelings. Another is concentration, where I can develop the practice of focusing on one thing, whether that be breathing, a candle flame or holding a beautiful thought. This concentration strengthens my ability to stay present, alert to all possibilities and potential. Understanding and accepting the bigger picture is another valuable skill for life. The habit of stepping out my own chaos for a few minutes, changing my perception, letting to, restoring some inner calm, clarity or hope.

People experiencing life-threatening situations sometimes report that time seemed to have slowed down. Research established that time does not actually slow down for a person during a life-threatening event but, rather, it is only a retrospective assessment that brings about such a conclusion. Duh! There is another explanation for that: Heightened Awareness. Accidents, jumping off planes/buildings/bridges, falling in love, seeing your baby that first time, having a near-death experience, nightmares/dreams, etc. are some examples when your awareness becomes highly focused on the present moment and so sharp that you can perceive every little detail \u2026 so much so that describing that brief moment can take volumes. That is being in the now. That is awareness. That is true human potential every moment. No need for death defying acts and near-death experiences. Simply live as if you are dying every moment. ",

Being aware of how things affect you can bring such awareness of who you truly are. A lot of constructs in today\u2019s society can limit our capabilities and belief in ourselves. It is a deep conditioning that our external world controls our internal one when in reality, it is our internal reality that creates our external one. For instance, it could be looked at like this. We are taught that a cup is a cup. We are shown it and someone tells us \u201cThis is a cup and it is for drinking.\u201d That is now your reality. However, the only reason that it is a cup to you is because someone told you. That\u2019s it. So if it\u2019s only because it was told to you, that means that a cup can literally be anything you want it to be that makes sense to you. You can create a new meaning to it. You are now free to use it as a vase, a hat, a bowl, etc. Whatever you want in a way that makes you feel good. You can see it\u2019s endless possibilities. We just have to work through our own doubt by not staying within the constructs that those around us expect of us. Staying true and confident in your decisions because it makes you feel good and it\u2019s in line with who you are is a great indicator you are self-aware. You taking control of how your external circumstances make you feel will determine how you perceive your world. Life is just more rad being self-aware. You are able to see through a lot of bs and you see just how much more capable you are to be in more control of your life instead of it controlling you. ",

            "answer_text": "self awareness is the knowledge that you are awareness. You know you are aware by being aware- knowing and being are indistinguishable. But before getting to that, self awareness starts with the misunderstanding of the self as limited to the body, mind, person with its history and achievements, its thoughts, feelings and emotions, its fantasies,\u2026 the false awareness of being somebody. Some people succeed going beyond by questioning their somebodiness and seeing its falsity. Then awareness may become of the falsity of all that was misunderstood. While falsity is seen for what it is, it will also be noted that it won\u2019t depart by itself so, it can stay. At this point awareness is losing interest in watching the false and instead turns towards itself- that is awareness of awareness in which there are no objects. That is the self aware of itself [self-awareness]. ",

A personal commitment to become more self-aware might also be known as a journey of self development, of spiritual growth; becoming more whole, seeking enlightenment, self-actualisation; more emotionally intelligent. All of these ideas are linked but probably boil down to each of us becoming more self-aware. Many of those interested in any of these practices/philosophies would suggest that being and becoming self-aware are the very reason we\u2019re here: that life\u2019s purpose is to personally and collectively evolve in our degree of self-awareness. Given the ever speeding-up of so-called progress, the chaos and uncertainty in the world (plus fake news and such biased info all around us) there\u2019s never been a better not more necessary time for learning to tune-in and BE self-aware!

            "answer_text": "The direction our life takes is dependent on where you focus your energy, emotions, and how you react to situations. Being self-aware helps you understand where your thoughts and emotions are taking you so that you can change course when they no longer serve you. We\u2019re all born with a sense of self-concept; this is only an initial form of self-awareness. A more evolved sense of self-awareness begins to develop at the age of 18 and is broadly of two types: public and private self awareness. Private self-awareness refers to introspecting to understand your own feelings and thoughts. Public self-awareness is the perception we have of ourselves with respect to how others view us. Developing self-awareness enables you to manage stress better and motivate yourself more effectively. When you can do these things, you can tackle any challenge life brings to you and come out on top of it. If you are looking for a place to start on your journey of self-awareness, make sure to visit Higher self. They are committed to helping people become self-aware and live their best lives.

Just watch, just see, make no effort, do not strive; an effortless awareness. In the beginning it looks very paradoxical \u2013 effortlessness and awareness \u2013 but once you start working on it, slowly the knack is learned. It is a knack. And once you have learned the knack, once you have known even a single moment of awareness without tension, you are on the right track; you will never be the same person again. Just relax and let things be as they are. A very passive awareness \u2013 that is the meaning of meditation. If sometimes you forget watching, perfectly good! When you remember, you watch again. When you forget, you forget. This is relaxation, this is accepting life as it comes. Then great joy arises out of it. You are never tired and you are never distracted because nothing can distract you. ~ Osho, The Madman's Guide to Enlightenment, Talk #30 ",
