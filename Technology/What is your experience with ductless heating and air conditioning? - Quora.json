            "answer_text": "I\u2019ve had extensive personal experience with them, as well as received feedback from friends and family about theirs. Like all HVAC systems, they\u2019re a mixed bag. First, the good: Ductless means no duct losses. These alone often waste 10%-30% of the energy used by a central AC system.Efficient: modern inverter ductless heat pumps are extremely efficient with variable speed blowers and compressors that allow them to run optimally for the heating/cooling requirements. Compare this with the vast majority of central systems that have a compressor that runs at a single speed (max output) or the high end systems that have two speed compressors.Comfortable: because the output various in many steps, these systems can run at a relatively low and quiet speed most of the time. Additionally, this is very effective at removing moisture during the summer, improving comfort even more.Put them where needed: in my house, we installed three systems: Living room, master bedroom, basement. The living room system is necessary for comfort because that space has many windows and vaulted ceilings, leading to excessive heating during the summer, even though they\u2019re insulated as well as possible. Our mini-split went on the fritz recently and we realized how useful and necessary it is now that we\u2019re depending on the central system for all our AC needs! The unit in the master bedroom lets us cool the MBR to an optimal temperature at night and turn off the central system, avoiding wasting all that energy. This is both much more comfortable and efficient.The basement unit provides air conditioning for the basement living space, which doesn\u2019t need much because it\u2019s mostly underground and naturally cool. But it\u2019s a godsend during the summer when humidity rises along with the basement temperatures. Our central system doesn\u2019t service our basement, so this is a big win.The inevitable bad: Our first living room system died just after its warranty expired. The coils are made extremely thin for best energy transfer and some units have a history of developing leaks. After many false starts and failures to repair the system, we replaced it with another brand (both top rated Japanese brands).Tricky installation: Our new living room unit has had (very slow) leaks since installation due to problems with installation, even though I used a very good company with factory certified technicians. Still, they\u2019ve struggled, amplifying the need for proper installation. These units *must* be installed and maintained by technicians experienced in working with these high-pressure, highly technical system. For example, the amount of refrigerant in the system is critical. You can\u2019t just \u201ctop it off\u201d, as many techs do. The newer refrigerants use much higher pressures, meaning fittings at the refrigerant lines have to be perfect.Usage: While they appear to be \u201cset and forget\u201d with their digital remotes, there are situations where they don\u2019t seem to work. Typically I\u2019ve found this to be when the systems are installed closer to the floor instead of at ceiling level (as factory recommended). This confuses the thermostats in the units. In these situations, the temperature setting must be much lower than expected. Once you know this, they work fine. But the systems \u201cappear\u201d to be malfunctioning if set to the actual desired temperature.Aesthetics: Many dislike the appearance of mini-splits. I personally don\u2019t mind at all, I think it\u2019s just different looking and people aren\u2019t used to it. But it\u2019s a personal preference.Overall, I\u2019ve loved having mini-split heat pumps. I just wish the experience hadn\u2019t been marred by one system repeatedly failing. ",

            "answer_text": "In 2013 I moved into my current home. It had ducted gas furnace and an old R22 add on AC cooling unit. The ducted AC system was significantly undersized to cool the entire home, so I turned off the bedroom zone and left the unit only to cool the living areas. In each of the bedrooms I had installed ductless mini split reverse cycle heat pump systems. This allowed us to individually heat or cool each bedroom. In 2016 I became a HVAC and refrigeration apprentice and started to learn about the installation and repair of these systems. My ducted AC system developed a refrigerant leak in 2018 which I repaired. The price of replacement R22 is now prohibitively expensive. While the ducted AC is working again, based on the success of the mini splits, I purchased 2 more large units to install in my living areas. The idea is to be able to individually zone the living areas and to eventually retire the ducted AC. As stated in an earlier answer, there is no duct loss with mini split systems. Additionally, there are no zoning motors, and because you have the ability to set individual temperatures in each room, or turn off entire rooms that are not in use, occupants are cooled or heated to their individual comfort temperatures and energy consumption is minimised by only conditioning rooms that are in use. There are also variations available such as multihead mini splits where 2\u20135 indoor units can run from a single outdoor unit. Another variation that may be of interest is cassette based indoor units. These indoor units are installed in the ceiling rather than on your wall. Whatever you decide, I recommend that you purchase a quality brand inverter unit, have it professionally sized and installed. In my professional experience, a quality branded unit will last significantly longer than a rebranded generic Chinese unit. Generally speaking, the Japanese brands are better than the Korean brands which are slightly better than the Chinese brands. ",
