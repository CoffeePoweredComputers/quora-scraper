            "answer_text": "I am an amateur radio operator I am an amateur radio operator KF6TT and have a MSEE degree majoring in Communications. My interpretation of this question is it relates to the receiver and not a transmitter. A radio signal consists of electromagnetic waves. The length of the wave is determined by the frequency, the lower frequencies have very long wavelengths and higher frequencies can have very short wavelengths. AM radio wavelengths are more than 100 meters, FM radio only a couple meters. The waves have energy, the longer the distance from the transmitter the lower the energy. The receiving antennas size relates to how much energy it can capture, the larger it is the more energy it can capture, consequently the better it works. Antennas work best as their length approaches the wavelength of the desired signals. Tuning, shaping, focusing, the antenna improves the performance relative to omnidirectional e field probes (The typical telescoping car antenna), but size matters. As distance from the transmitter increases it becomes necessary to capture more of the signals diminishing energy to overcome natural noise sources. Larger and better performing antennas, directional antennas, capture more of the signal, extending the range of the radio. There is no simple answer that can be complete. For example a telescoping car antenna, 100 meters long will be more effective capturing lightning and noise from lightning than distant radio transmitters, also a bit impractical. That is the non technical answer. Accurate and complete technical answers are beyond the scope of this forum. Maxwell's equations are a good starting point for serious students. The ARRL Amateur Radio Antenna book provides specific antenna design information for anyone interested in more details without the need for an engineering degree. ",

            "answer_text": "\u201c How does an antenna extend a radio's range? \u201c This implies that a radio doesn\u2019t need an antenna, but it can benefit from one. This isn\u2019t the case \u2014 an antenna is an essential part of a radio. The minimum required could be a half wavelength antenna. At Wifi frequencies this could be as short as two inches. At FM, this is about 60 inches. When extended range is required, an array, a yagi, or colinear could be utilized. All of these are directional in some way, because like many things in electronics and engineering, design and performance is usually a compromise. -Chris ",
