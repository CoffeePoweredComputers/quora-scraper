            "answer_text": "Having only been in Silicon Valley for less than a year, I may not be able to answer this question with as much gravitas, and I hope that some more established veterans share their thoughts eventually. I will contribute the following perspective, and please know that I am wholly biased in favor of Silicon Valley, so please read with a grain of salt :) Silicon Valley is, hands-down, the most vibrant, intellectually-curious, collaborative, competitive, forward-thinking, socially-aware, practical, idealistic, and dynamic area I've ever lived in, and I've lived in New York City, Ann Arbor, Cambridge, and now Palo Alto. Silicon Valley is essentially from San Jose up to San Francisco, with a bit on the bleeding edges, but more than geography, Silicon Valley is really just one big social network. I used to live in San Francisco for years before moving back last year, and this is my first go-around in Palo Alto. When you first get here, there's a natural excitement to just start meeting people everywhere, because folks are always out and around, and so much of business is social. It can be overwhelming, but also I've seen some new entrants perhaps use this to accidentally underestimate the importance of personal reputation and personal introductions. I know, because I caught myself doing this once or twice, mostly out of excitement. It's eventually easy to meet who you need to, but simply asking for introductions won't work -- it takes some work and people apply all sorts of filters to manage their inbound communications and requests. Someone new to Silicon Valley could literally have their afternoons and evenings booked solid with various start-up events, many of which are free or cost a modest fee. It takes some experimentation to find which events provide value. Behind the scenes, it takes a long time to build and nurture relationships, and that point shouldn't be rushed. Some entrepreneurs don't have the luxury of time, nor do some venture capitalists or other investors, but in general, word travels fast so those with good social skills and polite manners (following up, being respectful, helping with a hand) are noticed and recorded. I always say, when others ask, that the penalty for failure in Silicon Valley is pretty low, given how much people move around from startup to startup, whereas the penalty for being a jerk is tremendously high. Before Palo Alto, I spent three and a half years in Cambridge, MA, where part of that was spent as a graduate student and the other half as an entrepreneur, one foot in India and one foot in the life sciences. Let me say first that the scene is changing rapidly and I think that Boston and the surrounding areas are poised to see big improvements, as they have a lot of terrific assets. I'd like to highlight some things going on here that are noteworthy: The Startup Tribe at Harvard Business School filled with MBA students who are driving cool changes at the school and in the community, such as having Eric Ries (entrepreneur, author) and Jeff Bussgang as \"Entrepreneurs in Residence,\" as well as having students such as Andrew J. Rosenthal work hard to get more students at the school thinking about entrepreneurship.Entrepreneurs turned angels such as David Cancel, Dharmesh Shah and Bill Warner are pretty much wholly committed to an entrepreneurial renaissance in Boston, among many others.Widespread adoption of social networks is greasing the wheels for folks to get out more and meet up beyond a university context. Just last week, when I was in Cambridge, we had a little Quora meetup at a bar. On a bigger scale and with more impact, there are more incubators popping up, universities recognize the importance of entrepreneurship within the economy today, and venture capital will always have fresh pools from which to harvest limited partner funds.The Boston-area is especially strong in the life sciences and defense/IT technologies, and those sectors may not get as much press as consumer internet, social networks, and the like.I will say that, during my limited time there, I did notice a bit less acceptance for failure as a badge of honor, and that may in some ways discourage risk-taking, but again, I think this will change, and probably is changing already. Before I lived in San Francisco, I spent three years in NYC. I was not involved in entrepreneurship at this time (unless you consider my moonlighting job as a bartender entrepreneurial). I am a big fan of NYC, but I am only tangentially aware of the great tech scene emerging in the city, most notably: Hugely successful investors and entrepreneurs, such as Fred Wilson (Venture Investor) , Chris Dixon (business person), the emergence of big companies like Foursquare are emblematic, iconic and will likely lead to others flowering in the city.There is a real tech presence in NYC, with almost one quarter of Ron Conway's SV Angel investments going to NYC, with Accel (venture capital firm) opening an office there, with Silicon Valley Bank (company) sending one of their most visible arms (Shai Goldman) there, and there are more examples. TechCrunch has a presence there, too, which means a lot.From what I hear from entrepreneurs, the scene is emerging, but it's still small, though NYC probably gets more venture dollars than Boston, for what it's worth. It may be that in the future, more NYC tech startups focus on what's around them, such as consumer, digital media, ad-tech, financial markets, etc.From my point of the view, right now, it's hard to compare NYC to Silicon Valley simply due to the number of bigger tech players in the ecosystem. There's no Google, Twitter, Facebook in the area, nor is there an Oracle, Cisco, etc. That's not a knock on the area, but perhaps in a decade, there will be. This may be a longer answer than you had hoped for, but I would summarize as follows: Silicon Valley is like no other place. It's futile to compare it to places like Boston or NYC. There's a rush of excitement when one first moves here, and that excitement will undoubtedly be met with some \"downs,\" too, but on the whole, people here are smart, collaborative, competitive (in a healthy way), intellectual, pragmatic, and they believe in themselves, sometimes to a fault. I can say this after 9 months here. I wonder how many answer may evolve over time :) ",

            "answer_text": "I just moved here for work and have only lived here for a couple of weeks. Currently staying in Mountain View, but will be moving to Palo Alto. I'm just gonna ramble about my experiences so far. I'm not getting quite the initial rush of excitement others have talked about, but maybe that's because I haven't started work or been to too many networking events yet. The first thing that struck me is that pretty much everyone is an engineer. This is kind of weird if you come from an area where you hardly know any engineers. It kind of feels like I'm in college still, standing inside of Boelter Hall (UCLA's engineering building). Even in college it was somewhat of a novelty to be an engineer, but here, pretty much everywhere you go is filled with engineers. I've spent most of my free time in coffee shops getting prepared for my job, and have found most of the conversations to be kind of \"over-the-top\" Silicon Valley. Pretty much every conversation I've overheard has involved the words \"equity\", \"venture capital\", \"start-up\", \"user experience\", \"Stanford\", etc.  There was also one occasion where an elderly lady sat at a table next to a younger man and immediately started talking about programming. That surprised me a bit. People drive much, much slower up here than they do down in Southern California. I was driving home at 10pm the other day and all the cars were going about 60 mph. In Southern California, at 10pm, the average car speed would probably be more like 75 mph. I'm not really loving the slower driving. On the other hand, I've experienced more road rage up here than I did in SoCal. Just yesterday, some BMW driver got angry at me for making him merge behind me on the freeway, and tailgated me all the way to my exit where he then tried to scare me off of the exit by going around me. There's some really great food here. I've been getting Falafel STOP regularly. My girlfriend claims that she found the best Indian food of all time in Sunnyvale (and I'm excited to try it).  I haven't found any great Mexican food places but I'll stay hopeful. The beer scene's not as good as San Diego, CA, but there are some great breweries up here like Russian River and Lagunitas (about 1.5 hours north). Silicon Valley is much more beautiful and lush than where I'm from in Southern California.  My neighborhood in Palo Alto is right next to a park, and is covered in trees and greenery. It's a wonderful place to go on a run in the morning.  The nature and greenery is very refreshing after growing up in a desert. Another nice feature of Silicon Valley is it's generally very safe.  I feel totally safe walking around my neighborhood at 1am, and this is a great luxury.  There are a few exceptions to this (East Palo Alto), but in general you're safe. The houses here generally look more \"east coast\" than where I'm from, with paneled houses (not New Mexico or adobe style). People in Silicon Valley are incredibly educated.  It seems that most people I talk to graduated from schools like Stanford, MIT, Harvard, etc.  Because of this, I think people generally treat others with respect and assume that they are intelligent right from the get go.  I haven't met anyone who acts cocky about their background, despite the high achievements.  It wouldn't make much sense to act cocky when someone 10 feet from you also went to an elite college. So there's my hodgepodge of Silicon Valley experiences. ",
