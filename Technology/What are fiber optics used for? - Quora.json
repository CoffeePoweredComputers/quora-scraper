            "answer_text": "As manufacturers of fiber optic cabling systems for networking companies, CATV or utility outside plant installations, we are familiar with fiber optics. Fiber optics, however, has many others applications besides communications. Several new fiber optic networks using plastic optical fiber (POF) have been adopted by automotive manufacturers. In 2014, almost 5 million devices where connected with POF were installed in vehicles. Medical applications has long been used. It allows nonsurgical viewing of the internal human body for diagnosis. Using bundles of fibers, some of which transmit light into the body and others that capture an image for viewing, endoscopes have become one of medicine\u2019s everyday tools. Nondestructive testing also uses endoscopes to visually inspect hard-to-reach areas such as the inside of engine cylinders, pipes or even sailboat masts. You may have encountered this when working around engines, pipelines or pumps. Fiber optics is being used for sensors. Using sophisticated techniques, fiber can be made into microphones, electrical (voltage and current) sensors, chemical detectors and intrusion systems for perimeter protection. Fibers can even be imbedded in concrete structures such as bridges or buildings to monitor stress and detect internal cracks. Fiber optics can be used in signs, either by piping light to a small section of a sign, illuminating a mask or creating a shape, or by creating a matrix that can be selectively lit to create dot-matrix displays. Fiber can also create unique visual effects not easily duplicated with lamps or LEDs. Fiber optic lighting has many advantages over conventional lighting that often justify its higher cost. Probably the most obvious application is lighting swimming pools and fountains. Because fiber acts as both a light pipe and an insulator, the actual light source can be remotely installed, well away from the water, removing any hazard of electrical shock. Individual fibers can be filtered for spectacular color effects. I have seen many applications of fiber optic lighting recently in museums, where it is used as a source of \u201ccold\u201d light to protect delicate artwork. Fiber optic lighting is easily directed and focused, allowing even small objects to be brilliantly lit. Since the light source is remote so is the heat, and the source can be filtered to produce pleasing light that is not harmful to the valuable item being lit. ",
