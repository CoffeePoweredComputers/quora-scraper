            "answer_text": "Noble or corrupt ? Follow these steps to become a \u2018successful\u2019 politician : 1.Join Law School :- Most of the politician are illiterate and mostly dependent on their PA and other experts.Their speeches are made by somebody else.Their answers to questions are pre-prepared,so when some problem arises which is out of their control and they are not prepared for it they start to sink and forgotten. The reason I want you to join law school is to make you prepared for dealing with circumstances which are sudden and uncalled for.By becoming a Lawyer you would already have knowledge about laws and their flaws and experience of dealing with public,police and other high level people.If you work hard in being a lawyer and win cases,you will automatically attract people and politician who are in pinch.While working as a lawyer you will be able to associate yourself with powerful personalities who could help you when you need them. So work hard,grow your image,be/act righteous,get support and love,make money and powerful friends plus knowledge of law,psychology of people and charm of a \u2018smart person' and then you're ready for next step. 2.Join a strong party:- Now you have support,money and most importantly Charm its time to enter politics. Join a strong/majority party use your support base and money to become MLA then use your Charm to woo people and knowledge and communication skills to develop hate in them for opposite candidate's.Collect support for your party until you become so strong and admired that you can't be replaced. Keep people and members around you dependent on you.Never support them enough that they eventually won't need you. Keep supporting your superior and control your juniors. Eventually,you would acquire a position which can't be shaken and being a smart person you will always have a edge over your illiterate and dumb competitor's. Enjoy your position and work for your Country.\u270c ",

            "answer_text": "A few great politicians / leaders of 20th Century. Mahtma GandhiJawaharlal NehruJohn F. KennedyWinston ChurchillDeng XiopengSome common great characteristics of shared by great administrators and leaders/politicians. The nature of Polity has changed from Ancient to medieval to modern times. Also in the same time frame the nature of polity differs from country to country. Even amongst these differences, the great leaders and administrators depict unique traits that elevate them to the platform of ever lasting fame and greatness. 1) Foresight: The most essential quality required to be a successful politician is foresight. Almost every great politician worth his name in the pages of history has exhibited this quality. All the above mentioned leaders  were usually much ahead of their times.  2) Understanding the limitations and converting them into strengths: To understand the limitations and to turn it into opportunity is a hallmark of a great politician. Take Gandhi for example. he understood the elitism of the Indian national Movement had to be broken down. Congress was a movement no doubt, but it did not have a mass base except in certain pockets. These limitations were understood by Gandhi. Hence he focused more on constructive programmes, that would positively affect the poor. These constructive programmes were to play a very important role in strengthening the mass movement. They kept the movement alive in its non revolutionary phases and the peasants and the poor whom it benefited became staunch loyalists of congress during the revolutions. This was one of the reasons why the communists could not have a great effect on the Indian psyche.  Another limitation which Gandhi alone understood was the short term phase of any non -violent mass movement. Gandhiji launched mass movements in 1919-20 (The Non- co operation), in 1930-31 (The civil disobedience) and later in 1941-42 (The Quit India). All these movements were extremely short term to the duration of maximum 2 years. This was the inherent limitation of non-violent mass struggle and Gandhi understood it, and he came under criticism for withdrawing the movements as soon as limited concessions were wh by the government. 3) Understanding the People: Mahatma Gandhi understood the people like no one else. He had his hands on the pulse of the nation. Take for Eg. The Dandi March. The entire nation was ready for civil disobedience. The timing was perfect.Where to begin? What was to be the catalyst for protest? Gant proposed protesting the Salt Act. Salt? Really? The entire spectrum of National leaders were bewildered. Even the enemy found it well in the words of \"The Statesman\":  \"It is difficult not to laugh, and we imagine that will be the mood of most thinking Indians.\"  [1]  \"At present the prospect of a salt campaign does not keep me awake at night.\"   ~  The Viceroy Lord Irvin [1]  Only C. Rajgopalachari understood the importance. In his own words, \"Suppose, a people rise in revolt. They cannot attack the abstract constitution or lead an army against proclamations and statutes...Civil disobedience has to be directed against the salt tax or the land tax or some other particular point \u2014 not that that is our final end, but for the time being it is our aim, and we must shoot straight.\" [1] 3) Ideology: Gandhiji understood that the ideology of British rule in India was based on two thing. Fear and the idea drilled into Indians that Indians can't rule themselves and needed the British. With each successive movement, the idea of British supremacy, and fear was eroded from the minds of the Indians. \"All the forces in the world are not so powerful as an idea whose time has come.\" - Victor Hugo Ideology is about the minds of the people. Ideologies create politicians. 4) Circumstances: Many a times circumstances make great politicians. Winston Churchill was one one of the greatest leaders during WW2. However Churchill during peace time would not have been that remembered .  Noteworthy, that he lost the next election. 5) Oratory:Oratory plays an important role. One man speaking his thoughts to thousands and mesmerizing them- that is a certain requirement in politics. Winston Churchill: \" Hitler knows that he will have to break us in this island or lose the war. If we can stand up to him, all Europe may be freed and the life of the world may move forward into broad, sunlit uplands.  But if we fail, then the whole world, including the United States, including all that we have known and cared for, will sink into the abyss of a new dark age made more sinister, and perhaps more protracted, by the lights of perverted science. Let us therefore brace ourselves to our duties, and so bear ourselves, that if the British Empire and its Commonwealth[5] last for a thousand years, men will still say, This was their finest hour.\"   ",
