            "answer_text": "My only experience with finance is in trading (both prop and sell side at a large ibank), so my answers will be mostly focused on that. It depends on the firm, but in general: Most finance companies won't provide you with free meals. At most, you might have lunch catered and they might let you order Seamless if you stay late. Of course, there are some finance companies that are better about this, and not all tech companies have free food, either. Work hours definitely depend on your role. When I worked at Google, you weren't required to be on the desk at any particular interval of the day, but it was expected that you would finish your work and try to be around when your coworkers were there.  At a trading firm, if you are a trader or operations, you are required to be there during market hours (US equities hours are 9:30 - 4:00 EST but different desks trade different products). Developers or quants don't need to be available during market hours, but they might be highly recommended to do so anyway.Aside from having to be on the desk at market hours, you aren't forced to work any number of hours, but many finance companies have a culture of \"the more the better.\" More hours, more face time, more effort put into the appearance of being available and working hard, etc. This may be the case at some tech companies, but it's definitely less common in the valley. Sometimes it's because there's just too much work to do. I know some people who have been working for almost a decade in this space, manage their own teams, and get paid millions a year, who still work 15 hours a day. Other times it's because it's pretty much implicitly required (like if you were a first-year investment banking analyst). I know a lot of early-stage startup founders who work this much, but it's definitely not the norm for an average tech employee.Base salaries are probably about the same or higher in tech. A $100k salary is below average in Silicon Valley but average or above average for an entry-level banking or trading job. Bonuses for bankers and traders can be multiple times your base if the firm is doing well (but banks haven't been doing well in recent years).In Silicon Valley, working from home is probably as common as complaining about the high cost of rent. You can work from home in finance, but it's much more discouraged. Finance culture values face time a lot and companies are very scared of people stealing strategies. The level of paranoia at an average trading firm is like that of a super stealth startup (or Apple), and understandably so since ex-employees stealing code from trading firms happens quite often. Other than what I've listed, the attitudes of employees and managers can be incredibly variable. There are lots of chill people in finance and workaholics in tech and vice versa! ",

            "answer_text": "What the boss is impressed by.  I built software for the finance industry for years.  I am a former trader and I came up in technology through cheating on videogames (lets call that software modification) to hardware, coding, project management and executive (c-level) leadership.  When you are working in or for finance the only real question the CFO/CEO (sometimes the CTO if he is a blow hard) cares about is \"will whatever your doing with all that equipment, wires and software make me more money?\"  Sometimes they don't want you to reorganize their work flows but usually if it'll make trades go faster, cause fewer errors, speed up audits, setup accounts quicker, or allow them to fire some folks then that is a successful implementation. Particularly if it comes in close (within 20%) of budget and (6 months) delivery time. It is a testament to this core belief that technology investment,  of all forms and at all levels,  continues a pace despite the large quantity of massive fail projects that spent millions and delivered either nothing or worse performance. You can always get budget for a tech project.  This is also why financial firms have such lousy tech security. It is peripheral (generally) to the main project of either making more money or reducing expense.  Software executives tend to have been former engineers and they will consider the elegance of a solution in addition to its fit to goal.  In fact, if the implementation will allow for expansion in phase two they may not even be that concerned about how much of the goal is achieved. Software executives are far more concerned about deliverables and delivery dates than the clients generally are and although traders get mad when system deadlines are missed but I don't recall ever seeing anyone miss the last train home or work all night every night for a week with no shower to hit a delivery date in a dealing room.  There is often this disquieting long calm after the engineers declare they are ready to deliver before anyone worries about getting on to the desks and logging in to the servers to see if it works. As a programmer that always made me angry (I have issues).  If I was all invested in delivery then I wanted everyone to be in a rush to deliver even though we'd deliver by the  25th, come out of QC the 30th for a 31st deadline and the client's IT would leave the servers still sitting in their boxes on the 10th or 15th. That's why I got in to management. ",
