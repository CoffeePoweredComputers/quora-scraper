            "answer_text": "The easiest to install ink would need to be the blocks of solid ink used by some older printers including the Xerox Phaser 8560. For better or worse, the technology got left behind in favor of color laser printers. Even the new \u201cPhaser\u201d printers use color laser technology.

IF you could still find one, a HP printer using a 45 and 78 cartridges are likely the cheapest ever made. ",
