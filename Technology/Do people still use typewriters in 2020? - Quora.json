            "answer_text": "Thanks for A2A. Do people still use typewriters in 2020? The majority of domestic printers, and many office-grade laser printers fail to handle envelopes very well. For those offices that don\u2019t use pre-printed envelopes with letter-address windows, the basic daisy-wheel typewriter is still on the market for incompatible envelopes. The majority of these are restricted to 10/12 pitch, and very simple in construction to keep the price down. Brother and Silver Reed tend to lead this cheap market, the Brother having a few more inbuilt smarts. Each brand is not wheel or ribbon compatible with the other. Older, long established offices will still have what is almost a vintage typewriter reserved for the same purpose. ",
