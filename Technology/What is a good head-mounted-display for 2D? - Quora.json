            "answer_text": "Stereoscopic display is a natural result of using a display for each eye, so it\u2019s hard to find a non-stereoscopic display. A VR headset is not overkill for this use-case, since they\u2019re less expensive than a decent non-VR HMD. It\u2019s just not well-suited for it, because VR headsets have more-visible subpixels that make them sub-par for watching video. Sony\u2019s HMD is excellent for what you want to do, but it\u2019s $700 - $1000, so you\u2019d be much better off with a Gear VR and a Samsung phone. Gear VR is better for watching video than the better VR headsets, because of smaller sub-pixels on the phones that are used in the device. ",

            "answer_text": "There is no such thing as a HMD that doesn\u2019t display for two eyes. Head mounted displays have to be mounted close to the head so that they aren\u2019t hanging off your head like a lead weight. That doesn\u2019t mean you have to have 3d. You can just as easily tell any HMD not to display separate images for each display and it will not be in 3d. I also would not recommend this for doing regular work. HMDs introduce some pretty bad habits for eye strain and I wouldn\u2019t recommend using one for doing any kind of regular work. ",
