            "answer_text": "It\u2019s an interesting question but the time is a bit long and the true answer will probably fall somewhere in science fiction category. With the pace of technical and social development we seem to be going we\u2019re probably going to be intra-planetary species by that time and most likely countries like Estonia won\u2019t have a reason to exist. but jokes aside, what\u2019s the future like in Estonia? The optimist in me says that we\u2019re going to continue being a successful and A+ citizens of Europe and the country will be at the forefront of The EU leading this strong union. The standard of living will be rather high in the future like in Sweden and Finland. Estonia will be the centre of the world for all things Infotechnology. Like the Silicon Valley of Europe. In the future, Estonia will be in the forefront of cybersecurity and digital warfare in the world. And as the wars in the future will mostly be held virtually then knowing how to cyberdefend itself will give this small nation huge power and influence in global politics. But yes, very hard to speculate what is going to happen. Looking at the past then a possibility that we\u2019ll be a part of Russian empire once again soon is also rather high. ",

            "answer_text": "It is hard to anwer because there are so many hardly predictable elements in and around Estonia. The most unpredictable is Russia, the neighbour of Estonia. Russia has been problematic neighbour for many centuries and has wanted the lands of Estonia from early middle ages at least. So you never know what \u201cthey want next. The second unpredictable element of Estonia is the fate of Europe and other World. Europe has always been pretty unstable by mentality. So it is hard to say what would gonna happen here for the next 50 years. Estonians themselves are always ready for temporarity of everything. You can lose all you have next week! Nothing is certain here. Family ties are weak, nothing is guaranteed. Power can strip you to nude easily. So you have to be ready to collect your all seven things and run as fast ass possible. So it is really hard to say what will gonna happen in next 50 years in Estonia. ",
