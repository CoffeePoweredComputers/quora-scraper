            "answer_text": "Thanks for the A2A To get 500, or for that matter, any number of subscribers, you need a good channel niche, good quality content and consistent upload. Remember one thing - Individual subscribers are never permanent. They may unsubscribe any time. The thing which matters is that the total number of subscribers should not become less over time. You need to ensure that the number of subscribers gained is more than the number of subscribers lost. Forget all these things. Concentrate on only one thing and that is how to create good quality and interesting content. Subscribers will automatically follow. ",
