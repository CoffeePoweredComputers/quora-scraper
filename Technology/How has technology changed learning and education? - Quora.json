            "answer_text": "The shifted to on-line learning which has been occurring since 2000. The state universities did provide distance learning (snail mail) prior to that. I took on-line classes for my Master\u2019s degree but found most of them did not to provide the quality of instruction of the face to face. There has been some improvement in e-learning, but that may have peaked. By 2010 e-learning existed for many required high school courses. I sometimes monitored the lab in my district in which students took on-line courses. But these students needed help, It is the average/below average students that struggle to learn without a live teacher. At first college level e-learning courses simply required reading and memorization. I took one using two computers, one to search for the answers and the other with the test open for plugging in the answers. Too many students learned to use that method so now courses have project and more extensive work (sometimes a lot of busywork) to ensure that students are learning. The colleges want to prove the rigor of their curriculum. E-learning only seems to work well for the best students (who may be able to learn on their own anyway). ",

            "answer_text": "Some good some bad. Old timers like me are grumpy about change but whining is useless. One thing is it has changed the importance of things. When I was school aged, memorizing things like multiplication tables was mandatory. We needed them. But calculators came and the shift came to using multiplication rather than testing on the tables. It\u2019s not necessary to know that 7x8=56, but it necessary to understand what 7x8 represents and how to use it. I imagine all engineers and others who use math that requires exacting answers use technology now rather than pencil and paper calculations. Not that memorizing is not important, but much less than it was. Most technology fits this model. It\u2019s not good or bad but different. ",
