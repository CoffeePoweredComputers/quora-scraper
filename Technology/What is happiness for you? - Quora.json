            "answer_text": "I was very lucky to have been born into a very privileged family. The neighborhood I grew up in was what I believe every American mother and father hopes to give their children.  I lived in a mansion.  We had a pool and a massive backyard.  My dad drove a BMW.  My mom drove a BMW.  My first car at 16 was a BMW.  I went to a really good high school.  I went to college without an ounce of debt...etc... ...and still, as an adolescent, I was chronically depressed, had a strained relationship with my parents, and at the core was very, very unhappy. This can be attributed to a number of things, but the primary was that somewhere in my subconscious I realized that nothing would ever \"be enough.\"  The same town that provided all these wonderful things, also instilled in me this very false sense of purpose entirely dependent upon achievement.  If I got a B, why didn't I get an A?  If I got an A, why didn't I get an A+?  If I got the A+, why wasn't I working ahead, studying for the ACT, applying to colleges, buffing up my resum\u00e9, doing whatever I had to do to get into the best school possible.  And if I made a mistake, any mistake at all along the way, I was reprimanded and made to feel as though my entire future was a millimeter away from crumbling, all because I didn't ace one tiny quiz. I say this because I learned at a very young age what made me UNHAPPY.  Money, I realized, would never make me happy.  No amount of Hawaii vacations in the presidential suite or new toys under the Christmas tree could take away from the fact that at the end of every day I went to sleep feeling like I would never be good enough.   This is something that I've had to look at more and more in myself the older I get.  I think it's fair to say that I've accumulated an addiction to achievement\u2014as well as a sense that until I reach this \"unidentifiable peak of success\" I will never be good enough.  And that perpetuates a constant state of unhappiness. What I also learned though, again at a very young age, was what made me TRULY HAPPY.  And that was immersion, obsession, and undisturbed interest in a CRAFT.  As a teenager, I spent all my time playing World of Warcraft.  When my parents asked what I was going to do with my life, I ignored them and went back to my computer, unconcerned with the definition of my future and more interested in the next skill I could learn in the game.  (The irony here is that, in line with their expectations of achievement, I also found that same level of achievement in the World of Warcraft\u2014I became one of the highest ranked players in North America) It's a quality I hold very true to myself, this interest in a craft over its definition of success.  I am happy when I am mastering something, when discipline and creativity pulls me\u2014not money or a trophy, turning the craft into a means to an end.   Happiness, then, is not so much the action, but the state I'm in when performing that action.  When I'm immersed fully in whatever I'm creatively working on, I enter a state of flow.  And in that state of flow, I am happy. ===================================================If you liked this answer, you can read more on my blog: www.nicolascole.com, or follow me on Instagram:www.instagram.com/nicolascole77 or Twitter @NicolasCole77.

            "answer_text": "For me happiness are:- 1.Those rare moments when you legitimately don't want to be somewhere else, and you're not worrying about the past or the future. Like when you are in the mountains trekking. You are in the middle of a jungle. You can do nothing but about the world outside or things that generally keep you worried. All you can do is keeping walking. This is happiness. 2.Happiness is just moving on, and not dwelling on things that make you unhappy. Did that movie totally suck and waste your time and money? Don't go see it again. Did that person on the internet say something you disagree with? Scroll past it. There's so much stuff out there that you can experience, right now, probably for free, so there's absolutely no excuse for spending your free time complaining about stuff that has no meaningful effect on the real world. 3.Happiness is not going back to things or people that upset us over and over again. Often we are unconsciously addicted to the pain and suffering. So even when we know some things or people are bad for our wellbeing we go back to them again and again and again. 5.Happiness is pooping without any difficulty early in the morning 6.Happiness is getting paid to do what you love 7.Happiness is to go to bed knowing you have check marked all things from your day\u2019s to-do list 8.Happiness is knowing that your presence is useful, helpful and important to someone other than you. 9.Happiness is a night with a nice girl sharing a beer while listening to good music. 10.Happiness is to realize that there is literally infinite things to do on this planet, and there's no way you can absorb it all. But you can do something. It doesn't have to be big or change the world or make a dent in the universe, it just has to matter to you. 11.Happiness is realizing that being happy is not the end goal, but the by product of awesome things you do in life with integrity. Happiness is what you get as a gift for high self esteem . And high self esteem is the by product of the reputation you have with yourself. If you know you\u2019ve never cheated on your life goals and worked with sincerity you will be content. 12.Happiness is to not give away too many fuck to people or things that don\u2019t deserve our attention 13.Being happy also means accepting that the world is full of crazy people who believe that they're sane - people who are just trying to get through their day without experiencing any great hardships - people who are totally different from you, but as long as no one is harming anyone else, their points of view are just as valid as yours, and your point of view is just as valid as theirs. 14.Lastly and MOST IMPORTANTLY Happiness is more like a compass that tells you whether you are going in the right direction in life. It\u2019s a compass that flickers to the wrong direction if you are not doing in your life. If something makes you unhappy for too many days, it\u2019s time to question your journey and your life choices. That\u2019s the ultimate goal of happiness. to constantly guide you and make sure that you never lose perspective in life. If you understand this simple thing you will start finding happiness in the work you do and the small little every day things you do in life.
