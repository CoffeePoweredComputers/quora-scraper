            "answer_text": "The point of most cell phone lenses is not to enhance the image. There are exceptions where an effect is being added that may enhance the image in certain situations. (Polarized lenses reduce glare. If your shot is suffering from glare, this may help or \u201cenhance\u201d. Starlight filters add starlight effects to the image. If you want this effect then it is an enhancement.) Mostly though the lenses are either the macro, wide angle or telephoto variety. All of these will degrade the image a little because your are putting extra glass in front of your lens. The kits you get for ~$20 are not going to be high grade glass so that goes into your consideration as well. (Of course, you may not notice the effect unless you know what to look for. So don\u2019t be put off cheap lenses just because they are cheap. If they do the job you want them to do, then great.) So why use them? Macro lenses let you focus closer to the object then you would otherwise be able to. This has the effect of making the object look bigger. (This is kind of the point of macro photography, to take pictures of very small things.) Wide angle are like they sound. When you take a pick of something with your phone it only captures a certain angle in front of you. Maybe you want more in your shot and can\u2019t move back. Wide angle lenses help with this. In addition to the distortion you normally get from putting a lens in front of the phone\u2019s lens, wide angle lenses may have a fish eye look. It depends on how strong the wide angle is. Lenses labeled fish eye go for this effect on purpose. Telephoto lenses are the opposite of wide angle lenses. They take a narrow angle and this has the effect of magnifying a distant object. (Think about looking at the moon with your eyes, and then with binoculars. Same idea.) ",

Some don't make good contact with the smartphone camera, meaning you get fuzzy, out of focus results. Others require you to buy a special phone case so that the lens can attach to it. But this often gets you subpar results because of the lack of a good fit between the phone's lens and the add-on lens. For example, Kenko offers their Real Pro 0.4x Super Wide Lens expands the range of your phone's lens to take wide-angle shots at 165-degrees that are ideal for landscape photography, photos of large groups, and general snapshots. They also offer a fisheye lens with a 180-degree view and a macro/wide angle combination lens with a 120-degree view, so if you get the set, you can pursue all kinds of unique photos with your phone.

It is so easy to use, only you have to clear the lens of your camera and clip it like you clip your clothes for drying.
