            "answer_text": "The social classes of the future will be divided into those that have AI work for them (Zuckerberg & Bezos). Those who will work with AI (Computer Scientists) and those who will work for AI (Udemy teacher & Upwork freelancer), and I\u2019m afraid that no occupation in the future will be unaffected by AI. It\u2019s just a matter of which social class you will belong to. Will you own a Shopify, Instagram, Facebook, Amazon, Udemy, Upwork, Uber, Airbnb, Google, Spotify etc. work at one of these, or work for them? Sure, some AI will be products, but more importantly AI is the market. If you don\u2019t own the market, you are on it. ",

            "answer_text": "I can\u2019t think of any! But it\u2019ll be the ones that require the most creativity that are the least affected, because human creativity is the one thing that AI will struggle to replicate. With that said, AI is going to become more and more widespread to the point at which all of us are using AI in our jobs to some extent or another. In the healthcare industry, for example, while doctors are unlikely to be replaced by AI software, they\u2019ll probably find themselves using it on a daily basis to update patient health records and to make diagnoses.
