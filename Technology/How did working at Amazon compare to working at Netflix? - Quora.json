            "answer_text": "When I started with Amazon, I was a junior engineer. When I left, I was senior. I got put through the paces and had the opportunity to really learn a lot. I had to work hard for it, and at times I was really stretched. At times I was unhappy and wanted to walk away. But I feel that it prepared me for running my own company, especially my stint in management. Netflix was different from the start. I came in and was treated as a senior engineer right away. Many people were open to listening to my ideas and suggestions, and using what I\u2019d learned at Amazon I was able to influence and build some great things. I had a good work life balance, got to try my hand at public speaking, and in general was pretty happy. Gremlin\u2019s culture is a hybrid of the two. We value some of the Amazon principles highly: Vocally self critical, bias for action, customer focus, frugality, measure everything. We also love aspects of the Netflix culture: Context, not control, and Freedom and Responsibility. We run an autonomous team built on trusting our team to make the right decisions armed with the right information. We know we only win if our customers win, and they are our life. We know we make mistakes, and it\u2019s most important to own up to them and improve. ",
