            "answer_text": "Calibration blocks. Dialling in your slicer settings so that you get dimensionally accurate prints is well worth it. Some calibration prints will allow pegs and holes to be the right size, ensure x,y,z dimensions are identical, and show the limits of overhangs, bridging, etc. Most printers don\u2019t need extra bits these days, but some of the cheaper ones may have improved cooling shrouds for the extruder. Ideally you want two fans there: One to cool the bit just prior to the hot-end, the other for part cooling. The part cooling fan needs to be either software controllable or have a deflection vane in the shroud to enable part cooling to be varied. ",
