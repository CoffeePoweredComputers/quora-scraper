            "answer_text": "If you mean conventional satellite service, such as what\u2019s available now, in September, 2019, it\u2019s not going to happen. Conventional satellite communications use either something like Iridium, which is low bandwidth and expensive, or geostationary satellites. That means the satellite has to stay over the same spot on Earth all the time. To do that, a satellite has to orbit somewhere around 22,000 miles away from Earth. If I sent a web request through that kind of satellite service, it takes almost half a second to reach the satellite, come back to Earth at the receiving station, connect to the website I wanted, then come back to me by the same route. Trust me, satellite internet is pathetic. (That \u201cBS Satellite Internet\u201d is my way of saying satellite internet is BS. But Quora is so picky about credentials it often does not allow useful experience in credentials.) Now, if you\u2019re talking about the newer, LEO satellite services, such as Starlink, Project Kuiper (from Amazon), or OneWeb, it\u2019s still a long way off. Starlink already has a few satellites up, but not enough to start offering service. They expect to have about 1,500 up by the end of 2020, which means they will be able to start offering service in some areas. (They\u2019ll be starting in the U.S. and Canada.) OneWeb looks like it\u2019ll be next, starting with offering service in the arctic. Amazon still doesn\u2019t have any launches scheduled. First they\u2019re going to have to get the constellations filled out, which means launching much more than 1,500 satellites. At that point, there may be three services. (I\u2019ve heard comments about others trying to do the same, but I wouldn\u2019t count on it.) So now we have 3 companies going into satellite services and, as they get going, there will be court fights over who gets which good frequencies. (I\u2019m suspecting Starlink, under SpaceX, may win that one, since they\u2019re going to be up and running before the others.) Note that issue about the frequencies. In other words, there are good ranges for that kind of communication and bad frequency ranges. So it\u2019s not unlimited communication. There are also, for now, battery issues. Cell phones only need to transmit to the nearest tower. The new LEO satellites will be at least 300, probably closer to 500 miles up. It\u2019s a big difference supplying power to transmit a signal 500 miles (even 300 miles!) compared to transmitting to the nearest tower. So, with those factors in mind, it\u2019s going to be years before wifi and conventional internet is replaced. Not only is there the power issue, but the bandwidth will not be unlimited. Question, as answered: How long will it be before a satellite service replaces WiFi? ",

            "answer_text": "Your question: \u201cHow long will it be before a satellite service replaces WiFi?\u201d Assuming a context that you are asking about, the answer could be \u201cNEVER\u201d. WiFi is very short-range \u2026 less than 100 meters. No satellite could ever operate at that low an altitude since it would collide with just about everything in the world - assuming it could even do so with Earth\u2019s gravity tugging at it. These satellites would have to travel incredibly fast too \u2026 means a collision with land-based structures could be quite catastrophic! :) Now, if you wanted to include the context that WiFi requires another connectivity service (such as cable or DSL or \u2026 even satellite!) to access the Internet, then you might have a more reasonable question. For that, I would say that it would be unsound to replace traditional land-line and cellular (and 5G soon) Internet data services that are the \u201cbackhaul\u201d of the WiFi service, with any satellite data service. This is because satellites have a high latency for the signal to traverse to them and back from the satellite modem, let along the data path to ground stations, etc. Some newer Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellite systems can provide slow to medium data rates. But I do not believe that the economics would justify using them, except in the rare situations of being so far off the beaten path that only satellite service was possible (for example, while at sea). So, the answer for this context would be \u201cUNLIKELY\u201d to replace any WiFi that has a good backhaul data service to the Internet. ",
