            "answer_text": "In a nutshell, contact centers can provide the means for omnichannel support. They revolve around several channels - live chat, email, phone calls, or text messages, just to name a few. In order to create your own contact center and offer a seamless service across the channels, though, you should leverage contact center services: choose a single omnichannel support solution (this way, you don\u2019t need to pay for more than one tool) or pick a few dedicated tools that can be integrated with one another. In both cases, you will be able to keep all the important details in one place and serve your customers in a fast & efficient manner.  Depending on your needs and specificity of your business, you might want to choose between contact and call centers. If your customers prefer calling you - go for a well-functioning call center. In such cases, there\u2019s no need for you to invest in other channels. Powerful call center software like CloudTalk can easily provide you with everything your agents and callers need.If your customers expect you to be present across the channels - you might want to meet these expectations and set up a robust contact center instead. Omnichannel support tools like LiveAgent can work wonders for your business and your customers, especially if you already have a large company and a lot of versatile agents on board.The choice truly depends on the needs of your customers and the specificity of your business. It\u2019s important to realize, however, that both contact centers and call centers can bring you multiple benefits, including the ability to offer outstanding support. ",
