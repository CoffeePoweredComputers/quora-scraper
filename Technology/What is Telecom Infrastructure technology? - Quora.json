            "answer_text": "A detailed answer  would be required for gaining understanding which beyond the scope of Quora. However, I will try to provide a brief answer Telecom Infrastructure is a exciting and happening area that specializes in  building telecom networks connecting  intra cities, towns, highways  and  links to overseas countries as well. This could cover wireline as well as wireless technologies. Its a culmination of technological advancements in a number of areas widely divided into civil infra, electrical infra, network infra and management layer infra. This industry needs  experts in the area of civil, electrical, for the OSP portion and communication ( RF, Switching, data and Transport (microwave, fiber ) areas ) and IT networking in planning, project and operations roles apart from generalists for the ISP portion. Apart from this the management layers of NMS, OSS, and BSS needs software engineers to design and maintain the systems.  Hope the above helps.  Please get in touch in case u need to know more. ",

            "answer_text": " Sometime back I was asked to define what an Infrastructure means, the above picture was my attempt. As per my understanding, \"An Infrastructure is a physical network that can be used by Service Providers to provide Services\"   In a simple Telecom network, the infrastructure will consist of all the physical (hardware and software) components that can be used by the mobile operator/service provider to provide services.  As Sharath Kumar mentioned in his answer there are number of areas including civil, electrical, network and management layer. There would be too many to list here but I hope you get an idea. ",
