            "answer_text": "Not having an active 5G network I can only speculate. Under Mobile Data settings I currently have 4G, 3G and 2G and I can select which option I want. Sometimes if I am in an area with a poor 4G signal I can select 3G and actually get a better connection. I suspect that once my service provider switches on 5G I should have that added to the list of available services which if for any reason I feel the need to disable, it should be possible. Realistically is 5G going to increase our data usage particularly for phones? They said that when 4G first arrived, people were going to burn through their monthly data allowance in days or even hours but I do not believe that ever happened, 5G will mean nothing more than your information arrives more quickly and less user frustration.

            "answer_text": "Fortunately, with the iPhone, you don\u2019t have to worry about it. By default, it has a \u201csmart data mode\u201d. Likewise, it will only use 5g both when it\u2019s available AND when you actually need it. You of course can set it to use 5g all the time if you want, but Apple is really smart about this and provide you with the best of both worlds in terms of performance and battery conservation. ",
