            "answer_text": "In a word, yes. The FinTech revolution is inevitable and it is coming fast. Last year, global FinTech investment hit a record US$111.8 billion according to KPMG, a 120% increase on the US$50.8 billion a year before. If these numbers aren\u2019t indicative of FinTech quickly becoming a cornerstone of society, I don\u2019t know what is! With the finance industry on the verge of a huge disruption, it certainly makes sense to prepare for a potential switch to FinTech, not just for current finance professionals, but even professionals in different industries. CFTE is one such FinTech education platform that has built up an alumni of over 35,000+ professionals, entrepreneurs, CEOs and thought leaders. Many banks and other financial institutions have used their services to upskill their workforce. If they are preparing for the future, why shouldn\u2019t you? If anything, this suggests that not upskilling will render many finance executives obsolete and without real prospects in the industry. You can learn more about the courses that CFTE offers here, which caters to both new and advanced learners. I\u2019ve taken both courses and can vouch for the quality of the content. There are also other well-known courses you can look out for including the Oxford FinTech Programme, HKU FinTech course and more. Good luck! ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, the fintech is inevitable. If you are still young, perhaps below 45, you can or you should switch to the fintech industry. There is so much to learn at very minimal cost and time. But for older who work in banking and finance more than 20 years. We learn and obtain from the different ground, it is like probably too late to change. The bottom line, at least, everyone should understand the fintech and disruption to survive in a fast-changing pace environment. ",
