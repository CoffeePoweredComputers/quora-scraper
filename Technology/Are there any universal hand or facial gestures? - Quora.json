            "answer_text": "The closest to a universal hand gesture I've ever see happens with blind/deaf children. Many of them, not all, across cultures spontaneously will stroke their cheeks, usually with the back of their hand, to call for their mothers. They can't see each other to learn this behavior. No one at a center taught them to do this but I have a colleague whose child is blind and deaf and she was taught to recognize this gesture by the center staff who work with her child. If I'm not mistaken, this gesture was noted by the woman who worked with Helen Keller (you'd have to chck on that). It's the only one I've seen that seems somehow organic to the condition. I don't believe it's been studied to any great degree or length, as far as I know. Someone may have that research though. It's a frequently well-documented behavior.Other gestures we take for granted prove not to be universal: direct eye contact, shaking hands, patting someone on the head, pointing upward, raising the hand palm outward to greet or to \"appeal\" to someone, even shrugging, and the head nod/head wag for yes and no, has been noted by Don Grushkin.

            "answer_text": "In addition to Andrew Hennigan's answer, I recall a Deaf man telling me of his travels in Europe, and in one country (I don't remember which), at a restaurant the waiter kept shaking his head as the man made his order, which puzzled him, as it looked like the waiter was indicating they didn't have that item or was rejecting the order.  It turned out that in the waiter's culture, a shake of the head means \"yes\", while a nod means \"no\".   I would say that a hand (or two) at the throat MAY be universal for \"I'm choking\", but even this I can't say with any certainty since I have found many Hearing people to be quite dense and oblivious to even the most basic gestures at times.

I don't know if that's true, but I've yet to see it refuted in a scientific context.  (With the caveat that things can always be misconstrued in a given situation.) ",

The thumbs up gesture has at least five different meanings depending where you are, ranging from ok to something rude.  Even smiles can mean different things. Sonetimes a person smiles to show they are happy. Other times they smile to show that they are embarrassed. ",
