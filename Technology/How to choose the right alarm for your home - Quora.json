            "answer_text": "I chose a system based on my needs. 1-It couldn't be expensive. 2-I didn't want to break holes in any walls to install it. 3-I could take it with me if and when I moved. 4- If the power was turned off for any reason the system would work on a backup battery. 5-I could activate my system from my phone if I forgot to set it when I left the house. I found that in Simplisafe. I am not promoting them and get no money for this. It was a lifesaver having moved in a building with a bunch of criminals I was afraid to leave my apartment, once I moved in and realized my dilemma. I didn't know what I would come home to. I was also afraid of being setup. Someone entering my apartment and planting some drugs to call their cop friends to bust me. God was really looking over me. The minute I got my system mailed to another address, I brought it home covered up and installed it myself . I got my system when they first came out. So I have their orginal system. The minute I went out, the manager tried to enter my apartment with a key. The alarm went off of course. The company called to ask if I needed the police. I hadn't even gotten to the corner of my block yet. I told them no. I returned to my apartment and I could feel the keyhole had jagged edges. Someone couldn't get the key out fast enough. That was all I needed to let them know. They had been on my fire escape a few times,my window there is protected with glass break and an entry sensor. I just called the police. They have even shut my power down a few times, thinking the system would go down with it. The system signaled my email and text that it was on backup battery power. Someone tried again last week. My ring doorbell 2 went out, my internetI and indoor cameras went out, but not my simplisafe. ",

            "answer_text": "Talk to an installer familiar with multiple systems. Determine what you want and need. Do you want intrusion alarm only? Fire alarm? Medical or panic alert? Carbon monoxide or gas detection, flood detection? Do you plan on it being commercial monitored at caentral station or interfaced to your smart phones or remote PC? Are you going to use internet for communications, fiber optics or copper wire phone line service, or wireless? I recommend extended battery back up if you have possible extended power outages, especially if adding optional external high power sirens (Loud and effective but power draining) Think about Camera systems inside and outside, automated home system interfacing, and electric door locks. There are so many things to think about - don't rush in and have regrets later. ",
