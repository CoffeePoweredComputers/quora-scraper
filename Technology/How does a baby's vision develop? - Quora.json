            "answer_text": "Typically pretty slowly. Shortly after birth they can detect movement, but it's nothing but a blur. Within a few weeks, they develop the ability to see more clearly between 8\u201312 inches from their face. Around a month or two, they can start tracking on slowly moving, brightly colored objects, such as a bright rattle held in front of them and slowly moved from side to side. By about 3 months, baby is typically starting to really focus on things up close, especially the faces of mom and dad, which they're able to recognize. Baby is also typically able to start searching out voices recognized and the direction they came from; like Mommy talking on the other side of the room while grandpa holds the baby\u2026. Even though they can't really see them at that age, they might turn their head to that direction. Motion is also often fascinating, at this point; my son for example, is *OBSESSED* with ceiling fans. His little jaw goes slack and he just stares and stares! Around 5 to 6 months, baby will begin to develop depth perception, and accidentally bonking their face with things will decrease! Vision will continue to develop through the next 18 months or so, and baby should topically see their optometrist the first time somewhere around 2 or 3 years (assuming there's no problem present, in which case of course get them in sooner!!)
