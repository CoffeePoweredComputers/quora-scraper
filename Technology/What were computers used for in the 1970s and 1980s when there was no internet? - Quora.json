            "answer_text": "I met my first Apple ][ in 1979. I programmed in BASIC on it to do simple tasks. There were some cool prepackaged programs, demos, and games. I spent way too much time playing Lemonade Stand and eventually games like Zork. By the time I got to high school, we had systems with dual floppy drives (170k each!) running UCSD PASCAL, writing simple physics simulations, sort/search tools, and primitive games. You could use the typical Apple, Atari, C-64, TI/99a or TRS-80 to solve programs, do calculations, make graphs (this is before graphing calculators!) You either had to write your own programs, or buy them. There were lots of cool commercial programs, but there was also \"freeware\" and \"shareware,\" where you would mail a check to thank someone for writing a program. It was not unusual to meet in groups (both formal and informal) to trade ideas, experiences, and floppies of programs, or printouts of programs that you would key in with your keyboard. Magazines would have programs you could type in to run, and sometimes you would buy a magazine with an included floppy. Magazines and mimeographed newsletters were important means of sharing information. Paper was a critical medium for exchange of information in the pre-Internet days. Small computer stores would act as meeting places for communities of enthusiasts. Physical bulletin boards would advertise scheduled meetings of user groups. There was a big overlap of computer users and amateur radio operators, too. I was not part of that overlap, but amateur radio was another medium of social information exchange on the voice bands, and eventually data exchange as packet radio started to emerge. There were dial up BBSes, but the painfully slow rates made file transfer a long, drawn out affair. And if you called a BBS, you had better be sure that BBS in your local calling zone! People would trade lists of BBS phone numbers, and I had torn out the page of my local phone book showing which numbers were free calls. I could download programs, but there much much better bandwidth carrying a box of floppies to a friend's house or to a user group meeting. You could make rudimentary databases, do some word processing, which was WAY better than using a typewriter! You could MOVE blocks of text around, and print on a \"near letter quality\" dot matrix printer. Or maybe a daisy wheel printer! You spent a lot of time reading manuals, and a lot of them were pretty well written. I really enjoyed the original AppleSoft manuals and the Commodore 64 programmer's guide. As the 80s wore on, I got graphics programs, music composition software, and increasingly sophisticated games. I started doing my school papers on a word processor and did math in software. I eventually came across the spreadsheet, CAD software and SPICE for circuit simulations. All data was saved locally. All data transfer was media exchange. By the late 1980s I started running into Token Ring and Ethernet LANs, and learned about the Internet in 1986. That's a whole other story. TL;DR: Computers were really useful without a network, but data exchange went a lot slower. Social networking was meeting your friends for Pizza and floppy disk exchanging. And you actually had to read manuals. A lot more communication was on paper than one could imagine in the modern era. ",

With Star Office, Lotus Notes, WordPerfect Works and later Microsoft Office you could type up your CV (r\u00e9sum\u00e9) apply for jobs etc. There were lots of computer magazines that came from free floppy disks and later CD-ROMs/DVDs with movie and software to try out. There was a basic internet known as the sneaker-net in America where you would swap disks with your friends (walk in your sneakers to another computer to copy or download files). There was also a proper pre-internet, internet\u2026 Bulletin Boards also know as BBS (Fidonet and Usenet). More like forums you could ask questions and look through existing questions. ",

            "answer_text": "A huge number of things.In the 1970's I worked on a computer system used to track submarines by analyzing sonar responses. At that time I built a personal machine I wrote a simple game for, and played with process control such as controlling a heating element in response to temperature changes. People were starting to buy PCs such as the Commodore PET and TRS-80 to use for word processing and to connect to bulletin board systems over 300-baud modems. It was a bit of a joke at the time, I admit, that many home PCs were bought to \"organize recipes\" and ended up gathering dust. The average dot-matrix printer did not generate as professional-looking documents as an electric typewriter, so word processing did not really take off for a few years.In the 1980's I worked at a high energy research lab. Computers had been used to calculate adjustments to the cyclotron design in the 1970's, and in the 1980's we were using computers for data acquisition and analysis as well as for document layout, PCB design and various other things. We got an internet connection around 1988 I think but we already had links between Canada and Europe over HEPNET and had been using email and network file transfers for some years. ",

If we talk about early home computers, in the early mid 80s then the main use for most was simply playing games. I personally was not that much into them and I used it mainly to write programs. In the late 80s PCs became common and they were far more capable, They could be used for things like word processing. For me spreadsheet was from the beginning as still is the most used off line program. I also got a modem early on. There were bulletin boards that one could connect. From there one could get form example free software. Also one could connect the university computer. Still long into the 90s it was not taken granted that a computer was connected to the Internet. ",

            "answer_text": "\u2018\u2026But a home computer will help me with my homework!\u201d This was the white lie every UK child in the early eighties told their parents. Thanks to a UK Government scheme to encourage computer literacy in schools, most kids had used an 8-bit computer as part of their education. The machine they had used was the BBC Micro, usually a Model B. This retailed for \u00a3325 - roughly \u00a31000 (US $1400) in today\u2019s money. I remember my junior school holding jumble sales and other charity events to help raise funds to purchase and support this technology. By today\u2019s tech standards, the machine was laughable. It featured a processor running at 2MHz and 32 kilobytes of RAM. Programs were loaded from a 5 1/4\u2033 floppy disk. These specifications were secondary really - this computer represented The Future and it encouraged a generation of kids to learn how to code. A lot of kids were not satisfied with using a microcomputer at school and wanted more - a home computer of their own. Some of the wealthier kids were able to persuade their parents to get a BBC Micro of their own. Most went for the cheaper options; a ZX Spectrum, a Commodore VIC-20 / Commodore 64, an Oric or an Acorn Electron (other brands were available). Some used them to hone their programming skills, but most just bought and played commercial games. With my brother, we owned a ZX81, an Oric-1 and a ZX Spectrum+2A. Some of the games still hold up today, thirty years on, like Lunar Jetman, Head over Heels and Chaos. True, the graphics and sound were underwhelming but the playability was certainly there. Later in the decade, many of the old BBC Model Bs found a second life as part of school LANs. This was my first experience with communication between computers. My sixth form had a simple messaging system akin to email using this network. Trust me, it was an exciting time to be alive. And finally a song by MJ Hibbett and the Validators called \u2018Hey Hey 16K\u2019. It captures the nostalgia many kids of my age have for these old 8 bit machines. And here\u2019s a scary thought. This song was recorded in 2005, some twenty years after the Heyday of the 8 bit machines. We are not that far off the 15 year anniversary of this song. Sometimes it\u2019s best not to dwell too long on the passing of time.  ",

            "answer_text": "Honestly, they didn\u2019t do much. Home computers didn\u2019t usually have disc drives and really didn\u2019t even have hard discs. Back then, home computers were curiosities and more or less game consoles. You could often buy video cartridges to put in computers to play games or load rudimentary games from tape recorders or maybe a large floppy disc if your computer had that. Towards the end of the 1980s, computers started to be able to do things like spreadsheets or word processing, so people used them to do that. It still wasn\u2019t super-common to use them for that until the 1990s or later. Some people did some programming on home computers using BASIC or something similar. A few companies sold novelty software that would seem very lame by today\u2019s standards, but seemed cool back then, because anything that could be put on a video screen that wasn\u2019t TV seemed cool. The internet didn\u2019t really become a big thing for home computers until about the middle of the 1990s. In the early 1990s, it was difficult and spotty to be able to get on-line at home. We used dial-up modems and the services didn\u2019t always get you much. By about 1995 or 1996, the internet was much more of a thing, but often people still used it in places like libraries, schools, or offices. ",

            "answer_text": "When I started this stuff in the 1980s, the computers I did most of my work with were dedicated to the access-control & perimeter alarm systems in a state penitentiary. I was also learning how to program on my own computer, mostly writing utilities and simple games. A little later in the 1980s, I started putting together databasing systems for work-order tracking for the benefit of a local service institution. Very few people at the time gave much thought to sending data to anyone else out-of-house, and the data that did get transferred was usually transferred on 8\" (later 5-1/4\") floppy disks; the post office carried special mailers for them.

The Internet back then was different - text-based, session-based.  Telnet ruled.  Muds (multi-user dungeons), BBSes, and chat rooms were the principal means of interaction.   Computers were used for the same reasons they are today - it's just the tools that were different, and more rudimentary. ",
