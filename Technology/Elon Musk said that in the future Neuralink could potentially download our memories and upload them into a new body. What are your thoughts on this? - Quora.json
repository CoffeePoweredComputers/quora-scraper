Even the protheses he is developing cannot approach the complexity of the human brain, nor give adequate insight into the physical nature of human memory. But I might imagine the development of auxiliary memory, perhaps a new kind of chip even he hasn\u2019t thought of\u2014yet. Anyone suffering from any form of brain damage might benefit from this. It wouldn\u2019t restore lost memories, but it might prevent the further loss of memory. One might even imagine enhancing someone\u2019s memory capacity so that he can instantly speed-read, with the retention quality of intensive reading. A person so enhanced would be a valuable addition to a diplomatic mission. Only one problem: Finding some poor schmuck to volunteer. ",

In order to scan memory clearly and unambiguously, man has to be converted into a robot first. Only then a reliable picture can be downloaded out of that brain. A few flying thoughts/ideas here and there will not justify such costly projects. Thanks for reading. ",
