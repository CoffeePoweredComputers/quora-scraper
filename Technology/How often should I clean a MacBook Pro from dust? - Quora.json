            "answer_text": "I actually have a cloth from a company called Radtech. It is a cloth that can go between the keyboard and the screen on my computer, and I use it when I close the computer. When I open it, I wipe the screen off quickly, since my purpose for opening the computer is not to clean it, and I get on with using it. As for the keys, and more specifically getting dust in the keys, I use an air duster to clean the keys once a month, but I utilize both to keep my computer clean. The cloth from Radtech is machine washable, but mine is usually good after going over it on both sides with a lint roller. It\u2019s a very nice cloth. ",
