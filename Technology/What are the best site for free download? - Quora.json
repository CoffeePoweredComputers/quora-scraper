            "answer_text": "You could make a downloads website for The Sims 4 content. I had thought about making one but haven\u2019t had the time. My wife loves to download custom content for The Sims 4, but she has two big problems that are not addressed by the main Sims 4 download websites: 1) Many sites host files that either contain malware or link off to other sites that have malware. Downloads on your site should be scanned with an antivirus scanner and users should be able to rate files as safe. 2) Often, when an update comes out for The Sims 4, my wife\u2019s custom content stops working or it breaks the game. Your site could allow players to rate files as being compatible with the latest update and also keep track of the files a user has downloaded and alert them when a file is no longer compatible with the game.

Once you learn how to deal with the search function, there is a wealth of things on there. I also like Project Gutenburg (Project Gutenberg Self-Publishing - eBooks) for classic and independent e-books. ",
