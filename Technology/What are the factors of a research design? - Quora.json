            "answer_text": "Research design is defined as a framework of methods and techniques chosen by a researcher to combine various components of research in a reasonably logical manner so that the research problem is efficiently handled. It provides insights about \u201chow\u201d to conduct research using a particular methodology. Every researcher has a list of research questions which need to be assessed \u2013 this can be done with research design. The sketch of how research should be conducted can be prepared using research design. Hence, the market research study will be carried out on the basis of research design. The design of a research topic is used to explain the type of research (experimental, survey, correlational, semi-experimental, review) and also its sub-type (experimental design, research problem, descriptive case-study). There are three main sections of research design: Data collection, measurement, and analysis. The type of research problem an organization is facing will determine the research design and not vice-versa. Variables, designated tools to gather information, how will the tools be used to collect and analyze data and other factors are decided in research design on the basis of a research technique is decided. An impactful research design usually creates minimum bias in data and increases trust on the collected and analyzed research information. Research design which produces the least margin of error in experimental research can be touted as the best. The essential elements of research design are: Accurate purpose statement of research designTechniques to be implemented for collecting details for researchMethod applied for analyzing collected detailsType of research methodologyProbable objections for researchSettings for research studyTimelineMeasurement of analysisResearch Design Characteristics There are four key characteristics of research design: Neutrality: The results projected in research design should be free from bias and neutral. Understand opinions about the final evaluated scores and conclusion from multiple individuals and consider those who agree with the derived results. Reliability: If a research is conducted on a regular basis, the researcher involved expects similar results to be calculated every time. Research design should indicate how the research questionscan be formed to ensure the standard of obtained results and this can happen only when the research design is reliable. Validity: There are multiple measuring tools available for research design but valid measuring tools are those which help a researcher in gauging results according to the objective of research and nothing else. The questionnaire developed from this research design will be then valid. Generalization: The outcome of research design should be applicable to a population and not just a restricted sample. Generalization is one of the key characteristics of research design. Types of Research Design A researcher must have a clear understanding of the various types of research design to select which type of research design to implement for a study. Research design can be broadly classified into quantitative and qualitative research design. Qualitative Research Design: Qualitative research is implemented in cases where a relationship between collected data and observation is established on the basis of mathematical calculations. Theories related to a naturally existing phenomenon can be proved or disproved using mathematical calculations. Researchers rely on qualitative research design where they are expected to conclude \u201cwhy\u201d a particular theory exists along with \u201cwhat\u201d respondents have to say about it. Quantitative Research Design: Quantitative research is implemented in cases where it is important for a researcher to have statistical conclusions to collect actionable insights. Numbers provide a better perspective to make important business decisions. Quantitative research design is important for the growth of any organization because any conclusion drawn on the basis of numbers and analysis will only prove to be effective for the business. Further, research design can be divided into five types \u2013 1. Descriptive Research Design: In a descriptive research design, a researcher is solely interested in describing the situation or case under his/her research study. It is a theory-based research design which is created by gather, analyze and presents collected data. By implementing an in-depth research design such as this, a researcher can provide insights into the why and how of research. 2. Experimental Research Design: Experimental research design is used to establish a relationship between the cause and effect of a situation. It is a causal research design where the effect caused by the independent variable on the dependent variable is observed. For example, the effect of an independent variable such as price on a dependent variable such as customer satisfaction or brand loyalty is monitored. It is a highly practical research design method as it contributes towards solving a problem at hand. The independent variables are manipulated to monitor the change it has on the dependent variable. It is often used in social sciences to observe human behavior by analyzing two groups \u2013 affect of one group on the other. 3. Correlational Research Design: Correlational research is a non-experimental research design technique which helps researchers to establish a relationship between two closely connected variables. Two different groups are required to conduct this research design method. There is no assumption while evaluating a relationship between two different variables and statistical analysis techniques are used to calculate the relationship between them. Correlation between two variables is concluded using a correlation coefficient, whose value ranges between -1 and +1. If the correlation coefficient is towards +1, it indicates a positive relationship between the variables and -1 indicates a negative relationship between the two variables. 4. Diagnostic Research Design: In the diagnostic research design, a researcher is inclined towards evaluating the root cause of a specific topic. Elements that contribute towards a troublesome situation are evaluated in this research design method. There are three parts of diagnostic research design: Inception of the issueDiagnosis of the issueSolution for the issue5. Explanatory Research Design: In exploratory research design, the researcher\u2019s ideas and thoughts are key as it is primarily dependent on their personal inclination about a particular topic. Explanation about unexplored aspects of a subject is provided along with details about what, how and why related to the research questions. ",

            "answer_text": "Research design is determined by your research problem/s, means that what you are going to solve in a research processWhen you talk about research design means that you plan to study about the effect of one or more variables on one or more dependent variables as a consequence of your antecedents variables.Therefore, research design is build only if your research method is experiment or an ex post facto. Those two methods require research design.If you have two independent variables which consist of two level each and its effect on one dependent variable, you can draw your design to be 2 x 2 factorial design. This could be an experiment or ex post facto.Let\u2019s take an example, supposed you want to solve whether there is a difference of students\u2019 learning outcome in statistics between those who taught by lecture +tutorial and those who taught by lecture +audio visual by controlling students self-efficacy (high and low self-efficacy), you could determine your research design, that is 2 x 2 factorial design. You are able to identify your independent variables as the main effect, lecture strategy with two level, lecture + tutorial versus lecture + audiovisual. In this case, students\u2019 self-efficacy as your simple effect which also cosist of high and low self-efficacy. So could you imagine your 2 x 2 factorial design if you want to draw it.Based on item 5 above you could formulate your research title, \u201cthe effect of lecture strategy (tutorial vs audio visual) and self-efficacy (high vs low) on students learning outcome in statistics.\u201dSupposed your research design look like item 5 above, you have to conduct several times of treatments, so you have to prepare statistical materials for two groups of tutorial and audiovisual, because you used an experiment method.An ex post facto does not need treatments, in this case, we could not be able to manipulate the independent variables, that is why it is called ex post facto means after the fact. However, both has similarity in research design, but ex post facto is used only to compare, it is called causal comparative method as well.It is not right time to distinguish conceptually between those two, but they are brothers in studying effect.
