            "answer_text": "How they became popular was because the big movie studios wanted a cheap way to distribute movies that could not be copied, as VHS tapes could be. They also wanted a way to control where their movies could be watched, so commercial DVDs are region coded, meaning an American release could not be played in Europe before the movie was released in the theatres there, or vice versa\u2026 The player technology was a minor development of the already existing CD players. Of course, it is now possible to copy DVDs at home, and the regional encryption was defeated long ago by those who want to. The same applies to Blu-Ray discs, but more recently, and partly as a result, DVDs and BluRay discs are being replaced by downloadable movies, with disc packaging often containing a link to a downloadable version of the movie.

            "answer_text": "For the \"When\" part of the question, DVD players were available under $100 by 2001. By 2003 DVD players were available for under $50, cementing their popularity among the public. As for the \"How\", I am not able to answer this part of the question. Just know that DVD technology has been in development at least a decade before DVDs were popular. ",
