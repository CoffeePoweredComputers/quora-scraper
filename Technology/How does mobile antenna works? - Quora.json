            "answer_text": "Cell phones contain at least one radio antenna in order to transmit or receive radio signals. An antenna converts an electric signal to the radio wave (transmitter) and vice versa (receiver). Some cell phones use one antenna as the transmitter and receiver while others, such as the iPhone 5, have multiple transmitting or receiving antennas. An antenna is a metallic element (such as copper) engineered to be a specific size and shape for transmitting and receiving specific frequencies of radio waves. While older generation cell phones have external or ex tractable antennas, modern cell phones contain more compact antennas inside the device thanks to advanced antenna technologies. It\u2019s important to understand that any metallic components in the device can interact with the transmission antenna and contribute to the pattern of the transmitted signal. A cell phone works as a two-way radio, consisting of a radio transmitter and a radio receiver. When you chat with your friend on your cell phone, your phone converts your voice into an electrical signal, which is then transmitted via radio waves to the nearest cell tower. The network of cell towers then relays the radio wave to your friend\u2019s cell phone, which converts it to an electrical signal and then back to sound again. In the basic form, it works just like a walkie-talkie.  ",
