            "answer_text": "Finding a manufacturer in China can seem like quite a daunting task, especially if you are doing it for the first time. Business owners who are intimidated by the enormous task at hand can take heart from (yes!) a Chinese proverb: \u201cThe journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step.\u201d This is good advice. If you break up your task into little steps and focus on each one of them at a time, you will be importing your first shipment home from China before you know it. So where do you start? You first need to build a shortlist of Chinese suppliers who manufacture the product you are looking for. Step 1: How to find a manufacturer in China The internet: The internet is the default option for many people seeking to source products from China. More than a general Google, Bing or Yahoo search, hitting B2B platforms may be more helpful. These are online sourcing platforms such as Alibaba, Global Sources and Made in China, which connect buyers to Chinese manufacturers. Step 2: Make a shortlist of suppliers/manufacturers Your initial searches will throw up a number of potential suppliers and you will need to cut this list down further. You can do this by contacting each of them, telling them your requirements such as: Details of the components you expect to manufacture \u2013 specify whether these components require die casting, metal stamping or plastic injection moulding.Your minimum order quantity or MOQ.Step 3: Verify the credentials of supplier/manufacturer  Verify the credentials of supplier/manufacturer You now need to verify their credentials. While some obvious information is available online and they may have supplied you with some information too, you need to evaluate: 1. \tWhether they are indeed the factory and not a middleman. 2. \tWhether they have the technical expertise and production capability to deliver what they say they can deliver. Knowing which Chinese region specialises in the product you want manufactured is also one way of weeding out resellers from manufacturers. For instance, die casting and plastic molding manufacturers are found in great numbers in Zhejiang province. So, if you find that a supplier is based in another province, that company is more likely to be a reseller than a manufacturer and you may want to drop that name from your list.  FINALLY, DO YOU ALREADY KNOW WHAT YOU WANT TO OUTSOURCE? This information written is made with the assumption that you have already identified what component or part you want outsourced. *** Full disclosure, this response is parts of an excerpt from an article that I had previously written. Made sense to just copy some points from there since it was addressing pretty much the core of the question here. ",
