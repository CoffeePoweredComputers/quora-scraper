            "answer_text": "Without any doubt, FAST-NU Lahore is far better than COMSATS Lahore in terms of syllabus, facilities, teachers and job opportunities. COMSATS\u2019 reputation has been in a decline in recent past years. Its dual degree program was cancelled by the Higher Education Commission [src] and recently their faculty was on a strike [src]. This resulted in a lot of frustration in students and they had to face a lot of problems. Their teachers aren't that famous and the only pro of being a COMSIAN is that their research is among top ranked universities of Pakistan. FAST-NUCES on the other hand had no major bad news. Their faculty just got better, their library got renovated, and their reputation is getting better day-by-day. I've been studying in FAST for 3 years and I've already studied 3\u20134 courses from Stanford and Purdue University graduates. Getting a job is also very easy. I got my first internship after just 4 semesters and now I'm doing another internship after six semesters. FAST-NU alumni are highly regarded in the industry. One major difference is the standard of marking between the two institutes. FAST-NUCES makes it very hard for students to survive while its relatively very easy to get marks in COMSATS. In the long run, FAST prepares its students for the software industry in a very rigorous way and it has proven to be beneficial for the FASTians. ",

            "answer_text": "Without any doubt FAST is better than COMSATS when it comes to Computer Science. Both the university offers quality education of Computer Science but FAST provides you more exposure. The students studying in FAST are given more tough time. COMSATS University will allow you to do more self learning. COMSATS University is the leading IT university of Pakistan so, if you would be able to secure your seat in any of the above mentioned university then you are all set. In my opinion only FAST Lahore and FAST Islamabad is better in CS. If you are choosing between COMSATS Islamabad and FAST Peshawar then choose COMSATS Islamabad. ",
