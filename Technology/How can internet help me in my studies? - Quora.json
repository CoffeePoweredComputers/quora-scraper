            "answer_text": "Personally, apart from classes I do a lot of self learning from internet. If some concepts aren\u2019t clear from class, I come back and check some videos on YouTube. There is this MIT OpenCourseWare, popularly known as MIT OCW, where you get videos and lecture materials for many courses. Apart from MIT, many other prestigious institutes have open coursewares where you can find lecture materials and video lectures which can be of great help during examinations. I learnt major part of my first year portion from these online material. If you are interested in a particular topic and want to learn more from that field, you can dig in some journals, research articles. There are many sites where you can enroll in online courses, be it any field. These sites help you increase your understanding of your subjects. If you want to learn a completely new subject, you can go ahead and do that. So, internet has lot to offer and how much you would want to use is in your hands. Cheers ",
