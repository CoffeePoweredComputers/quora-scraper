            "answer_text": "I know a secret that could destroy the entire world as we know it, if it got out and people became aware of it, and acted on it. Read on only if you\u2019re willing to share this knowledge\u2026 The secret is that money is created out of thin air, by special people. It\u2019s willed into existence. It\u2019s something of absolute and universal value, produced from absolutely nothing. Thus, it\u2019s magic, strong magic. Money is magic. The people who make it are magicians. They have cast a spell on the world by writing special occult symbols on pieces of paper. By this device, they have come to own and control essentially everything. This would make \u201ccreate money\u201d the most powerful magical spell ever cast, I suppose. The world isn\u2019t run by politicians, it\u2019s run by money magicians, who can buy and sell the politicians. The money magicians begin by making money out of thin air, as much as they wish. They loan it out, always asking interest in return. By further magical techniques with ledgers, and lately, computers, they then loan out many multiples of whatever amount of money they have, collecting interest on all of it. And then, everybody else in the whole world spends their entire lives working and chasing and attempting to accumulate this money, borrowing enough to be be able to live and do something, someday, hopefully. Some succeed; most don\u2019t. That\u2019s built into the structure of the game. It\u2019s a rigged game. Because the money is lent upon interest, and must be repaid with more money, also borrowed at interest, the debt is mathematically unrepayable, exponentially growing. By manipulating cash flows, credit, and interest rates, those who create and control money can control everything and everyone. They\u2019ve done so, and they\u2019ve used their power to enrich the richest, and impoverish the rest. They apparently believe it\u2019s in their interest to have everyone poorly educated, deep in debt, without resources, and thus forced into servitude of some sort, either military or corporate, or else the gulag. The power of money creation is obviously the greatest power on Earth, when money can buy anything. Being able to create money is an almost Godlike power; imagine having your own printing press. Why, you could take over the world! Hmm\u2026 We think of ourselves as being rational today, of not believing in God-Kings or Divine Monarchs. But why, rationally, do we allow a tiny group of people to hold essentially absolute power over everyone else, to very literally own the world and all of its important institutions? Why can these special people create money and loan it out, when nobody else can? What gives them the (Divine?) right? We know that societies are happiest, most stable, and most abundant when wealth inequalities are minimized. Why, then, do we continue to participate in systems that serve to maximize wealth inequalities? There\u2019s no reason that it has to be this way. We fought against a central bank for a hundred years, and then in 1913 we finally got one. We promptly had the crisis that the bank was supposedly there to avert. In the intervening time, our money has lost 97% of its value. We\u2019re mired in enormous debt, and there are no provisions for periodic forgiveness like a Jubilee year, a Biblical tradition oddly forgotten by many otherwise-religious folks. So this debt is forever, a crushing multi-generational burden. Many Americans are suffering in real poverty, while a few individuals and corporations get grotesquely rich. Why are we allowing this? And why did it happen in the first place? The answer is simple and ugly: Because those at the top of the system are not pursuing rational, benevolent, or wise courses of action. They are not representing the interests of the people, nor the environment. Their policies serve simply to enrich and protect those who are able to buy access to politicians. It\u2019s corruption-as-institution. It\u2019s not necessarily that they\u2019re personally evil people, but the effects of the system on the environment and the majority of humans are pretty evil, so it\u2019s an evil system, formally. The situation is ridiculous, just absurd. Money is the most important thing on earth for most people, because most people lack the money to get what they need, let alone what they want. Meanwhile, a select few get to create their own money, and use it to buy anything and everything. I guess it\u2019s just too large for most people to notice. But it\u2019s eaten us all, it\u2019s consuming the planet and everyone on it, and we really need to see why this is happening. Even if you\u2019re enthusiastic about capitalism and competition and free markets, any ideas about a \u201clevel playing field\u201d are made meaningless when one group can create money and collect interest, while everyone else must borrow money and pay interest. Obviously, in the long run, the only winners in that situation will be the banker magicians, and in fact that\u2019s what\u2019s happened. I guess they\u2019re counting on people just not noticing, or not being able to do anything about it if they do. So far that\u2019s worked. But maybe not forever\u2026 When enough people realize that we\u2019re playing an un-winnable game, a rigged game, that we\u2019ve been played for suckers, we\u2019ll quit playing. When people realize that we\u2019ve been put under a spell, we can break it. When people realize that we can build alternative systems, we\u2019ll do it. And then, the entire world as we know it will end, incrementally or perhaps suddenly replaced by a much better, happier, healthier one. Maybe we can all be money magicians, and allocate the power of money creation to each person individually, rather than a central bank. Why not? And if they could bail out Wall Street with trillions, we can certainly transfer a similar amount to Main Street, for starters\u2026 Let\u2019s say every American has a certain amount every year to create and spend, loan, invest, whatever. No central bank, just democratic money creation. If we did that, along with cutting our enormous \u201cdefense\u201d budget down to a reasonable size for national defense rather than international domination, we could have a rich, happy, prosperous nation. We can build whatever kind of systems we want, whatever we can believe in and imagine. We can build a better world, and we should. People are so cynical, probably as a defense against so much misery, a defense against being hurt by another crushed hope, but we can make so many things so much better so easily, and we will. It\u2019s time for an evolution; it\u2019s already underway. That\u2019s very dangerous to the \u201cpowers that be\u201d but unless they flow with the tide of history, they\u2019ll be swept away. For the rest of us, there\u2019s a whole new world waiting to be built. ",

            "answer_text": "I joined this startup where I am working currently on 1st January 2018. I was expecting a bitter cold, it was frosty chilling. So cutting freezing in my airy room that for 2 months I just did too and fro from the office. It was almost mid-Feb and my first salary was yet to be credited. In no case, I should have opted to spend my 75% of the first salary on living. Rent, deposit and even BROKERAGE, I really regret that money spent. Why did I do so? Because there was a group of college FRIENDS coming by and I needed to shift to a flat. Although my salary didn\u2019t allow it, I did so. Why? Because of FRIENDS\u2026  I was a Dota freak (an online multiplayer video game) for the past three years. Whenever I tried removing Dota from my life Youtube helped me get back. I never thought I would stop playing that game. But I did, why? Because of FRIEND. My credential on some of the answers of Dota speaks \u201cPlayed 7000 hours in less than 3 years\u201d. I was that crazy for that game, I casually played 40\u201350 hours in 2 weeks. In the college, the counter was 100\u2013150 hours in 2 weeks. But now that counter is zero. Why? Because of FRIEND.  I started writing on Quora out of nowhere. I never thought anyone would read my writing. My writing always had bad comments from my English teacher, neither did I put in efforts to improve it. I accepted the fact that my English is bad and let it be that way. But I started writing on Quora. Why? Because of FRIEND. I many times thought to stop writing on Quora after getting no views and upvotes. But I didn\u2019t because of some FRIENDS told me I write well. Now I am writing this answer on FRIENDS.  My office working hours are flexible but I need to be present there 6 days a week to clock the weekly hours. There is no provision for weekends. But still, I manage to party 4\u20135 times a week, sometimes even 7 days a week. Why? Because of FRIENDS How is it possible? With FRIENDS They can make you do things you don\u2019t want, things you never thought, things you never planned and even the things you never desire. They are dangerous but at the same time, they are helpful. They are medicine for the wounded heart and vitamin for the hopeful soul. They are the people you can share your secrets with, cry with, laugh with, and have fun with. They don\u2019t try to change or judge you. They accept you the way you are. The hard times reveals the best ones of them. Keep them safely in your life. They are the siblings God never gave us. They are our chosen family. They are Friends\u2026 ",
