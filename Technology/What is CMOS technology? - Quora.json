            "answer_text": "CMOS is an acronym for Complementary Metal Oxide Semiconductor. CMOS integrated circuits incorporate both P-type and N-type MOS transistors on the same die. It does so by using a P substrate and cutting in sections that are highly N-doped.  This is a highly simplistic picture that has a lot of physical problems like Latchup:  A real good CMOS process would use some kind of physical isolation between the NMOS and PMOS sections, usually by etching a trench between them. CMOS is considered the most useful technology for digital circuits because of its low power leakage -- that is, current only needs to flow in the circuit when a value switches from 0 to 1 or 1 to 0. Here's an NMOS NOT gate:  When it is \"0,\" it is continuously drawing current from Vcc and therefore sucking out power. For CMOS, it doesn't draw any current (except transistor leakage) when the 1 or 0 is stable.   CMOS is also useful in image sensors, but probably not the best imaging technology.  It is widely used in imaging because it allows for easy fabrication of the image sensor on the same chip as the circuit that transfers the image data to a processor or into memory. ",

            "answer_text": "Complimentary Metal Oxide Semiconductor is termed as CMOS. CMOS Technology use both PMOS and NMOS transistor i)PMOS(Positive Metal Oxide Semiconductor)  ii)NMOS(Negative Metal Oxide Semiconductor)  Cmos circuits use a combination of PMOS and NMOS transistors to implement logic gates and other digital circuits found in computers, telecommunication equipment, and signal processing equipment. CMOS has characteristics very close to that of an ideal logic family. An ideal logic family should dissipate no power, should have zero propagation delay, controlled rise and fall times, and have good noise immunity. NMOS and PMOS transistors are not ideal switches. NMOS pass strong \u20180\u2019 but a degraded or weak \u20181\u2019 (pull no higher than VDD-Vtn); whereas PMOS pass strong \u20181\u2019 but a degraded or weak \u20180\u2019 (pull no lower than |Vtp|). Hence, NMOS is best for pull-down network, whereas PMOS are best for pull-up network. For more details contact us:93844 09662 #Vlsi training center #vlsi Training center in Chennai ",
