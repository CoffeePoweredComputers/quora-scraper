            "answer_text": "As a modern country Armenia is young. On September 21, 1991 Armenia held a referendum and majority of people voted in favor of independence from USSR. This young Republic was the successor of the first Armenian Republic which was formed in 1918 may 28 and later had been incorporated into the Soviet Union as Soviet Socialist Republic of Armenia. As you can see the third Republic of Armenia has a history of 28 years. However Armenia as a national and cultural entity has a history which dates back to around 4000 years before us. The formation of Armenians started since II millenium B.C and lasted more than thousand years. Several ethnic groups and tribes lived in Armenian highlands, some of which managed to unify and form states and kingdoms. The unification of Armenians was complete in the era of Urartian Kingdom, under which all the tribes and ethnic groups of the Armenian highland were unified under one state. The Urartu kingdom lasted for about 400 years (XI-VI B.C). Shortly after the collapse of this country, Ervanduni or Orontid dynasty(570\u2013 201 B.C) of Armenia was formed marking the beginning of a country called Armenia. The first ever mention about Armenia in any historical source is in the inscription of Persian king Darius I. There have been quite a few versions about the origination of Armenians and Armenia but only one of them is officially accepted and proved. It is that Armenians are native to this land and have gone a long process of becoming a unique ethnic group! There are also a few legends about the origination of Armenians. The most famous one of them is Hayk and Bell. According to history of Movses Khorenatsi (5th century), when Babylonian tyrant Bell became the king and he was very arrogant and oppressive Hayk decided to take his family and move to a country called Ararad. Bell attempts to bring him back and marches his forces to where Hayk was located. During the decisive battle Bell gets killed and Hayk stays in a place which later is being called after him, Hayq or Hayastan (Armenia).  This sums up the entire history of ancient Armenia and it is mentioned in very old historical sources. Conclusion: Yes, Armenia is an old country but the current Republic is still young.
