            "answer_text": "I am an iPhone 7Plus user and also a Samsung Note 8 user. This is the result of photos from each camera. Conditions: auto shooting, the results are not reset at all. Iphone camera results  This one is the Samsung Note 8 camera  I am a layman of photography techniques let alone the technical analysis of the results of the photo shoot. But you can easily see the difference between the two cameras. Pay attention to the top forto the lamp (Iphone) vs the bottom photo (Samsung). Visible Iphone catches light in the dark. The results of the iPhone light as broken and spread. Samsung light is controlled, according to the original situation, does not break and spread.Grass element. Details on the Iphone are not visible. At Samsung more visible.The wall (on the left), on the Iphone light like under, the wall details are not visible. At Samsung the wall details are more visible.The rest please analyze it yourself. For me, the angels also know, Samsung is the champion. Note: Not advertising is not magic. Just often annoyed on Iphone fans. I love your Apple products. Macbook Pro laptop, use iPad Air, use Apple TV, Samsung only Note 8. But if you have to choose for shooting, choose Samsung. During the day, the iPhone and Samsung photo results are relatively balanced. thank you ",

            "answer_text": "Your statement is incorrect. iPhone smartphone cameras are not the \u201cbest\u201d when tested by the experts at DXOMARK. However they are good, and easy to use, and the camera doesn\u2019t make many mistakes. If the photos look better to your eyes, I can\u2019t argue that point. However, I\u2019ve got an old $200 point and shoot camera that will blow every smartphone camera out of the water. In my opinion, all this quibbling and discussions about which smartphone camera is better is a huge time waster. If you want pretty pictures, buy a real camera. If you want to fuck around with a selfie stick, keep your smartphone. ",
