            "answer_text": "With the resources and skills available the Incans had developed the technology to communicate to different parts of the empire using strings and build walls which did not need mortar to hold them together. Stone Masonry: The Incans were known for their skills as stone masons. Their buildings were built using precisely cut rocks which were placed so precisely that no mortar were needed.    Today their ruins withstand the earthquakes that topple modern buildings. Yet this was achieved using stone hammers for cutting and sand for polishing. In their palaces the kings could enjoy stone baths into which the water from mountain springs was channeled. Quipu: The Incans did not have a writing system to send messages to the other parts of the empire. Instead they used Quipus, which is a coloured, spun and piled thread or string with knots.    A quipu could have a few cords to up to 2000 cords. The length of the cord, the colour and position of the strings and knots conveyed the message to the Incan record keepers. Quipus were used convey the information about census, taxation and other administrative and commercial purposes to the king even from the parts of the empire with a different language precisely. ",
