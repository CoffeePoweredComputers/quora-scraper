            "answer_text": "They don\u2019t, for the part - they protect against radioactive contamination. I have a rock that\u2019s radioactive - the radioactivity is an inherent property of the rock. The alpha radiation mostly doesn\u2019t even escape from the mineral crystals - it just can\u2019t penetrate very far into matter. The beta radiation can penetrate most of the anti-contamination clothing (what you\u2019re calling the \u201cradiation suit\u201d but it only penetrates about a half inch or less into tissue. And the gamma radiation will only be stopped by lead - and, trust me, we don\u2019t encase people in lead to protect them from gamma radiation! OK - if I take that rock and grind it up I now have radioactive powder, and if I sprinkle that powder onto my kitchen counter I\u2019ll be able to measure radioactivity on the counter top. My counter has not become radioactive - it has become contaminated - just as my skin doesn\u2019t become radioactive if I smear some of the radioactive rock powder into my skin. Covering the counter top - or my skin - will keep the contamination off. That\u2019s the purpose of the anti-contamination clothing. The reason for trying to keep contamination off of the skin is to reduce radiation dose to the skin from contamination. But, more importantly, it helps to keep contamination off the workers\u2019 hands - this, in turn, keeps them from transferring contamination to food, other objects, other people, and so forth.  Here\u2019s a police officer dressed in his protective gear at the 20-km line around the Fukushima reactor site. And - lest you nitpick - he\u2019s 20 km from the site and they had to dress out thousands of cops; given that, they did a good job. (My photo) ",

            "answer_text": "A \u201cradioactive suit\u201d, i.e., a suit that is radioactive, sure wouldn\u2019t. Presumably you mean a radiation protection suit. And mostly, they don\u2019t either. The suits you see people wearing (mostly in movies, since most of us, I hope, never have the occasion to see this in real life) are mostly to prevent the wearer from being contaminated with radioactive material\u2014to keep them from inhaling or accidentally ingesting radioactive matter (especially in dust form) or getting it on their skin. They actually do very little to protect from dangerous radiation: if you stood next to a cobalt-60 source wearing such a suit, the difference in the dose you\u2019d get versus standing there stark naked would barely be measurable. They will stop alpha particles (but so does your outer skin) and attenuate beta radiation somewhat, but generally not enough to be useful. You can get protective gear lined or impregnated with lead, which are some use against gamma and x-rays, but a suit with enough lead to protect you in a Chernobyl-type situation would be too heavy to move in. Or, in a situation where you only had to worry about neutron radiation, you could wear a boron-impregnated suit and get substantial protection, but I can\u2019t think of any such situation that would be likely to occur in real live. No, the point of those suits is to make sure that when you leave the radioactive area, you leave the radioactivity behind and don\u2019t carry it with you, continuing to expose yourself and others. In particular, preventing you from inhaling or ingesting radioactive dust or gases is important: for alpha and beta radiation in particular, it is much worse to have them inside you than just being around them.
