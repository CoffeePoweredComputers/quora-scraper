            "answer_text": "Xiaomi HRX Edition is the best fitness tracker Mi Band - HRX Edition (Black) 1. TRACK YOUR DAILY PHYSICAL ACTIVITY Right. Er\u2026 so, what is the purpose of tracking your steps, your sleeping hours, your calories burned, etc.? To me, the only purpose is to gather data. The Mi Band \u2013 or any fitness band \u2013 provides such data for you to understand what your body has been doing all day long. If you set a workout goal, such data is important, but if setting workout goal is a critical purpose for a fitness band, you would probably have bought a more expensive brand. So, speaking for the rest of the general public who is willing to pay only 1299rs for a fitness gadget, this band will capture data of your body activity.  One aspect of tracking that may interest some of you is sleep tracking. Mi Band magically detects whether you are in deep sleep, light sleep, or awake. Of course, it\u2019s all based on the movement detection on the Mi Band. So if you tend to move your hands during sleep, the Mi Band detects as light sleep. Whatever the case, it offers an insight on how you sleep at night, whether you toss and turn regularly or sleep like a log. 2. MORNING ALARM This is my FAVOURITE feature for any activity tracker (and it\u2019s probably just me). Mi Band wakes me up subtly by vibrating on my wrist. It does not disturb my wife, it does not irritate me with an audible alarm which I need to reach out to deactivate. In the event that I snoozed the alarm and got up of the bed, I do not have to worry about forgetting to turn off the snooze alarm on my phone sitting next to my bed. Even if the alarm goes off on the Mi Band, it is with me, inaudibly vibrating. And since the Mi Band is waterproof, I could disable it even with wet fingers. 3. SMARTPHONE INTEGRATION For non-Xiaomi phone users, the Mi Band vibrates when there are incoming calls. For Xiaomi phone users, the Mi Band can auto-unlock if the phone is within proximity. And without a display screen, the Mi Band is very limited in displaying smartphone information as some other activity trackers could do. 4. BATTERY LIFE This is probably the strongest reason for getting a Mi Band. The battery life is 30 days, so you literally wear and forget that it\u2019s a piece of battery-operated gadget. This is unlike most other fitness bands where you need to charge once every few days. Besides, there is nothing to fiddle with on the Mi Band, unlike other fitness bands where you can press buttons to see display information. So you literally wear and forget about it, allowing the Mi Band to track your activity without distractions. 5. CUSTOMISATION The Mi Band device is actually very small, and so you can actually customize with color straps or pendant holders so you are not limited to wearing on your wrists. You could even clip it on your keychain for those who dislike wearing the band. 6. PRICE Xiaomi has once again made a tech product so affordable that everyone can own one. Need a cheap but good ",

            "answer_text": "There are many kinds of fitness trackers, their functions are roughly the same, but the price is very different. As a Mi fan, I first want to recommend the Mi smart wearable device. The newly upgraded Miband 5 released in 2020.06.11 is a good choice. The price is less than $50, hardware upgrade, sensor accuracy increased by 50%, sleep monitoring accuracy improved by 40%. Can better track your physical condition, support 11 exercise modes, including rowing machine, rope skipping, yoga and other indoor exercises.  Health The Xiaomi Mi Band 5 has introduced more health-related features. It improves sleep monitoring accuracy, including irregular and sporadic sleep patterns, and supports a 24-hour heart rate monitoring function. To solve the sub-optimal health issues in modern life, the Band 5 has built-in Personal Activity Intelligence, Activity Index, which allows people to calculate the levels of their heart rate using a specific algorithm and can provide users with helpful information to aid in exercises and workouts. With the newly added women\u2019s health mode, it can be a good fitness tracker choice for female users. Battery Life The Mi Band\u2019s super long battery life has attracted many people to choose Xiaomi\u2019s fitness tracker among so many smart wearable brands. The new Mi Smart Band 5 adopts a brand new charging solution \u2013 magnetic snap-on charger, so users can simply charge the band without removing the strap, which is more convenient than the previous capsule charger. With a 135 mAh battery, the Mi Band 4 can last for up to 20 days. However, to power the larger, brighter screen and new features, the Mi Band 5 NFC version only supports 14 days of continuous usage.
