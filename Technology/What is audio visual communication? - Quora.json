            "answer_text": "In a very simple definition, AV communication is the use of a medium which combines audio and visual content with the purpose of transmitting a certain information to the audience. All sorts of videos (movies, YouTube videos, etc\u2026) transmit a certain message, no matter how relevant, big/small, good/bad it is, you receive some kind of information through them. And that\u2019s a beautiful and exciting part of communication! Combining sound with image gives you such a range of messages you can transmit! Just imagine how it would feel if you were seeing that Titanic scene where Jack holds Rose on the prow of the ship, and throughout, clown music was playing! All of the power and emotional charge the scene had would be destroyed, and a whole new message would be transmitted to the audience! Audiovisual communication is a beautiful and super fertile field of investigation and testing. Through it you can convey just about all kinds of messages, since it is the one of the most complete areas of communication! I hope i was accurate enough and helpful! ",
