            "answer_text": "It really depends on the parents. Screen time recommendations for children in that age range suggest that children should have no more than two hours of screen time a day. If the child has been at home watching television or playing computer games all afternoon, and then the parents hand them a phone or tablet to get them through dinner at a restaurant, that\u2019s obviously not best practice. But, if the parent rarely allows the child to have screen time, it might be okay to hand the child the phone while waiting for a doctor\u2019s appointment, or on a long car trip. Bottom line: it\u2019s up to the parents to monitor. What we see in public is a snapshot in time. It may - or may not - be reflective of the child\u2019s (or the parent\u2019s) everyday habits. If my son or daughter was about to have a meltdown in a public place, and I knew handing them my phone would prevent an outburst, you can bet that I would do it (unless the meltdown was a tantrum in response to being told \u2018no\u2019 to the phone). Sometimes, as a parent, you just have to do what will get you through until bedtime. Parenting is difficult. It\u2019s made worse by the feeling that others are watching us and judging us on our decisions. ",

            "answer_text": "I would say no. I think that you should have a collection of kids videos that reinforce your values. Don\u2019t just plop them down in front of broadcast/cable TV without supervision because you never know what trash might come up next. Even the videos should be used with caution. The better choice is to get toys that will stimulate their imagination and creativity. But I do understand that there is probably going to be that one time a day when you need a quick fix of peace.
