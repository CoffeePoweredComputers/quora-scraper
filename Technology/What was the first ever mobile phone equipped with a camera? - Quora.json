            "answer_text": "Arguably, the first mobile phone equipped with a camera was a 1997 Motorola Startac that Phillipe Kahn equipped with a camera--Meet the Man Behind the Very First Camera Phone--however this wasn't a commercially available phone. The Samsung SCH-V200 released in June 2000 had a built in camera, but the camera was separate from the phone's network access, so you had to connect it to a computer to get to the photos.  The first cameraphone where the camera could send pictures across the cellular network was the Sharp J-SH04 released in November 2000 (marketed as J-Phone). http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/1550622.stm ",
