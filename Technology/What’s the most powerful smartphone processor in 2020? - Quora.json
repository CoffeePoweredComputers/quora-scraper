            "answer_text": "There is no doubt that the year 2020 has been the year of and for 5G chipset. We have witnessed the almost every single brand come up with their own 5G chipset, marking their footing in the race. With the changing trends in the markets, and with the emergence of the 5G spectrum since last year, there has been a huge inflow of smartphone chipsets from key competitors in the market. While we talk of powerful processors of 2020, one has to mention a few obvious ones, however instead of doing that, I would just put forward one such chipset that in my opinion is the fastest one of all.  In terms of iOS, there is of course Apple\u2019s Bionic A13 chipset as well as Bionic A14. Although the reason behind not choosing the Apple processor as the fastest is because the number of Apple users are fairly lesser than the number of Android users and that does make a difference. At the same time there is also Huawei HiSilicon 990 which could be taken as one of the options however, there is also a better option than that one. Like all the other brands, MediaTek too came up with its first-ever 5G chipset in the name of MediaTek Dimensity 1000 in the end of 2019 and up till now it has added 4 new chipsets to the Dimensity series. While all the 5G processors are extremely powerful, the fastest processor was launched just a few months back in the name of Dimensity 1000 Plus. Dimensity 1000 Plus is an octa-core chipset with four Cortex A-77 cores and four Cortex A-55 cores. It is built on 7nm process, which helps in the efficiency level of the smartphone. the Dimensity Plus supports up to 144Hz refresh rate, which is almost 2.4 times faster per second than an ordinary 60Hz display. This particular feature that been one of the most talked about feature of the Dimensity 1000 Plus. With 144Hz refresh rate, users can enjoy lag-free experience. To boost this up, the Dimensity 1000 Plus also incorporates the Nubia Red Magic 5G that sports the 144Hz display.  The battery efficiency of the chipset is better than many others that are available due to its new battery-saving technology as well as integrated nature. This chipset is capable of adjusting the modem\u2019s power configuration and operating frequency as per network conditions and user activities that results in saving battery life. The SoC is capable of switching between 4G and 5G networks automatically based on application needs. There is Rapid Response Engine which guarantees lag-free gaming experience and also ensures Bluetooth or Wi-Fi transmission simultaneously with no hiccups or strains whatsoever. The Dimensity 1000 Plus also encompasses the HyperEngine 2.0 technology which augments the smartphone to deliver a smooth, immersive gaming experience. This include resource management engine that ensures game performance fluidity with minimal power consumption by managing CPU, GPU and memory resourced.  It also comes packed with the latest MiraVision technology, which is designed to improve per frame picture quality. It uses the integrated APU 3.0 to adjust per frame contrast and delivers better picture quality of 4K content in real-time. It is rumored that MiraVision Picture Quality Engine enables pictures with 4K content which is better than the standard HDR10+. Therefore, MediaTek Dimensity 1000+ can definitely be considered as the fastest processor of 2020. However what we know of this chipset is just through its scores and statistics, therefore we would just have to wait to witness this chipset in action. ",

            "answer_text": "When talking about a powerful smartphone processor, there are various factors that we need to keep in mind. Many people believe that the fastest smartphone processors have the best AnTuTu or Geekbench scores, others believe in the CPU structure and CPU clock speed with RAM speed and many other people believe the most in the real world performances since there are many processors which promise quite a lot on papers but they turn out something really different in the real world. For instance, you would have heard about Snapdragon 865 processor and would have also heard that Google and LG made a statement about not using this smartphone chipset in any of their future smartphones? What was the reason to this?  Well, Snapdragon 865 made too many promises on the papers and after it came as a successor to Snapdragon 855+, people presumed to be the best in the business on their own. However, when it actually reached the smartphones, it is then that the people realized what it was actually about. The Snapdragon 5G series chipsets from Qualcomm are devoid of any integrated modem and they need to use an external modem for the 5G support. No doubt, this is one of the major disadvantages of the smartphone processors and Snapdragon 865 is not spared from this. But this is not the only reason whey Snapdragon 865 was rejected by these world-class smartphone manufacturers. No integrated modem means less download and upload speed in the smartphone as compared to the one with an integrated modem and an integrated modem has several other advantages as well.  In fact, the Snapdragon 865 was found to be notorious for its battery drainage issues and its heating problems are not hidden from the world, now that it is a part of several smartphones. And this is not just it. With Snapdragon 865, Qualcomm made it necessary for the users to keep connected on the 5G mode, as there was no support for 4G only mode, even if 5G network has still not reached your country. In such a case, connectivity issues are quite obvious and while Snapdragon 855+ was good at least with its 4G connectivity, Snapdragon 865 has made it worse and until there is no 5G network, you would always face some kind of connectivity issues. Due to this, if you are under a misconception that high AnTuTu scores would always translate to similar, high rear world performances, Snapdragon 865 is enough to prove you wrong. Yes, this smartphone processor costs high and has great performances as well, but at such a high cost, you would not love to bring such disadvantages home, especially when you can have better chipsets at lesser costs.  Talking about the iOS users, they surely have Apple\u2019s Bionic A13 as the best chipset they wish for soon, there would be Bionic A14 chipset as well. However, the Android smartphone owners, which are much higher in number than iOS users need something good for their smartphones and Snapdragon 865 might be good on papers but it cannot be trusted at a high cost with so many disadvantages against their name. So what should the Android users trust? You have two very good options and these are Huawei HiSilicon Kirin 990 and MediaTek Dimensity 1000 Plus. And I would still not suggest Samsung Exynos 990 processor as this has also not got good reviews from the users. But if you need to choose the best one between MediaTek Dimensity 1000 Plus and Kirin 990, you need to compare their specifications. And on comparing the specifications, MediaTek Dimensity 1000 Plus appears a much better option for the smartphone with its new specifications, especially the enhanced refresh rate and the gaming technology etc. The CPU of this smartphone processor too is good enough.  So I can suggest MediaTek Dimensity 1000 Plus as the best smartphone processor for the users and this appears the most powerful one as well. However, as this is not a part of any smartphone still, I think we need to wait for the real world reviews of this smartphone processor. After viewing the worst with a chipset like Snapdragon 865, we cannot believe anything from just its specifications on papers. ",
