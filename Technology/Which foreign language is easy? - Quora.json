            "answer_text": " According to the chart above most Western European languages are the easiest. If you are looking to learn a language that is both useful and easy, Spanish is by far the best option for you. Dutch and Spanish are probably the easiest languages for native English speakers to learn, but Dutch isn\u2019t particularly useful so Spanish would be your best bet. French and Portuguese are also up there in terms of usefulness and ease of learning. Speaking from experience Spanish and German are pretty easy. German is considered more difficult to learn than Spanish, but that\u2019s because of the grammar. German pronunciation and writing are incredibly easy for a native English speaker. In fact, I haven\u2019t studied German in a couple years but I can still understand most of what someone is saying if they speak German to me. Since it is so closely linked to English it sounds more familiar, and therefore you can pick out individual words easier. The infographic below depicts Medium difficulty languages and hard languages.  I don\u2019t have a lot of experience with the medium difficulty languages, but I have studied Japanese and Chinese and I can tell you they are a lot harder than Spanish and German. With Spanish I was able to have conversations after only a couple months of studying. With Chinese it took almost a year just to put together easy sentences, and it took even longer to understand what everyone was saying. They say it takes 2,200 hours to learn one of the \u201chard\u201d languages and I\u2019d say thats probably pretty accurate. Chinese itself is actually not that hard, the only thing that makes it hard are the tones and characters. Grammar in Chinese is remarkably simple. Japanese, on the other hand, is easily the most difficult language on the list(and probably the most difficult major language in the world. It has 3 writing systems(4 if you count romaji), they have characters and each one has multiple pronounciations based on the situation. The entire language changes depending on who you are talking to(your boss verses your brother will yield very different results). I\u2019ve studied a good number of languages but Japanese is definitely the hardest. ",

            "answer_text": "Honestly, it heavily depends on your mother tongue and how often will you be in touch with that particular language. For example, as a Chinese, we will find Japanese pretty easy to learn, not only because we are heavily influenced by Japanese culture, since Japanese\u2019s Kanji (literally Chinese words, when translated) directly borrows a ton of words from the Chinese word base, most of them have very similar, if not identical meanings to their Chinese counterparts with similar pronunciation, their usage of certain connectives are also very similar to Chinese (say, \u306e no and \u3082 mo, are the same as \u7684 (one\u2019s) and \u548c/\u8207(and or with, depending on context) in Chinese). Even we understand nothing from the hiragana text, we can guess it simply from the Kanji or guess from the prononciation of Katagana. Japanese is also a sort of an in-between of English and Chinese in terms of grammar and sentence structure, hence for most Chinese who\u2019ve studied Chinese and English previously, Japanese is relatively easy to handle since it wouldn\u2019t take long to master a language with similar structures and even words. We will, however, suffer big time if we were to learn something not similar to English (which is the language we usually learn other than Chinese compulsorily), such as French, Russian and even Arabic. Take German as an example, although it is also a Germanic language similar to English, the wordings and sentence structures are like night and day compared to Chinese, not to mention there is a ton of infinitives which changes according to the subject, along with tonnes of plurals which are generally unique on their own, which doesn\u2019t even exist in Chinese. This is also true for others that originate from other countries, as shifting to a foreign communication system which has little relation to another would be very taxing, as you will require more imagination (in other words, \u2018bridging\u2019 of neurones) to memorise certain words.
