You have only two options. Either borrow one from a friend or buy one. Well\u2026 you can always try to find a VCR rental store. VCR Player rental I am sure you will have a great difficulty finding one but, who knows, maybe you are lucky and you have one just around the corner. How do VHS players work? ",

            "answer_text": "They make an adapter that will make VHS-C tapes playable in a regular VCR.  Or they did.... it looks like a VHS tape, and you insert the VHS-C.  If you can find one, use that to play the tape on a regular VCR.  You can buy a VCR at Goodwill for next to nothing.  Another thought is to put an ad on Craigslist and offer someone 5 bucks to use their player.  I realize this answer probably doesn't meet your urgent need, based on the date of your post. ",
