            "answer_text": "The computer can read the text out loud or translate it to Braille. Unfortunately this technology is very reliant on how sites are coded. For example, if a developer doesn\u2019t input alt attributes it\u2019s as if images don\u2019t exist. Worse yet, alt tags are rarely used relevantly or often used for keyword stuffing. And if someone uses an image instead of text, the whole page could be out of context. It\u2019s really bad if a designer wants a fancy font and used images instead of web fonts or svgs because this can also mess up tab abilities which are reliant on header hierarchy. ",

            "answer_text": "The computer can read the text out loud for someone who cannot see. There are also peripherals that can convert text on a web page to braille. As part of making your webpage accessible, it is recommended you add descriptions for images on your page, thus images can be described for those who cannot see. It is part of the image tag <img> in HTML. You can add text to the \u201calt\u201d part of the tag so if someone cannot see the image, then the text describing the image can be read out loud. ",
