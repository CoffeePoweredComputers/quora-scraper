            "answer_text": "It depends on the additives Bpa for example could be in polycarbonate but PVC for example is its own kind of plastic If your really concerned and have the time and money Then would set up a small plastic lab with some basic equipment like a stirring hot plate , some beakers , and the ingredients. For recipes you can look online on bioplastic recipes then you could pour the plastic into a tin foil muffin tin , grind the plastic into a dust and then extrude into 3DPrinting filament for example a 3Devo is a example of a brand of filament making machines but just like a 3DPrinter it's best to use default settings ",

            "answer_text": "Most filaments are pretty virgin. Meaning the ABS is really ABS. Some companies use modifiers to make it print better. The reason you do not see much concern is that printer filament parts are not meant for food contact, so not too much worry. That said, again, most filaments are not going to have BPA filaments due to the nature of the filament printing process and the lack of need for those additives. ",
