We could once keep pace with the change in info, traditions etc.. No more it seems, we need the kids, indeed the grand kids to help us with technology today. Its kind of amazing that humans who once grew old to become respected elders, are now irrelevant or worse, dependents. Yet, it does seem to be working, we are adaptable, even in our old age, although though I still have trouble distinguishing between tapping, swiping, pressing, and holding. ",
