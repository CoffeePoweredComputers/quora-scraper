            "answer_text": "Yes, it is the good time to start a YouTube channel but I am quite unsure of what you meant by the phrase \u201cgood option\u201d. If you are starting a Youtube channel for the money then you better stay out of it at all. Long story short, Youtube isn't gonna pay you some crazy amount of money in the short run or sometimes not even in the long term, so if your primary focus is money then stay away from Youtube, go get a real job. But if you have a talent, Or possess a certain skill, Or love to entertain others, Or you are simply passionate about making Youtube videos then it is the perfect time to start a Youtube channel. I would like to give some advice on getting some initial viewers and increasing your engagement rates: Make your videos worth watching. Think like if you were to watch it, would to stick up till the end of the video?Avoid lengthy videos initially. The sweet spot is 5\u201310 mins. The engagement rates are the best on a 5 minute long video from monetisation point of view as well. You can surely get good engagements on a 3 mins long video but ad revenue would be less. However, a 10 minutes long video would earn 3 times more revenue as you can embed hoti 3 ads in it.Either make your content the most unique content or the most detailed content in your niche. If I were to make a video regarding bicep curls then the viewer shall think it is the final video they need to watch relating to bicep curls, they should not feel the need to ever watch another video in the same context and it should be everything they ever wanted to know about the topic. These kinds of videos get a lot of shares from the viewers on their social media.Urge your viewers to subscribe to your channel. I don't say that you beg for subscribers but no one is going to subscribe to your channel unless and until you shamelessly plug it.Make your videos look professional. This does not mean that you spend a hefty amount of money firsthand but you atleast use equipment which is decent enough. Most smartphones today have decent cameras and a decent mic so make use of it whenever needed.Upload a video every single day! You never know which of your videos goes viral anyway so keep working every single day to put out quality content.Do not compromise on quality.Pick a niche with less competition, if possible. I know it's hard.Build a blog around your Youtube channel. Making a website is darn easy now so you can just post a blog article relating to your own videos to increase revenue.Feel free to ask anything relating to Youtube, I will answer your queries as soon as possible :) ",

            "answer_text": "I have a YouTube channel for 3 years now and I barely uploaded something across 3 years and I have 3k subscribers and quite some views. I am close to having my channel monetized. Having videos on YouTube brought me clients for my freelancing business, without having the best videos out there and now I am starting to relaunch my channel by having daily content because the client work has literally plummeted to zero. I always wanted to triple down my work on YouTube and now I have the right push. The reason why it\u2019s worth starting a YouTube channel in 2020 and in every year is that once you have done a video, it\u2019s all hands-off and that video could bring you money in multiple ways. You can bring clients to your services (if you have a service business), you can earn through affiliate commissions and through youtube AdSense just to name few ways that can benefit you and your bank account. Not to mention the skills you develop having a YouTube channel, that you can offer to others in the future, exchanging skills to money. In order to have a successful YouTube channel, you need to learn a lot. You need to learn how to plan your content, how to create great thumbnails, how to do see, how to speak in front of the camera, which hardware and software to use, and more. These alone could bring you, clients, if you ever decide to offer your knowledge to others, as I said above. You can never expect to be successful at the beginning, it might require a lot of work and time to get some traction, but the sooner you begin, the better. ",
