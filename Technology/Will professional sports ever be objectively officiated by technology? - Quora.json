            "answer_text": "I have wanted one piece of technology implemented in MLB for years. A computer should call balls and strikes. I'm so sick of half blind middle aged umpires making lousy calls that adversely affect the outcome of games. They can still make \u201cthe call\u201d to give a game that nostalgic feel but it should be relayed to an earpiece ( I'm sure the Astros or Red Sox could recommend a couple of good brands!) in real time to always make the right call from a laser grid marking the strike zone. This could eliminate batters and pitchers getting thrown out for arguing over balls and strikes. ",
