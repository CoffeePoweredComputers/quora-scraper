            "answer_text": "That\u2019s a good question. Although I was born and raised in Honolulu, I have close family on Maui. Specifically, my maternal grandparents lived in Wailuku, and I always stayed there on our periodic visits there. Surprisingly, a lot of the things I remember from childhood in Wailuku, Kahului, and Makawao are still there: breakfasts at Tasty Crust, cold treats at Tasaka Guri-Guri, cream puffs and long johns at Komoda Store. Still, the winds of change have blown, and among the things I remember that are no longer there: Ooka Super Market used to be the main supermarket in downtown Wailuku, where the town gathered to get their food if they didn\u2019t want to go to the bigger stores in Kahului. I remember that my grandmother used to save Gold Bond trading stamps from there. Sadly, the supermarket closed in 2005.I remember also the Dairy Queen that used to be just off Main Street as you went toward Kahului, where you\u2019d get sundaes and Dilly bars. The building is still there but has had different tenants over time.In general, however, the shop mix along Market Street in Wailuku has changed. Where there used to be clothing stores and fish markets, now there are smaller boutiques.Suffice it to say that Maui is not the same place I remember from three decades ago, and it seems like it always changes from visit to visit. There will likely be things I will add to the list over time. ",

            "answer_text": "Maui has changed so much and while it is still home there are lots of things I miss from my childhood. One is friendship as Maui is a very transient place. A lot of people I grew up with left for college and never returned. There are also several locally owned restaurants that have closed over the years that I truly miss. We currently have a lot of development happening, such as the renovation of the airport, which has changed the landscape. It might seem odd to care about that but flying back into the Maui AirPort was the first feeling of arriving home for me. Now that it has changed it does not feel quite the same. In addition to this the development on the beaches has exploded. I remember there were just a few homes or none at all on some of the beaches, especially on the South Side, and now they are completely filled. With all the development it would be nice if the beaches were off limits moving forward. ",
