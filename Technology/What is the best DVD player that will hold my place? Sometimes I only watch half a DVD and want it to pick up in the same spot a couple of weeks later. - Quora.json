            "answer_text": "DVD players are getting rare as Blu-ray Disc players also play DVDs (as well as CDs and Blu-ray discs) - you should get a Blu-ray Disc player - provided your TV has an HDMI input connection. In answer to your question, all Blu-ray Disc players should be able to hold your place - However, it also depends on the how the DVD or Blu-ray Disc was authored when it was created - in other words, the metadata that tells the player that it can hold the place has to be included on the disc. In most cases, it is, but you might find some cases where it isn\u2019t. Also, keep in mind that the place holding only works if the DVD or Blu-ray Disc is played on the same player where it started and, since the player holds this information in its memory, it is possible that if you or someone else proceeds to play another disc in between, that the placeholding information could be deleted. A similar question has been asked on Quora previously - so this additional answer may also help: Why don\u2019t some of my Blu-rays and DVDs resume where I left off? ",

            "answer_text": "Every DVD player I\u2019ve used has this feature. In fact, even amongst the really cheap DVD players I\u2019ve used, it will remember your place on the last disk, even if you\u2019ve removed it for a month. The term \u201cbest\u201d is vague and will be ignored. If you must have this feature, before buying a name brand DVD player, read the owner\u2019s manual first. Every major manufacturer has their owner\u2019s manuals online and free to download. ",
