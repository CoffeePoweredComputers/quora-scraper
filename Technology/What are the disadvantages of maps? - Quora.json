            "answer_text": "The biggest disadvantages of maps come from maps which are badly made in one way or another: Maps with no scale give a poor idea of distancesMaps with no legend are frequently confusing to the map userMaps with errors on (usually accidental) can send the map user to the wrong place or otherwise lead them to bad decisionsBut there are also some disadvantages that are inherent to geographical maps: Maps are never perfect. The smaller-scale the map, the more detail from the real world is missing, even if it has no actual errors. Features are simplified (this is called generalisation) and averaged out.Flat maps always involve distortion. It\u2019s not possible to project the curved surface of the Earth onto a flat sheet/screen with perfect accuracy, and while there are some projections which faithfully reproduce either areas or directions, the maps in most common use (Mercator variants) badly distort areas away from the equator.Maps always omit information. To make maps readable for one type of information, another kind of information must be left out, otherwise the map becomes an unusable mess. Most labels on maps obscure something which could otherwise have been shown there.Maps don\u2019t show time, but hardly ever say what specific point in time they are supposed to represent. For instance the map of Europe on my wall right now shows Crimea as part of Ukraine, but in fact it was annexed by Russia in 2014. The map doesn\u2019t state what date it shows.Maps are always designed with a particular use, or set of uses, in mind. But the maps themselves almost never state their intended uses! So it\u2019s quite common for people to put a map to use in a way that it wasn\u2019t intended for, and which the generalisations, labels and accuracy aren\u2019t really suitable for. The only solution to this would be better \u201cmap literacy\u201d. ",
