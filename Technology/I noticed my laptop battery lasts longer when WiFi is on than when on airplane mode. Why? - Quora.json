            "answer_text": "Your question: \u201cI noticed my laptop battery lasts longer when WiFi is on than when on airplane mode. Why?\u201d Thanks for asking me to answer, but I don\u2019t know the answer. Under normal circumstances, turning off all radios (including Wi-Fi) should have less of a battery drain for sure (whether it is a laptop or cellular phone). Perhaps some application or background service (such as DHCP) on your laptop is trying to get to the Internet for information and constantly re-trying when it is unsuccessful. When it gets service on Wi-Fi, that application sleeps and doesn\u2019t drain your battery. ",

            "answer_text": "I have one of that strange answers. I was developing a windows service, it requires communication. But for some strange reason it was eating a lot of CPU(two windows of it would consume 100%, does not matter if celeron or i7). But I remembered a text in Internet explaining the use of delays or the use of \u201cThread.Sleep\u201d to avoid this. So I put it on my code and voila, no more over use of CPU. Your wi fi is delaying something to eat CPU and battery. ",
