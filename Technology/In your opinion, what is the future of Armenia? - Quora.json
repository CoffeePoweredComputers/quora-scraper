            "answer_text": "It\u2019s very hard to say. Mainly this is because there\u2019s so much geopolitics involved. There are Many Variables within Armenia\u2019s Control There are many choices for the Armenian government to make that will affect the next couple generations to come: Will Armenia remain under Russian influence?Will Armenia play ball with the EU? With the United States? With other superpowers?How successful will the new administration be (post-\u201cVelvet Revolution\u201d) to modernize the government, eliminate corruption, and bring in new talent?Will we open borders with Turkey?Will we resolve our land disputes with Azerbaijan?Who will we have trade deals with? Who will be Armenia\u2019s friends?Who will we buy arms from?How will we address social issues internally? (Vis-a-vis women\u2019s rights, gay rights, religious rights, treatment of minorities, etc.)Will we open our doors to repatriates? How will we take care of the Syrian refugees fleeing violence? How will we attract American repatriates who have the ability to stimulate the economy?How can we build a robust technology and innovation sector in the economy, attract research grants and talent and entrepreneurs for startups?What direction will our monetary policy take? Which sectors will our banks support? What kind of stimulus is needed to catalyze innovation and the development of intellectual property?This is just the tip of the iceberg. There are many other issues that Armenia needs to decide on. And these decisions will affect Armenia\u2019s economic, military, and geopolitical situation for the generations to come. There are Many Variables Outside of Armenia\u2019s Control On the other hand Armenia has little or no control over Russia\u2019s middle east strategy or its former SSR strategy, or United States\u2019 containment strategy, or the EU\u2019s single market policy, or China\u2019s economic and technological expansionist strategies, or Iran\u2019s real-politik and nuclear strategy. These are all factors that can shift at any minute and change the geopolitical landscape (as well as the international economic landscape). For instance, if Russia suddenly decides to ally itself more closely with Azerbaijan and desert its Armenia strategy, the Republic of Armenia will face some serious issues in terms of leverage in the Nagorno-Karabakh debate. On the other hand, if the U.S. decides that Armenia is a reliable strategic partner in the Caucasus and/or middle east against such nemesis as Iran or ISIS, then Armenia would gain a military advantage in terms of alliances. But these factors are VERY hard to predict. Conclusion As an optimist, I can tell you that there are many things within Armenia\u2019s control. Having many possibilities is a good thing, in my opinion. This means that our generation and the next generation have a lot of agency to affect change and steer the country in the roght direction. But really it\u2019s up to our generation to \u2018step-up to the plate\u2019 and do what they/we believe is necessary to improve Armenia\u2019s position in the future: economically, politically and strategically.

            "answer_text": "A2A Hey, Happy 2020! The future of Armenia will be overall good\u2026but with baby steps. Things will slowly improve. It will not be paradise on earth but things will become better for Armenia. Many Armenians abroad are dedicated to make Armenia better and after the Velvet Revolution of 2018, the spirit is stronger now amongst the younger generation of the diaspora. The out-migration rate is falling and it has been falling for some time. Armenia does not need to become a super rich country like the UAE. Armenians are socialists by their nature, they need to follow the Scandinavian system of governance and provide the social benefits to the population, create programs to improve the rural areas. Many Armenian leaders and intellectuals both at home and abroad fully realize this. Things will improve further if Iran becomes a democratic and pro-Western society, however if things get worse with Iran, things might affect Armenia as well. But even without this, things will be good for Armenia, it is more or less shielded by Russia. It is noteworthy to mention that we are seeing an upward trend in the growth of the overall economy since 2018 Velvet Revolution, but again baby steps.
