            "answer_text": "Well I think that the reasons are as follows : Good start by DC. CSK were unable to get any wicket in the first 10 overs. Dhawan and Prithvi played well and laid a strong foundation to set a high total on the board. CSK were unable to get any wickets with the new ball. Jadeja is not looking in touch. Jadeja went for 40 or more in the last two matches without getting any wickets. It\u2019s hurting the team as he is a key bowler who bowls complete 4 overs. Chawal went expensive in first over but he came back and removed both openers of DC in first two overs. However I feel that as tournament progresses Jaddu will also be back in touch and pitch will favour spinners.Only 1 wicket in last 6 overs. CSK were unable to get many wickets in the end too, resulting in a total score of 175 by DC.CSK openers not in form. Both Watson and Vijay are not looking in great touch from the first 3 matches. However CSK doesn\u2019t have much options as Rayudu is unfit and Raina not available.CSK were unable to keep required run rate in check. Req. run rate kept rising and pressure on the batsman went high as the match progressed. Faf is the only one looking in great touch with the bat. Also I feel that MSD should have come before Kedar as after some time, he could regain a bit of his form and even could have helped team to win the match.A complete bowling show by DC. Every bowler of DC bowled well today, Avesh went for runs but Du plessis was dropped while he was bowling. Image source: IPLT20.com - Indian Premier League Official Website CSK have a 6 day break and with too much experience in the side, I think that they would figure out what\u2019s best for team and come out stronger in the upcoming matches.

            "answer_text": "There are only three things wrong with the current CSK team: They can\u2019t bat well.They can\u2019t bowl well.They can\u2019t field well.Wait\u2026But thats everything gone wrong, is it not?. Thats the case of the current CSK team. I suspect that they wont end up even in the top 4 this season. They don\u2019t have a good top order with any International players [except Faf] who can consistently anchor the innings especially when you chase. Watson, Rayudu, Raina, Jadhav, Vijay are all old timers and it has been ages since they played in any international matches. There is no proper middle order batsman who can build partnerships and this puts too much pressure on Dhoni- who himself is retired , well past his old self. They don\u2019t have good pace bowlers in good form, apart from Sam Curran. Ngidi is in poor form, Deepak Chahar does not bowl proper line and length. Amongst the spinners- Chawla is also old and cannot contain even a minnow like Sanju Samson. Jadeja is not keeping well and gives away too many runs. CSK had two good fielders- Raina and Jadeja. Both of them have lost their sheen and not as athletic as they were 10 years back. The core of the CSK team is getting old and lethargic. They need to get good local Indian talent in the likes of Shubman Gill, Ishaan Kishan , Mayank Agarwal, Suryakumar Yadav to replace their ageing top order. CSK\u2019s core strength has been its batsmen heavy top order. That is a pale shadow of its past.  The team needs a revamp. They can take inspiration from Delhi Capital\u2019s transformation. 10 years back- Delhi was made up of old timers like Sehwag, Gambhir, Ishant Sharma, Ashish Nehra who were yesteryear legends, but unfit for the dynamism that T20 demands. Today\u2019s Delhi Capitals team is made up of young, agile players who can build partnerships guided by the experience of Ricky Ponting CSK needs to stop relying on Watson, Faf, Bravo and replace them with good young Indian players. Local talent is the key. Foreigners can add a bit of variety and depth, but the core of the team should be made of local players. ",
