            "answer_text": "Of course, financial space is very broad. But just to give you an idea there\u2019s a platform that focuses on the other aspects when it comes to financial concerns. Symbol from NEM for example allows businesses to modernize their daily operations by incorporating blockchain technology both seamlessly and painlessly. The Symbol tech stack caters to firms in a wide range of industries including agriculture, manufacturing, construction, finance, data management, healthcare, and logistics. Further, Symbol caters for every part of the process of producing and selling goods. It thus has the ability to significantly bolster security for point of sale retailers. By harmoniously working with another major technological frontier, IoT (Internet of Things) solutions, Symbol directly combats the growing problem of credit card skimming. Symbol\u2019s cohesive IoT-tied solutions resolve card-skimming problems of gas/petrol stations and Automated Teller Machines (ATM) users around the globe. We can now explore exactly how Symbol and IoT technologies work together to put an end to a crime that affects financial institutions, retailers, and everyday consumers, and how Symbol\u2019s expansive feature set collaborates with other IoT solutions to resolve challenging business problems. Do you know that Card skimming crimes are on the rise, with each skimmer accounting for up to $1million dollars worth of fraud, and according to the U.S. Secret Service, thefts from ATM skimmers now total more than $1 billion per year?
