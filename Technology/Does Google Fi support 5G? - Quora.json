            "answer_text": "According to Wikipedia \u201cGoogle Fi, formerly Project Fi, is an MVNO telecommunications service by Google that provides telephone calls, SMS, and mobile broadband using cellular networks and Wi-Fi. Google Fi uses networks operated by Sprint, T-Mobile, and U.S. Cellular. Google Fi is a service for US residents only, as of late 2019.\u201d So, at this time, no. Google is a mongrel patchwork of technologies that approximate or \u2018virtualize\u2019 a network. T-Mobile\u2019s 5G network doesn't provide 5G to Google Fi, and the available phones supporting Google Fi use LTE bands 2 and 4 plus WiFi - not 5G. ",
