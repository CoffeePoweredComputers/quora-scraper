            "answer_text": "Obviously 11 Pro. Here the key point is battery. XS max battery has 3174 mAh, 11 Pro max has 3969 mAh. Sometimes you can survive without vibrate motion, without sensor, silent button, without enough free space but without sufficient battery backup you cannot use the device all the day without charging twice so Battery is the major key role.. I bought 7 Plus instead of iPhone X because I cannot afford XS max, and the features and specs in the 7 Plus have already reached my expectations and requirements in terms of Battery backup, camera, processor, etc. So buying X would have been disadvantage for me, so I bought 7 Plus to reach my requirements in my budget. Coming to your point, the features and specs in XS max are all most common in 11 Pro, just like 4 and 5, 6s and 7, X and XR- XS max like that. So I recommend you to buy 11 Pro to acquire giant battery and the some improved specs, features, like 3 cameras, upgraded processor, A 13 Bionic chip.   ",

            "answer_text": "They are basically the same price. The only possible advantages XS Max gives you are the 3D Touch action and less cameras behind for a cleaner look\u2026. Both come down to personal preference. Otherwise you absolutely go for 11 Pro Max. It is better in every way including performance and battery life. ",
