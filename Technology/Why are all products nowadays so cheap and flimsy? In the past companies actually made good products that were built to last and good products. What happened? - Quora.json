            "answer_text": "Consumers is what happened. About thirty years ago, when China decided to build its economy on the back of manufacturing of consumer goods to start with, they literally invaded all the markets for cheap, disposable consumer goods. They found a willing partner such as Walmart that was ready and eager to peddle \u201clow prices every day\u201d and capture a huge share of the U.S. market. In the process, it drove scores of manufacturers of quality, long-lasting durable products in the U.S. out of business. These cheap products with ultra-low prices were an instant hit with consumers who loved low prices as they were struggling to make the ends meet with their low wages and high inflation that pushed prices up to a point where many locally made products were beyond their reach. Walmart, with its low prices, kept the inflation within check and grew at a phenomenal rate. The above may be over-simplification but in essence, this is what has been going on in the United States since the early 1980s, especially after China was admitted to the World Trade Organization and was given free access to global markets. However, that does not mean longer-lasting, better quality products have completely disappeared. There still are many products that last a lot longer than the cheapest variety that you get at Dollar Tree or 99 Cent stores. As the economy flourished and people started enjoying the fruits of low inflation, high employment, and rising wages, they have moved up the ladder and have started shopping for more durable, higher quality products. You just have to look for brands that imply high quality and reputation. You don\u2019t see Chinese automobiles or aircraft in this country because consumers demand high quality, reliability and long life for such products. Products marketed by firms such as Levi, Apple, Sony, etc. may still be made in China but they are far better quality and durable than the lower-priced substitutes. Eight years ago, when I was traveling through China with a group, our Tour Director took us to a shopping Mall where we would be able to buy \u201cknockoffs of knockoffs\u201d meaning there now are some companies in China that are producing cheaper imitations of the higher quality products still made in China but sold at a premium in the United States and other countries.

            "answer_text": "It\u2019s more profitable to sell items with planned obsolescence. Quality items that last cost more to produce, so to have a similar profit margin they\u2019d be more expensive than the competition. But wait, there\u2019s more\u2026 because the better items would last longer, how do you expect the company to sell the same number of units? You can only manipulate fashion trends so much to try to get people to replace their kitchen appliances every few years, and most people would not be willing to abandon something that was working perfectly - and had been extra expensive - just for looks. Consumers tend to be more price-sensitive than value-sensitive. Also, people don\u2019t always like solid (but heavy) products as much as shiny and light (but flimsy) products. Add in that most people aren\u2019t really equipped to determine the actual quality of items, and buying the cheapest is often understandable. Simply put, it\u2019s easier to produce cheap junk, market the hell out of it, sell it for a low(ish) price, and expect the customer to buy a replacement in two or three years time (or less) and make more money than by selling a product that costs twenty times as much but will last a lifetime.

            "answer_text": "Not sure that I agree with you and some of the other answerers. Yes there are some products that are cheap and flimsy and have a short product life. Fine. I remember Carl Sagan describing why teenagers wore cheap shoes. It was based on a very logical cost/benefit analysis. The style, at least at that time (I am too old to know what happens today), changed year to year and they were getting older anyway so why buy a pair of shoes that lasted more than a year. Once we were older and in the \u2018real world\u2019 we bought shoes that would last longer. I now, regularly have shoes that last 10 years or more. They cost more but last. I would also say that today\u2019s sport shoes (I call them sneakers) are not cheap! Technology is another area where it makes no sense to build something that will last 10 years. After 3\u20134 years the technology has advanced so far that the product may be obsolete whether or not it has worn out. But I do have some tech devices that easily last 10 years or more. It is in other areas where the idea of cheap and flimsy doesn\u2019t hold. How many cars on the road nowadays get 200,000 miles? Plenty. I have sets of cooking pans that I have had for 20 or 30 years and still work great. I am not alone in this. Same for a lot of what I have in my home: furniture, fixtures, wall paint, carpets, cabinets. Some of these go out of style well before they wear out. The closest item I have to being cheap and flimsy is my can opener. Yes, there are cheap and flimsy products that you can buy, and that is a consumer\u2019s choice. There are also quality, hearty products that you can buy if you choose. ",

Yes, people would like it to last longer but people buy the cheaper brands and just switch out - manufacturers are of course happy to go along bt the builders just do what people want \u2026 or something obvious. NO ONE buys furniture to pass along to their grandkids like 2 generations ago. ",
