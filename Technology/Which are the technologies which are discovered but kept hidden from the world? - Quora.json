            "answer_text": "Actually there are a lot of them. Some are mere conspiracies while some are kept secret for a purpose. So here I am gonna tell you about one such ancient invention: Greek Fire  Greek fire was an incendiary weapon first used in Byzantine warfare in 678 CE. You can call it napalm of ancient warfare. It was highly flammable liquid, made of secret ingredients and used both in catapulted incendiary bombs and sprayed under pressure so as to launch flames at enemy ships and fortifications. It was also used with success in defensive situations. Greek Fire became the most devastating weapon for over seven centuries and ensured that Constantinople resisted all attackers. Emperors knew its value and declared that it must absolutely never reach foreign hands. A Secret Formula The invention of Greek Fire is credited to a Christian Greek named Kallinikos (aka Callinicus). Flammable liquids had been used in both Greek and Roman Warfare but nothing had ever been devised that was quite as lethal as Greek Fire. The precise components of the liquid were a closely-guarded secret but a light petroleum or naphtha is one known and vital ingredient. Other ingredients were quicklime, sulphur, resin and potassium nitrate. Some scholars suggest gunpowder was included in the mix. The process of making the liquid was also highly dangerous. The recipe of making Greek Fire was kept in such a secrecy that only emperors and few other selected people knew about it. Now its formula is long lost. It is said that Greek Fire instantaneously set ships ablaze & there was no way of putting out the flames as water had no effect on them. Use in Battle Greek fire was first used in naval engagements where streams of the flaming liquid were fired under pressure towards enemy ships. The dramatic effect of Greek Fire \u201ccaused enemies to shiver in terror\u201d. On top of that there was no way of putting out the fire as water had no effect on it. There was very little defence against it either covering the ship in soaked hides, maintaining a safe distance or attacking during storms. Important Victories  *Greek Fire grenades* During the 7th century Arabs were at their peak. They were constantly challenging other empires in the Mediterranean region. During their contest to capture Constantinople, the heart of Byzantine empire, Greek Fire did very well job of resisting the Arabs for long time. It also saved Constantinople city against the attacks of Russian fleets in 10th century. Decline Its usage suddenly stopped around 1200 CE and from then on there was no mention of it being used in wars. The reasons are still unknown. To this date the exact version of Greek Fire, as described in texts hasn't been recreated mainly because of the incomplete knowledge about its ingredient and their exact compositions.

            "answer_text": "Every one is writing about External technology and science. We have more knowledge about Space, Mars and Nuclear weapons. But we seldom have knowledge about inner science. West is advanced in technology and East is advanced in Spirituality. These two forces should be bridged to create a better human life. Now coming back to question, there are much advanced technology hidden in Vedic knowledge and ancient Indian and tibetan civilisation. If I speak about them people will call me insane or term it as B.S They are called miracles because science doesn\u2019t found any proof to it . But it\u2019s absolutely science only. Science and scientist should research about it. It should be bought to benefit of humanity. Now I will quote some example for those who are awaiting the so called miracles . Transformation of matter. Jesus transformed water to wine. It\u2019s not a miracle.He just used the ancient knowledge of transformation of matter. Let me explain more Think how you can convert water to wine Water is H20 and Wine is H20+ ethyl alcohol or glycerol Now if science finds way to convert some part of water ie. Hydrogen and oxygen to carbon and Sulphur. We will call it by name like chemical reaction or fermentation or something. Suppose this process of converting water into wine takes 2 hrs today. May be 10 years down the line a scientist may come up with an idea of doing the same process faster in 3 min with help of adding a catalyst to it. Now can it be called a miracle or wonder? No. Now you and me call it a science. So these so called miracles are miracles because no one have discovered science behind it. Dying comfortably Science and Technology have progressed much to create a baby or have painless delivery. Today there is much advanced technology to track a baby and its growth every day.But what about death? Can it be made more comfortable? Instead of dying in hospital bed surrounded by doctors and nurses with tubes going from your body to machines rather if we can do it in our home. How beautiful that would be? A painless swift death. There are technologies for that.Many of these technics are mentioned in Yoga sutras. My opinion is Science should explore it and utilise it. SHC : Spontaneous Human combustion is not uncommon today Humans can generate fire inside from body. These techniques were used by ancient monks and sages to burn their body when they passed away. There are many like these Healing power of Humans Transmutation Telepathy Some of them are very dangerous too. That should be kept hidden only. Otherwise it will be misused by us. I\u2019m not naming them here. I hope one day some scientist will explore these things and Science will utilise it for betterment of humanity Miracles remain miracles only till science opens eye to it. ",
