As you wanna start a Gadget Review Blog so be focused on some basic things from the very beginning. Which are, You have to be well aware of different Hardware & Software specs with necessary details for the respective gadgets.You have to be well versed in all Technical Functionalities (not just names) of different gadgets from Smartphones to RC Drones (based on your preferred area).Do you have a Solid pipeline of getting access to all new gadgets which have just released or about to release in the market? Otherwise if you are just thinking of rehashing another Bloggers post that will never ever help you to build your own credibility or name. So think about it!In the beginning start with a Micro Niche (on a particular type of gadget) on which you are comfortable enough.Avidly Read, Follow & build network with other gadget bloggers. It will help you to sharpen your knowledge & you will get to know the style/ trends.After looking into all these detail then jump onto setting up your Blog (Literally & technically) and Start Blogging :)",

            "answer_text": "Starting a review blog is one of the best ways to not only create a site, it\u2019s also a great way to make money as well. WordPress is the best platform for setting all of this up. The first thing you will need is a domain name, then a web hosting plan and installing WordPress to power the site and manage your content.  You can also download a premium theme for your site to make it stand out from the crowd. When it comes to the monetization of your site, Google Adsense and affiliate marketing are probably two of the best options to choose from. Also take a look at other gadget review sites to see what type of content they are creating and how they are posting reviews on their sites.
