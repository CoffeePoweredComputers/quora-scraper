            "answer_text": "It's basically based on your budget. In current e-commerce sale you can get iPhone 11 64GB at Rs.48000, iphone 11 pro 64GB for Rs.80000. Then newly launched iPhone 12 64GB is priced Rs.80000 in India. If you have 80k INR as your budget you can go for iphone 12 which is better deal than 11 pro. But you wont regret using 11, my suggestion for you is to buy 11 128GB and save some money. ",
