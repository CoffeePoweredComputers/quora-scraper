            "answer_text": "Business Failure Rates Business is risky and often deadly. The failure rate of businesses, especially in their first five years, is very high in all countries. According to statistics published by the U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA), seven out of ten new employer establishments survive at least two years and 51 percent survive at least five years. Common Reasons Businesses Fail One weakness of an overall list for all businesses is the relevancy to the many types of industries and businesses. For example, location is critical to a retail business such as a restaurant or clothing store. Manufacturing a product requires many technical skills, quality control and ability to compete with large established manufacturers. An Internet based company has quite different challenges and drivers. Therefore to be most useful business owners should analyze those causes of business failure that are most frequent in their industry or business sector: Inadequate accounting and costing system and practices, which can lead to and be closely related to:Cash flow problemPoor inventory managementPoor credit arrangement managementPoor financial controlInability to manage costsInadequate gross margins of products or servicesInadequate or weak management, which can have several roots:Lack of experience of founders, initial management,Operational mediocrity or inefficiencies,Dysfunctional management,Lack of succession plan,Poor business model (don\u2019t know cost/profit drivers)Lack of sales/revenues:A declining marketCompetitionPoor or insufficient marketingUnexpected or rapid growth the organization is unable to keep up withInsufficient Capital (Money)Poor location \u2013 most critical for retail and consumer related businessesOver-investment in fixed assetsReduce the Mistake Level All businesses and business leaders make mistakes. Inexperienced and new businesses have more mistakes. Too many mistakes can lead to business failure. One goal to survive as a new company is to implement strategies to reduce the number of mistakes to a level the organization can survive. Avoid repeating mistakes by recognizing and educating everyone in the company when a mistake is made. For example, a bad credit decision that goes sour. For example, a hiring mistake - what lessons were learned?Watch your competitors for both their failures and successes and learn from them.Implement a good accounting system early which will have many benefits - an accurate measure of cash flow; real measurement of costs, profits and losses; and needed data on growth rate and performance.Approach mergers and acquisitions with eyes wide open - the failure rate of acquisitions and mergers is very high.Focus on growing management and management skills at the same pace the business is growing.",

            "answer_text": "Extracting payment from a client who\u2019s determined not to pay you is a pretty challenging issue for a small business owner. I work online as a freelance writer/virtual assistant and have had this happen three times in all. The first time was with a client for whom I\u2019d been providing services for about a year - he asked me to do some extra work which would be paid on an hourly basis and then when I invoiced him, he ignored repeated requests. I discovered that he\u2019d done the same thing with other people providing services for him and I ended up losing about $2,000. About a year later I took on a fixed price job via one of the freelancing websites - it was to proof-read and edit a thesis. The client was in a hurry so I put aside other work to complete this job within a very short deadline. For some reason, the cleint kept skype chatting me and I began to get a bad feeling about it. The job was a 12 page document so when the client began insulting me, saying he wasn\u2019t sure that the work would be acceptable, I sent him a three page sample of what I\u2019d done. I got a message back saying it was perfect. He\u2019d also brought his client (for whom the work was being done) in on one of the skype chats, so I also sent the sample to his client to double check that it was acceptable and it was. I then asked my client to release the payment to the freelancing website (who would hold it for 10 days before releasing it to me) which he did and I sent him the completed work. Within minutes of receiving it, he cancelled his payment method on the freelancing website. I asked the freelancing website to investigate this which they did, finding in my favour but there was nothing they could do as he cancelled the payment to them. I\u2019m still waiting for the payment 4 years later and it shows up in my financial records on the freelancing website! About two years ago a long-term client asked me to do a website rewrite for him, asking me to track time (which I always do) and invoice him in chunks of 20 hours. I did this and the first payment went through fine. I still had 7 hours leftover but the client didn\u2019t ask for any more work to be done so a couple of months later, I emailed the client asking if it would be okay to invoice for the 7 hours as no more work had been forthcoming. He ignored this email. I repeatedlt asked on a weekly basis with the client ignoring me. I eventually caught up with him in a skype chat and he told me he wasn\u2019t willing to pay because he\u2019d been emailing me asking me to do more work and I hadn\u2019t responded. This was a lie - I did double check all of my emails (and the spam and emails I\u2019d trashed), but there were no messages from him at all. He still owes me and I can see my work on his website right now. I was really surprised at this one because I\u2019d worked with this client for 3 years prior to this, we\u2019d built up a good working relationship, had regular skype calls, etc. He\u2019d paid me quite a lot of money for work done (I recruited and managed a team of writers for him so he could concentrate his efforts on his business) and the sum he\u2019d refused to pay was relatively small in comparison with what he\u2019d paid out over the time of our working relationship.
