            "answer_text": "While I agree that Cook\u2019s total compensation is lower in 2016, I\u2019m not so sure I\u2019d call it a \u201ccut in pay.\u201d If you are being paid a salary of $2 million in one year, then receive $3 million salary the following year, I think most people would call that a raise, not a cut. That\u2019s what happened to Cook in 2016. At the executive levels, a portion of their non-salaried compensation (sometimes, a substantial portion) is commonly tied to performance, specifically the achievement of certain corporate financial objectives such as revenue and/or operating profit. These goals are very arbitrary and determined by the board of directors. As the company grows, inevitably, so do the goals for the future. In 2015, Cook achieved the targeted financial objectives and was paid 100% of the achievement-based bonus that was slated for his position. In 2016, he did not achieve the objective for the year and was paid 89.5% of the bonus for his position (reflective of what portion of the target was achieved).[1]  The bonus, combined with his 50% higher salary resulted in total compensation that was lower than the year before. That\u2019s the mechanics of how his total compensation was derived. In other words, Cook did not really take a pay cut. This is a one-time occurrence. In 2017, it will be a different goal and he either will or will not achieve it and will again be paid a bonus on whatever percentage of the goal was achieved. Whether he is deserving of whatever compensation he receives as CEO of Apple is a matter of opinion, I suppose. According to the Apple\u2019s board (which has a compensation committee designed specifically to assess the fairness of his compensation structure), the answer is \u2018yes\u2019, he is deserving of whatever he makes at Apple.  [1] Year over year, revenue declined 7.2% in 2016, while earnings from operations declined 18.7%. Is a decline in bonus appropriate for the financial performance delivered? In my opinion, the answer is yes.  ",
