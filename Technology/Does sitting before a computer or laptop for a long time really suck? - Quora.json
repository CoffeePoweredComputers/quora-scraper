            "answer_text": "It is really bad to sit in front of a screen for a long time. Funny enough, I did a paper on this once. Screens in general can cause nearsightedness, strain your eyes, reduce brain activity, cause ADHD, and sitting down will highly increase chances of heart disease and obesity. Plus, you feel terrible because I sat in front of a screen for 4 hours straight and I felt so zoned out and melancholy afterwards. To help you can look 20 feet away for 20 seconds every 20 minutes of using your computer. Don\u2019t get me wrong, though, because I use computers all the time. I did this paper because I wanted to know if I was endangering myself. That\u2019s my two cents. ;) ",

            "answer_text": "Only if you have no purpose and you are sitting on an uncomfortable chair. I learnt right away I needed a very confmy and supportive arm chair as well as comfortable environment. I also connect the lap top to a bigger external monitor. Also frequent activity other than just typing away is necessary. Like walking a few minutes and looking at other things. Having done this for 25 years of at least 10 hours a day and many 16+ hour days it does get tiresome. But it is not all that different than sitting on a couch for 6 hours a night watching TV. ",
