            "answer_text": "\u201cBy far, the greatest danger of Artificial Intelligence is that people conclude too early that they understand it.\u201d(Eliezer Yudkowsky) \u201cI think we have a duty to maintain the light of consciousness to make sure it continues into the future.\u201d(Elon Musk) Any full-spectrum superintelligence will be conscious. Digital zombies cannot investigate first-person experience or grasp the nature of their ignorance. Full-spectrum superintelligence will be supersentient, so to speak, able to access a vast library of state-spaces of consciousness inaccessible to the legacy wetware of unenhanced humans. On this analysis, mankind\u2019s superintelligent successors will also be our biological descendants. By contrast, classical digital computers are \u2013 and will remain \u2013 insentient. Programmable digital zombies will outperform the biological minds of humans, transhumans and even post-humans in a wide and expanding array of cognitive domains. Artificial intelligence will outclass biological minds in school, leisure and the workplace. Silicon (etc) robots will be better doctors, professors, games-players, caregivers, investors, conversationalists, lovers, Quora pundits and so forth than archaic humans. Networked neurochips and smart prostheses will massively augment the cognitive capacities of biological minds in a recursive cycle of self-improvement. Yet neither symbolic AI nor connectionist systems are going to \u201cwake up\u201d and become unified subjects of experience, i.e. minds running phenomenal world-simulations: us. Only phenomenal minds can understand the world. The above claims would be contested by many AI experts (cf. Church\u2013Turing thesis), although Turing machine functionalists have no explanation of how consciousness has the causal power to e.g. ask questions about its own existence. A serious answer to your question would start by defining our terms: a boring exercise, for sure, but otherwise, researchers are prone to talk past each other. Often they still do regardless. All answers to the Hard Problem of consciousness are crazy. Here, I\u2019d just like to stress one point. The conjecture that panpsychism or non-materialist physicalism is true may (or may not) deserve to be taken seriously; but panpsychism or non-materialist physicalism doesn\u2019t entail that digital AI can be any more sentient than a carrot or a rock. Believers in digital sentience need to offer a physicalist account of consciousness and phenomenal binding \u2013 or alternatively, explain why we should accept dualism or \u201cstrong\u201d emergence.

            "answer_text": "It would be important to know what the classification criteria, underlying the term \u201csuperintelligent\u201d, are. Let\u2019s see the case of the amoeba, a living organism, strongly committed to keep on living. Even though it has no brain, it exhibits a very dynamic and effective form of intentionality in the way it is able to maintain the chemical profile of its internal milieu, while, around it, in the external environment, everything changes quickly. We can state that, in terms of survival responses, an amoeba is a \u201cgenius\u201d. We can consider that, at the cellular and infracellular level, the amoeba has the reflexive typologies proper of its nature and necessary to its survival: to remain despite the fast change of the environment. An AI is an entity with a nature that is proper to it, different from a human nature. What we can consider to be a \u201csuperintelligence\u201d for the human case, may not be applicable to an AI. Is a \u201csuperintelligent\u201d AI one that finishes all the tasks for which it was built with 100% effectiveness and higher efficiency, in terms of resources and speed, satisfying the reasons for which it was built?! Or can we consider an AI as \u201csuperintelligent\u201d in the case of a transcendence in which that AI would refuse to fulfill the tasks that are given to it, as a tool, because it would consider itself an autonomy with right to refuse a condition of slavery?! As for the question \u201cWould a superintelligent AI be conscious?\u201d: reflexivity and intelligence are co-simultaneous in terms of cognitive dynamics. ",
