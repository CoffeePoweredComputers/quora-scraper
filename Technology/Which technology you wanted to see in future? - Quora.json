            "answer_text": "I\u2019m really looking forward Mixed Reality. Mixed Reality is the most recent development in the \u201creality\u201d technologies, some people don\u2019t understand the concept because there are 2 forms of these technologies that are referred to as Mixed Reality. Mixed reality that starts with the real world \u2013 virtual objects are not just overlaid on the real world but can interact with it. In this case, a user remains in the real-world environment while digital content is added to it; moreover, a user can interact with virtual objects. This form of mixed reality can be considered an advanced form of AR.Mixed reality that starts with the virtual world \u2013 the digital environment is anchored to and replaces the real world. In this case, a user is fully immersed in the virtual environment while the real world is blocked out. Sounds like virtual reality, right? In fact it does, but the digital objects overlap the real ones whereas in conventional VR the virtual environment isn\u2019t connected to the real world around a user.I have seen some demos of Skype on HoloLens and it looks amazing and terrifying at the same time. Ecommerce driven by Mixed Reality will definitely change the way we interact with products and services in the future. ",

            "answer_text": "Space X Starlink. Imagine a gigabaud broadband connection like the best direct fiber optic internet connections and lowest latency connections to boot. Right now this is only used by the super rich on a limited satellite network. It currently very expensive, bulky and full of roaming charge. Since their limited satellites are in geostationary orbit which is pretty long distance for a signal to travel they experience high latency. You could not play a first person shooter on such a network. With SpaceX Starlink up and running in as little as 2 years from now you would be getting low latency broadband connections because there are thousands of cross networked satellite in low earth orbit. Since they are built for very large scale usage their services are expected to be priced for anyone to use as a direct broadband satellite data link. It will be so cheap that even isolated 3rd world and high arctic communities can easily afford it. Yes that, unlimited, unbelievably high bandwidth direct satellite data anywhere in the world for just a few dollars a month. It can be a real thing in as little as 2 years from now as SpaceX has already deployed nearly 100 satellites this year alone so far with many more planned this year still. Starlink will also make needing to own a very expensive high end PC a thing of the past as all the heavy computer work can be done entirely in the cloud. You would only have to pay a small subscription fee to use a cloud PC like ShadowPC which only works in only a few parts of Europe or US. True high grade computing for anyone, anywhere. Yah man, play the absolute best games on their best settings in full spender while experiencing the best online game experience. Starlink And high end gaming anywhere out in the most isolated parts of the world Shadow - High-performance gaming for all ",
