            "answer_text": "Here is an answer that is also accurate, but perhaps easier to explain to people outside of physics and optics. Classically, you record a hologram by splitting a laser beam into two. Within the coherence length (not important for understanding, but look it up if you want a deeper understanding), the two beams are identical, and stay identical even once they are split. One of these beams is spread and directed onto the holographic plate (like a photographic plate but much higher resolution). This is the reference beam. The other is directed onto the object, and then bounces back onto the holographic plate. This is the object beam. Because the two beams are coherent, they interfere with each other where the two are different from each other: the difference between them is that one travelled to the object and was scattered by the object, and the other wasn't. The hologram records that difference as a pattern of light and dark (or of phase modulation). Finally, the hologram is illuminated by a new clean beam (this may be a laser beam or a spotlight, depending on the type of hologram). This reconstruction beam is very like the reference beam. When it hits the hologram, it acquires the hologram's pattern (the difference between the object and reference beam). So it turns the reconstruction beam (which looks like the reference) into the object beam (which is the beam as scattered off the object). You can see the object in three dimensions because the whole light field is reconstructed. ",

            "answer_text": "A hologram records information about light passing through a 2D region rather than light focused onto a 2D region (as in photographs). A hologram works in the same way as a photograph, in that both involve capturing an image onto a 2D image plate or film. The 2D plate contains millions of evenly distributed silver halide crystals that can become activated by light, causing them to turn black. The crystals have a binary state -- transparent or black -- and their probability of turning black increases according to the amount and intensity of light (the total number of photons) that hits them.  The difference between a photograph and a hologram is the following: A photograph captures a 2D picture of the light leaving the scene and heading toward an imaginary point at the center of a focusing lens. The imaging plate is on the other side of the lens, and so the light hitting the plate is organized in the same 2D arrangement as the scene. The advantage of this is that \"reading out\" a photograph can be done just by looking at it, or more typically, by inverting the luminosity to turn a negative into a positive, and then looking at it.    In contrast, a hologram captures a representation of the light passing through the imaging plate on its way to the viewer. (the light doesn't actually pass through during photography, but that is a detail.)  The hologram captures the light before it is focused, and thus contains information about the light from many points of view. The way this information is captured involves the magic of light wave interference patterns using lasers. The light wave interference pattern is recorded by the silver halide crystals.   The problem with a hologram is that the interference pattern on the imaging plate looks random and meaningless if viewed directly. The image must be decoded by using the same type of laser light that was used to create the image in the first place. The way decoding works is that the laser light passes though the 2D film, causing the light wave pattern that hit the plate during photography to be reconstructed. The viewer on the other side of the film is then able to view the scene as if the scene was still there. Because holograms can reconstruct the 2D scene from different points of view, the hologram looks 3D when viewed. The stereo vision of humans sees two different points of view in each eye, causing the image to appear to have depth. Holograms cannot (normally) be in color because monochromatic (single frequency) laser light must be used to reconstruct them. The holograms on credit cards are called \"rainbow holograms\" and use a trick to be able to be visible without lasers, i.e. under \"white\" light. A side-effect of this trick is that the 3D depth is only visible when the hologram is viewed upright. If you rotate a credit card 90 degrees, the 3D hologram effect goes away.

Within a room that is cross sectioned in a geodesic dome style pattern. Each of these junctures has a holo-emitter. Later shows had ships that just had little light bulby-like halo-emitters(which is kinda ? imo). They probably did the bulby-emitters because it made it easier to have holo-grams roam the ship (Message in a Bottle). The other change was a future century mobile emitter that allows the Doctor to roam around like everyone else (a bit of a guffaw, imo, but kinda fun to have the Doctor roam around, which is why that exists). Fast forward to Hirogen technology, and the books, which has outdoor emitters on a stick. So to recap Holo-emitters (or whatevers)Geo-emitters\u2014Elaborate geodesic dome style with multiple junctures to allow force field reality sensoring and realistic corporeal like light emitters to function.Bulby-emitters\u2014Basic light bulb style emitters that are placed in inconspicuous locations throughout the ship, allowing the hologram leg room to stretch and enjoy his/her freedom amongst crew-members (who doesn\u2019t want your hologram to follow you about while you work?Stick-emitters\u2014emitters that are placed on cannister like objects and project out with stick-arms to allow holo-grams to enjoy outdoor settings and even go to worlds that can\u2019t support solid life.Mobile-emitter\u2014an emitter on a broach that allows holograms free range of motion anywhere of their choosing as long as it does not get a burst of something that destablizies the holo-matrix forcing the hologram into the shelter of a Geo-emitter style room.I\u2019m sure there is more but that\u2019s what comes to mind. Essentially, their are loads of programs available that people write for holo-whatevers, sometimes they are stored in little colored tubes, or flat plastic discs and are fed into a slot and retrieved later. Sometimes the program is just there and person says \u201cComputer, run program\u201d and voile! The lights in combination with information that puts resistance in the room creates the illusion of walking, running, jumping, hiking, flying, soaring. The force field is capable creating a projectile and killing someone, or in creating a phaser that is capable of killing someone. The force field is also fully functional and is capable of \u201cgoing where no man has gone before\u201d or the reverse. There is speculation as to who cleans up afterwards in the holo-program or if the generators work like a replicator and transfers any sweat etc into material to be used for energy, etc. The holo-matrixes can be hacked and other programs can be overlaid onto them. In the case of aliens, they can also be mentally penetrated and used by aliens to check out things in the humanoid realm. It\u2019s pretty fuzzy if not fantasy science. I do know that there is a TV that has been in production for over 20 years that has emitters that give a 3 D feel, and that characters will be able to be switched with any that you prefer in the shows. We already have seen celebrities who have had their shows recreated via this type of technology so that they can give stand-up routines posthumorously, Joan Rivers is one of those celebrities who has a routine that can be played, I believe it is in Vegas.[1] Footnotes[1] Andy Kaufman and Redd Foxx to Tour, Years After Death, as Holograms",

            "answer_text": "Holography is the science and practice of making holograms. And a hologram is a physical recording of an interference pattern which uses diffraction to produce a three-dimensional light field, resulting in an image that retains the depth and other properties of the original scene. The construction process of a hologram 1. The phenomenon of interference is what helps with the recording of a hologram. 2. It requires a source of the laser, beam splitter, an object, and a photographic plate. 3. The beam splitter splits the laser beam; one part of it strikes the photographic plate, which is called a reference beam. The other part of the split beam on the photographic plate after suffering reflection from several points of object; hence, it is called an object beam. 4. The superposition of both beams produces an interference pattern which is recorded on a photographic plate called a hologram. The technique of holography allows the display of three-dimensional effects or images. In packaging, this technology is often used for special embossed material combined with special inks and printing techniques. The effects are created by metalizing the substance\u2019s surface with a tiny layer of silver aluminum. The surface structure diffracts the light beam resulting in a three-dimensional appearance. Moreover, holography is a major thing in brand protection solutions as it helps incorporate authentication features embedded in the latest technologies to differentiate between original and the knock off. While there are several major players in the packaging industry, one of the most trusted and technologically equipped ones is UFlex. Equipped with the world\u2019s best and most extensive range of the latest high-tech machinery, the packaging company can fulfill all the holographic films requirements. ",

            "answer_text": "How do holograms work? Here\u2019s an in-depth description from Wikipedia: Holography . A shorter answer: Holography is a (potentially) lens-less form of photography where rather than capturing a focused image on a sensitized medium, a light field is captured. I added the \u201cpotentially\u201d because some holography set-ups do use lenses, but not in the same way an ordinary camera does. At it\u2019s simplest, a hologram is captured when a laser is split into two beams, one of which is directed to shine on the subject of the hologram and the other is shone on the sensitized medium. Here\u2019s Wikipedia\u2019s diagram:  Notice that the light reflected from the object intersects the light that comes directly from the laser (via splitter and mirror.) This sets up a light field of interference patterns that is what is actually captured by the medium, in this case a photographic plate. The plate is then developed and looks like\u2026a fogged sheet of photographic film, mainly because that is precisely what it is. But if the original laser shines on the plate again:  The light field is recreated and a virtual image of the original subject can be seen. If the viewer shifts position slightly, a slightly different angle on the subject will be seen. Imagine if the plate were merely a pane of glass and the viewer looked through that pane at the original object. If they shifted position, you can easily imagine how the view would change. The hologram\u2019s \u201cview\u201d works in the same way. Now, let\u2019s take that photographic plate, or sheet of film, and cut it in half. Illuminate each half with the laser and\u2026.they each have a view onto the original scene. I know that all kinds of ideas about holograms have emerged from pop culture where sf movies show moving 3D images all the time and call them \u201cholograms.\u201d I appreciate the speculation on what might, someday, happen. But holograms are already pretty cool without needing to confuse them with a lot of imaginary stuff. ",

            "answer_text": "How holograms work Laser light is much purer than the ordinary light in a torch beam. In a torch beam, all the light waves are random and jumbled up. Light in a torch beam runs along any old how, like schoolchildren racing down a corridor when the bell goes for home time. But in a laser, the light waves are coherent: they all travel precisely in step, like soldiers marching on parade.  When a laser beam is split up to make a hologram, the light waves in the two parts of the beam are traveling in identical ways. When they recombine in the photographic plate, the object beam has traveled via a slightly different path and its light rays have been disturbed by reflecting off the outer surface of the object. Since the beams were originally joined together and perfectly in step, recombining the beams shows how the light rays in the object beam have been changed compared to the reference beam. In other words, by joining the two beams back together and comparing them, you can see how the object changes light rays falling onto it\u2014and that's simply another way of saying \"what the object looks like.\" This information is burned permanently into the photographic plate by the laser beams. Hologram is effectively a permanent record of what something looks like seen from any angle. ",

            "answer_text": "Normally when light is incident on something (such as a photographic medium), what is recorded is just the intensity of the light.  The intensity of a ray of light contains \"half\" of the information of the ray: if you think of the rays of light as described by a complex scalar field [math]u[/math], then the intensity is [math]|u|^2[/math].  Becuse the intensity drops the phase of the incident wave, if we look the intensity pattern, we will not truly see something that appears three dimensional, because as light propagates through space its phase changes, and will change at different rates depending on the distance traveled. As hinted at above, most photographic media record an image by responding to the intensity in some manner.   Suppose the field [math]u_{\\mathrm{I}}[/math] represents the image you want to record.   The trick behind a hologram is as follows: let [math]u_{\\mathrm{R}}[/math] be a (strong) reference beam, and allow the photographic medium to record the combined field [math]u_{\\mathrm{I}} + u_{\\mathrm{R}}[/math].   The intensity is then proportional to  [math]|u|^2=|u_{\\mathrm{I}}|^2 + |u_{\\mathrm{R}}|^2 + u_{\\mathrm{R}}{u_{\\mathrm{I}}}^* +u_{\\mathrm{I}}{u_{\\mathrm{R}}}^* [/math] Certainly, the above expression depends on both the amplitude and phase of the incident image wave that we wanted to record.

If the light is observed at some distance from the sources, and, say, recorded on a photographic plate, an interference pattern will appear which depends on the incident amplitude and phase (as Andrew Lucas has mathematically stated).  In effect, the pattern has encoded information about the two point sources that generated it.  If one were to properly illuminate the pattern, the two point sources would indeed be reconstructed. Now consider having many point sources, such as an illuminated object.  The resulting interference pattern would be very complex, often not visible to the naked eye.  This is the reason for having high-resolution holographic emulsions which are typically at 5000 line-pairs/mm and higher.  Nevertheless, the recorded pattern has encoded everything about the object from every vantage point within the field-of-view of the photographic plate.  In other words, the interference of every wavefront from every point on the object, recorded at a specific time, amplitude and phase is on the plate!  When properly illuminated, the complex pattern will yield the image of the object. What's even more amazing is if the plate were broken into several pieces, each piece will have the ability to recreate the ENTIRE scene! ",
