            "answer_text": "As previously said, it depends which parts you print, how you design them, and what you print them out of. There's also something to be said about post-processing the printed parts (annealing and other things, for example can increase the durability of a part to some extent if done correctly). Although, 3d printing is done in layers, which create many, many, many points of potential structural failure. That being said, it's impractical to attempt to print a fully-functioning rifle, for example, because you'd essentially be printing something the size of a black powder cannon for the barrel \u2014 unless it was chambered for something like a .22LR as stated in the previous answer. Personally, I enjoy the idea of being able to apply 3d printing technology to firearms \u2014 the disclaimer here being that I'd mainly use it for customization purposes, and, if the material properties would allow, saving money on upgrades by printing some of the internals (except the firing pin, or on older guns, the hammer \u2014 which likely need to remain metal). Where I would NOT utilize 3d printing for a firearm is in regards to the high-stress or high-heat components and things you absolutely DO NOT want to fail catastrophically. The barrel, for example. You could print a housing or a seating for the barrel, but you wouldn't want to print the barrel itself. If a 3d printed barrel fails, it's going to do so by blowing up in your face. There are immense pressure (and heat) levels inside the barrel of a gun when said gun is fired, and as such, I would not advocate printing high-stress parts such as the barrel if one were to combine 3d printing and guns. To go back to the customization and printing some of the internals, this would be totally fine. Custom grip panels on a 1911? Sure. Custom furniture on an AR-15? Totally doable. A nice little tidbit to toss in at this point is the Sig Sauer P320 handgun.  See that little window with the numbers in it? This particular handgun is actually a separated fire control unit that drops into the grip.  In case you don't know how gun regulations work, the actual firearm is defined as whatever part of the gun holds the firing mechanism \u2014 that's what gets regulated, so that's what gets serialized. This means that this gun is able to just be one little piece that can have any frame, any slide, and any barrel and other stuff (provided they match the gun, or are at least compatible somehow). Most guns, on the other hand, don't do that, and instead have the fire control group spread throughout some part of the gun, making any attempts at customization far more involved or very limited. So in this case, maybe one size frame is too thin for your hand, but the next size up too thick. Find or model one up that matches, but has a wider grip, or a larger palm swell, or any of that. While you're at it, add in some little custom details. Maybe a little dragon embossed on the side. Maybe a cheeky little \u201cPew pew\u201d on the side instead. Maybe a custom grip texture. That's all totally doable if you apply 3d printing to this particular gun \u2014 as long as you leave the window for the serial number to be visible. Also, 3d printing is an excellent way to customize your gun, because of all the different colors and materials available for use in your 3d printer. But that's another answer entirely. In short, entirely-3d printed guns (at average consumer levels anyway) are not safe. Guns that only have 3d-printed cosmetic customizations (furniture, maybe some internals \u2014 not the firing pin), however, I would expect to be safe. Although, I wouldn't 3d print some part of a gun and then necessarily expect it to survive getting run over by a semi or survive a significant fall. The layers or material itself would likely cause that part to shatter. ",
