            "answer_text": "Hello Ashok, There are very many factors which seem to have come together to produce our Earth including our harmonized planetary and solar system which have resulted in our various climates, seasons, life support systems with elements, terrain, oceans, plant, animal and human life Some people believe all this happened by chance and others including myself conclude it was not by chance but resulting from a series of events planned by a being who exists beyond space and time. The probability of another similar earth forming event with similar planetary and solar systems to ours by chance is for all practical purposes zero. So it is practically impossible to discover another earth similar to ours unless the timeless and extra-spatial being who could have made it happen did so and communicated the same to us. ",
