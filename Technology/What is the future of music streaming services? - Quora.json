            "answer_text": "This is a great question. From a business development perspective the big question is whether or not standalone streaming can ever generate long-term profit. Companies like Spotify, Apple, Google, Napster, and others are iterating so quickly to develop the \u201cgotta-have-it\u201d feature set that will send their paid user count through the roof and tip the economies of scale in their direction.From a technology perspective the big question is what users want. Everyone is pretty darn comfy with the $10/month price point of streaming services, and getting them to budge will require a massive technology driver. TIDAL tried it with high-def audio. Maybe VR?From a royalty and payments perspective the big question is who can deliver global royalties fastest, most efficiently, and most accurately. Companies like MediaNet, SOCAN, Kobalt, and others are pouring countless dollars and hours into building the payment pipelines of the future.The future of streaming music belongs to whomever\u2019s vision of that future bears enough possible ROI to continue generating outside financing into the foreseeable future. Personally, I hope the future of streaming music integrates live concert experiences \u2014 presented in real time \u2014 and possibly VR or AR. There are so many concerts I\u2019d love to attend but can\u2019t for geographical reasons. Pipe them into my home, though, and I might very well pay a \u201cdigital experience\u201d ticket price. ",
