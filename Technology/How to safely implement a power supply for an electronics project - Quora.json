            "answer_text": "How do you safely implement a power supply for an electronics project? A2A Depends on the project. I used to build 100w power amps, the power supply was a massive transformer, several massive capacitors, a bridge rectifier, and one or two more bits. Built into an earthed aluminium chassis, and correctly fused. Nowadays if I build a microcontroller project, they can mostly be supplied by 5v at 50mA - 1000mA. If mains powered, I use a USB brick. If battery powered, I use a small power bank - the auto-on versions, generally without switches. If power demand is below 80mA I have the microcontroller take a current pulse periodically to keep the bank turned on. ",
