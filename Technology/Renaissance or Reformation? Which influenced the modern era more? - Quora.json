            "answer_text": "If we accept common usage, it would be hard to argue with the assertion that the Reformation influenced the modern era more.  The Renaissance was mainly an aesthetic movement\u2014the revival of the classical in architecture, art, to some extent in letters\u2014which did not impact or fundamentally threaten either secular or ecclesiastical authority.  The Reformation, on the other hand, challenged and ultimately upended the authority of the Catholic church, resulted in the defection from the Church of most of the states of Northern Europe, turned the German states into horrific scenes of bloodletting during the 30 Years War, and remade (mainly in the course of that war) Europe, and thence much of the rest of the world: The Reformation (and the reaction to it) gave the world a completely new idea of nation and of the nation-state (we still refer to this as the Westphalian nation-state), and of the relationship between church and state. It also gave impetus to science and other intellectual endeavors that involved direct or indirect challenge to religious authority\u2014chiefly, the political philosophies that were the foundation of major political systems today, from liberalism Fascism to Marxism-Leninism.

            "answer_text": "This question is hard to answer. First off, one of its two options is suggesting that we 'owe' all we have today to a religious schism... that, itself is debatable, as religion invented little outside of itself. And the two are so intertwined that it's hard to separate them from their context and attribute an 'importance' (over the other) individually... The Renaissance itself owes its existence first to the 13th-century spread of universities (education) through Europe (after the success of the initial 'teacher-student tradesman corporation' initiatives created in 1088 Bologna, then later Paris); these 'tradesman education' roots led to architectural innovation, which led to cathedrals, which led to Vatican-initiative 'cathedral schools'; Italy and France's regents at the end of the 12th century 'merged' 'corporation and cathedral' by placing them under ecclesiastical control (as 'universities'), and through that, the Vatican still managed to control 'non-religious' ideas and expression through Europe. Still, they 'allowed' certain new schools of thought to emerge, namely when they allowed the study (and translation) of classical Greek philosophers/literature at the end of the 14th century, and the adoption of these 'humanist' ideas is arguably when the Renaissance began. Yet the 'gathering of educated minds' that were universities led to ideas that emerged all the same; the discovery, importation and translation of ancient Greek bible manuscripts in the 15th century (after the fall of Constantinople) began a movement to 'reform' the new testament in a format closer to the 'original', and the Vatican 'silencing' of this movement did a lot to create the dividing lines that later led to the Reformation. But that schism was a rather a side-product of the 'innovation' that was education, and all that surrounds us is a product of innovation, too. Through all the above, religion was doing all it could to suppress freedom of non-religious expression, and by the 16th century, things were growing beyond their control. The Reformation was important here, though, because they set the (emotional, political) precedent of living outside Vatican control to a population who until then probably didn't even imagine that such a thing was possible. The 'route to today' from there is much more complicated, but let us say that the loss of Vatican 'credibility' (trepidation at their total control) in the common mind led many more to 'dare' to defy them, or to think outside the boundaries set by them, which led to more innovation, which probably led to the printing press, which led to even more widespread education, which led to... the modern era. The 'most influential' I see in all the above is a 'break from (stagnant) unithought', and a rise in education. The Reformation created their own brand of unithought from another, but at least they showed that it was possible to 'change one's mind' and defy questionable authority. The Renaissance is what happens with education, and it came about in spite of religion (and beside the Reformation). ",
