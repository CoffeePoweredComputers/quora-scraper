            "answer_text": "To answer this question it may be useful to first note that the difference between Gingerbread and Ice Cream Sandwich was a major re-write and the difference between ICS and Jelly Bean was a refinement (based on the project Butter program) Part of Apple's dominance in the early part of the smart phone wars was due to the solid, smooth working iOS on the iPhone. All Android OS versions before ICS were simply not up to the standard of iOS. There are a number of reasons for that including the fact Apple makes the hardware, software and processors for their phone enabling them to achieve tighter integration. The release of the Samsung Galaxy Nexus with Ice Cream Sandwich changed all that. Google fundamentally changed a number of key things as it relates to the way consumers interact with the phone. Efficiency, measured by the number of steps to achieve a given task, is one of the most important metrics when evaluating a smart phone. ICS made Android far more efficient. The number one way that was accomplished was by adding the all important ribbon to the OS. In fact it is so important to Android that Google gave it a dedicated button on the right. The ribbon tracks all running apps and allows you to jump right to the app exactly where you left off, based on a visual representation of the app, or close the app with a simple flick off the screen. The importance of this addition cannot be overstated. App management was one of the main weak points of Android before that. Now with two easy strokes you can get to any app or process you want. An equally important companion to the ribbon is the notification bar. While the bar has been a long time fixture of Android OS it was significantly upgraded in ICS to give you more info such as an image of the person sending the communication (assuming you have one). In Jelly Bean, Google has gone even further. You can now take action on notifications directly from the redesigned notifications shade, which means you don't necessarily have to go to the app to execute your action.  That means less steps and more efficient use of the device. One feature that is often overlooked in ICS/JB is context memory. If you are reading an email and want to go to a link in the email you simply click the link and the browser opens it. Nothing special there. But when you want to go back to the same email, you simply click the back button. Without context memory the back button might take you up a level in the browser then you would have to go to the ribbon or home to get back to your email. Now ICS/JB take you right back to the exact spot you were in your email. I have found the context memory is extremely good at guessing where you want to be when you use the back button and not just taking you up a level. There are many other refinements such as smoother actions, a far more solid feeling user experience, no need to reboot your phone, less lag, better voice recognition, more flexibility in placement of apps & widgets but the overall efficiency improvements achieved with the addition of the three main features I have outlined makes Android a worthy contender as the best smart phone OS out there. I cannot speak to other phones with ICS or Jelly Bean because I have not used them extensively but I highly recommend the Google pure Android flagship  phone because of the tight integration and improved performance and efficiency. At the end of the day, all the fancy additional features or even a faster processor doesn't matter nearly as much as that. ",

            "answer_text": "From my personal experience, other than the obvious improvements in speed and app integration, the SINGLE greatest difference between these two Android OS's is the ability (or non-ability in JB) for a user to save apps to the external SD card. Yes, this ability was removed in ICS, but since the question was specific to GB vs. JB (a leap I personally made this week when I upgraded my original Galaxy Tab 7 to the newer Tab 2 10.1), I was able to easily relearn every nuance from GB to JB except for the inability to save my apps to the SD card instead of everything but photos, videos and music having to stay on internal memory. I had fully expected to be able to simply swap the current SD card in my Tab 7 to the Tab 2 10.1 and go (naive person that I was) but it has taken MUCH more time and effort because of this single greatest difference between the two. Since I had nearly 10GB of apps and app related info on the SD card, and opted for the only available version of the Tab 2 10.1 from any 4G carrier (the 8GB version) I have found myself having to cull through and severely limit the number of apps on the new device. Oddly enough, I did quite a bit of research before upgrading my device, but I was dumbfounded when I discovered this 'flaw' in an otherwise great upgrade between the GB I had been using on my 7 inch tablet and the JB the new one came with. Staying as informed as I try to be with new technology, I just can't get my head around why Google and Android would remove perhaps the single biggest advantage they had over Apple's iOS in the ability to use an external SD card to save apps AND other files in GB, instead of filling up internal memory with everything but extraneous media files in JB. I find myself hoping that the next version of Android will return to this smart external memory advantage. Until then, I will extoll the other virtues of JB while musing on the lost virtues of GB. ",

            "answer_text": "I would say the feature I use the most in Android 4 that wasn't anywhere near as good in Android 2 is the improved voice recognition. It's faster, it streams, and on Jelly Bean it doesn't require a connection. In second place I would say would be the recent apps button, being able to see all running apps with a screenshot. The swipe to dismiss in this menu as well as in notifications are really cool too. Other reasons I wanted to switch to Android 4 include: Viewing notifications on lock screenResizable widgets, especially for tabletsData usage tracking (especially with carriers phasing out unlimited data)Improved native apps: save for offline reading / view desktop version in browser, easier sharing, photo editing, zero shutter lag in cameraHolo themes: system apps look sleeker and less clunky",
