They look old and drab with collapsing bridges and failing infrastructure, but The Wall the corporations and the politicians are making on the southern boarder, that should be pretty futuristic, GREAT futuristic! But I\u2019m betting on crumbling cities in the US for decades to come due to neglect and indifference in the sty of consumerism. Failure of nuclear energy facilities more prominent, and natural disasters awashed on every shore! Personal flying drones over the relics of our ancestors is what I imagine in the future! (sarcasm dripping) Internationally? Pudong, China and Dubai! LOL ",

The skyline has changed so much over the last decade that I wasn\u2019t sure where I was on a freeway that I had traveled many, many times. From the Salesforce Tower to the Transamerica Pyramid, this could easily be a scene from one of many sci-fi or futuristic movies\u2026  ",
