            "answer_text": "For some people, they're willing to drive longer distances to get to work - mostly because it's hard to find a job locally. For me, it's the opposite. 30 years ago, I drove 28 miles one way to get to my job. Today, I drive 7 miles one way. I don't think 50 years is going to show a lot of difference. 1970's were different, yes, but not THAT different in terms of driving cars. With the exception of efficiency. 70's cars were heavy old boats and gas guzzlers, but people didn't mind because that's what was normal. Things that have changed is that wearing a seat belt is a law now. Steering columns have improved for safety purposes, and you're going to have a harder time messing around with a carburetor. I miss my old beast, but I'm glad newer cars have advanced the way they have. I once owned a van that got about 4 miles to the gallon, had a foot of play in the steering wheel, no power brakes or power steering, crank windows, it couldn't go over 40mph, and it was unsafe as hell. It served as an emergency vehicle until I was able to replace it with something better. ",

            "answer_text": "In the UK, there are vastly more cars on the roads than there were when I was at school. I stopped using the bus as soon as I could get a car because the buses to the suburbs of Edinburgh stopped earlier than I finished work on a Thursday. And I would need to take a taxi if I went out at the weekend. Now, there are buses 24hours a day, but it takes too long to get to where I work, so I use the car some days and cycle the 20 miles on others. Traffic is still much quieter than it was before lockdown as most office workers still work from home. Cycling is increasingly popular for a commute. ",
