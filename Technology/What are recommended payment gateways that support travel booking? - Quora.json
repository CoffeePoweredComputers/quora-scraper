            "answer_text": "When collecting payments for travel you want to make sure the payment getaway has reasonable settlement rules (measured in days not months) and does not aggressively block credit card transactions. Some companies are using the same payment gateway account (integrated into their booking platform) which can lead to a poor reputation for your travel brand if the gateway restricts ALL businesses due to the poor behavior of a few. When choosing a travel booking platform to support your travel business make sure it\u2019s integrated with more than one global payment gateway. For example, our company, YouLi Travel Management Platform, is integrated with Stripe and Square by default, and will integrate additional getaways for Enterprise clients. One of the benefits of using a platform that allows you to manage your gateway independently is that you can switch gateways without having to switch your trip management software. So if Square offers a better price or settlement terms, you can switch from Stripe to Square with a few clicks and your clients will not be impacted. ",
