            "answer_text": "Totally, you just can\u2019t beat it spec-wise and price-wise! Spec-wise: Camera: You need a good camera? - 48MP main camera. You need to zoom it but it should be clear? - 2X Telephoto. You want to cover the whole building but you got no space to move back? - Wide Angle. Or do you even want to see something small that your eye can\u2019t see? - Super Macro Shot (It\u2019s unbelievable).Display: Looking for a phone with a wide aspect ratio? - Look not, this is the one! You want videos to look catchy? - Just enable the video enhancer (Got some really good feedback from friends). You want things to look smooth and not just fast - Enable the 90 Hz (Its eye treating)Speaker: This time, not just one, it's double the fun. Things feel to make more sense\u2026things happening on left is heard on the left and vice-versa. It didn\u2019t divide the power for two speakers, but became twice as powerful!Battery and Dash charger: Charging - Its fast! So, why do you need a fancy wireless charger if you are not planning to use it enough? The battery may not be huge, but good enough to give phone balanced weight and backup.Customization: You like black/white theme, double-tap/single tap to wake, gestures/button control. What not? You got everything you need here. No gimmicks to make phone slow!Updates: Is your Oneplus phone one/two/three years old? You still get the support and care from Oneplus. How? Was your Oneplus phone\u2019s last update more than 6 months ago?Storage and RAM: 8 GB RAM run phone like butter. There nothing the phone can\u2019t handle. You like any app, then hit the install button. There is no stopping! No SD card slot? Everything is cloud these days, so do you need an SD card to reduce privacy?Design: I am in love with all of their design. Oneplus X - Buttery smooth back. Oneplus 3 - Strong metallic body. Oneplus 7T - Shiny smooth body.Price-wise: You get Oneplus 7T for 35,000 rupees (India), which is half of Samsung Galaxy S10 plus of 71,000. This is not the best phone, but best for the price -> So, it is worth buying! Lets make world a better place\u2026at least one thing a day\u2026 \u201ctry forgiving, try helping, try consoling people\u201d. Thanks for reading (smile). ",

            "answer_text": "Greetings! OnePlus launched their latest flagship Oneplus 7t with Snapdragon 855+ which is the latest processor from Qualcomm.The smartphone is launched at Rs 37,000.It is a good value for money smartphone.Like every OnePlus smartphone,this also doesn't have Certified IP 68 rating and wireless charging as well(Hopefully they will provide both the features next year in their upcoming smartphones because of the increasing price of their smartphone every year). It is an upgrade over the OnePlus 7 which was launched earlier this year.In terms of camera,One plus decided to go with triple camera setup on Oneplus 7t. The three cameras are i)Primary Camera. ii)Ultra Wide. iii)Telephoto while OnePlus 7 has i)Primary Camera. ii)Depth Sensor Battery of Oneplus 7t is 100 mah more than the Oneplus 7.Overall,compared to the OnePlus 7 it is definitely an upgrade.Oneplus 7t has a refresh rate of 90 hz which is present on 7pro and not on 7.The snapdragon 855+ is clocked 15% more than the Snapdragon 855.So definately,7t is a good device as compared to Oneplus 7. But,Asus Rog 2 is more better option than the 7t as well as 7.If you are a gamer you are definitely going to love Asus Rog 2.The liking of the design of both the phones depends on the consumer.Because,the circular camera setup is kind of boring and Asus Rog 2 design is also likable to some extent.(For people who don't care about design but rather care about the specs.) But,the Rog 2 is beast.it has more battery than the 7t.Rog 2 has a refresh rate of 120 hz,while 7t has 90 hz.There is a headphone jack on Rog 2 which is missing on 7t.Surprisingly,Rog 2 beats the camera of 7T.The rog 2 is surely a beast for gamers. OnePlus has launched a good smartphone and it is an upgrade over 7t.But,surely can't deny the fact that Rog 2 is more powerful and a best flagship under 40,000 because of its aggresive pricing.OnePlus should give certified IP ratings to smartphone and wireless charging also because of their premium price.Overall,7t is a good phone for Day to day usage.But surely Rog 2 WINS!! Better than oneplus 7 if you don't have any budget limit and a fanboy of OnePlus. ",
