I\u2019d suggest you change it to something else ASAP.If it\u2019s in a shop, restaurant or similar, it is often printed on the receipt, on a sign, or is available from the staff.If it\u2019s a hotel, you will normally get it with your check-in or room paperwork.If it\u2019s your next door neighbours, you knock on the door and ask them.If it\u2019s one of the \u2018public\u2019 WiFi networks, you normally have to sign up. Many will let you do that just by connecting, but for the others you need to sign up on a different connection first.",
