            "answer_text": "On an average Luxembourg gives the most salary to its workers. However Luxembourg has nearly zero crime rate. So I am not sure if there is any scope of a forensic scientist. On 2nd place is USA in terms of salaries so my guess will be forensic scientists should have the brightest career in the USA as it has ample crime and good salaries. ",
