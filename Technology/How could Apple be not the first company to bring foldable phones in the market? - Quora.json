            "answer_text": "I think you should rephrase the question, assuming you\u2019re talking about foldable screens not just foldable phones. If this is the case, you should also know Apple would never release a product containing features which have not been extensively tested. That\u2019s the reason they would probably wait a bit before releasing a 5G smartphone. Thing is, they want to be absolutely sure that everything which has the Apple logo is working perfectly with all infancy diseases already cured. New technology has bugs in 99.999% of the cases, which must be taken care of before a product is released to the market. Imagine paying a huge premium on a foldable screen device just to see it breaking within a short period of time because the manufacturer overestimated the number of folding cycles the screen can take. Even if you get a refund or get the device repaired for free, you would most probably lose any confidence in that line of products. Assuming foldable screen devices will hit the market sooner or later, if I were Apple I\u2019d also wait until this technology is proven reliable during real life usage tests. People want reliable devices, not just fancy gimmicks. ",

            "answer_text": "Because Apple isn\u2019t magic. And Apple releases things when they\u2019re ready. Think about this: Samsung and others have shown off phones that are foldable and cost around $1,500. Apple hasn\u2019t shown off anything it\u2019s working on. The latest we\u2019ve got front Apple is iPhone XS. Apple could have a foldable phone in its labs. Their patents suggest they\u2019re working on it. They could be waiting for it to become mainstream. To go into iPhone, Apple needs to be able to mass produce technology on an insane scale. Plus, Apple might want it to become cheaper, so they can put it in phones that cost \u00a3999, not phones that cost 50% more. ",
