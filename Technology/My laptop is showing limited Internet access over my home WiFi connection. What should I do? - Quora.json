            "answer_text": "Let's try to understand the problem first. You are getting message of Limited Access when you are connected to your wi-fi. It means you are connected to your Router but there is no internet or there is internet but your computer isn't able to recieve that. It means your LAN card is working fine. Now we have 3 different steps to fix this issue but before going further just restart your computer. 1. Disconnect your computer from your wifi and re-connect it. If this works then no need to follow other steps. 2.Go in Start menu and search CMD or Command Prompt. A black window will be pop up on your screen. You need to type further commands : ipconfig/release then press enter, ipconfig/renew then press enter, netsh winsock reset then press enter. Restart your computer. Normally it should work by now. Still if you are facing the same issue then, follow 3rd step 3. Restart your Router/gateway router. And follow step 2 before restarting and if it still doesn't work then contact your ISP (Internet Service Provider). At this point there is no issue in your computer because you are already connected to your network. It is just your network. I hope it helps. Thanks. ",
