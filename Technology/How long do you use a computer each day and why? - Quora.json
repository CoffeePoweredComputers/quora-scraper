Whenever I\u2019m working it kind of throws me off and there are days where I won\u2019t use my laptop at all. I also kind of have friends and that throws me off from computering (yes, computering). Oh, and school! Whenever I\u2019m using it, it\u2019s typically for binge-watching (which could take up a little less than half a day when I include looking up definitions, reading articles about the show, etc), editing my blog and/or writing poetry, reading articles outside of binge-watching, and I\u2019ve now become accustomed to using Quora on a daily basis, whether it be on my laptop or my phone. I should get some sunshine. ",

The reason why is I need to for my job in IT. While I\u2019ll still read textbooks on my own time, it\u2019s not very common at work for learning. ",
