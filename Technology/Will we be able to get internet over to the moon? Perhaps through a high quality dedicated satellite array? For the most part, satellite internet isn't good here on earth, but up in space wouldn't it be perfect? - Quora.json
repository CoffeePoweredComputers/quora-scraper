            "answer_text": "Regular Internet won't work from the earth to the moon - the latency gets annoying. You don't want to have to wait a second or so between packets. But NASA is looking at more suitable protocols. You can't get around speed of light delay, but you can stream and fix errors later rather than retry immediately. You could make regular local Internet with email and google servers, but video would be laggy. As I recall, you need three ground stations on Earth to keep contact with the moon, handing off as the earth rotates. Or one could use Musks new satellite Internet constellation, routing signals between the satellites as for terrestrial Internet then to a lunar-pointing antenna ",

            "answer_text": "Yes it is potentially possible to include the moon within the Internet protocol structures. There are certain limitations, the first is that data rates will be much slower, and the other is that it would have a terrible PING . Infact the ping would be so bad, that every standard protocol would timeout ..but of course we could devise another time rate.The fundamental program is that the speed od light or radio is finite. ",
