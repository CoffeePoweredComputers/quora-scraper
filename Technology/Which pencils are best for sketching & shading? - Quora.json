            "answer_text": "When it comes to sketching and shading\u2026some people get confused that which pencil should they use. Pencils matter a lot when you wanna work efficiently. All your time and efforts may go in vain without the selection of proper pencils. Different Artists like different types of pencils. I used to sketch in pencil since the beginning. Then I wanted to work with some better quality pencils to do the sketching, but couldn't decide what pencils to purchase...I definitely made the right choice here. Staedtler Mars Lumograph and Faber-Castell pencils! These pencils are perfection. For anyone who has ever used a 'cheap' pencil, you will notice immediately the difference. These pencils are smooth, and they glide onto the paper with such ease, like a knife through butter...wonderful. the way they blend on the paper is really heart winning. There are no 'gritty' bits in the lead. The pencils are not round in shape, they are hexaganel, which personally, I find fit easier in the hand, and do not slip from your fingers. They also sharpen without breaking (use a Staedtler sharpener). I use both normal lead pencils and mechanical pencils of both the brands. As I have been sketching for quite a long time now, I would say that Staedtler Mars Lumograph and Faber-Castell pencils are now my only choice. Buy Staedtler Mars Lumograph pencils with confidence!!! You can see my work with these pencils below and I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll love the way they blend:   PS: For the darkest shade, like shown in the above sketch, you can use Staedtler Mars Lumograph EE pencil or a Charcoal pencil ;) ",

            "answer_text": "thank you for A2A \u2026 Shraddha J Agarwal For sketching and shading , I would strongly suggest you to go with the one you are comfortable with. There are many options available in the market , considering a generalized category , wooden. (normal pencils)mechanical.these pencils have a range of graphite types used, which is, 9H -9B,  image courtesy- google. wooden pencils. you will need ,obviously a sharpener or a cutter always handy to get those leads straight or blunt as you wish.you will have to have all the above mentioned graphite shades if not into blending while shading, a bit complex text to change them while sketching and then remembering which one will match. (frustrating)you will surely need to have those pencil extenders.mechanical pencils. I find them a bit comfortable, because you don\u2019t need to sharpen them, but keep on clicking them.It gives a bit less lead area, as they are sharp enough and so you need go through working a bit more.You will need to keep on changing types of graphite leads as per usage if not into blending . But you will have leads in boxes labeled!You don\u2019t need any extenders.WHAT I PREFER? I personally prefer mechanical pencils as I don\u2019t need to change those leads, less frustrating task.no, extenders!long lasting.labeled leads.I am into blending so, i use 5B,6B,5H,6H,4B only.And do use what ever you are comfortable with. THANK YOU. ",
