Pew breaks it down demographically in the following way: Non-Internet users are split equally between men and women; not dramatically split along racial lines, except for Asians (20 percent of black people, 18 percent of Hispanic people, 14 percent of whites, five percent of Asians); are generally older (39 percent of the folks are over 65 years old); have lower income (those who earn less than $30,000 make up a quarter of the non-Internet users) and lower levels of education (33 percent have less than a high school diploma); and live in rural areas (24 percent).

Have a friend who refuses to use it. He has a basic flip phone and uses it only for calls. Won\u2019t learn to text, use the camera, or any other feature. Says he doesn\u2019t want to fool with all that. I think as we get older we just don\u2019t want to get into another realm that seems alien to us. As for myself, I love the world it\u2019s opened to me. The knowledge out there is unlimited and because of the web, it\u2019s accessible to everyone. To each, their own. ",
