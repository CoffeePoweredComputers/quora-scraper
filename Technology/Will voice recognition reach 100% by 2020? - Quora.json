            "answer_text": "There\u2019s an old adage in computer science (I mean, \u201cold\u201d for computer science): Garbage in, garbage out This becomes highly relevant for voice recognition: there is a lot of noise in the data. The same person at different times of day, feeling a bit tired or under the weather, using a different microphone, using the same microphone in a different location in the same room, \u2026 all introduce variance in the signals. As the models improve, and the feature sets become better and better, it is still likely that the differences between different people will not always be greater than the differences due to the signal variance. This means that a perfect voice recognizer cannot exist. To each anywhere near 100% we would need either a highly controlled environment in a noise-free room, using top-level microphones (plural, to catch more information about physical aspects of the physiology of the person) or vast amounts of data (years worth of speech from any individual), or preferably both.

            "answer_text": "Short answer: NO. I don\u2019t think it will ever be possible to have 100% accuracy. Having said that, I believe the short-term goal is to have accurate enough models so that the voice interface can replace the text interfaces of today. As Andrew Ng points out in the following video, a small improvement in the speech recognition accuracy can have a huge impact on the user experience and the usability.  I think the focus will mostly shift towards the context-aware voice recognition after a certain point. I believe this will be critical to design powerful conversational interfaces. ",
