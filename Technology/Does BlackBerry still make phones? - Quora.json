            "answer_text": "BlackBerry hasn't made any smartphones since late 2016. They essentially licensed their brand name to TCL which now manufactures BlalckBerry phones. Their phones are still decent but they tend to be overpriced. Software support kinda sucks as they don't get Android updates and security patches as quickly as other flagship devices. TCL itself has a questionable quality control track record and you'll frequently find people complaining about hardware issues plaguing their devices on reddit and various forum threads. Unless you're a diehard fan, there's literally no reason to buy a BB device when there are better alternatives out there. ",

The last one actually produced by BlackBerry itself was the PRIV. Another company, TCL, now produces BlackBerry Android devices under licence from BlackBerry. BlackBerry the company now deals 100% in security and other software. ",

While BlackBerry themselves no longer produce phones in house, they have partnered with TCL Communications to establish BlackBerry limited, which produces phones under the BlackBerry brand. Their latest phone is the BlackBerry Key2. You can find them by searching BlackBerry limited on Google. I'm currently typing this on a BlackBerry PRIV, and I love it. ",

They\u2019ve out-sourced the actual manufacturing to a company called TCL and re-branded their mobile division into BlackBerry Mobile. This is pretty common with most brands. They'll design their phones under a division of their company and then have another company manufacture them. ",

They only have a handful of models, and the company is offering half their lineup as Android phones and half as native Blackberry phones, utilizing the Bkackberry operating system. The two operating systems are similar. I prefer the Blackberry OS. Their market share is very small, and they don't seem to be trying to change that fact. There seems to be a lack of interest in the company, and I would presume that many investors see it as a waste of money. There doesn\u2019t seem to be any Real dynamic force running the company. The Phones are quality phones but with a few drawbacks. The Non Android phones suffer from a lack of support and a lack of innovation. ",

            "answer_text": "I'd say modern BlackBerries are some of the best devices they've ever made (with the exception that \u201cflip phones\u201d will always win in battery life and durability). The entire BB10 line was a total failure, primarily due to the fact that they are way too underpowered (and the android emulator isn't very efficient) to run ANY android apps without lag. The battery life is also terrible compared to other phones on the market at the time. Their newer devices are still very secure (and some have physical keyboards) but natively run android and don't lag like crazy, even when running a simple app like flappy bird or Spotify. The cameras and battery life also seem to be pretty good. However, BlackBerry seems to have a tradition of never using the latest technology in their phones. None of the ones they currently sell were made with the best processors of the time, or the features that became popular around then. Overall, I'd say they're pretty good. One final note: TCL is the company that actually makes the phones, while BlackBerry focuses on software. ",
