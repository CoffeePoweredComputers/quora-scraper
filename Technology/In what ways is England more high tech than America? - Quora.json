            "answer_text": "I wouldn\u2019t say England is more High-Tech than America, it\u2019s about the same. England has the UK Space Agency and works with the European Space Agency, America has Nasa. Where England seems more High Tech is in daily life, we appear to introduce and use technology quicker. Credit and Debit cards here, for example, had Chip & Pin a decade before America, even from American banks in England. I suspect having a small landmass and a dense population makes things easier for us, but there must be other reasons too. But it is so common, take something as American as Amazon, which offers same-day delivery in both England and the US, what\u2019s their latest offering? Prime Air, delivery by done. Where did it launch first? Cambridge, England, three years ago in 2016! https://m.media-amazon.com/images/G/01/acs/test/jr/121216/PrimeAirVideo._CB509077587_.mp4 I mean if you list all the technology available, then suddenly England seems very high tech. But there is nothing stopping America adopting technology just as quickly. Often the technology adopted is American in the first place!  ",

            "answer_text": "In day to day life? Most things. Chip and pin, contactless payments, better internet services, integration of tech in eateries, such as ordering from a computer rather than speaking to a human. A lot of places here now have the option to order and lay via your mobile phone. These sorts of things aren\u2019t just available in big cities here, but in small towns and even in a fair few villages. Literally every aspect of my life is integrated with technology on some level. People seem to not realise that Britain contributes more to the sciences than any other nation per capita. We are an advanced place who lead the way in many fields. ",
