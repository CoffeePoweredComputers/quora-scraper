            "answer_text": "Scientific Revolution can roughly be said the period of 16th, 17th and 18th century and can be said begun with the publish of De Revolutionibus by Copernicus. Why was it termed as Scientific Revolution?Earlier, people ask the church about nature, life, ethics and they were answered by the bible or the Aristotelian theory. In the ongoing renaissance period, people started finding reasons by scientific observation. How it shaped science?Many old theories like earth is rest was discarded. Many people came up, some were prisoned like Galileo, some were suppressed, some were mocked but later all these reforms led to the truth of nature.Copernicus showed heliocentrism, which was supported by Galileo, and then mathematically modified by Kepler. Drift of Scientific RevolutionAfter the repression by churches over new theories, the revolution drifted towards the northern Atlantic states like England, Holland and France and many new faces popped up that shaped the revolution. Like William Harvey, discovered the blood circulation process in body, Francis Bacon, for inductive sciences, Rene Descartes for his new world mechanization. Shaping of new revolutionBacon and Descartes, strongly influenced that science should not be engulfed to astronomy and mechanics, it must be more general. Everything in the nature that can be exploited for the welfare of the society must be included in science and many more fields approached, like that of, heat, electricity etc which rumbled the whole scientific revolution into industrial revolution which all was around country\u2019s economy and development of states started in a new advanced pace.
