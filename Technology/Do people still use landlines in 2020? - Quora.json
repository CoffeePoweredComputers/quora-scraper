            "answer_text": "Do people still use landlines in 2020? I know of thousands of customers that DO. Basically it boils down to basic SECURITY. A LANDLINE is 99.9% more reliable to be alive during a disaster then any other communications device. So Fire Alarms will have one backup land line, Elevators are REQUIRED to be hard line to the MPOE (main point of entry) where the land lines come in. Schools have a Cell phone but the main line is a RED emergency LAND LINE that once it is picked up calls out to 911. It is basic safety to have a LAND line. Old pots or land lines are POWERED by the phone company so if your lights are out your corded phone will still work. Stuck in an elevator with no power or no signal\u2026. the phone will work. Land lines DO NOT need to have a signal to work and they do not depend on a battery in the device. ",
