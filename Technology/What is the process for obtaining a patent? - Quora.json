            "answer_text": "I think Gene Cavanaugh laid out the basics pretty well. But I\u2019d add two prior steps: Basic market research and researching what has come before. Time for some Aretha Franklin!  Who Needs You! This is the hard question for the inventor. This cute, smart frisky idea is just so awesome. Blinking with it\u2019s big baby eyes. Who could resist? Everybody, that\u2019s who. The question of who would benefit from it and how do they value things is an early one in the process. It is hard to make this determination on your own but it is worth a try. Who really really really needs this new thing? Needs it enough to stop their easy, known, habitual way of doing things\u2026 Are there enough people who need this (really really need it) that .1% or so of them could be a workable market to start with? If not, no harm done\u2026 just don\u2019t spend money and effort on a patent. You thought of something new, maybe, but it just does not have enough value to warrant the investment. Did it pass that first test? Really? OK! Next up: researching. It is pretty easy to discover what is called \u201cPrior Art\u201d by digging through google searches (they have a patent search engine) and the various Patent Offices (US and elsewhere) have search tools. But look elsewhere too\u2026 Like journals in the research area, catalogs for that industry, Hunt long and hunt hard. You do not want to move unless you are fairly certain you have a truly new thing in mind. That would waste a good deal of time and money.  The key is to search with the spirit of, \u201cI know it must be out there already\u201d not the spirit of, \u201cMy idea is super and smart and probably nobody has quite seen it this way until me!\u201d All of this might might be true but that is beside the point at the beginning. What you want is to hunt by taking all sorts of creative swipes at finding it. Maybe the other guy (or gal) gave it a weird or old fashioned name. Maybe they were applying it to some other use\u2026 Keep thinking of it as \u201chiding from you\u201d and reward yourself for finding it or near misses. When you find it (or some near miss) dig into any patent information about that product. This could be very good news: now you don\u2019t have to pay for the patent! They already did, or if it is public domain, you are free to work the idea without paying a fee to anyone or worrying about being sued. If there is an owner the chances are good you can work something out with them. If not, you discovered this set of facts at very low cost and you can \u201cgo back to the drawing board\u201d with your head held high (and money in your pocket). If those two hurdles are good and truly cleared\u2026 then and only then do you climb the ladder Gene describes. ",

            "answer_text": "As a patent attorney, I\u2019ve filed a number of U.S. patent applications on behalf of inventors and helped them at different stages of the process. The application is drafted. There are two major sections: the claims, and the support for the claims in the form of drawings and description of the drawings. The claims are what you will actually have patented if your patent is allowed; something like \u201c1. A method for teleporting a person from a first location to a second location, comprising: determining a layout of atoms of a person, creating a wormhole between the first location and second location using a nuclear fusion flux capacitor, sending the atoms of the person through the wormhole, and reassembling the person using an electronic atom manipulator and the determined layout.\u201d \u201c2. The method of claim 1, wherein the layout is determined by a portable electron microscope.\u201d and so on. The description and drawings have to illustrate and provide sufficient technical detail that an ordinary engineer or specialist in the relevant field would be able to recreate your invention from the information provided.The application is filed, along with various administrative forms where the inventor affirms they are the true inventor, the inventor/attorney disclose any relevant prior art they are aware of, and initial filing and search fees are paid.The patent office will do a preliminary check to ensure that the formal requirements have all been met, like paying all fees and having legible text and drawings, and will let you know if anything is missing.Within about a year to a year and a half, an examiner will determine if your claims are valid, patent-eligible, and aren\u2019t already done by or obvious in light of what exists in the prior art.If the examiner does reject your claims, you\u2019ll have an opportunity to change the claims and/or argue why the claims should be allowed.If the examiner is not convinced, you\u2019ll have to decide whether to pay fees to reopen examination and repeat step 5, appeal the rejection to a review board (which can take several years), or abandon the application.If the examiner is convinced, your patent will be granted, and you\u2019ll pay some issuance fees and have an official copy of the patent mailed to you. You\u2019ll be able to license the patent or keep competitors from practicing the invention.",
