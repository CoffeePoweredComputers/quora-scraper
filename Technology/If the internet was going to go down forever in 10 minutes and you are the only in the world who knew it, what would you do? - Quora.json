And say that I will bring down the internet in 10 minutes unless they give me 10 BILLION dollars! Of course, no one will believe me, and no one will pay me. Then the Internet does, in fact go down. The I will email the same places and saw I now want 20 BILLION dollars to fix the Internet. In small bills. Sent to my private Island. EDIT: it\u2019s been pointed out to me that once the Internet goes down, I can\u2019t sent the emails. Humm\u2026 FedEx and USPS then? ",
