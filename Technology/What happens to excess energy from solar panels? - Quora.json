            "answer_text": "The excess energy from solar panels turns to heat. If you set a solar panel in the sunshine and don\u2019t connect the wires to anything then some of the light that hits it reflects off, but because it is black most of the energy gets absorbed and the panel gets warm, just like any other black object. The heat is carried away by radiation and convection. If you connect the wires to something that can take all the current the panels can provide then some of the energy goes into the electricity, thus the panel doesn\u2019t get quite as warm. If the something at the other end is able to use some but not all of the electricity that the panels can provide then the situation is in between. The panel gets warmer than if it was providing more useful electricity, but not as warm as if it were sitting disconnected. ",

            "answer_text": "It\u2019s always 5 o\u2019clock somewhere. And it is certain that \u2026 that \u2018somewhere\u2019 is connected to the neighborhood solar panel which is generating excess energy now. Now, what would that somewhere be? Think small scale: Your excess energy goes straight to the battery. It is local, dare I say - domestic. You charge your own battery during the period of excess energy so that, you can utilize it, when there\u2019s no sun. The only condition\u2014 your domestic battery has to be in uncharged or partially charged. You can\u2019t really charge a fully charged battery. [image courtesy[1] ]Thus, in this case- it\u2019s five o\u2019clock in your battery. Think a little larger: Your solar panel is producing excess power, but your domestic battery is currently fully charged. What do you do? You send that excess power to the local utility. In that process, you actually earn some money. Now, I will not go into the technical intricacies of Solar Tariff, or the infrastructural modifications required to ensure bidirectional power flow, but I will show you how your utility can use that additional power you are generating and selling to the load. [image courtesy [2] ] This is the current breakdown of power generation for NY state[3] . The Natural Gas turbines (in red) have a very small start-up, and shut-down time.  If the utility center sees excess solar power coming from domestic distributed sources, they can easily cut down some small units from their Natural Gas turbines\u2019 generation, and utilize the \u2018free\u2019 solar energy. In all honesty, you don\u2019t need to go upto the state level for this adjustment. This control/redistribution is performed on a much more local level, in fact- the correct term is zonal level. The power network for the state of NY is divided into 11 zones (A through K). (For my neighborhood, the zone is F). However, conceptually\u2014 it can be visualized by the following image.  Thus, in this case- it\u2019s five o\u2019clock in your zonal readjusted natural-gas generation. Think even LARGER:What if your entire zone is currently supported by slow-response sources like hydro, nuclear or coal- based power generation stations only. What if there\u2019s no fast-response energy sources to tweak with? Well \u2026 this scenario \u2026 will NEVER OCCUR \u2014 in practical. Everything will be taken care of in the zonal level. But, theoretically? What if \u2026. Well, it is always five o\u2019clock somewhere. Somewhere along this crazy-interconnected power network of this nation[4] ,[5] .  Thanks to Robert (view comment) for noting that even state level imbalance/surplus is not that uncommon for states like California. I will illustrate on this later.

            "answer_text": "When you install a solar battery as part of your solar panel system, you are able to store excess solar electricity at your home instead of sending it back to the grid. If your solar panels are producing more electricity than you need, the excess energy goes towards charging the battery. The current flow drags down the panel voltage due to internal resistance of the panel. So panel voltage equals battery voltage. The prolem is that if the battery becomes fully charged (large panel small battery) the panel keeps pushing the current into the battery to destroy the battery by boiling.

            "answer_text": "Excess energy from Solar Panels is wasted if there are no provisions for storage or any other use. It is like if you fill 10 bottles of water from a running water tap and one day you realize that there is more water, then either you can store it in new bottle or you can leave it and waste. The same thing happens to excess energy from Solar Panels. Hence it is very important to properly design a system so as to get the maximum benefit. ",

            "answer_text": "Your Net electricity meter then measures how much you exported. The payment you receive for this exported electricity is called the feed-in-tariff. Currently it tanges from 11c to 15c per kWh exported,, while you pay between 20c and 45c usually for one kWh of electricity used. At night you import electricity and the Net meter measures how much you consumed and adds it to the electricity you consumed during the day from the grid. So this is what is going on! ",
