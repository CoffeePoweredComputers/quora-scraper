            "answer_text": "Unless you have very weak wireless or a very fast broadband a wireless connection will not be the bottleneck.  Start by establishing a baseline, one computer connected directly to your Internet connection with no other devices attached.  Run some speedtests (dslreports.com).  Attach your network and re-run the same tests.   There should be very little difference between the results.  If there is then put on your diagnostic hat and focus on your internal network.  Add one thing at a time, wait a few minutes and re-run the speed tests.  You should end up finding that when one thing is connected it's slow, when that one thing is disconnected it is fast.  Then uninstall the bittorrent you just uncovered on your teenagers computer. If the speed tests you get directly attached to your Internet source are well below what your ISP is billing you for (< 80%) give them a call.  On a residential connection there probably isn't a service level agreement (SLA) so there isn't a guaranteed speed but if you are not getting reasonably close to what you are paying for then either something is wrong on the ISP side, something is wrong with your access device, something is wrong with your MPOE to device wiring or your location is unable to get service at the given speed reliably. A call to the ISP should help you figure out which of these is the cause of the slowdown.  If it's the ISP something is likely misconfigured or oversubscribed.  If they give you a pile of something that smells and your speeds magically get better then it was misconfigured.   If they know what they are doing they should be able to help diagnose between a faulty access device, MPOE to device wiring and last-mile infrastructure problems.  So call your ISP but BE NICE.  If you are sweet as sugar but persistent they will find and fix the problem if they can.  If they can't then start ISP shopping.  A few more dollars a month with competent support is often worthwhile. If it is pure location then you can't do much; each technology has a distance limit and if you are near the edge (without extreme measures) you are stuck.  At least you can be decrease the amountof speed you are paying for to what the technology is able to deliver. ",

You can also look into directly connecting your devices via ethernet cables. Such as Cat6 cables . A wired connection is always better than a connection via Wifi. You can give this a try and see if that makes any initial difference. If you are downloading or uploading or streaming on many different devices look into upping your plan + cables. ",

Repositioning your router can have a significant effect on the quality of your wireless connection. If you have wireless broadband, secure your wireless network. There are certain applications that may discreetly start running when you log in to your computer. Set these applications so they do not run automatically. If you are having problem in wireless, you could invest in a wireless repeater. ",

            "answer_text": "Fed up with the poor internet speed of your home broadband connection. Here are some ways by which you can overcome this issue. Investing in a better router: You need to ensure that the router that you are using is the best in the market not just in terms of speed and reliability, but also it should be up-to-date with regard to technology.Change the location of your router: Is your router placed close to a door or window? Change its location and place it centrally or better yet near the ceiling, this will ensure that there is no disruption in the internet speed because of barriers in the home.Replace your ethernet cable: Sometimes it may be your ethernet cable that may be causing the issue. So try replacing it with another ethernet cable, make sure that it is of better quality.Keep changing your connection password: There are always freeloaders looking to tap into an easily crackable internet connection. It is important that you change the username and password of your connection and also change the default password of your router to prevent freeloaders from hacking or slowing down your connection.Switch to a fibernet connection: The last suggestion would be that you switch your cable or DSL connection to a fibre optic cable. The latter is the best in terms of speeds, bandwidth and security.",
