            "answer_text": "Is it really about only who will export more arm to Azerbaijan and Armenia, they will get more benefit.If you will see in this Scenario then Russia and Israel will get maximum benifit from this war but is it really about exporting arm to this country and getting benefit from this?   Well, if we see there is mejor three countries who play a big role in this region. TurkeyIsraelRussiaTurkey, which shares a border with Armenia, is backing Azerbaijan.Because Turkey has the deep cultural ties with Azerbaijan. And as we know Turkey is trying again to become leader of Muslims country so supporting Azerbaijan fits well into Turkey\u2019s aggressive foreign policy. But we can't ignore this fact that Azerbaijan has built several gas and oil pipelines with Turkey and Europe across the Caucasus. Some of these pipelines pass close to the conflict zone (within 16 km of the border).In an open war between the two countries, the pipelines could be targeted, which would impact energy supplies and may even lead to higher oil prices globally.  Israel , If we talk about Israel, this is very interesting thing that Turkey and Israel both countries are supporting Azerbaijan. According to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, A total of 60% of Azerbaijan's arms imports came from Israel and 31% from Russia . [1] Azerbaijan is big market for Israel so Israel is supporting Azerbaijan but we can't ignore this fact that USA is supporting Armenia so if Israel support Azerbaijan in war then it will not be good for relation of USA and Israel because both countries have a great relation to each other and for Israel, relation with USA is more important than selling Arm to the Azerbaijan.  And if we talk about Russia, Russia have good ties with both Azerbaijan and Armenia and supplies weapons to both.Therefore, Russia is trying to balance between the two, by mediating.  In conclusion we can say that this war will give more harm to countries in comparison than Benefit if war happened so it will be better if all the country will try to calm situation through diplomacy.

            "answer_text": "Russia, Iran, France, Turkey. US is a big loser here. I\u2019ll explain why for each. Russia: Sold weapons to both sides, former USSR nations and is a heavyweight in this area. Both sides know only Russia has real leverage in this conflict. Only Russia can really force these 2 nations in the table if they wanted too. Russia initially was quiet for several reasons. It was stunned that this conflict blew up with such intensity. They expected the 2 sides to fight a few days, not Azerbaijan going all out trying to recapture. Another reason was punishment to Armenia, many do not realize in Armenia, pro Russian politicians are in prison for corruption and Armenia is flirting with the EU. Many say Russia was quiet for a few days, they were sending Armenia a message. Iran: Iran has close relations with Armenia, Russia has used Iran territory to transit weapons to Armenia. Iran makes money from that. It also sells subsidized oil to Armenia and since a war is looming, It gives Iran leverage in oil prices to Armenia. France: France\u2019s central foreign policy goal is to counter Turkey. It see\u2019s Turkey has the headquarters of Political Islam which to France is a threat. France gains because it can start a relationship with Armenia and exert influence in the area. Macron (France Leader) has made a priority to exert French influence wherever he can. France has seen the US retreat internationally under Trump and has rushed to replace it wherever it can. Turkey: Probably the biggest winner! Turkey and Azerbaijan has always had close relations. Similar language and ethnicity have bonded the 2 together. This conflict has been amazing for Turkey for a few reasons. 1) Turkish weapons (drones) have been effective in this conflict. Effective is not even enough, they been fantastic for Azerbaijan and that is good news for Turkey in terms of export sales. Erdogan (Turkish leader) has been able to sell this conflict at home as a conflict that cannot be solved without Turkey. (Turkish Nationalism). It is playing in a backyard that no one dared to play out of respect for Russia. the whole 30 years of frozen conflict and no one tried to solve it out of respect for Russia. Now? It cannot be solved without Turkey. Turkish media is playing this conflict as a conflict of big brother helping an occupied state and is showcasing Turkish weapons so they can show the domestic/international audience its a strong power. US big loser: This conflict shows once again the Trump administration cannot solve conflicts. America has left the international scene and this conflict, being so complicated with many reasons, is beyond the comprehension of the Trump govt and as such Azerbaijan and Armenia are not worried of US sanctions which certainly would happen under any other US leadership.
