            "answer_text": "Probably depends on your definition of \u201cquantum leap\u201d. The problem is that there are two different \u201c5G\u201d standards. One for frequencies below 6Ghz, which only offers marginal improvements over 4G, and one for frequencies above 15Ghz. It is in this latter area that things could get dramatic. The bandwidth is dramatic, and for local connections the latency is also dramatically lower. On the other hand, above 15 GHz the radio waves truly have millimeter wavelength and are VERY short range - think an antenna stack every 200 feet, and about the only building material they will penetrate is very clean window glass. So getting 5G into the cores of big buildings will require significant work. You will start to see some early rollouts labeled 5G, but these are the below 6Ghz variety, it will be a while before the real thing is here, particularly outside city centers. ",

The change from Release to Release 15 is significant: bigger than R13 to R14 But it is *not* huge The change from 4G to 5G is a lot smaller than the change from 2G to 2.5G (GSM to GPRS), or the change from 3G to 4G I wish we would give up on this \u201cG\u201d nonsense and the fetishisation as though it meant something\u2026 ",
