            "answer_text": "Given the long history of our species, I would describe the exploitation of fossil fuels as the most powerful innovation since fire. In the long run, this development may not prove to be as overwhelmingly positive as most people might think. Though we all enjoy the ease and comfort that came with cheap energy, and much of what technology has to offer, it is becoming more and more clear that this innovation is, at best, a double edged sword. Fossil fuels have allowed our species to populate all continents and biomes of the planet in ever greater numbers. There are so many of us that in some places, we are running out of space to live. Our population is growing at an alarming rate. The standard of living is slowly rising in most third world countries. This leads to greater energy consumption. Meanwhile, fossil fuels are finite. The problem arises when we realize that ALL of our systems depend on fossil fuels to function; heating, lighting transportation, water, power, and most worrisome of all, food. By some estimates, 90% of our food production is entirely reliant on fossil fuels\u2026 to such a degree that a soil scientist I know described the function of soil these days as being a growth medium or substrate for the natural gas based fertilizer and petrochemical pesticides that fuel modern agriculture. The soil itself is sterile. Ergo, if fossil fuels went away, so would the vast majority of our food supply. WHEN fossil fuels go away, it will make the Irish potato famine look like an ice cream social. Never mind all of our other systems. Then we compound all of the above with the effects of climate change, hypersalination from excessive irrigation and the as yet unknown effects of fracking, all the \u201cdeveloped\u201d countries might be wishing they were more third world. We can\u2019t survive without food and water, no matter how technologically advanced we become. So, as with climate change, the problem is not change (which is a constant), but the rate at which that change occurs. The extraction of fossil fuels might become economically untenable over the course of a few years, or even months once we reach the bottom of the barrel. The human species is very adaptable, but history has shown that even we need time to navigate major changes. The whipsaw speed at which such change may occur might leave us (and the thousands of other species we take with us) so much roadkill bloating on the shoulder of the evolutionary highway. Life has always gone on here on Earth, but it has never needed us to do so. I sincerely hope we have not, as a species, been too stupid for too long. ",

            "answer_text": "The Motorola high power transistors in the early 80s \u201ctransformed\u201d mobile electronic devices by eliminating the need for big heavy multi-winding transformers to take AC line voltages down to semiconductor voltage levels. Without that you would have a six pound transformer with silicon rectifiers to charge your iPhone. That was a REALLY BIG DEAL. But the average person today doesn\u2019t even know what a laminated transformer is, or was. Laminated transformers are still used in power transmission and large industrial uses, but for home use, semiconductor based voltage switching devices are the norm. ",
