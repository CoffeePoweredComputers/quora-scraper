Each country will set it\u2019s own rules for their telco\u2019s / mobile operators many have done this, in part, by licensing the RF spectrum and auctioning this to these carriers. Very few (if any?) have state owned and run infrastructure. So further control is about their regulation. If you are are talking about the technology in a broader sense then even there the situation is not so much about countries as companies, though in the case of ZTE they are state owned. more info can be found here who owns the 5g patents from that there is - Who is leading the 5G patent race? The United States, who could currently be considered to be in a trade war about with china, is doing it\u2019s best to sow all sorts of doubt about the chinese companies that do sell 5G routers and antenna\u2019s. But this looks largely like posturing and BS (who\u2019d have thought that with the current POTUS huh?) ",
