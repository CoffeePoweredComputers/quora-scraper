            "answer_text": "Everything has ethical implications. If I understand what is being asked, I believe the question should be phrased more along the lines of \u201cShould ethics be taken into consideration when pursuing new technology?\u201d -or- \u201cShould some technical advancements not be pursued due to troublesome ethical implications?\u201d I don\u2019t believe you will find a definitive answer on this topic. There will be disagreement about what is or is not ethical. There are various approaches and frameworks for ethical decision making, some of which conflict with others. A Framework for Making Ethical Decisions My opinion would be that anyone pursuing a new technology should consider the ethical implications. However, a lot of technological breakthroughs occur while research was focused on a different, but related, avenue of interest. New technologies are sometimes applied in a way that no one thought of during the research and development process. How could they consider the possible ethical implications of such an application when they never thought of it themselves? There is also an argument to be made that technological advancement is ethically neutral and it is the way in which it is employed that determines the ethical implications. It appears I\u2019ve just spent several minutes providing a long-winded version of \u2018maybe\u2019, but a definitive answer would be inaccurate on such a broad topic. You might even say it would be unethical to provide a definitive answer when I am aware of the various factors that would make any such answer inaccurate. ",

            "answer_text": "Ethics should be a part of everything one does. Science sometimes thinks that technological advances should occur regardless of the outcomes or ramifications. However, this is faulty thinking. Aristotle taught in his Nicomachean Ethics that the ultimate responsibility of man is to be and do that which is good. He stated, \u201cWe are what we repeatedly do. Excellence, then, is not an act, but a habit.\u201d In other words, if we train ourselves properly we will automatically do the right thing and will be ethical in all our decision making. Had scientists in the past done this in developing technological advances we would not have weapons of destruction that exists today. ",
