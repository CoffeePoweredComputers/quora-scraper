            "answer_text": "For me, the worst experiences are always with telecoms companies. You are at their mercy and most of them do not care much about customers or employees. When I was living in New York City, the only option for internet service in my area was Time Warner - so I had no choice but to deal with them. Needless to say, they sucked. Frequent outages, hours of hold times on the call queue and nothing I could do about it. Disclaimer: I am on the marketing team at Nextiva - a business communications company. Why do I love working with Nextiva? Because our founder believes in customer service so much, that the company was built on that principle. Nextiva even trademarked the phrase \u201cAmazing Service\u201d because we believe in it so much.  Here\u2019s the Reality: Customers expect employees to have excellent customer service skills nowadays. We are living in the world of online reviews, where companies with shitty customer service can no longer hide in the shadows. Unfortunately, there are still too many businesses who do not get it - and that\u2019s the problem. Businesses Need Multiple Ways for Customers to Connect With Them: Too often, there have been times when I wanted to live chat with a support representative on a company\u2019s website, and it wasn\u2019t available. Sometimes I just need a QUICK ANSWER and don\u2019t feel like waiting for hours to talk to a rep on the phone. Whenever this happens - I feel a sense of frustration. Solely having a phone number for customers to call is not enough. Businesses must provide ample opportunities for customer service experiences to happen. When I decide to reach out to a business, I want to do it when and wherever I want. I also want to use the device of my choosing. Here Are Some Ways Businesses Should Communicate With Customers: Face-to-Face Video CommunicationReal-Time Messaging (SMS)Email and Phone CommunicationArtificial (AI) AssistanceSocial Media Customer ServiceHowever, even for businesses that do use technology for customer service, there are several reasons why the experience can still go horribly wrong. Here Are Problems That Frequently Happen: Businesses show me things I do not want to see.There are absurdly long hold and response times.Poor connection quality.Ineffective technology tools.Improper routing.The impact poor customer service has on businesses is highly detrimental to its longevity and success. Not only does it hurt customer relationships, but the business\u2019 reputation, as well. The trust I once gave to some companies no longer exist due to not meeting my expectations. With every negative experience comes a decrease in prospects, sales, customers, and profits. A report reveals that poor customer service is costing businesses more than $75 billion a year. Delivering poor customer service via technology (or lack thereof) is too big of a loss to ignore. Businesses need to offer services that go beyond the telephone. It is time they provide options where customers can choose how they want to reach them. Below are a few ways to make it happen: Social MediaMobile PhoneEmailSMSWebsiteLIVE ChatVoIP SystemsMessaging ServicesBusinesses have to start offering more tech choices. That is if they want to ensure customer service experiences meet expectations. And, the more ways, the better. Without options, customers will complain. Increasing poor customer experiences and reputations. Once this happens, it is hard to come back from it. Sometimes the damage is too much.  Diagram via: FreshSparks Technology offers businesses a multitude of tools that can positively impact customer relationships. They just need to take advantage of them. I know that a lot of my experiences would have gone a lot better if businesses used technology in more ways than one - and more effectively, at that. ",

            "answer_text": "AT&T was pretty impressive when we canceled. Instead of billing us the rest of the pro-rated remainder, they sent us straight to collections. As in, we ended our service on the 15th of the month and were called for collections by the 30th. Of course, we couldn't log-in to pay it since they locked us out when we canceled. Seems legit. The real winner though was Comcast. Comcast installation was amusing, primarily because their technician they sent was 4 hours late, knocked on our door, and walked away when we answered. When we called Comcast for an explanation, the tech had actually said we scared him (by answering the door?). In other words - the dude was messing around and wanted to go home early. It took a few attempts, but we were finally up and running. I believe at the time it was like $150 service charge to set up that was waived, or something worth $150 was waived because of the issues we had. We thought we were good to go. About a month or so later, both our kids were sick with the stomach flu. We parked them in the kitchen on the (easier-to-clean) tile and attempted to order a movie for them. We received a notice that we had not paid and could not order anything as such. Considering we had paid, we were pretty confused. Obviously, we called them to see what was up. The first rep wouldn't talk to us because our account was delinquent. Second rep saw we had made all of our payments but couldn't figure out what was going on. A manager finally saw that the credit we had been given was being seen a late payment in the system hence the issue. He waived it (again) and we moved on. This started to happen monthly. We would have to call - they wouldn't talk to us - we would press it harder and finally show someone what happened. Heck, they even sent us to collections over it! We actually had to get someone to wipe our account clean and start over with a fresh balance of $0 instead. Needless to say, we aren't with Comcast anymore. ",

            "answer_text": "What has been your worst customer service experience with technology? This is not the worst customer service experience of my life, but, as I am just now coming off of it, the story is fresh on my mind, and the steam is still pouring out of my ears. For the past 15 years, my phone has been the $10/month extra phone on my ex husband\u2019s Verizon plan. About 7 years ago, my little flip phone expired. I called my local Verizon store and the guy told me to come in and he would replace it as there is a free replacement plan on the account. I went in, he transferred my data to the new flip phone and there were no charges. The guy stood behind the counter and took care of this business. Last Sunday, that flip phone expired. I plugged it in thinking the battery needed charging, but the battery did not charge over hours. I called my local Verizon store and asked if they might have a battery for my old flip phone. Without asking what I had, the guy said no, the batteries for the old flip phones are no longer manufactured, I would need to buy a new phone. I explained that my phone was the $10/month extra phone on another person\u2019s account. We discussed my options and he told me there was a free flip phone with which I could replace my old one. They would need to call my xh while I was in the store to get his PIN. I called my xh with whom I had not spoken in 6 years to give him a heads-up. I went into the Verizon store on Monday. First off, the \u201cconsultant\u201d informed me that the batteries for my old phone are still manufactured. He asked if I had called Batteries Plus. I said no, I had called this store. He said, \u201cThis store?\u201d I said, \u201cYes. This store.\u201d I am sure he did not want to be bothered with me and my free flip phone. The \u201cconsultants\u201d now sit behind desks at individual work stations like sales reps in car dealerships with expensive electronics at their disposal. Phones and phone plans are big investments nowadays. Much to my consultant\u2019s dismay, I am sure, I said I wanted to get the new free replacement flip phone. I needed to change the number anyway as my phone number had been pirated by a scammer. The consultant quickly determined they did not have the \u201cfree phone\u201d in stock. They had another model which would cost my xh $56 on his bill and $25 in taxes to me. I said, \u201cYou don\u2019t have the free phone?\u201d He said he would check and he brought out the phone that wasn\u2019t free. I found this so irritating. I said, \u201cI will wait and get the free phone.\u201d So he typed up the order on his Ipad. I asked him how the free phone was different than the one he had showed me. He said he didn\u2019t know. He said the phone would be in Wednesday or Thursday and asked for a phone number where I could be reached. I said there was no number where I could be reached because my phone was dead. He said, \u201cThen you call us,\u201d and I agreed. He told me we would change the phone # when I returned to get the new phone, and that we would have to call the owner of the account again to get his PIN again. I called the store on Wednesday. A woman said my phone had not come in yet. I asked if someone could e-mail me when it came in. She said, \u201cNo, we can\u2019t change the order now.\u201d Wtf? We can\u2019t \u201cchange the order\u201d now? Hey Toto, I don\u2019t think we\u2019re in Kansas anymore. Okaaaaaaay, so whatever\u2026 I called on Thursday (today). A man answered and said, \u201cYeah your phone has been back there a couple of days. We tried to call you but we couldn\u2019t reach you.\u201d I said, \u201cMy phone is dead. Or it was until last night.\u201d (The phone had miraculously begun working again Wednesday night.) The guy typed into the order that I would call you.\u201d So I got hold of my xh again and gave him a heads-up that he would be getting another call from Verizon. And I drove to the store, doubtful that a phone would actually appear before my eyes. I was taken to by a consultant to his work station whereupon I mentioned that we would be changing the phone number. \u201cYou have to call customer service to do that,\u201d he said. (This was my breaking point.) I told him that the consultant with whom I had met on Monday had told me that, indeed, we could change the phone number when I picked up the phone, and then I proceeded to describe the history of erroneous information I\u2019d been given upon all 5 of my contacts with their store. When I said that it had been typed into the order that I would call because I couldn\u2019t be reached because my phone was dead, he turned the computer screen to me and showed me that the order said to call me at the number on my dead phone He said that maybe we could change the phone number. He would have to take a look at the account. He had me call my xh but never spoke to him while he looked up the account. Then he went and got \u201cmy phone.\u201d He set the box down on the table and told me there was a $40 \u201cupgrade\u201d charge, a $30 charge for the $130 phone which was discounted $100, $10 in taxes, and a $15 \u201cactivation fee.\u201d I balked at these charges, pointing out that I had been told the phone would be free. I started to open the box to look at the phone. \u201cYou can\u2019t open the box,\u201d he said. \u201cI can\u2019t open the box?\u201d I repeated. \u201cThe phone isn\u2019t yours,\u201d he said. \u201cYou haven\u2019t agreed to buy it.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll buy it,\u201d I snapped. \u201cCan I look at the phone now?\u201d He agreed. He changed the phone number, I paid, and I took my $95 \u201cfree phone\u201d and left the store. My xh had told me he pays $6.00/month for this \u201cfree replacement\u201d plan. I\u2019m pretty sure it was the same phone I\u2019d been shown on Monday--the $81 phone which I had rejected because I wanted the free one. ",

            "answer_text": "In 1985 I was a programmer for a small company in Silicon Valley who wrote a retail point-of-sale and inventory control program. Since we were a small company, the other programmers and I would handle the majority of the technical support calls we\u2019d get. One day, a clothing store manager called and said that he needed to backup his inventory, but the program kept telling him that the diskettes were full. I explained to him that our backup program required blank, formatted floppy diskettes and that he\u2019d either need to format some new ones, or erase the contents or reformat existing ones. He said he didn\u2019t have any extras, so what was the command to reformat the diskettes? I said \u201cformat a colon (format a:)\u201d He replied \u201cOkay, I\u2019m very busy now, many customers, have to go, bye!\u201d A few hours later he called back and got one of the other programmers. He said his hard drive was \u201cgone.\u201d When asked what led up to it, he recalled speaking to me earlier and said he entered exactly what I had told him: \u201cformat :\u201d (format and \u201ca\u201d colon) He had reformatted his hard drive. This was in the early days of MS-DOS, later versions would not have allowed this. He was obviously furious. I had already put in my two week\u2019s notice because I had found another job nearby so I told my boss to tell him that they fired me, in case it came to a threat of lawsuit. He said he wouldn\u2019t do that. I don\u2019t know whatever became of the customer after that. I -was- going to have him read back to me what I\u2019d said, but he was in such a hurry to get off the phone because of his many customers\u2026 oh, well. ",

            "answer_text": "Mine was with a Panasonic camera which stopped zooming, three days after the warranty expired. I went onto the support website and found that there were dozens of complaints of the exact same problem, going back at least three years and it was only fixable by sending back to Panasonic, or at least their designated repair place. I contacted Panasonic who quoted me a repair price of about $260 US - to fix a camera which cost $340 a year previously. When I asked if they could help, as it was so close to the warranty expiry date and a known problem, I was basically told \u201cread the small print\u201d. That\u2019s how Panasonic lost a customer for the next 35 years, or however much longer I live. For contrast I give the following story. I have a pair of pretty good Nikon Binoculars which I use a lot. They were getting a bit dirty and worn after 18 years use, and the extension piece for non-spectacle users had a broken part. I contacted Nikon and asked if they did servicing. They said yes, ship them back, so I did. One week later, they arrived, refurbished, with the broken part replaced. No charge. You can be sure that when I next went looking for this sort of stuff Nikon was at the top of my shopping list, and you can guess which brand is at the bottom. ",

            "answer_text": "Samsung. I bought a brand new Samsung Galaxy Core Prime from a retail store. Gave it away as a Christmas gift, but the person showed me a display issue when they opened the box. It looked like a crack in the display underneath the touchscreen. No marks anywhere else on the phone. The retail store couldn\u2019t do anything after the first 15 days and directed me to the local Samsung service center with my receipt. Samsung takes the phone and returns 15 minutes later refusing to perform any warranty work, blaming physical abuse. How an lcd display can get cracked or damaged without damaging the touchscreen is beyond me, and I repair electronic devices like this as well for a living.Luckily I was able to obtain a new replacement lcd display and touchscreen assembly for under $20 USD, repaired it and then gave it back to the person, telling them what happened. You could not tell it had ever been serviced and it\u2019s still working today. 2. I bought a Samsung Galaxy i9000 through Telus some years back. Samsung and Telus pushed down a firmware update, and bricked the device, just as the warranty ended. Telus refused to do anything, Samsung refused to do anything. The phone still sits in it\u2019s original retail box. Another paperweight. ",

            "answer_text": "Live chat. Especially live chat systems that operate like a call center. You know the ones where you have to navigate a help page, select what category/area your issue might be under, then type in your problem\u2014only to have to retype your problem to first agent you connect to. Why doesn\u2019t the agent get that information? What\u2019s the point in me writing anything in that pre-chat form? Oh, add on top of that an unstable internet connection where you lose connectivity for 5 seconds. Because you dip offline for a second, the chat just disconnects you and have to start the live chat right the beginning with a new agent. I thought it was me who just thought this way. But there\u2019s a live chat survey showing a 1000 other people do. And businesses know they can do better as well! ",

He told me it is me the problem and he hung up on me. I\u2019m sure I do not speak well either but thought someone may be able to help us and minimize the time we were spending. Oh well, it happens sometimes. ",
