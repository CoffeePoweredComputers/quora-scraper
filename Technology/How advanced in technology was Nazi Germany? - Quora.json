            "answer_text": "Germany\u2019s military technology was vastly superior to its rivals. They had great tanks such as the Panthers and Panzer IVs, they had great planes such as the Bf 109, they had great guns such as the MG42 and the StG44. They even went as far as to create plans or at least ideas for different weapons that almost seemed sci-fi at the time. Other countries had great things too, but Germany was among the best in everything, while for example the USSR had the T-34 and other good tank designs, but that was about it. Their small arms were decent and so was their airforce. ",
