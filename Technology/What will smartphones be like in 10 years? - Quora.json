            "answer_text": "I read a story on TechRadar on this, and I\u2019m rolling my eyes a bit. They\u2019re completely wrong. What could your future smartphone look like in 2030? The story shows what phones might look like in 2\u20133 years, but 10 years from now, smartphones won\u2019t be a thing at all. They\u2019ll be as much a thing of the past as Flip-phones are today. What you\u2019ll have is a small credit card-sized brick about 1/4 of an inch thick, mostly batterythat you carry in your pocket or a watch, bracelet or other wearables, all of which primarily recharge via solar. The Brick will be a 5,6, or 7G Connection to the internet that will project your own personal WiFi.  Everything else will run off that. A device similar to a hearing aid will replace all home speakers to interface with your Personal Digital Assistant. Your DA will handle most things by voice command, like summoning your personal or rideshare vehicle, playing media for home entertainment, ordering food or supplies, scheduling appointments, getting reservations, setting reminders, paying bills or vendors or using machine learning to understand your habits and remind you of things you might need to pick up on the way home based on your consumption habits. (It takes you an average of 4 days to go through a gallon of milk, so you might need to pick up some on the way home today.) When you leave the house, you\u2019ll select a device to carry with you depending on what you need, sometimes the full handheld computer that handles much of the functions of today\u2019s Smartphones, but it will not have its own connection, rather running off your personal wifi for everything, even phone calls will run via VoIP over that wifi, sometimes just a small display screen to visually augment your connection through your earpiece. Sometimes you\u2019ll be fine with just your earpiece and brick. Your vehicle\u2019s internet connection, your TV\u2019s set-top box, all your home internet devices will primarily run off your personal wifi. A small supplementary device left in the home will be needed to keep the home internet devices, like home automation devices, smart appliances, chore-bots like Roombas and other IoT connected while you\u2019re away. When people ask about why net neutrality is important, this is why. The problems lack of net neutrality causes aren\u2019t what most people think of, like having your connection to NetFlix choked by ISP\u2019s greedy for more fees to deliver video streaming. In fact, the problem with lack of Net Neutrality is never technology that already exists, it\u2019s the technology that doesn\u2019t exist yet being delayed because the companies that own the pipelines don\u2019t want to lose their cash cows. Voice over IP should have taken over Land Lines 10 years before it actually did. Want to know why it didn\u2019t? Because the Bush Administration wasn\u2019t interested in Net Neutrality, and the ISPs fought VoIP tooth and nail to hold it back because of how lucrative Land Lines were. Here are just a few examples of ISP Fuckwaddery before Net Neutrality was put in place: Net Neutrality Violations: A Brief History So if you think ISPs without Net Neutrality keeping them from being assholes are just going to let you have one single connection to the internet, rather than your SmartPhone, Your Cable TV package AND your Home Internet, Go back and read that article again. And again. And again. They will NEVER let you have just one connection while they hold the keys. Not until they\u2019re forced to. ",

            "answer_text": "Here what I imagine phones would look like in 10 years. Of course, as you might expect it would have no bezel, notch, hole punch, or motorized cameras. It would most likely have everything on the front to be underneath the display including the cameras and speakers.It would be very thin and light. We would true wireless charging that works from afar distance instead of only up close. Which may mean we no longer even need a battery in our phones at all. Since it would have no battery it can get much thinner and lighter and not mention, the phone will have microLED instead of OLED which not only be even thinner, screen burn-in will no longer be a thing because of microLED doesn't burn in, unlike OLED and the quality would be just as good as OLED display.No ports, many phones companies are already removing the headphones jack from their phones so it would be no surprise if the headphone jack becomes obsolete and because of phones will no longer have a battery inside it would also no longer have a charging port either.No mechanical buttons. some upcoming phones of 2019 such as the Samsung Galaxy Note 10 and Google pixel 4 had been rumored to have no buttons at all including the power button and volume rockers. So if this ends up happening and it is a success it would be no surprise that it will become the norm in 10 years. But you may be asking, how am I supposed to change the volume and turn the phone on and off? Well, most likely the side of the phone will be touch and pressure sensitive which basically means the buttons aren't really going away it would just be a touch button instead which may be great, You will be able to control where these touch buttons will be located and which one you use and which one you don't use including the Bixby button on Samsung phones which is great for Samsung fans who hates using the Bixby button.It might be foldable. There been some foldable phones such as the Galaxy fold and Huawei mate x which is a phone that unfolds into a small tablet. There is another foldable phone concept call the Motorola Razr 4 which is your average phablet that folds into a mini phone. At first, its sound like a gimmick that not really gonna work but now it's more than a gimmick, it's got real use to this. If you miss using a small flip phone, the new Motorola Razr phone concept would be great for you. If you want to get the largest screen you can get on a phone, the Galaxy fold would be great for you. There is also the Huawei mate x which is similar but I do not recommend getting this phone as it no longer has Android, Google Play Store or any of the Google apps because of the U.S. blacklist. We just now working on foldable phones. Maybe in 10 years, we can get a phone that can unfold multiple times. Which may mean we get a phone that can unfold into not only just a small tablet but into a bigger tablet and possibly into a computer or tv. But unfortunately, none of these phones have any water resistant which may be a deal breaker for today and the future. But maybe in 10 years, we'll figure out how to make these phones waterproof.",

            "answer_text": "Ah, The time has come for wild predictions unencumbered by the thought process. OK. IMO phones will be on their way out in 10 years. As in, many people won\u2019t even have a phone. Phones are tied to the telephony network, allowing you to make and receive voice calls, including to emergency services, and receive simple text messages. Those services are increasingly abandoned in favor of other ways to communicate that are not necessarily tied to phones. Phones also have a role as a \u201cpersonal device\u201d where you store your photos, your contacts, some documents. Cloud services already allow you to store all of this information, so you can access them on multiple personal devices as well as shared devices. All this means that you can use multiple devices with multiple form factors without having to have one particular device with you wherever you go. You can access all this information with a smartwatch, a small tablet, a large tablet, a laptop, your home computer, the car computer, your work computer, or the TV in your hotel room. The same data is available everywhere. If you like the phone form factor, you might get a small tablet, maybe even a foldable one if they manage to make one that doesn\u2019t suck. But I expect we\u2019re going to see much more variety in the from factor of the devices that people use to access information, communicate, and play. ",

            "answer_text": "Broad strokes, I think it will come down to what happens in the next few years with emerging technologies, particularly with flexible screens, with AR\\VR and the IoT. Smartphone technology is developing at a phenomenal rate. Currently large smart phones have essentially made a huge penetration into the tablet market. It is relatively ridiculous and unrealistic to hold a 12\u2033 screen against our heads to make a call, so I think the size of phones are quickly approaching the maximum size that would still be effective. However, flexible screens have a VERY realistic chance of changing that. For example, say you are walking around with a flexible phone. Your phone is currently folded down into a 2\u2033 x 3\u2033 screen. Small enough to easily fit in your pocket, make\\receive calls, and check passive updates. But, you get a text and want to send a quick reply. Open it by one fold and you you could have a 3\u2033 x 4\u2033 screen. It is large enough to text if needed. Need something larger for more comfortable reading, open it again, need something laptop size, open it again, etc. This keeps it small enough to be convenient when needed, and large enough to easily be productive when needed. Now, the second option I see depends on AR\\VR and the IoT. Currently a few of the issues with Augmented Reality and Virtual Reality are the glasses. Early beta testing showed that even with Google Glass, they were a bit conspicuous, and some business started disallowing them because of the chance that patrons could be recorded without permission. In addition, not everyone\u2019s head is the same size or shape, so it can be challenging to get the model we may want that will fit our faces, AND look nice, AND work for people who already wear glasses. I realistic alternative is AR\\VR contacts. Again though, not everyone may enjoy wearing them, or if they do, they may need prescription lenses. In addition, for full immersion, it helps to have some for of physical interaction capability aside from eye movement. Usually this is either a glove or some sort of handheld controller. With the Internet of Things however, smart clothes are becoming more prevalent. Instead of having to wear a dedicated sensor or controller for your AR\\VR, it could just connect with your clothes. Move your arm in a certain way, and it measures your response and acts accordingly. So, in the end I think it is going to develop along one or both of those lines. It is a matter of how much more those technologies mature, and how much are we willing to embrace them. One interesting point though is the processors are getting phenomenally powerful. Today\u2019s smartphones are more powerful than \u201cyesterday\u2019s\u201d supercomputers, and \u201ctomorrow\u2019s\u201d smartphones will be as powerful as \u201ctoday\u2019s\u201d supercomputers. We are quickly approaching the point where processors will be so powerful that you could double their speed and not be able to perceive the difference. Regardless of how things turn out, I will say that 10 years from now, you will be able to use conversational speech to control and interact with your phone, and it will likely have some form of AI that works significantly better than what we have today.

            "answer_text": "Ten years ago, someone asked, \u201cWhere will the laptop technology be in 10 years?\u201d Then Apple introduced the iPhone and changed the world forever. It\u2019s not that laptops died, but people\u2019s world suddenly started revolving around their smartphones and laptops took a backseat. My guess is that smartphones will continue to be the center of people\u2019s lives for another 10\u201315 years, but eventually some new technology will replace them and take them out of people\u2019s minds forever. Google has already tried to do something interesting with Google Glass, but they didn\u2019t succeed commercially. But same was the case with Apple\u2019s earlier invention similar to modern smartphones \u2014 Apple Newton. Sometimes it takes a few iterations for technologists to hit bull\u2019s eye. My feeling is that we need a new technology that can become a part of human bodies and let us evolve into smarthumans. Why do you need a smartphone screen with \u201cretina display\u201d when a user interface can directly be projected on your retina? Why do you need an on-screen keyboard when thoughts can be read, parsed and acted upon electronically (see Brain\u2013computer interface - Wikipedia)? The company that does this right will be the next Apple. ",

As more gadgets are able to connect to the smart phone our interaction with the device will become less direct and more indirect. Our touch screens will give way to glass tablets that pull data and processing from our \u201csmart phones\u201d. Instead of touching the screen on the device itself we will touch a separate screen. These screens, like dongles today, will be sold for $50-$100. We won\u2019t have an iphone and ipad, we will have a iphone will multiple sized glass tablets. We will have wearables for everything, all connected into our smart phone. We will have ear pieces instead of using our phone as a phone. The phone itself will be approximately the same size only no touch screen and few buttons. It will pretty much be a processor, battery, and internet connection. The phone will serve as the connection and processor of all the devices that we interact with, but we will have little direct interaction with it. However, it will be far more personal and something that we never like being without as the world we interact with won\u2019t recognize us without the device. Hope this helps. ",
