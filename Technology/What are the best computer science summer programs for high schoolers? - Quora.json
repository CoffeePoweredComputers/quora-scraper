Also, there's Tractor (a card game which I am notoriously bad at).SPARC: Not strictly a CS camp, but apparently Python & machine learning are taught for programming labs.A*: Have no experience with this (What is the A-STAR program for pre-college math and CS students?), but they run summer and winter competitive programming camps for Bay Area students.",
