            "answer_text": "Did you feel your house looked too outdated compared to your friend\u2019s or relative\u2019s? Or are you planning to have a new home built which is in sync with the latest trend? We all want to be in the line with the latest trend, especially when it concerns our social life. When we design or redesign our homes, it helps if we can draw inspiration from the latest trends. Here are five major interior designing trends in 2019 Biophilia - This trend is becoming increasingly popular in homes. More natural elements are being placed around the house. This gives a feeling of oneness with nature and has a very calming effect, especially indoors. This could range from moss covered walls( Checkout here ) to artificial plants and flower stands . Bold and geometric - The year 2019 has seen a rise in use of bolder and richer colors in homes. The era of using cool grey\u2019s is slowly diminishing and people want to experiment with vibrant emeralds and ruby reds. Along with these come geometric designs and patterns (decor, lighting elements, carpets, walls) which surprisingly gel well with such vibrant colors. Canopy beds- First invented in the 13th century, the four poster bed was popular but lost its appeal around the 80\u2019s. However, it is now back on the trend list. Anybody looking for a comfortable and secure style in beds can go for the canopy bed. It comes in varying textures, designs and sizes.  Bold, black bathrooms- Bathrooms have always been fitted with light colored tiles, marble preferably. 2019 has seen a rise not in white tiles but black tiles! It gives a more secure and sophisticated look to your bathroom and is simply must get!  Sustainability - Somewhat related to the Biophilia theme, this includes buying furniture that is sustainable to reduce the negative impact on nature. This type of furniture includes recyclable material and lasts longer and is more durable than normal furniture. If you have a green thumb, then sustainable interiors is what you\u2019d love!  ",

            "answer_text": "If you\u2019re ready to find out about the top 2018 interior design trends, read on. We asked the experts to share their predictions on what\u2019s in and what\u2019s out. Their answers may surprise you. Bold colors: This is officially your incentive to push the boundaries of pattern and color. While neutral shades should still make up a portion of your design, in 2018 it looks like we\u2019ll see them take much more of a background position. You can either go big with statement furniture or use these shades throughout your accessories. In particular, rugs, throw pillows and blankets are a great way to get in on the trend without feeling overly committed. Vintage accessories : Design should be anything but boring. We love the idea of this vintage accessories trend because it allows you to give your designs a little something special, a built-in showpiece and potential focal point. We suggest doing some research to see which era of design you connect with the most and using those types of accessories as your inspiration. Darker and mixed finishes : We\u2019ve talked about how to mix metals before. If you\u2019re going to go this route, remember to pick one dominant metal to carry the room and to use the others as accents. You should also be sure to match the finishes on each type of metal to help pull them together visually. Wide-plank woods : Wider planks are the perfect choice for those who prefer rustic or industrial aesthetics. They have a way of providing the room with a sense of history and charm that is rarely found in more mass-engineered looks. Additionally, even though the wood will probably be fairly neutral, the wide planks will add a subtle pop of visual interest to the room.
