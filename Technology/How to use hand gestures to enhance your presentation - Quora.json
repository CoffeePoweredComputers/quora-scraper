            "answer_text": "Hand gestures can definitely improve your presentations, and in two ways. The first is in the general sense, without specific intention, but rather as part of your overall body movements. That is to say, when we\u2019re passionate about a subject, our upper body gets involved: hands and arms, as well as facial expressions and vocal variation. Our movements provide an energetic undertone to our words. A more intentional use of our hands involves a bit of choreography. We may be talking about a person, or a tree, that grows from small to tall, in which case we can use our hands to illustrate the process by holding our hands close together, then increasing the distance between them to simulate growing. Hands can be used to specify two physical points of reference, as you may say, \u201cTo my left was the ocean, and to my right the hills.\u201d Hands can be clenched, portraying anger, or offer palm up, arm outstretched as you ask the audience, \u201cWhat would you do?\u201d In subtle ways, your hands can support the emotional tone of your talk.

            "answer_text": "That\u2019s a great question. The answer depends on several things. 1) Is this question relating to a single pretension or 2) In general for all aspects of public speaking? If it\u2019s #2 and you want to improve overall, I suggest you join a local Toastmasters group and commit to once a week for six months before you begin to see an improvement in your public speaking overall and gestures specifically. You can tell your evaluators that you want suggestions for improvement in the areas of gestures to take a faster track in that regard. If it\u2019s #1, then take a look a the venue where you will be speaking. See how much room there is to move around, and create your speech in reverse based on the amount of space there is on the stage or area you have to present. You will look like a pro when you get up there and all your movements perfectly match the amount of space you have to move. Along with gestures goes equaling your time on both sides of the stage. Try not to favor either side of the audience or the other side will feel cheated of your presence. If you have trouble coming up with natural gestures, you can present your speech to a friend in your living room and (you really need to memorize it, or 90% memorize it) deliver it to them. Have someone video you on your phone. Just give the speech a few feet in front of them like you are explaining how you\u2019re going to do your speech, and not like you are really doing it. Watch the video back. You will see small, natural gestures that you did without realizing it. Then you can make those bigger and put them in at the right places in your speech if you freeze up gesture-wise on stage. That worked for me when I had no idea what to do with my hands when I went from my living room to the stage - I realized I had to rehearse it. Good luck and remember to practice! Watching yourself on video can frighten you, but it\u2019s all the more reason to join Toastmasters. It\u2019s not what you think it is, probably. It\u2019s a safe place to make your mistakes with friendship and support. And it\u2019s really affordable. About $60 for six months in most cases. Break a leg. ",
