On Saturdays my mom screaming at the top of her lungs for us to get up to do our chores was another really loud shock to our systems. Maybe you need someone to do that for you. So are you having a hearing problem (get your hearing checked), or do you stay out too late or embibe too late. You should get 7\u20138 hours of good sleep. If it\u2019s depression then try some vitamins/minerals. While I could mention the old pagers used to shake in your pocket, but maybe that won\u2019t work. ",

I generally can wake on time by looking at the clock prior to going to sleep, mentally telling myself when I need to get up. I would suggest if you need to work on your sleep healthy habits. What I mean by that is setting up healthy habits, going to bed at the same time, getting up at the same time everyday. Sorry no days off! Do this everyday. Don\u2019t drink caffeine or alcohol several hours before bed. Cut screen time before bed, don\u2019t eat too much .. you know, all the things to help you rest! I am a strong believer in rituals. I guess loud alarms if all else fails! ",

The D jay laying down some loving music with a top note of bottles being smashed come on cunt get some might mean 1 hour 32 minutes before you have to get up. Bird song is really irregular the flocks just turn up at random times and savage the local insects leave the curtains open and set your head that you have to be standing with your trousers, skirt or kilt on at a certain time. Probably your big problem is the snooze button. Never use it ! Promise you should have set it all up before you went to bed. Four hours sleep or at least lying down is doable just get up and feet on the floor no second thoughts just do it ",

If you have a dog this method might work for you, just put your dog on the bed to sleep with you and keep the door closed, dogs usually have to go to the bathroom depending on their age. Lets say that your dog is five years old (in human years) then he/she will be able to wait to go potty for five hours. This stays the same as they grow up. So if you have your door closed your dog will wake you up to go to the bathroom and you let him/her outside and start your day. ",

A lot of alarms can be made apparently louder by putting them in a cavity like a pint glass. I used to use a time switch that switches a slightly modified radio on tuned to an obnoxious channel! ",

Before sleep drink about a quart of water (not alcohol) your nody will process it and while you are in the bathroom you can wake up. Or if you live alone set your alarm in different rooms close enough to hear and far enough to walk to. Or change jobs because eventually you will be fired anyway. ",
