Therefore, you should find a mouse according to your budget. If your budget is good, then you will get a very good quality mouse, otherwise, if your budget is not good then it can be very difficult to find a perfect mouse for you. But you don't have to worry, because here I have informed you about both budget mouse, if your budget is low then go for low budget icons or if your budget is good then go for a good budgeted mouse. if we talk about the best mouse within 500 rupees then HP USB X500 Wired Optical Mouse, Lenovo 300 Wired USB Mouse, and Logitech M90 Wired USB Mouse are the best mouse. Secondly, if your budget is more than 1000 rupees, then you should go for a high budget mouse like Redragon Gainer M610 Wired USB Gaming Mouse, Dragonwar ELE-G9, Logitech G102 Prodigy Optical Mouse and Logitech Pebble M350 Mouse.
