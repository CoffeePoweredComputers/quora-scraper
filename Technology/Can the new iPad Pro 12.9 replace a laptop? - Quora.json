However, to me, \u2018capability to organize files effectively, move files through USBs, print documents and such\u2019 doesn\u2019t sound like a particularly complete description of what I expect a student to want to do. What software do you anticipate using (if you know yet)? What subjects will you study at what level? Does the college where you will study have any advice about whether you will need a laptop? I have had an iPad Pro 12.9 for over a year and used it for an hour or more a day for a ton of different tasks. I love it - it is really, really good - and justifiably expensive. I also have two high-end laptops (work and personal ) which I use around seven hours a day or more, mostly for work, again, widely varied tasks. It\u2019s been 20+ years since I was a student, but three or four years of study (assuming you\u2019re about to start an undergraduate degree course) will involve countless activities for which you\u2019d want a good computing device. A laptop is much more flexible. There is just so much more you can do with one than an iPad. For niche, specific tasks that the iPad plus a good app does well (such as taking handwritten notes, drawing, a portable reading device and web browser), the iPad is much better than a laptop. For a much wider range of tasks (including writing and editing large documents - something I imagine all students need to do a lot), a laptop is either much better in my opinion, or is the only one which is even capable of doing the job, because the software for that job is only available on a laptop, or the iOS Apps which do the job have a much reduced set of functionality. You can also get a really nice laptop for the same price as a relatively small-storage iPad Pro without cellular, and have money to spare for some software. If you were thinking about getting the biggest iPad Pro with cellular (which is what I chose), then for the same price you can get an absolutely brilliant laptop - powerful and light - which will easily last your entire course and then some, and a docking station, a decent monitor, keyboard and mouse to use when you\u2019re working at your desk - much nicer for those loooooong writing/study sessions. So, no, I don\u2019t think an iPad can really replace a laptop for most of us. It\u2019s getting really, really close, and if you had the option to have both, I would. But if you can only have one, have a laptop. ",

            "answer_text": "With the pending release of iOS11 the answer is YES*. But notice that yes has an asterisk. iOS 11 is a significant change to iOS. It brings visible sharable files, and system-wide drag and drop. This means that users whose work requires acting on files or users who need workflows which bounce data between different applications, will find everything becomes much easier and more intuitive. For those who do this sort of thing, iOS 11 iPad is going to be ideal. Now for the asterisk part. *However\u2026 There are people who develop software, or rely on all sorts of specialised apps and plugins and various modifications to the system. These people will never be satisfied with the constraints of a safe OS. They need a desktop style OS, and all the instability and mutability that goes with it. For them anything less than this is not a \u201creal\u201d computer. I suspect there is a bit of bias at work in estimating how big these two groups are. A lot of people who live and breathe in computer-land would estimate that 90% of users absolutely need desktop features, and only about 10% could manage with a restricted machine. I would dispute those numbers. My guess is that in the real world, about 95% of people would be totally happy with the benefits of a safe os and perhaps only small number of computer specialists need the features of desktop OS. I don\u2019t think the desktop PC operating system is going away. But I think the majority of users can manage without the risk. And there is one other reason why we should avoid using PC OSes\u2026  ",

I use it everyday for many different tasks: watching videos, emails, social media, web browsing, online shopping, etc. I can even use it for scanning documents and maybe some light word processing and Excel, but nothing too heavy. My iPad works great on the content consumption tasks (emails, social media, etc.), but runs into problems when I want to actually to produce something more complex. So, my answer to this would be that if your sole purpose is content consumption and that\u2019s what you use your laptop for, then, yes, the iPad can probably replace it. But as soon as you get to the more complex tasks, then you need a PC. For most people, I would say that they could probably live with just an iPad as most computer-related tasks fall in the content consumption category. For those heavy-duty users who need to actually produce something, then, no, it cannot replace a laptop. Apple needs to add more features (mouse support, better file management system, etc.) to iOS to really be considered a PC replacement. ",

You may have more of that in iOS 11, but right now it\u2019s all cloud-storage focused. iPad still focuses on consuming media, not producing it. For drawings and office documents, iOS 11 steps forward, but cannot replace a laptop unless you alter your workflow to exclude USB drives, focus on cloud storage, and stop thinking about file hierarchies and instead rely on tags and search.

Even my ipad pro replace my macbook pro for work, i can say it may different for you. since i have my ipad pro, i use my macbook pro as second tools. I am working on my ipad pro and watching movie on my macbook pro. you can completely replace your laptop if you can find all apps you need on apps store. Of course you need to buy the apps, but i can quarantee if the apps are a lot of cheaper than usual laptops or windows apps. here how i work on my ipad pro organize and move files : i use dropbox to organize and move files. using dropbox a lot easier than using google drive or icloud to organize your file and you don\u2019t need usb to move your files into your computer. Ipad pro doesn\u2019t have usb port.Printing : you can using wifi to send your files into wifi printer.working : drawing on my ipad pro, and easily send the final files directly into my client without using my computer.music : pocket tube apps is options for offline music download and listening on ios or you can register for music on itunes.movie : no, you can't download or pirating movie on ios. But you can streaming on youtube or another movie pirate websites.and of course i type this on my ipad pro. so if you\u2019re looking for usb ports, ipad pro doesn\u2019t have it. ",

            "answer_text": "It really depends on what programs you need. If you're a liberal arts major and just need a word processor and a web browser, there's a very good chance that an iPad with an external keyboard could be all you need. Your needs could be served today with Dropbox (or other cloud storage), and with iOS 11 and the Files App you may not even need that. There are flash drives available with a lightning connector and a USB connector that work with iPads. Most recent printers have AirPrint support so you can print from an iPad. I regularly multitask on my 9.7\u2033 iPad Pro (though YouTube requires a YouTube red subscription for that feature), so you'll comfortably be able to have two or more things open at once on a 12.9\u2033 model. As a college student you'll likely have access to a computer lab if there is a task that an iPad can't do. ",

Ipad will never support mouse, so go away if you are a deep mouse user.To write a word, you will need to use lots of shortcut keys, otherwise you will need to point your finger at the screen frequently which is tiring. ( e.g. Shift+Option+ \u2b05\ufe0f/ \u27a1\ufe0f to select word one by one. long press CMD button to find more)You need to have a logitech Create keyboard. Or any other keyboard with shortcut buttons ( e.g. home, lock, volume up/down etc.)Don\u2019t buy Apple\u2019s own keyboard, there is no keyboard light, there is no shortcut keys, and it is super expensive.make good use of multi tasking system. in total, three apps can run at the same time after IOS 11.Don\u2019t expect to use much software or Photoshop on your Ipad.still a lot APP doesn\u2019t support horizontal display which is painful.You will find sometimes it is even so difficult to attachen a PDF when sending an email. ( I solve this by sharing the PDF send to my own mail APP using GMAIL, and then I use my own mail APP save the attachment. then I can use my own mail APP to send mail by choosing attachment from saved docs)Get your self an IOS device memory stick, it makes sharing docs easier as well.Get yourself a new 29w charger and buy an apple\u2019s typeC to lighting cable to enable fast charging.

You really can't effeciently move files around on an iPad, nor can you use a USB since it doesn't have a USB port. You can find adapters, but I don't think you can move anything but pictures. Again, you could use cloud storage to move things, but if you need it on a physical USB drive, you can't on an iPad. I strongly recommend you don't sink hundreds of dollars into an overpriced piece of garbage for use at college. If you need help finding the right laptop, I can help you find the cheapest laptop available with features like a touch screen, gaming capabilites, large storage, or included programs. ",
