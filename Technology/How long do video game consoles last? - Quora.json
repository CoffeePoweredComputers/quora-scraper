            "answer_text": "That depends on lots of things. Quality of the product, amount of time the item is used and the general upkeep of the item. The worst system I ever had as far as lifespan goes was the very fun, but difficult to get going Nintendo NES. I loved it, but it you didn\u2019t almost pass out from manually blowing in the cartridge before inserting it , pushing it down before hitting the power button then you might not get to play whatever game was calling you. On the other hand I never had that problem with any other console and I have almost all of my systems in storage in pristine working condition. That group includes Sega Dreamcast, Super Nintendo, Nintendo 64, Nintendo Wii and a GameCube, PS1, 2 (3 & 4 I\u2019m still using) a Sony PSP and a Nintendo 3DXL Sony like everyone else has their quirks, but they still start like I just bought them and although they\u2019re not perfect, you get less chances of the RLOD than messing around with an XBox So I\u2019ll probably always be a Sony guy.

            "answer_text": "Ideally, if you take care of the machine - and aren\u2019t the idiot who owned this poor Xbox One before it died\u2026  \u2026a game console should last you a very long time - mostly likely exactly as long as you need it to keep working That being said, game consoles are mass manufactured in Taiwanese factories by the millions - and while Quality Control tries its best to weed out the faulty machines, sometimes the defective machines make it on to store shelves Most often, the defects in these machines are gradual\u2026 only showing up after a certain amount of time, which would not register during the brief testing done at the factory Generally speaking, if a machine is going to fail due to manufacturing problems, it will do so within the warranty period you get when buying the thing - so if your console has lasted longer than the warranty, it\u2019ll probably keep going for as long as you own it ",
