            "answer_text": " The Club has two hooks, that the user ideally will place through the steering wheel to minimize its movement vis-a-vis the steering wheel AND so that the steering wheel and club are prevented by the roof, door or floor from turning.  The shaft is lengthened to its maximum and locked in place with the key.  (The pictured Club is improperly placed, with the steering wheel and the car's wheels not turned, with neither hook inside one of the small openings of the steering wheel, and with the extended shaft not near the car's structure.) The Club can easily be defeated by cutting the steering wheel so that The Club can be removed. I used to use one, and my car was never stolen.  Who knows whether that helped? Modern steering wheel and ignition locks are much more resistant to thievery than were ignition locks in the 1980s when The Club was invented. ",

            "answer_text": "It is a pole that has a hook attached to one end, and another movable hook. One hook is placed on the inside edge of the steering wheel. The other hook is slid to the opposite inside edge. Once in place, the movable hook is locked into place. Now the pole is securely attached to the steering wheel. The steering wheel can now turn just a few degrees before the pole meets an obstruction. If you can't steer, you can't drive. However, you can easily remove the steering wheel, replacing it with another. Or you could cut the steering wheel to remove the club. When it comes to preventing car theft, nothing is a sure thing. The club is easy to defeat. But it is a cheap easy deterrent. ",
