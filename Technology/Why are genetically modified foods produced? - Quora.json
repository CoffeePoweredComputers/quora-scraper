Every organism in an ecosystem needs to evolve with all the other organisms around it. These days, animal fodder is mostly what\u2019s engineered, and it\u2019s to have resistance to things like glyphosate. The problem with that is the advent of \u201cSuperweeds\u201d. A plant will come along that is resistant to this herbicide, and pretty soon you need something new to spray on the crops. That is, until weeds develop a resistance to that one too, and on it goes. I\u2019m not saying that I have all the answers, but I know that GMO\u2019s aren\u2019t it. ",

We have been modifying weeds to turn them into food since before recorded history. The whole anti-GMO movement is an embarrassment to educated people. In fact the chickens, cows and pigs we eat are also modified from their original wild species so they are better suited for eating.  ",
