            "answer_text": "Every year, my Dad would use his weekends - often plus some vacation days - to bring in the year\u2019s supply of firewood. We\u2019d get the week off school, if that was the plan (perks of being homeschooled!), and my Mom would plan quick and easy meals. We\u2019d dig out the denim and leather work gloves, give our muck boots a run under the hose, and slather on the mosquito repellent. My Dad would load up the irreplaceable Stihl canvas bag with his chainsaw accessories - I can still remember when he upgraded and it came into our lives, and I can smell the two-cycle engine oil and sawdust odor that permeated it delightfully. We had a variety of tractors over the years - beginning with simple riding lawn mowers, and upgrading first to an old classic Ferguson, then the most adorable light but powerful Iseki Bolens, and finally to a sleek Kubota with a payment book and everything. Each would roll through the black dirt, often swinging a bushhog behind. But on firewood days, our faithful tractor would be pulling a trailer. It started as a lawn trailer - just a little cart for grass. I\u2019ll never forget its painted black sides, scratched and battered by the logs that took it from new to well-loved. Then my Dad picked up a deal on an enourmous metal trailer that originally had done service hauling telephone poles. It had a half-circle cutout on each end for the pole to rest in and everything. It was solid iron and weighed an astronomical amount; the pink and white paint scheme and tall side posts for hanging linemen\u2019s gear added to its conspicuousness. But it could hold a ton of firewood, and the Ferguson could keep it rolling. I\u2019ll never forget riding in on top of a load of cut logs, clinging to one of those posts as we bounced over the rust and my Dad gunned the engine to keep us from bogging down. He\u2019d always look back before gunning it, to catch our eyes and make sure we were prepared for the lurch. Eventually Ferguson was sold on eBay - adding my cute little brother and parking it in an apple orchard in bloom when we took its listing photos probably helped it sell almost instantly - and the Bolens (also an eBay deal) arrived. Bolens couldn\u2019t really budge the monster trailer. So my Dad drove home one day with a cute SkiDoo trailer - nothing but wheels and a frame with two carpeted skids. He decked it with tongue and groove pressure-treated lumber and added a coat of light blue paint. Our wood trailer was born, and would last until just before I married and moved away from home. Each one of those trailers has memories wrapped up in the giant loads of firewood it hauled. The smell of crisp leaves and crushed spicebush leaves. The quiet rustling of a forest in the height of summer. The winding trails that my Dad cut and cleared, always with twists and turns because my Mom loved to walk and see what was around the bend. The poison ivy (which I am immune to), the jack-in-the-pulpits standing bright and tall, the fiddlehead ferns in their mysterious glory. The rush as I\u2019d pedal my mountain bike a quarter mile back to the house and assemble cold lemonade and cups, feeling a childish wonder at how strange our home was with just me inside it. Driving my bike back while balancing a bottle of lemonade, watching intently on the path for sticks and bumps and ruts. The feelings of victory when we came in at the end of the night, gross and tired and sore and incredibly happy. The glow of a family working together, with a common enemy in the flies and mosquitos and a common goal filling that trailer. Later the piles would melt as we\u2019d split and stack logs, and I learned to make neat ends and stack cord after cord. I didn\u2019t love hauling wood on sleds up to the house in the dead of winter, but those summer and fall evenings spent out watching my Dad drop tired trees and picking them up are precious memories. My Mom still wears the same coat and picks up sticks, and my Dad still cuts trees for firewood. The giants of the forest don\u2019t really grow on their newer, smaller land, and the muck was left behind for high ground, but the people are the same. I\u2019ve tried to \u201cgo home again\u201d in the last five years, but pregnancy and little ones and falling trees and stacking heavy logs didn't mix well. The times out in the woods are my most precious family memories of old, and my great regret is that in my late teens and early twenties I scorned those days and wiggled out of them, pleading school or sickness or work. I\u2019d give so much to slip into muck boots and walk under the sun-kissed trees with my Dad, watching for his signals and occasionally shouting over the ear protection, and rolling giant logs after he carefully dropped and sectioned off the trees. But they say you can\u2019t go home again. The old house is there, but the yard was changed to horse pasture, and dishonest loggers trashed much of the glorious forest. We still keep in touch with the people next door, and someday - someday I want to wander their trails right to the border and peek into the land I grew up on. ",

            "answer_text": "It used to be Christmas, when I was a little girl, the second of six children.  Christmas Eve was spent at my Grandmother's, a large Craftsman farmhouse filled with aunts and uncles and cousins, and all of we children forced to contain our enthusiasm, and to absolutely not play with the creche figurines or stick the black olives on our fingers and walk around plucking them off with our mouths.  All the adults drank beer, which in my family was seen as harmless as water, so we kids didn't realize Dad was stumbling drunk driving us back home.  We were allowed to open one present on Christmas Eve-  always the same gift:  Pajamas from Aunt Greta.  Oh, well,  we'd put them on and go off to bed, my elder sister and I upstairs under the eaves, the younger ones in the downstairs bedroom, two to a trundle. We would lie in bed, eyes scrunched closed, fighting to go to sleep because we all knew the sooner we went to sleep, the sooner Christmas morning and the presents came.  There was no giggling or arguing on Christmas Eve-  Mom wouldn't stand for it.  Mom, I figured out when I had kids of my own, took bedtime seriously because it was finally her chance to not have to watch and correct and referee and herd six rambunctious kids around.  I didn't know it was because she was ticked off at Dad- again- for getting drunk on Christmas Eve-  again- after she'd carefully hoarded change and made a pound of hamburger do the work of two for three months saving money to buy our gifts and there he was, passed out and snoring-  again.  Oh, well,  ignorance was bliss. Because we would finally sink into sleep, and Christmas morning would finally come-  usually around 4 a.m.  That's when we would gather, all of us kids-  or at least, those of us old enough to understand we had to be very, very quiet.  We would gather upstairs, under the eaves, on the two twin beds, and we would draw a map of the living room-  the tree here, the stockings there, the couch, with Dad, asleep, guarding the presents, there.  Well, that's what we thought, anyway.  And two of us would be picked-  usually my next younger brother and I- to creep down the creaky stairs, across the smooth and shiny cork flooring, stealing into the living room in the dark, to get a look at the presents and report back. (It occurs to me now, my older sister probably had us go to protect her own rear-end's skin:  my brother and I could be quiet, the others couldn't be trusted, and it left her able to feign ignorant sleep if we were caught by Mom- a fate none of us wanted. The last Christmas this happened, my brother and I slipped down and through the house into the dark living room.  We could hear Dad, snoring on the couch, we could see the small piles of gifts, darker shapes against the darkness of the room, and we went on our inspection in PJ'd feet.  A bike, doll, ice skates, chemistry set, Tonka truck-  good stuff!  I climbed up onto the hearth and snagged a stocking, and we started to tip-toe out but we must have made some sound because suddenly dad snorted, coughed, came awake and grumped \"What are you doing in here?\" I ducked, flat to the floor behind the coffee table but my brother was caught, deer in the headlights caught.  \"Get back up to bed!\" and my brother shot off, out of the room. I waited and waited and waited, barely breathing, and finally got up the nerve to creep out myself.  My brother was waiting for me in the hall, and we sped together towards the stairs, but, it must have been pent-up fear, because, as we passed the downstairs bedroom where our youngest brother was still sleeping, missing out on the fun since he was only 4 and unable to control himself, my brother said \"Ho-Ho-Ho!\" and started laughing madly.  We made the stairs, trying to be both fast and quiet, giggling uncontrollably, and we heard the youngest brother shout \"Santa!  I heard Santa!\" as he came running out of the bedroom- -straight into Mom. She lit into our younger brother, ordering him back to bed, and discovering the rest of her younger children were AWOL from the trundles.  She really got lit up then, and, as I recall, we had to sit and wait until 7:00 before she would let us come down to our presents.  It took HOURS. But I still had the stocking, so we shared it out, and tried our best to feel ashamed of ourselves. We moved the next year, all the way to Colorado, with a different kind of house, and a different way of living.  We still had good Christmases, but we never gathered up to plot our present piracy again-  and sometimes, I miss that. Now, I suppose I've gotten old enough to not have any single favorite tradition-  they're all good, to me. ",
