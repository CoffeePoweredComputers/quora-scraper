            "answer_text": "First, I would like to share a personal point of view about collaboration that I have been able to verify many times: Tools or processes do not make a team collaborative. Attitude does. With or without collaborative tools.However, beyond this easy and provocative response, knowledge sharing tools depends on what sort of information you want to share, what you mean by \u201csharing\u201d and how is your team geographically scattered. What do you want to share ? Text document, video or images, mind map, spreadsheet, URL, Power Point or Prezi style presention, map, etc ? Beyond knowledge content, there is knowledge content manager, communication tools and collaborative project / tasks management tools.What do you mean by sharing ? From simply allowing one person to be able to read files of another person to being able to simultaneously edit a common shared file, whatever content type it is, and even while chatting and video-conferencing ?Are you able to put people in the same room IRL ? Are you spreaded all around the world ? Does everyone has a good Internet connection ?After years of working with several tools and teams, my unique response is still\u2026 Google tools. I use them mainly when I need my team to co-create or think of a specific solution, and when they are scattered around the world : Everyone has access to it.It\u2019s free (at a certain point)You can do everything you need with Google doc tools using canevas, apps, etc..Everyone can understand how it works in a few minutes.It\u2019s reliable.Works on Apple OS, PC, Chrome notebook even on Android smartphones !File sharing is very easy to understand and to set up.Backup on local hard drives is automaticSome task management tools are really good at initiating collaboration as well as following tasks. My prefered one is still JIRA Software (Issue & Project Tracking for Software Teams) To me, when the team can be assembled, the best collaborative sharing tools are still big sheets on a wall and pencils or whiteboard / cork board. Hope this helps SB ",
