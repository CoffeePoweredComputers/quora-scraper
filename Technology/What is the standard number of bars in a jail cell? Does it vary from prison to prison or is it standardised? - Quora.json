            "answer_text": "Most prisons and many jails don\u2019t have bars on the cells. The doors are typically solid with the exception of a narrow window from roughly where the door handle (which is recessed into the door) and maybe 6 inches from the top of the door. Cells also have a window that is a few inches wide and maybe 30 inches tall in the outer wall. Enough to allow some light to enter, but not enough to give much of a view and definitely not wide enough to get through even if you could break the \u201cglass\u201d out. The \u201cglass\u201d is usually lexan - a polycarbonate substitute that has 250 times greater impact resistance than glass and 30 times that of acrylic. ",

In the State I served my sentence in 3 maximum security prisons were identical with each other. In the cell windows there were 2 bars. The windows were far too small for even a small inmate to attempt to escape from after removing the 2 bars in the window. ",
