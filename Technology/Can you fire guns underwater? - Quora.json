            "answer_text": "\u201cCan a gun fire underwater?\u201d Absolutely! Gunpowder contains oxygen - a key element in the firing process - so when the trigger is pulled, the gun still goes off exactly as it would on land as long as no water has crept inside the shell casing. When it comes to science experiments, Andrew Wahl, a Norwegian Physicist, isn't afraid to take risks. In this experiment, Wahl hops into a pool and puts himself in the direct line of fire with a loaded gun. Using a cord, he pulls the trigger on himself. Water is 800% more dense than air, so unlike a bullet fired above the surface, once the bullet hits the water it immediately begins slowing down. And instead of barreling towards Wahl, the bullet slows and falls to the bottom of the pool. Even though this was a controlled experiment, Wahl still looks totally relieved. *DO NOT TRY THIS AT HOME* \u00a00:00-0:30 Underwater Firearms were created in the 1960\u2019s during the Cold War as a way to arm frogmen. Because standard ammunition does not work well underwater, a common feature of underwater firearms is that they fire flechettes, or spear-like bolts instead of standard bullets. These are usually fired by pressurized gas.  Soviet APS Underwater Assault Rifle ",

By doing so, they avoid the issue of pushing the water in front of the bullet out of the barrel, which is one of the main problems in firing a gun underwater. ",
