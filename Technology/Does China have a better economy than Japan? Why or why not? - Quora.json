            "answer_text": "Not sure what you mean by \u201cbetter\u201d. If you mean more successful, no. China\u2019s economy has exploded but it has been due to investment and a large workforce (the same thing that happened to Japan). This has brought millions out of poverty but the country still significantly lags Japan in terms of GDP per capita (a better measure of individual wealth than GDP PPP or nominal). If you mean outlook, then I would again say no. China has at least two of the fundamental problems Japan has been facing since the 1980s - slowing population growth and aging. By 2050, it\u2019s expected that 200 million will retire from the workforce in China (and by 2100 the total will be 600 million). With birthrates well below replacement level, China\u2019s population will start shrinking noticeably in the 2020s. This means that as time goes on, China\u2019s dependency ratio (those dependent on the workforce) will skyrocket. As more and more pressure is put on the working-age generations to support the children and elderly, the economy will stall just as Japan\u2019s did. Unlike Japan, however, the leadership is returning to supporting state-owned companies over private ones. Being that state-owned companies tend to be horribly inefficient and corrupt, I expect China\u2019s economy will shrink substantially before it levels out. ",

            "answer_text": "On the economic level, the difference between China and Japan lies in the size of the market. The main problem is aging. China's per capita level lags far behind Japan's, and it seems that China's economic situation is not better. However, we should be clear that political economy as a science is not comprehensive only in terms of economy, but also in terms of politics when discussing economy. For China and Japan,It is a zero-sum game to rely solely on current resources to develop in the framework of the existing world order. No one will have a clear momentum for growth. the strong impetus for future development comes from two possibilities. The first is the huge dividend of breaking the current world order , We believe that the world is equal and it is unacceptable that hard-working people staying at the bottom of the pyramid. The second is the huge dividend brought about by the fourth industrial revolution. From this point of view, China and Japan are essentially different. I don't want to analyze them too much. Let's call it a day. ",
