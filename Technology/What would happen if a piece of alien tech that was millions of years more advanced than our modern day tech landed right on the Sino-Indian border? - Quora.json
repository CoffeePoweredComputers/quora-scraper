India will grab another part, and set up a committee to study it in detail and that will be work in progress, for the next two decades. They will call it a strategic, national issue, refuse to disclose in public any plan and introduce a GST rate of 28 % on all Indians, for just being a citizen. (USA will appoint Trump as the project manager and he will become bankrupt again and drag USA, along with himself and his family - however, the IRS will finally wake up to how Trump diddled them ?) Hope this helps, do stay safe, make a better day ! ",
