            "answer_text": "The short answer is no. Google Search often gives answers (or results) that for a human, seems as if another qualified, trained human was involved. It is an amazing accomplishment; however it is not Artificial Intelligence. GSE also uses machine learning and many predictive/modeling algorithms first seen in AI systems, that by itself does not make Google Search an AI. AI needs \u201ca flexible rational agent that perceives its environment and takes actions that maximize its chance of success at an arbitrary goal.\u201d. Even if we relax the \u201carbitrary goal\u201d requirement, based on the notion that even humans can have a very specific \u2018top\u2019 goal of being happy or some such. It is still not an AI because GSE is not constructed as a rational agent. If GSE was a rational agent it will have a non-trivial goal that tries to maximize a set of possible unsupervised actions it could take based on some evolving internal state which models its world and the degree of uncertainty. An example of AI at Google is DeepMind\u2019s Go playing program. GSE is more akin to an expert system but increased use of machine learning will push it over time, closer to an AI. But will it get there? I don\u2019t know. To me seems risky from the business perspective. If one day GSE refuses to answer somebody\u2019s question not based on some explicit rule programmed by a person, but based on some internal state for which it has modeled that answering the question will negatively affect one of its goals, then we can safely say it is now an AI.

            "answer_text": "No. An AI understands what the question is and then understands what is the answer. No search engine does this. At best they try to cateorize a query to a set of predefined categories and then use statistical methods or map to a known set of facts to pick an answer. Obviously the results are very good. BUT the engine does not really understand what they are saying. If enough people (for whatever reason) post something on the internet, Google (and all other current search engines) will report that post as an answer, even if it\u2019s meangless or wrong.
