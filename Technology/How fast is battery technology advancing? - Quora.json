            "answer_text": "Battery technology is advancing as fast as the laws of chemistry and physics will let it. New concepts in this field seem to show up every few months and are held up in the popular press as the Next Big Thing, and then vanish into obscurity, and this has led to all sorts of conspiracy theories of technology suppression. The truth, is far more pedestrian. I was a chemist, and a material scientist up until I retired, and I follow this subject closely, and actually read the refereed papers, so I see what is going on. The fact is it is a huge leap between theory and a working cell, but an even greater one between something that works on a lab bench and a commercial product. Useful life, ability to cycle enough times, thermal issues, wear and tear on the electrodes, and of course cost, both of the cell itself, the materials and overnight cost of setting up production all have to be worked out before a practical energy storage system can be brought to market. This is what we are facing here, and wistful thinking will not make any of these issues go away. ",
