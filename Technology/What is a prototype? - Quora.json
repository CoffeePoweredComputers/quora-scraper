            "answer_text": " A prototype is a working application that can show that the main idea of an app works and solves a particular problem. It can be a set of sketches, a mock-up, a model, a simulation of the final product, or a pixel-perfect prelaunch interface. It is a reflection of your idea put into some physical representation that shows the way the product will look like, what it will do, and how it will function. Prototyping is an integral part of the design process. It gives room for experimenting with the rough draft of the final product before the production cycle starts. Companies of any size should consider creating their idea prototype before the actual product development stage starts. Getting early feedback from consumers helps to define strong and weak sides, which enable designers to polish a prototype further to avoid creating inappropriate solutions. This way, all the team works efficiently with a small investment into idea implementation and low risk of its failure improving the final vision and product along the way. So the main objective of this stage is to test the product before launch, which, in turn, saves money, time, and energy. We at Visartech value prototyping as a crucial development stage that helps to evaluate the product idea from many perspectives and forms fundamentals towards successful product creation and better business results. So if you wish to start small and see whether your idea is truly in demand on the market, improve it along the development path, and make sure to jump-start strong, let's lay the foundation of your future business success together!

            "answer_text": "Prototyping is adequate to demonstrate the basic fundamentals of the idea and that the theoretical design translates into a working model. Let\u2019s talk about the types of prototype you will probably need. Visual prototype A visual prototype is a sample or model of a product to test or validate a concept. It is designed to try a new design to enhance by potential consumers users. The visual prototype is the mental formalization and potential look of an idea. There are several ways to create one: CAD (3 dimensions)Actual physical prototypeDrawing (2 dimensions)Visual 3D model (3 dimensions)Proof-of-concept A proof of concept is a system designed purely to provide a demonstration of the core functionality of set of principles. Its generally used to validate technical feasibility, helps determine the scope and of customisation necessary to complete the project. Presentation prototype The presentation prototype is simply representation of how the end invention will look. It is likely that production grade materials will be used.  If you are planning on manufacturing a product, prototyping is the best starting point. With a presentation prototype it would be easier to approach and discuss with potential manufacturer. Then you will be able to apply minor changes that may be needed to start mass-production. Prototypes are almost essential when looking to manufacture. In some instances the CAD designs from the Design Process are enough to send directly to a manufacturer, but this is predominantly only if the product is very simple and composed of existing parts. More often than not, a prototype will be necessary prior to approaching a manufacturer in order to further refine the design. In some instances, product prototype is not essential but can add value to a project. By using at least one of the type describe above you will be able to prove that the concept works.
