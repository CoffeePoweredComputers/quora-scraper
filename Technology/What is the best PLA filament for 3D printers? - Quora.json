            "answer_text": "The one that works best for you. PLA is a bit of a commodity. There are some really crap filaments out there, but if you take those out of the mix, you won\u2019t find a huge difference between the rest. It\u2019s more about your specific situation and calibrating properly for the filament that you\u2019re working with. (even different colors of filament within the same product line may behave slightly differently) I like Matterhackers for ease of use\u2026it\u2019s very tolerant of different settings. Hatchbox wins for colors and producing very vibrant prints. eSun (generally considered a \u201cbargain\u201d filament) works really well for me and it\u2019s my go-to for bulk printing spool after spool. The trick is to try different filaments and find out what works for you. Every printer/bed/hot-end is slightly different and \u201cbest\u201d for one setup may not be best for you. ",

            "answer_text": "My daily printer is a Tiertime UP Box and if I use the UP branded filament then I get very consistent results. These machines print at higher temps than most printers in both ABS and PLA and are optimized for these filaments. While worth it most of the time, the UP filaments are pricey and limited in colours so I\u2019ve tried other, cheaper brands. In Australia, I\u2019ve found eSun filaments to work very well and print almost the same as the UP stuff. I stay away from too much experimenting these days as clogged extruders are not a fun way to spend time, and large prints (6\u201320 hrs) require really consistent filament to finish without glitches.
