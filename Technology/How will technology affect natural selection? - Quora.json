            "answer_text": "Technology will have zero effect on Natural Selection. Natural Selection is nature selecting the most successful reproducers. I mean, come on, it\u2019s right there in the name. After all, technology is not (and won\u2019t be for the forseeable future) genetically heritable\u2026. However, technology has already affected Artificial Selection. And although you haven\u2019t stated it, you\u2019re talking about humans, kind of obviously. Everyday technology typically extends human lifespans. First technology? Keeping and maintaining fire. Fire cooks food, reduces disease. Fire wards off predators, wards off being eaten. Fire wards off parasites, reducing disease again, and improving quality of life in general. So fire is technology, and human lives lengthened. Then we learned to farm. Farming is\u2014and uses\u2014technology. Farming controls and stabilizes food sources. Farming generates not just bands or tribes, but communities. Communities need permanent shelter, so buildings and cities. Cities have histories, so writing and record-keeping, art and culture. Then metal. Metal is technology. Arguably among the first to be really great at decreasing lifespans, but altering policies. I\u2019m done with metal here. Somewhere about here Science is invented and things get really busy, but science allows physics to be better understood and chemistry and\u2026medicine. And vaccinations. But technology, is artificial. By its very definition. So yeah, it\u2019s great. But it has no affect whatever on non-heritable traits which provide advantage. ",

            "answer_text": "To have any noticeable effect at all, the technological impact must be sustained over a long period of time. Probably tens of thousands of years at the least. Humans have only been farming for a little over ten thousand years. A significant deployment of any form of machinery not reliant on human or animal muscle power maybe a thousand or so years. Industrialization but a few centuries. The \u201cmodern\u201d information age, a few decades. Bio-engineering hardly one decade. There is a naive assumption that technology once invented is here to stay. That the course of the future will be one of continuous advancement. Yet a quick look at history sees civilizations rising and falling over spans of just a few hundred years each. There is no evidence at present that advanced technology, whenever it appears, however many times it might appear, will ever persist long enough to have any appreciable impact on natural selection whatsoever.
