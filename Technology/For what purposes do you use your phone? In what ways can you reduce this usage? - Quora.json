            "answer_text": "Well i dont use my phone that much. So im going to show a list for what i use my phone for. One way to reduce usage is to use your phone only as a mp3 player, this way you only listen to music without doing anything else on it. Thats what i do. And im using it as a communication device. For calling sending messages. Because i have a job that requires me to use my phone for that. But if you dont have to, i would say dont reply too often keep it in your backpack or handbag, not in your pocket because your phone is sending and receiving rf emf radiation. Dont check social media to often. I for example only do that if i am on a train bus etc. If you are eating going out with friends or whatever, i always say lets not use our phones and lets enjoy the moment, only in case of emergencies, so we would check our phones every hour just to see if we got a important message for nothing else. Do not play phone games that often try to play on your ps4 xbox one or pc. You can play phone games but try to limit it for an hour or so. Dont play games that require you to pickup and use your phone all the time. I hope this is helpful to you. Goodluck with trying to reduce your usage! ",
