            "answer_text": "3 cameras are here already for a while. Android phones have introduced it some 2 years ago. Now a trend to 4 or even more cameras is ongoing.Smartphones cant\u2019t change lenses as real cameras do, so the manufacturers build in more lenses with different field of view (FOV).The 3rd camera is mostly a super wide about 120 degree FOV. This enables you to capture more of the surrounding without the need to move back.The 3rd camera is especially useful in tight spaces or when you can\u2019t move back (like for the busy road or a cliff) but want to see more of the scene.Since the FOV of the 3rd camera is similar to some action cams (GoPro) now a smartphone can generate a similar video footage as action cams.",
