            "answer_text": "My source of inspiration comes from the Divine. When Warren Buffet shared his life experiences with the youth of America, he said that luck was on his side. He is an American, grew up in his own country - the land the the free, with an adventurous spirit to do all kinds of small businesses. Warren Buffet practices a religion he likes, studying under Benjamin Graham in Wharton Business School. Warren Buffet acknowledges his good fortune and knows he will NOT do as well if he were born in Afghanistan. I have to do a lot of soul-searching to overcome a ton of inconsistencies in my family culture, and issues of religion, language, nationality, individual rights, work, health, financial security, and relationships. So by the time what I learn from Warren Buffet\u2019s biography and social scientists begins to gain traction in my life, a lot of money and opportunities had passed me by. However, the Divine reaches out to me, to inspire me to leave a legacy in the form of a book that spells out life\u2019s grand plan for my children, their friends, and my readers. This book will be published in early this year, 2019. ",

            "answer_text": "I varied by age. When I was little I wanted to succeed for my parents. Who were going through a divorce. After the divorce and throughout my father's cancer we were forced into near poverty. That was a strong life lesson. I was determined to better myself. That lasted all my life. I got married at 33 and had three children. I also needed to be successful to give them educational opportunities. ",
