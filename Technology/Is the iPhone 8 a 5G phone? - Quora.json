            "answer_text": "Though we would all like to have a 5G phone, the answer to this question is No the iPhone 8 is not a 5G phone. The fact is that the 5G technology is still in it\u2019s working stages. Most cellular companies are still testing the service out before it becomes mainstream. Apple is in the works to make a future iPhone that will support the 5G network, but the hopes are that this phone will be available some time in 2019 or after. Other cellular companies are also trying to bring 5G to the mainstream, but its a slow process because they will also have to boost the LTE signal as well for data. Hopefully in the next year or so we will see a future iPhone running 5G, but not with the current iPhone 8. ",
