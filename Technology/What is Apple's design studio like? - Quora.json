            "answer_text": "The studio is so secretive, it\u2019s sometimes referred to as \u201cthe studio behind the iron curtain.\u201d Access to the design studio is limited to a select few Apple employees. Since there are product prototypes in the design studio, Apple obviously has to take precautions to prevent leaks. On very limited and special occasions, they will allow the media in for a tour or share sneak peeks of the studio in promotional videos. The studio contains the following:1) Presentation Space 2) Kitchen 3) Designer\u2019s Workstations 4) Jonathan Ive\u2019s office 5) CAD Studio 6) CNC Shop Here is a virtual tour of the entire design studio. In this video, we can see how closely the studio resembles the design of Apples\u2019 retail stores. The studio presentation space are the same tables you\u2019ll find in any Apple store. The entrance and foyer have aluminum walls whereas, fiberglass walls divide most of the rooms inside of the studio. Of course, everything is minimalist and ultra modern with attention to functionality and simplicity.  There\u2019s real footage of the studio in the \u201cDesigned by Apple in California\u201d Chronicles 20 Years of Apple Design video.
