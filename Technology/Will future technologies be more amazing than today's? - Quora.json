            "answer_text": "BEST OWN & MOST USEFUL INVENTIONS: Seems that my 750 creative scientific & engineering publications + 5,470 Inventions & Discoveries = third prolific Inventor & Discoverer most in world & at 86 am still inventing flat-out + an entire easy Maths App Library MAL where I\u2019ve learnt how to solve exceedingly difficult equation & ODEs for which I received DSc + when you 1-word Google DRPATSAWESOMELIBRARY leads you to access & download + a hobby of collecting over 500 medical cure files from daily contact with brilliant American etc R&D Doctor Groups might verge me on being a genius + 220 incredible de-facto relationships. My latest & best Book now at the Publishers: PROSPERITY FROM A PITTANCE - The New Sustainable Future, but I can\u2019t make a single $ from it or lose the Pension. Smokeless air preheating & after-burning 1-stick HELIXTOVE far better than rocket stoves - thorn like from lemon tree or cactus as a tooth pick - Under-seat plane survival - 1930 ultra-stable micro-wing STOL = 20m Lanier Planes - Via my Sustainable Home Engineering (S.H.E.) our Highly self-sufficient solar demo home has 150 ingenious items, most of which I invented or adapted to enable us to thrive on 5% pension + Edible Jungle; yet all are solar 12-volt appliances including TV, fridge, bed warmer, blender from a small starter motor, LED lights, fans, tools + hose-reel pump + countless more - Plus we have the most perfect homemade 27-year dual solar TRiCAR transport far more efficient, & economical than Tesla monster. I have a flag on TRiCAR that depicts the Australian flag except that, instead of the alien British Union Jack in upper left corner, we have placed a map of Australia = a vastly nicer flag. Have been collecting from magazines etc developing a Database of 1,000s of brilliant exotic circuits for AeroSpace & Process Control etc over decades - Also somehow I have acquired 0ver 500 medical cure research files evidently to enable the world\u2019s worst diseases to be freely cured Naturally, yet doctors + authorities seem ignorant or more keen on making money than natural curing - Navajo Spinal Therapist - Non-medical method of pissing completely when usually impossible - 1965 homemade at sea Sail self-steering on 2 sail boats enabled me to remain in bed reading or radio listening or sleeping most total distance across the Pacific via Hawaii; Miracles that have saved me from 2 tsunamis & 2.5 hurricanes.

Yet now at age 86 I\u2019m cranking out a wealth of scientific articles & books, having achieved a BSc in Physics & Maths + PhD + Doctorate of Science. Evidently school then in early 1950s were merely guessing without statistical proof to judge!!! + my perfect inventive Wife of 70 + being so self-reliant + healthy & happy + more creative than ever with such huge pension.
