            "answer_text": "The working of  Telephone network is very vast, complicated and deeply technical. As far as I understand, by the context of the current times you may be asking about a Mobile Network, which I will roughly explain first and then proceed with a few lines on Wired Landline telephone networks. In simple terms, the start point of a Mobile call is your compatible handset. By call I mean a Voice call, or use of Internet (can be termed as Data Call) or SMS /MMS or other services. The mobile handset communicates to mobile towers on set Radio frequencies. The towers which you may see on top of buildings or standalone towers have special antennas to send and receive signals and voice and data traffic from the handsets.These towers and your cell keep communicating no matter where you go in the Service providers coverage area. And this happens very frequently in terms of paging. In a way the Mobile and the tower in whose area the  Mobile is keep hollering at each other, announcing each others location and presence on a radio channel. This concept is called paging. The towers have special systems called Base stations which capture and send this traffic via copper cables, microwave ( yes it is a method of transferring data, not only a medium for heating food ;-) ) or Optical Fibre cables to a Switching centre. The concept of switching is related to transferring the traffic (voice,  data and signals) to other nodes so a call can go from one place to the other. There are also some equipment which help in a person getting special service like voice mail, sms, MMS, and some which are responsible for the Billing of the call.There are numerous concepts and specifications involved in this. When you dial a number for the person you intend to call, this information is sent by the towers to these servers. One of the server called the Mobile Switching Centre analyses which area is the called number based on the country, area code, mobile operator phone number series.  There is a database which maintains information about which tower was a persons cell phone last communicating with, by virtue of paging which I discussed before. The Mobile Switching Centre or MSC  asks this information to the database about where is the mobile of the person you were calling last seen, and under which towers signal area does this fall.The MSC simply directs the call towards that particular tower, which knows where in its area the phone number you are calling actually is. It's sends a special request to the cell indicate somebody has called, which causes ringing. The landline telephone network has no towers as it is Wired network as opposed to the wireless nature of a Mobile  network.  The number dialled on a landline is routed via the telephone wire to the Electric cross connect system at  the local telephone exchange. This system has a direct mapping for the number dialled to the location of the called person.  It simply switches the call to subsequent cross connects till the destination is reached. ",

            "answer_text": "A telephone network is a telecommunication network used for telephone calls between two or more parties. There are a number of different types of telephone network: A landline network where the telephones must be directly wired into a single telephone exchange.This is known as the public switched telephone network or PSTN.A wireless network where the telephones are mobile and can move around anywhere within the coverage area.A private network where a closed group of telephones are connected primarily to each other and use a gateway to reach the outside world. This is usually used inside companies and call centers and is called a private branch exchange (PBX).Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN).Public telephone operators (PTOs) own and build networks of the first two types and provide services to the public under license from the national government.Virtual Network Operators (VNOs) lease capacity wholesale from the PTOs and sell on telephony service to the public directly.
