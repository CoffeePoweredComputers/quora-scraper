            "answer_text": "I have a deep understanding of these two brands. My first smartphone, Samsung Galaxy note3, was released in 2013, when I bought it for 5399 yuan (more650 dollars). It was quite expensive for me at that time.  That's it~. In the first few months of using it, it was excellent, but when I used it for half a year, it started to go wrong. System jam, crash, automatic restart, these may be solved by system brush. However, the charging is gradually slow, WiFi is interrupted and color difference appears on the screen, which is the problem of mobile phones. The problems that bothered me began to appear only half a year ago. For a top multinational company, I'm disappointed with Samsung. In July 2014, I finally couldn't stand this mobile phone. I sold it and bought a millet mobile phone. Millet 4 is just a passer-by to my original plan. But after I used it for a while, I found that I fell in love with it.  It costs only 1999 yuan, about a third of the price of the Samsung note 4. Its system was extremely excellent in many systems at that time, full of humanized UI design and functions, and it was difficult to encounter the Caton. I like its stainless steel frame. It has a sense of craftsmanship. But it also has a big flaw - it's easy to get hot. At least I chose to pay attention to Xiaomi, which was founded only four years ago. When I need to go to Russia, this mobile phone is very useful. It keeps many beautiful pictures of Russia in summer for me. In Russia in the autumn, when my iPad was too cold to use (automatically shut down), it still kept silent, maintaining my communication with the outside world.  Photos of the timeI found that I liked the brand. Just like finding a treasure, I bought a lot of useful products (smart bracelet, balance car, headset, mobile power supply, lamp...)  What kind of mobile phone do I use now? Xiaomi's latest 5g mobile phone. It's only about half the price of Samsung's 5g mobile phone. But it has similar experience. These are the photos I take with my mobile phone. I will also use it to write for office and pay with its screen fingerprint.     Some photos taken casuallySo when you ask me who is better between Samsung and Xiaomi, I will say: Samsung's top mobile phone is more than Xiaomi, but its price is too expensive, while other mobile phones, I recommend Xiaomi. Just because Xiaomi can give users twice the experience at the same price. ",

            "answer_text": "Since you brought this comparison up, let\u2019s closely take a look at these behemoths of the digital world. \u2022\tROUND 1 First up, XIAOMI! Let\u2019s begin with the name . You ask, \u201cWhat\u2019s in a name?\u201d Well, a lot! Xiaomi\u2019s name has quite an interesting backstory. The name basically means \u2018millet\u2019 in Chinese. But, that\u2019s not all. In 2011, the CEO said that the name did not have just the literal meaning but also some hidden meanings. The \u2018Xiao\u2019 part of the name refers to the Buddhist concept that \"a single grain of rice of a Buddhist is as great as a mountain\" emphasising that Xiaomi wanted to focus more on the simple, subtle and little things by improving them rather than outright striving for absolute perfection. Even the seemingly little \u2018Mi\u2019 part has a meaning which according to the CEO stands for Mobile Internet and even Mission Impossible to refer to the immense problems and obstacles faced by them in starting the company. On a lighter note, the CEO also finds the name to be cute (I don\u2019t, personally. Do you?). Phew, such immense stuff behind those little words written on our phones. Who knew, right? Next up, SAMSUNG! In comparison to Xiaomi, Samsung doesn\u2019t seem to have much up its sleeve in terms of the meaning behind their name (etymology, as you might call it). According to Samsung's founder, the meaning of the Korean Hanja word Samsung is \"tri-star\" or \"three stars\". The word \"three\" represents something \"big, numerous and powerful\". Yup, pretty standard fare when you compare to Xiaomi. So, the winner? Xiaomi, by a mile! \u2022\tROUND 2 Next up, a little bit of history. Nope, seriously, I\u2019m not going to bore you on this one. Just a little bit of backstory to know what we\u2019re dealing here with. Let\u2019s start off with Samsung in this round. Samsung was founded by Lee Byung-chull in 1938 (Yup, even my grandmother must have been a little kid back then). Hilariously, now known so widely for their electronic products, Samsung actually started out a small trading company dealing in dried-fish, locally-grown groceries and noodles (Yeah, you read that right). With the passage of time, Samsung grew immensely and exponentially. It might be surprising to know, but Samsung is actually a respected name in shipbuilding, engineering, construction and whatnot. Samsung was actually a part of the construction companies at work for building the Burj Khalifa, the Petronas Towers and also the Taipei 101. Phew! In 2015, Samsung has been granted more U.S. patents than any other company - including IBM, Google, Sony, Microsoft and Apple. The company received 7,679 utility patents through 11 December. As of April 2011, the Samsung Group comprised 59 unlisted companies and 19 listed companies, all of which had their primary listing on the Korea Exchange. If I were to go anymore into details, you would get bored. So\u2026.. Xiaomi\u2019s turn! Compared to the age of Samsung, this little bunny (Xiaomi\u2019s mascot is a white bunny wearing a traditional Chinese hat) is just an infant. It was founded by eight partners on 6 April, 2010. But, in just a span of 7 years, it has gained quite a following and recognition in the digital world. Over the years, Xiaomi has developed quite a handful of mobile phones and has even expanded to many other products like TVs, Fitness Bands, Air Purifiers, Laptops etc. Heck, they even make portable water cups, key chains, plush dolls, luggage and personal transportation vehicles. No doubt, this isn\u2019t a fair round considering how old and big Samsung is, compared to Xiaomi. But the little millet, Xiaomi also gave a tough fight to the big guy. But, for now atleast, Samsung wins this round hands down. Finally, the round you\u2019ve been waiting for! \u2022\tROUND 3 Let\u2019s come to the main topic of discussion, their phones! Samsung has had quite a history with phones and that clearly shows with it being the largest smartphone maker in the world. Samsung phones (smartphones especially) had always been made of plastic, which though were of premium quality, could not really hold their ground against metal bodied smartphones (Yeah, I\u2019m pointing at Apple smartphones). But all this changed with the advent of the Galaxy S6 and S6 Edge. That marked their beginning with metal smartphones. While I personally like Samsung designs, yet their lower end smartphones and even some mid range ones look very curvaceous to me. I prefer lines over curves in terms of phone designs. However, the lower end Samsungs are still mainly plastic. But their metal smartphones surely have a charm about them. Go take a look at the 2017 A5 and A7 smartphones and you\u2019ll know what I\u2019m saying. And if you got them bucks, go for the S8 Edge without hesitation as it is beyond stunning. However, if you are searching for something low to mid range, be sure about the specs of the phones before buying since they\u2019re priced pretty close. You could get a better phone by just shelling a 1000 bucks or two more. I suggest On Max and J7 Pro as some of the better Samsungs under 20k. Why 20K? Since Samsungs start getting better from that price bracket onwards as opposed to the ones you get under 10K or even 15K. Samsung\u2019s Touchwiz UI is pretty beautiful and most people will be happy to live with it. However, the UI does tend to get laggy after you fill the storage of the phone to the brim or get too enthusiastic by playing titles like GTA V at the highest graphic settings. Of course, I\u2019m talking about the budget Samsungs. I\u2019ve never owned a flagship Samsung, so I can\u2019t comment about them. But going by the reviews, it seems Samsung phones are now much better optimised with their UI and hence ensure a far smoother UI experience than before. So, if you\u2019re buying a mid-range Samsung, don\u2019t worry, it will be lag free for almost everything you use it for. Now comes Xiaomi, the world\u2019s fifth largest smartphone maker. Xiaomi\u2019s humble beginnings like its 1st smartphone, Mi 1 have now come a long way. It now makes some of the most bang-for-the- buck smartphones in the market. Most of the current Xiaomis are metal bodied. Even it\u2019s 2nd lowest priced offering in India, the Redmi 4, comes with a metal body (albeit with some hints of plastic at the back towards the top and bottom). Its phones are pretty good to hold in hand too and provide an \u2018affordable premium\u2019 experience. While Xiaomi has certainly taken the budget smartphone market by storm (currently being dominated by its Redmi 4 and Redmi Note 4 range), it also has some quite capable flagships like the MI6. The Xiaomi phones come with MIUI (with the exception of the Mi A1), Xiaomi\u2019s own UI that has an essence of the Apple ios. The UI is pretty good, simple and lag-free for most of the time(as per my experience) but won\u2019t give you any thrills. The UI is highly customizable though. Xiaomis are the sort of phones that give you the most out of your money - a good to hold phone and lag free interface, all without breaking the bank. And of course, every Xiaomi comes with an IR Blaster. And don\u2019t forget about the breathtaking Mi Mix smartphones. Who wins this round? You choose! Phones are something about personal choice. I currently own a Xiaomi and have used Samsung devices in the past. Both Xiaomi and Samsung phones have their own fair share of pros and cons. I\u2019m not here to give any reviews on phones. There are tons of videos for that on the internet. I tried giving you here just the mere introduction of the way these two companies and most importantly their phones, vary from each other and let you decide which one of them is the better one of the lot. (NOTE: Phone models mentioned in this answer were in context with the Indian market) This was my first answer. Thanks a lot for reading!
