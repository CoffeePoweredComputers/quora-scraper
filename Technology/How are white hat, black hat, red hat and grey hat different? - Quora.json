            "answer_text": "First of all There is no such thing like Red hat Hacker There are following categories of Hackers:- White hat hackerBlack hat hackerGrey hat hackerScript kiddieSuicide hackerHacktivistThere may be some other categories but the main ones are listed above. But there is nothing like Red Hat Hacker. I think you are confused in RedHat Linux and other categories of Hackers. RedHat is an organization which has created a Linux OS, known as RedHat. Black Hats Black-hat hackers, or simply \u201cblack hats,\u201d are the type of hacker the popular media seems to focus on. Black-hat hackers violate computer security for personal gain (such as stealing credit card numbers or harvesting personal data for sale to identity thieves) or for pure maliciousness (such as creating a botnet and using that botnet to perform DDOS attacks against websites they don\u2019t like.) Black hats fit the widely-held stereotype that hackers are criminals performing illegal activities for personal gain and attacking others. They\u2019re the computer criminals. White Hats White-hat hackers are the opposite of the black-hat hackers. They\u2019re the \u201cethical hackers,\u201d experts in compromising computer security systems who use their abilities for good, ethical, and legal purposes rather than bad, unethical, and criminal purposes. For example, many white-hat hackers are employed to test an organizations\u2019 computer security systems. The organization authorizes the white-hat hacker to attempt to compromise their systems. The white-hat hacker uses their knowledge of computer security systems to compromise the organization\u2019s systems, just as a black hat hacker would. However, instead of using their access to steal from the organization or vandalize its systems, the white-hat hacker reports back to the organization and informs them of how they gained access, allowing the organization to improve their defenses. This is known as \u201cpenetration testing,\u201d and it\u2019s one example of an activity performed by white-hat hackers. A white-hat hacker who finds a security vulnerability would disclose it to the developer, allowing them to patch their product and improve its security before it\u2019s compromised. Various organizations pay \u201cbounties\u201d or award prizes for revealing such discovered vulnerabilities, compensating white-hats for their work. Grey Hats Very few things in life are clear black-and-white categories. In reality, there\u2019s often a gray area. A gray-hat hacker falls somewhere between a black hat and a white hat. A gray hat doesn\u2019t work for their own personal gain or to cause carnage, but they may technically commit crimes and do arguably unethical things. For example, a black hat hacker would compromise a computer system without permission, stealing the data inside for their own personal gain or vandalizing the system. A white-hat hacker would ask for permission before testing the system\u2019s security and alert the organization after compromising it. A gray-hat hacker might attempt to compromise a computer system without permission, informing the organization after the fact and allowing them to fix the problem. While the gray-hat hacker didn\u2019t use their access for bad purposes, they compromised a security system without permission, which is illegal. If a gray-hat hacker discovers a security flaw in a piece of software or on a website, they may disclose the flaw publically instead of privately disclosing the flaw to the organization and giving them time to fix it. They wouldn\u2019t take advantage of the flaw for their own personal gain \u2014 that would be black-hat behavior \u2014 but the public disclosure could cause carnage as black-hat hackers tried to take advantage of the flaw before it was fixed.

            "answer_text": "There is a difference between Black, White and Grey Hat Hackers. However, there is no such thing as a Red Hat Hacker. There are also people called Hactivists. Black Hat Hacker - A black hat hacker is a bad guy who hacks into systems for his own personal gains and sometimes even to watch the world burn. These are the types of hackers that we should be scared of. White Hat Hacker- A white hat hacker is a good guy who hacks into machines and companies and tell the owner how they can secure their systems. They are also paid as an Ethical Hacker. Grey Hat Hacker- A grey hat hacker is a hacker that is both good and bad. He or she cant be predicted. They might use their skills for good and they might use them for bad. Hactivists- These hackers usually hack for a cause or to spread awareness. Like hacking into the most visited websites to spread awareness about human rights etc etc. I hope this has answered your question. Follow me on instagram \u2014 hack_snack \u263a\u263a ",
