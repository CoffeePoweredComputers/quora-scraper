If you have WiFi and/ or ethernet on the TV and you can get online content, it is a \u2018Smart\u2019 TV. If you, you can buy a set top box, such as an Apple TV. These plug in using an HDMI cable and add services like YouTube, Amazon Prime and BBC iPlayer using either WiFi or ethernet. ",

A \u201csmart TV\u201d will have an ethernet or WiFi connection, and will be able to play YouTube videos and USB sticks. A newer one can probably stream many different video services, use a Bluetooth keyboard, and browse the Web directly. ",
