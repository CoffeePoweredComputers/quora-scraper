            "answer_text": "FACTORY WORKER Manufacturing jobs may soon become a thing of the past. Machines have been poaching factory worker's jobs for decades, but majority or all-robot factories have only recently become a reality.Earlier this year Apple and Samsung supplier Foxconn replaced 60,000 employees with robots, and China's Everwin Precision Technology is in the process of replacing 90% of its factory workforce with automatons. SURGEON Surgical robots are already taking over the operating theater. Da Vinci launched its range of operating robots way back in 2000 -- they have since performed two million procedures. Ultra-precise, robo-surgeons are currently used for everything from knee replacement surgery to vision correction.Futurologists predict robots will almost certainly operate on patients independently and replace human surgeons one day. PHARMACIST Pill counting devices have been used by pharmacists for years, but thanks to the latest robotic prescription dispensing systems, hospitals can now use automatons to dispense prescriptions. The machines are noted for their accuracy. Thousands of people die each year as a result of human pharmacist errors, so it could only be a matter of time before these devices become ubiquitous.FINANCIAL ANALYSTS Human financial analysts can no longer compete with artificially intelligent financial analysis software that can read and recognize trends in historic data to predict future market moves. It\u2019s no wonder that financial analyst jobs could be the worst hit in the estimated 30% of banking sector jobs lost to AI in the next five to 10 years.INSURANCE UNDERWRITERS AND CLAIMS REPRESENTATIVES The effects of automation on the insurance industry are already being felt. In Japan, Fukoku Mutual Life Insurance has recently replaced 30 of its medical insurance claims reps with an AI system based on IBM\u2019s Watson. Watson ExplorerJOURNALISTS In 2014, the Associated Press began to use intelligent software to write quarterly earnings reports. Up to 3,000 reports are being written by AI every quarter, the Verge reported. It\u2019s entirely feasible that content sites of the future could exist without any human writers at all.",
