            "answer_text": "Yes, you can clean a Blu-ray disc with ease. In order to keep your Blu-ray discs in good working order, you are going to need to pay more attention to the way you handle them. But it\u2019s inevitable to have scratches, dust or grease on your Blu-ray discs. So it\u2019s important to learn how to clean a Blu-ray disc properly. Also, you should know how to properly handle your Blu-ray/DVD disc to try to avoid dust, smudges or even scratches. The cleaning materials are not that hard to find. Most of the time, several pieces of clean, soft, anti-static microfiber cloths would be sufficient. Avoid wiping it in a circular motion as you would leave scratches that cannot be repaired on the disc when rubbing the disc this way. You can try either a disc scratch repair cream or a scratch remover machine to help you repair your scratched discs. So when you have a damaged Blu-ray disc with scratches and the playback is filled with skips and pauses, try fixing the scratches on the disc first before you decide to toss it away. ",
