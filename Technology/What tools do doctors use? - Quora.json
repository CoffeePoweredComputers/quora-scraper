            "answer_text": "The question is vague but doctors use computers to record information about patients and to retrieve information about past visits and to look up information about medications and illness. During the examination of a patient, Stethoscopes, Blood pressure cuffs, otoscopes, ophthalmoscopes, reflex hammers, and vaginal speculums are used frequently. During treatment of patients, doctors use gloves, gauze and bandages, needles and syringes. Other equipment can be used such as ECG machines, ultrasound, and Xray devices. This is just some of the common tools doctors may use. ",
