            "answer_text": "Kinda. It\u2019s something you really have to look into before deciding to make the switch between VoIP providers. In theory, as long as you have the appropriate firmware load on the phone that\u2019s supported by the VoIP provider, there should be no issues using / bring your own IP phone. But also consider what the providers terms of service are. Let\u2019s say you got VoIP phones from 10 years ago and can\u2019t accept new firmware upgrades or not supported on the providers network, then you\u2019re out of luck. Many of the cloud services use phones from vendors like Poly, Yealink and Cisco which can be used between providers which is good for interchangeability. Bottom line is to do your research. Have the conversation with a potential provider before assuming phones can be moved over. You\u2019ll save yourself time and a headache by learning this upfront instead of the hard way. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes they, but assuming your login details have not been locked. The majority of IP phones seem to be extremely complicated to set up, but with the correct login details for whichever supplier you wish to use, you should be able to use any IP Phone. Most IP Phones will have a version of their user manual online, this should also tell you the IP address of the handset. The easiest way to find out if your handset is locked or not, is to try this first. If the factory login details do not work, then your previously supplier has a lock on the handset. If you do log in, just as your new supplier for their setup details. If you need help, head over to VoiceRules - Global Phone System as they have options for setting up remote handsets and phone systems ",

            "answer_text": "Yes and No H323 sets are generally proprietary, SIP set set are generally not however this not a hard and fast rule. A H323 set from Avaya Mitel or Cisco generally only on their PBX\u2019s SIP set like Polycom and newer SIP set from Avaya Mitel and Cisco will work just find on any SIP based platform. The feature integration is easier if you are using the same PBX. I think that the major PBX suppliers seam to go out of their was to make SIP phone integration difficult but they do work. ",

When they are simply sold to be used with the service I think it is rare for them to be locked and they are mostly compatible with each other. ",
