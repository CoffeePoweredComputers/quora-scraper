            "answer_text": "All human professions are doomed, without any exclusion, be it black, blue or white collars. Modern humanity is professionalized, overspecialized to the smallest fragmentation of works, physical or intellectual. It is too specialized to be smoothly replaced by automation, robotics, software algorithms, and smart systems, from self-driving transportation to smart plants and farms. Division of labour, physical or mental, is the separation of a work process into a number of tasks, with each task performed by a separate person or group of persons. It is applied to scientific research & development, systems of mass production, the assembly line and is one of the basic organizing principles of human production. Adam Smith saw this splitting of tasks as a key to economic progress by providing a cheaper and more efficient means of producing goods. The division of labour allows all human professions to become extinct due to artificial intelligence, however narrow or weak it could be. Even Artificial Narrow Intelligence has achieved extraordinary feats. In just the last decade, we\u2019ve witnessed the rise of specialized AI that holds conversations,speaks any of 100 languages,beats anyone at Jeopardy!, Chess, Go, Poker, and in any Atari video game.recognizes objects and faces better than us,spots cancer better than most doctors.Besides, ANI has been used to invent technology, discover laws of physics, even identify new drugs. Today\u2019s AI can compose as well as Bach, and paint as well as van Gogh. It has developed its own highly original artistic styles. It can drive, fly, and even move better than most humans. Given the current state and trajectory of AI, for how much longer can humans remain the most intelligent creature on Earth? What chance do we have in the coming age where AI eclipses humanity in all areas? When will AI take over? - AlwaysAsking.com Now imagine a general AI possessing all the functions as above combining abilities as: Communicate via natural languageLearn, adapt, and growMove through a dynamic environmentRecognize sights and soundsBe creative in music, art, writing and inventionReason with logic and rationality to solve problems...",

The fact that there are something like several thousand individual cultures on earth, and more than several hundred (known) languages means that diversity will be with us for the foreseeable future.Humans are naturally needy. Children born of astonishingly wealthy parents who shower them with endless gifts and money to enable them to buy anything they aren\u2019t supplied with directly still are consumed by ravening, never-ending needs. Nothing short of death will ever eliminate that.",
