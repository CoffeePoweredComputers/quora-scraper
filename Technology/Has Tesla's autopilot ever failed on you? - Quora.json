            "answer_text": "No. I\u2019ve been in situations that it wasn\u2019t designed to handle, and in those situations, it reacted exactly as it was designed to react. I reacted exactly the way I was supposed to react and tightened my grip on the steering wheel if needed and took over. Especially in the early days of autopilot, there were times when I honestly didn\u2019t know if the car would stop by itself. So I used the brake pedal. The car might have stopped fine had I not done that. But what would have been the point? It does mean that I have no way of knowing what would have happened. It might have been that the car would have stopped fine. It might have meant that it would have stopped, but it would have been less smooth than I would have expected. But it was never a big deal for me to reenable it if I had to override it. So I had no reason to care what the car might have done. These days, it\u2019s far less likely that I\u2019d ever have to take over. There are times when I take over anyway, primarily because the car is too overcautious. The biggest problem I have is that if the car starts to make a safe and legal lane change, often the car in the lane I\u2019m moving into will keep getting closer to my car even though it\u2019s not supposed to. Then the Tesla will abort the lane change. It won\u2019t assume that the driver behind me is just an obnoxious moron who plans to tailgate me and then possibly back off. It will assume that the person is oblivious to the fact that a car that is moving at the speed of traffic is moving into the lane a few car lengths in front, and that that vehicle speeding up would result in an accident even if nobody changed lanes. So it\u2019s not a matter of Autopilot being unable to handle what\u2019s on the road. It\u2019s a matter of other drivers being bad drivers and ignoring the rules of the road. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, of course, it's in beta and Tesla has made it clear that it had its limits. However, I use it as Tesla directs and have always been safe. Tesla makes it clear that Autopilot is not usable in all situations and require you to remain alert at all times, ready to take over. That's really easy to do, actually. Driving properly with Autopilot requires leaving your hands on the steering wheel, your eyes in the road and your brain switched on, ready to catch those situations which it can't handle. Even doing all that, Autopilot makes driving a great deal easier and much less tiring, along with being safer than driving yourself. I've caught Autopilot on curves it couldn't handle, I've caught it when traffic didn't do things it expected, I've caught it when it couldn't read signs just as I've caught it when I was at traffic lights. I caught it because I used Autopilot as Tesla directed its drivers to do. However, it's helped me avoid accidents where people stopped ahead of me, it's helped me driving long distances without becoming too tired just as it's helped me pay attention to traffic changes while it took care of the basics of driving down the road. You use Autopilot properly and you're safer, less tired and able to drive in a completely new way. If you're an idiot and you don't follow the rules, you're a danger, but that's just the same as driving a manual car. ",
