            "answer_text": "Think of it this way. In the car, are you safer in the drivers seat, or the passenger seat, or the back seat? It all depends on how you take a hit. You just don\u2019t know, so you have to protect yourself as best you can. That\u2019s why modern cars have airbags all around. So, to properly protect your computer, it needs to be in a protective sleeve to maximize survivability against any hit. The screen is the most vulnerable,so there needs to be a solid piece on top of it. I would then put that side facing inward, since any hit from that direction would probably be less forceful that a hit from the other direction. Best would be a hard case, but that may take up a lot of space. If you have an inside pocket, that may also provide cushioning from an outside hit. Did you think about if the bag take a dunking in water? Bottom line. You never know. ",
