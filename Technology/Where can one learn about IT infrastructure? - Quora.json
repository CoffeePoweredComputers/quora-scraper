            "answer_text": "In my opinion, IT infrastructure on a technical level falls into three categories:1) Software2) Network architecture including response and downtimes3) Boxes (CPU, servers, et c) #1 - The software that will reside on your network will dictate the kind of network and kind of boxes that you will need to administer. If your architecture is mainly transaction processing (like a financial institution) then many small transactions of up to 1 million per minute will need to be accommodated. On the other hand, a video streaming application, requires one giant pipe from a server to an end user box with lost bits/packes affecting end user satisfaction.  In addition, the software impacts the network bandwidth needed. Does the demand occur evenly over 24 hours or spikes at particular times. #2 - The network that you have in place may need little or a lot of rework. Many times, the network infrastructure may be in place and cannot be upgraded without significant investment or downtime, Either circumstance may not be possible.  In that case, the network administration must be tweaked to enhance uptime, throughput and security.    #3 - Boxes are enablers. Without good boxes, the rest of the network is throttled but #1, and  #2 are of more important. As a server administrator, this will be your forte, but the symphony of getting all three to work together is what makes IT infrastructure so critical a component of knowledge. Some of the best courses that I can recommend are offered by Oracle and Network Appliance (I'm biased of course).  Both of these companies sell products and services that are grid-based and involve all of the three components that I have mentioned. ",

            "answer_text": "Thanks for the A2A. The answers here are pretty impressive. My 2\u00a2 are- IT Infrastructure is there all around you. You just don't see it because it's not an app but it is what allowed you to run that app. There are various sources to start learning. Based on the direction you want to take- hardware, cloud, network or security or a combination of the above. Based on that decision, you can start by looking at YouTube, online courses on networking, compTia, exin, AWS etc. I find a lot of information on tech republic, Wikipedia, and generally online. It's an amazing field and there are a plenty of options in this space. Good luck. ",
