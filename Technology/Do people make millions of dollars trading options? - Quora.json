Now you may ask me - All by Buying backed options? . No my dear friend . If anyone says that then he is lying. You can not mint millions by just buying nacked options. In option trading, only option writing makes you money. Although theoritically option writers have risk unlimited , in real , at the end of the day option writers are real winners. One step ahead , if you stratify your option trading and adjust the trades with different strategies as per the dynamics of market, it's a left hand game in option market. However due to huge margin required for option writing and making many legs of strategies people prefer buying naked options at cheaper prices and end up losing. If you trade systematic and time your trades, mange your money, understand the dynamics of Market, not being greedy, avoid trading on expiry and result days, then take my words you will never lose money. To do this you need to be patient , emotionless. Good luck You can follow me in tele gram . Search for https://t.me/stockoptionfuture channel . ",

Your profits only become substantial when you are trading bigger lots (dozens/hundreds/up) on a very well-vetted, disciplined strategy. Though you can nickel-and-dime your way to substantial losses with single-contract trades. The Really Big Wins you hear about are when an institutional investor places a huge bet on a black swan event \u2014 that is, a one-in-a-million occurrence \u2014 and guesses right. For the rest of us, that\u2019s the express lane to poverty. ",
