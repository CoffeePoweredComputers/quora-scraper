            "answer_text": "You\u2019re doing it wrong For starters: \u201cI eat around 1000\u20131200 calories a day\u201d\u2026\u201dI am eating healthy\u201d You\u2019re either lying about the first statement or deceiving yourself in the second statement. Eating 1000\u20131200 calories a day is not healthy, even for your size, especially if you are doing intense exercise.  Now, with regards to your question\u2026you don\u2019t really lose weight exercising. I mean, once I went running for an hour when the \u201creal-feel\u201d temperature was 104. I weighed myself before and after and I\u2019d lost about 15 pounds of sweat. All that weight came back after I rehydrated. You lose weight with your eating, by eating at a deficit. Too much exercise and an extreme deficit like you\u2019re using will lead to weight gain long term. You\u2019ll crash your weight, start eating more and gain your weight back, and more, quickly. The elliptical doesn\u2019t cause you to immediately lose weight outside of water weight from sweating. It can help with your caloric deficit as well as build up muscles in your legs and core. To directly answer the question: There is no way of knowing exactly how much weight you\u2019ll lose from water weight, it depends on how long you do it and how hard you go, even then, it\u2019s only water weight.
