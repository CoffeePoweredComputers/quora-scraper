            "answer_text": "Once an idea is proposed, the general trend says that its needs atleast a decade time for its raw implementation. Nanotechnology from being just a research field has finally found its place in commercial world whether its medicine, cosmetics, health,military or energy applications. Following are some recent growths and a step ahead for nano ideas implementation;  Invisibility Cloaks- yes, the one similar to harry potter\u2019s cloak\u2026 In 2007, researchers from Purdue university designed this proposed cloak using metamaterials. This was made possible using some special metamaterials with nano-needle morphology which could deflect light coming towards an object in a similar way light gets deflected by water and bends around just beneath the surface. However, it had some serious design issues limitations in terms of wavelengths and fabrication of such metamaterials. In 2016, a team of US researchers have found nanotransfer printing technique which allows mass production of these materials which means that from now, we would be soon witnessing real invisible cloack. Hydrophobicity in action- Hydrophobicity is actually the water repelling property possessed by lotus leaves which does not allow water droplets to sit on the surface. Many nanomaterials have also developed to mimic this character. This coating has been already been explored in anti-rust , self-cleaning applications. In the recent year, patent has been claimed for use of hydrophobic material in water harvesting system. Scientists have developed an apparatus for passively collecting water in an environment where dew forms are disclosed. The method includes supporting a hydrophobic radial surface at a slope of about 10 to 80 degrees from the direction of gravity and waiting for dew or condensation to form on the hydrophobic surface and run down the hydrophobic surface to either a reservoir or a beneficiary of the passively collected water, such as the roots of a plant.Molecular machine : Molecular machine is just an expression used for self-assembled/synthesized molecules which simply mimic the operations performed at macroscopic level. Past year has been a tremendous in terms of molecular machine growth. The 2016 chemistry Nobel prize winner Fraser Stoddart, used atoms and molecules as fundamental parts to create molecular structures that imitated the movement of a muscle and even that of an elevator. Through the use of a chemical switch, each could be made to change state and perform a mechanical action which would be reversible in nature. ",

Scientists are trying to use this nano level tech in material science and medical science mainly.  Nanotechnology in Material science :- Nanomaterials are enabling us to make things smaller and lighter. Some examples are. Transistors, the basic switches that enable all modern computing, have gotten smaller and smaller through nanotechnology. At the turn of the century, a typical transistor was 130 to 250 nanometers in size. In 2014, Intel created a 14 nanometer transistor, then IBM created the first seven nanometer transistor in 2015, and then Lawrence Berkeley National Lab demonstrated a one nanometer transistor in 2016! Smaller, faster, and better transistors may mean that soon your computer\u2019s entire memory may be stored on a single tiny chip.Using magnetic random access memory (MRAM), computers will be able to \u201cboot\u201d almost instantly. MRAM is enabled by nanometer\u2010scale magnetic tunnel junctions and can quickly and effectively save data during a system shutdown or enable resume play features.Ultra-high definition displays and televisions are now being sold that use quantum dots to produce more vibrant colors while being more energy efficient.Nanotechnology in medical science:- One of the most important applications of nanotechnology is in the treatment of neuro degenerative disorders.Research work is going on in the use of nanotechnology to find the cure for cancer.Carbon nano tubesRegeneration of tissues and so many more uses.Here is a link of an article on latest progress in Nanotechnology :- Nanotechnology at Pittcon 2018 ",

The atomic force microscopy is suitable for such a task. Data storage with a density of 400\u2013500 Gb/in sq. can be achieved, about 10 times more dense than conventional magnetic data storage devices. The small size will allow for use in watches, cellular telephone, laptops, computer, whilst it's high density data storage capabilities will lead to terabyte data storage systems on just 2.5 in.
