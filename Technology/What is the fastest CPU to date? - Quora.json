            "answer_text": "Fast at doing what? A 1 Mhz 68000 took 144 clocks to do a divide.Today the same integer divide can be done in a much smaller number of clocks at giga hertz speed. Knowing what is critical to this question! An analogous example is shoveling a field of snow. One man with one 10\u2033 wide shovel vs a football team offense and defense with 24\u2033 shovels working across a field in parallel can shovel a lot more snow per unit time. i.e. faster. Shoveling snow is a nice example because a man can only toss it so far to the left or right. The junior varsity team might have to back up the varsity and or the organization of the team members be located to keep snow moving all the way off the field with a minimum number of transfers. Parallel works wonders but done wrong is just tosses snow on the next guy.  Moving snow out of the stadium is the job of the I/O subsystem with truck loads analogous to a block device and may be the limiting component of the system. Time to insert Meltdown and Spectre thoughts here. ",

            "answer_text": "This would depend on what workload you\u2019re looking at, and what market you\u2019re looking at - whether you\u2019re only looking at general consumer desktop and workstation CPUs, server-grade CPUs, or niche parts found in supercomputers. The CPU which is fastest in gaming or single-thread workloads (currently the Intel Core i7\u20139700K, Intel Core i9\u20139900K, AMD Ryzen 7 3800X, or AMD Ryzen 9 3900X, depending on cooling and workload specifics) can\u2019t compete with many-core server CPUs such as the Xeon Platinum or EPYC Rome in multi-core workloads, but are much better at the single-core to quad-core optimised workloads that are typical on mainstream desktop computers. Intel and AMD, as well as other manufacturers such as IBM produce specialist CPUs for supercomputers which are even more powerful (in multicore performance) than those used in \u201chyperscale\u201d servers. For a compromise of single-core and multi-core performance (optimised for workstations, rendering and video editing, and small-scale servers), Intel\u2019s X-series and AMD\u2019s Threadripper series are the best options.
