            "answer_text": "Regular people. Anyone, really. There isn't a type of person that would own a Switch, but I could come up with some that may be more likely to. Nostalgic people. Nintendo games have been around for decades. Fans of the games any point in their legacy are likely to pick up the Switch to check out the newest installment of their favorite series. Parents. While most parents aren't against purchasing an Xbox or Playstation, the two consoles have a much smaller amount of \u201cchild friendly\u201d games, especially on the mainstream market. The Switch doesn't have all child friendly games, but those that aren't are usually third party developers. The Switch markets games that are more likely to be safe and enjoyable for children. Some parents aren't okay with their child playing violent video games, especially with realistic blood, along with any other games with mature themes. Whether you find it silly or not, it's undeniable that it would be much more likely, especially if the parents have younger children (those under 10). I can't really think of anything else. Most of the time, it doesnt matter what background or personality a person has. Either they have a Switch or they don't. ",

            "answer_text": "well, not sure \u201cwhat kind\" of people own Nintendo Switch's, I guess avoiding some of the more sarcastic retorts\u2026 Fans of Nintendo exclusive games such as Pokemon, Mario, Zelda, Metroid (Prime 4 promised), ect. Lovers of portable gaming, but who also like the base console option Lovers of games exclusive to other countries, the Switch and its games is not \u201cRegion Locked\" and you can buy, import and play games from ANYWHERE in the world without \u201cmodding\u201d your system Lovers of a huge variety of games, besides the huge variety of combined 1st & 3rd party games that has always surpassed other systems, the increased power scale of the Switch has invited more companies to port games that were once exclusive to Sony and/or Microsoft systems Lovers of Indie games, Nintendo made making and selling Indie games so very easy and much cheaper than Sony or Microsoft, it invited a huge number of game makers and even gamers themselves to provide a huge library Next month, the Switch Lite will be brought to the table, for only $200, a very inviting incentive to those who want the power, portability and expanded games library but don't need tv output and who want something easier on the pocketbook I'm still confused by the wording \u201cWhat kind of people?\u201d, these statements i made are obvious even to people who are not fans of Nintendo products, so I am curious if you are searching for some different type of information or if this question is just \u201cclick bait\u201d ?!?!
