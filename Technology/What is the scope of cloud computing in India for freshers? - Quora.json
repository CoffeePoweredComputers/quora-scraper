            "answer_text": "Cloud Computing this technology is welcomed by many organisation in India and they even hire people for the role of Cloud Support Engineer, Cloud computing Engineer, Cloud Solution Engineer, Cloud Administrator/ Architect, etc. But what I personally came to experience that few organisation doesn't allow freshers for Cloud related jobs they expect experienced candidates. And the reason for the same can be the teaching pattern, we are not taught what is required in the present world and thus the recruiters moves towards experience holder because they don\u2019t want to spend much time and money in the training of candidates itself, where they can easily get their work done by experienced candidates. But, Everyone was a fresher first, even the core industry now, where once just a startup. A fresher understands the pain of a fresher. The world is changing and thus, there are few organisation which are ready to test the freshers capability now-a-days so, don\u2019t loose hope. Learn the concepts with practical knowledge, have some programming as well as scripting knowledge (powershell, python) and have your basics clear. Do such courses from institutions which fulfils the industry demands (Certifications will be an add-on). Cloud Computing is a fast growing technology and will hopefully bring opportunities for freshers. Best of Luck. ",
