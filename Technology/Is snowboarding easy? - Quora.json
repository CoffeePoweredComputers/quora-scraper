            "answer_text": "There was a Quote, Skiing is easier to pick up but harder to master, whereas snowboarding is harder to pick up, but easier to master. Now I won\u2019t dive into irrelevant topics and I\u2019ll get straight into answering your question. Snowboarding is not essentially easy to pick up as it\u2019s not something your body is used to at all, you\u2019re basically binded onto a board and are applying techniques to move around. There are many aspects you will have to get comfortable with when starting such as knowing how to do transitions, apply basics to the actual decent and keeping a good level of balance and finding your comfort zone. As your progress you\u2019re basically just taking everything you know and sharpening your skills, occasionally learning a new cool trick or maneuver every now and then but the majority of experienced learning is just taking what you already know, and using it for different purposes. So as to keep it choppy, the answer summarized: Yes it\u2019s a fairly challenging sport but it\u2019s incredibly rewarding and given enough time, can become Easy. ",

            "answer_text": "The learning curve on snowboarding is steeper than skis, in other words, a few times out and you will probably be able to ride most intermediate hills. But, those first couple of days are painful! I had skied for years, when on a whim, decided to switch to boarding in my late 30\u2019s. I took a lesson, bought a used snowboard and never looked back. I never looked back because it hurt to much to turn my head! ;) Seriously though, after three or four times out I was able to board at least to the point that I could handle black and double-black hills. I still suck at it, but it is great fun. ",
