            "answer_text": "I\u2019ve been in the customer service industry for a little over 8 years now. I try to provide excellent customer service at every moment of my work day. One of my favorite moments when I provided excellent customer service was when I worked at a massage & spa shop as a receptionist. Being a receptionist at a spa is not easy, and it\u2019s even easier to get frustrated. I\u2019ve always been able to stay calm and handle difficult or upset customers extremely well. I learned how to match the pace of a client to be able to show them I am on their level, and I\u2019m here to help. A skill I learned at a door-to-door marketing company. One day, I answered the phone to a guy who wanted to use up his massage credits and cancel his membership after, but he had a very complicated schedule with limited time. I proceeded to ask him about his massage preferences and what times he was available. I made sure to try and find him a therapist that matched his requests. One thing I learned about being on the phone with clients is to have constant communication, even if that means some small talk while waiting for the computer to hurry up and do its thing. After about 5 minutes of scheduling and figuring everything out, he stops to say, \u201cYou have been so helpful today, Let me tell you, I just went through hell with <Name of Well Known Home Improvement Company> trying to get my washer and dryer. I had such a hard time figuring out delivery from the store to my house. They caused me such a headache, so much stress, and their customer service was just awful. I want to thank you for giving me such great service and taking the time to help me today. I want you to know I really appreciate it. You\u2019ve made this process so easy.\u201d That man later left me a raving review, and even called my manager to tell them how happy he was. That moment made me realize how important it was to provide great customer service. It felt like such a small situation, yet made me feel so happy that I helped someone. It\u2019s so important to understand your client and treat them like they really are the most important thing, and that nothing else matters at the moment than they do. I now work at a custom fragrance boutique called Scented Studio in Colorado. I\u2019ve been there for two years, and I\u2019m so happy to say that I have many reviews during my time here that mention our customer service. In fact, almost every single review mentions the great service we provide. We create fragrances for people which becomes incredibly personal, and in reality is very intimate. You end up getting to know a person when you\u2019re asking them about what they like to smell like, so it\u2019s important to know how to match your client so that you know what questions to ask. As we have to take a couple of minutes to blend and adjust oils, we also have to keep a fun conversation going so that they feel comfortable and welcome. When it comes to scent, clients tend to feel hesitant, and scared to make a fragrance that doesn\u2019t work, but that\u2019s why we have to be able to step in and keep them positive that what they choose will be something they love no matter what. And it is, every time. Even if it takes us hours to find the right formula, we make sure the customer always leaves excited about their new creation. We even like to say, \u201cYou\u2019re not allowed to leave until you love it.\u201d As we also book parties at our store, I have to have excellent phone etiquette to make sure the customer understand every bit of information we give them. I remember being trained at the spa to smile as I\u2019m talking to the customer on the phone. I pretty much had to make it feel like I was talking to the customer in person. Now, I get laughs, positive responses, questions, and party bookings! Customer Service, in all aspects, is incredibly important. You never know who your client is, and what they could mean to your business. That\u2019s why everyone should be treated equally. That\u2019s how you put the customer first, instead of the customer being the one who is, \u201calways right\u201d. ",

            "answer_text": "About an hour ago, I was trying to figure out why my television wouldn\u2019t recognize the satellite. It\u2019s a new tv, and our old one did just fine, until he finally died, two days ago. He was 23 years old. His name was Mike TV, and we\u2019ll all miss him, very much (in lieu of flowers, my family and I would just like you to be kinder to your electronic devices, from now on). Anyway, I called my satellite company and complained that my new tv was gettin\u2019 no love from their receiver. The customer service rep., Miguel, explained that I would need to locate a coaxial cable, probably connected to Mike TV, and connect it to the new tv, instead. For 28 minutes, I tried to explain to Miguel that there was no coaxial cable, and never had been. In fact, I tried to convince him that our 23 year old tv worked on ETHERNET, and was, therefore, wireless. Yes, I did. Miguel, somehow, refrained from outright laughing at me, and patiently explained that my outlandish ideas were impossible, unless Mike TV had been somehow revamped, in the last year. Miguel did say that he would accept that as plausible, but I shut that shit down, hard. I insisted that I was right (no cable, ever, no way, nu uh, no how), and Miguel (10 year customer service rep. who\u2019s heard every single bunch of crap and still speaks with a smile so wide, you can hear it) was, obviously, so very very wrong. When Miguel remained unconvinced, I politely bid him adieu. Then, I was asked to review my call. Guess what I did. Can you guess? I think you can. You\u2019re right. Out of a possible 10, I gave good ol\u2019 Miguel a 2. \u201cThat\u2019ll teach him.\u201d I said, out loud, to myself, feeling smug. But, my new tv still didn\u2019t work. So, I called my brother-in-law. He installs cable tv, and if anyone could help me, Erik could! I\u2019d been so stupid to bother with customer service, when I had an ace in the hole just a phone call away!! So clever, OMG! Erik was patient. I spilled out the whole story, and feeling loved and accepted, cussed a blue streak about Miguel. I may have disparaged Miguel\u2019s grandfather. I was really feelin\u2019 my oats. Finally, through all the whining and cussing, Erik asked me to move Mike TV so that I could get behind him. Erik asked me to look around, and were there any wires, or\u2026 cables, coming out of the back? Lo and behold, a cable so close to my leg, had it been a snake, well\u2026 our world would have much different technology, I suppose. Anyway, Erik\u2019s laughter is still echoing in my head, and I owe Miguel several apologies. The new tv works, and Mike TV will find himself hauled away, come Tuesday morning. All in all, I\u2019d say I showed my ass pretty well, tonight. Luckily, I dealt with two men who treated me with respect, and didn\u2019t belittle me because of my gender, or my blatant impatience. Thanks, guys. I really appreciate it. And, I\u2019m so sorry! UPDATE: I called my satellite provider, today, and because Miguel made notes on my account that we\u2019d spoken, and gave details about our conversation, I was able to correct my previous behavior. I explained how stupid I\u2019d been, and asked if they could update the notes to reflect my regret for down-voting Miguel\u2019s assistance. Sarah, the CSR I spoke to, said that she would update my account, and send Miguel a message to let him know that I called to change the status of my survey. And, to send along my sincere apology. This is, probably, the last I\u2019ll hear about it, but I\u2019m glad I followed up. Being rude, even if you think you\u2019re right, is childish. Being rude when everyone knows you\u2019re wrong, except you, is a perfect recipe for comedy. Except, this time, I was the joke. Ah, well. Ya live, ya learn. ",
