Basically, a payment gateway is an intermediary entity, which authorizes data and facilitates data transfer between a payment portal and a front-end payment processor or acquiring bank. One of its main functions is to harmonize payment data formats. Traditionally, \u201cpayment gateway\u201d term was used to define a more clear and simple instrument for e-commerce, while \u201cpayment switch\u201d was associated with legacy technologies and systems.
