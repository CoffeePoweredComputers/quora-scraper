            "answer_text": "Some must-know things about tech today, according to me are: 1. Internet of Things (IOT) One of the biggest tech trends to emerge in recent years is the Internet of Things. the idea that all technological devices can be connected to the internet and to each other in an attempt to create the perfect marriage between the physical and digital world. 2. Machine learning Another exciting emerging technology is machine learning, which is essentially a computer\u2019s ability to learn on its own by analyzing data and tracking repeating patterns. 3. Virtual reality (VR) Although VR has been around since the 1950s, until recently the technology wasn\u2019t able to deliver the fully immersive digital experience users have been craving. That\u2019s about to change with recent improvements to both hardware and programming, and the effects are going to be felt across almost every industry from retail to education. 4. Touch commerce Being able to buy anything you want with the touch of a finger may have seemed like a fantasy a few years ago, but it\u2019s now a reality. Merging touchscreen technology with one-click shopping, touch commerce allows consumers to buy products easily from their phones. 5. Cognitive Technology Cognitive technology is in the same vein as machine learning and virtual reality except that it\u2019s a broader concept. Combined, these different technologies are able to automate and optimize a lot of tasks that were previously done by people. ",

            "answer_text": "From Lively Music to Dead Mechanics-Gaia on Death Bed The Holistic View was a Musical, Enchanting, Synergic Teamwork of participation by the entire Biosphere in accordance of the ultimate compositions of the Eco sphere. Mother Gaia-Bhoodevi, has been giving her compositions, evolving wonderful evolution after evolution, continuously creating mutations in every tune, the entire communication of the rapture being the Music that communicated from the solid inner core to the outer limits of the Magnetosphere. Every organism, each cell in every organism participated in the great songs, by breathing, smelling, sensing and harmonizing. The organisms basked in the bounties give by Mother Gaia, the loving mother, not an inanimate machine. Unfortunately, some organisms instead of smelling, sensing and enjoying, stopped enjoying and started analyzing. One organism, the most horribly infected of all, started screeching that everything is a machine without any life or music and that all life forms, Mother Gaia, the planets in the Solar Musical System, The Milky way, the Universe...are only mechanical and not musical. The gigantic Musical teams of the Life Forms, the Phil (Love) Harmonics, most of nature\u2019s compositions are tortured, killed and then mechanized. The organism says that the ultimate mechanization is scientific advancement. All sensing from Mother Gaia, a benefit an organism gets by being in Gaia is lampooned. In the Zoology laboratory sits the Lecturer in Zoology amidst the dead cats, dead rats, dead snakes, dead frogs..., explain the mechanical structures of the organisms. The idea of participating and tuning with the organisms certainly is not part of the science of Zoology. For the Zoologist life forms essentially are mechanical. If the Scooter mechanic explains the oil storage in the scooter, the zoologist explains the food storage system in the organism. He actually cuts the animals to explain the mechanical system. Now murdering the biosphere and eliminating all the music of life forms is euphemized as economic development. All the life systems of Mother Gaia\u2014land, water, air...are bulldozed, destroyed...and dead structures called factories are getting established. The factories do not sing, they spew poisons creating cries of anguish. From the Paradigm of the wonderful Music of Life we are now in the mechanical paradigm, the paradigm of the lifeless machines.
