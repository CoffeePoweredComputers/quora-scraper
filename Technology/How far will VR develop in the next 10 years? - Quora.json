            "answer_text": "VR technology is developing really actively. But according to the research and forecasts of TechCrunch, Digi-Capital and ABI Research, in the next 10 years AR technology will take a large share of the market. Revenues from AR are projected to be four times higher than in VR before 2020. In fact, by 2020, AR/VR can receive an income of $ 150 billion. USA, while AR will consume about 120 billion dollars, and only 30 billion will be a share of VR.  Revenues will be distributed among several large verticals, including education, games, health, industry and retail. In the virtual reality market, there will be similar growth rates, but in a much smaller market compared to AR.  Also, after a successful launch on Pok\u00e9mon GO, Tim Cook said that Apple in the long term will continue to invest a consistent money in AR. It proves that in the future augmented reality will more powerful innovative solution. ",

            "answer_text": "Virtual reality is a hot topic in the field of science and technology. It is assumed that the cost of hardware and the complexity of production are the obstructions for the massive adoption of virtual reality. However, the experts from the VR industry have different opinions. Virtual reality is an underestimated field that could bring changes to medical therapy, professional training, and life experiences for both consumers and business beyond videos and games. What Is the Next Opportunity for VR Immersive Experience To Consumers? Speaking of virtual reality, the first thing people think of might be watching 360 videos. However, most people might consider such immersive experiences as passive ones while ignoring the active interactions. Like the traditional 2D videos, 360/VR videos add the fascinating stereo sounds and visual effects to reinforce the immersive experience, but more could be achieved beyond this point, such as designing more interactive components and more dynamic storylines. Eddie Lou, the founder of Sandman Studios, pointed out that the passive and active interactions are not mutually exclusive. It is more about storytelling. For example, Fresh Out, an animation produced by Sandman Studios and selected by 2018 Venice Film Festival, has more than one end depending on how the audiences choose in the interactive components. In other words, the story is dynamic and unpredictable. In this case, the animation could be considered as a game or an interactive story.  In fact, there could be no explicit boundary between VR games and videos. They both require comprehensive storylines, visual effects, and interactive elements. However, more VR content creators may be familiar with VR videos while not all of them know a lot about VR games. VR films can be the potential tool to turn those audiences to the players, said Hugh Hou. Huge Hou, Co-founder of CreatorUp, has collaborated on a VR horror film called Willow\u2019s House recently. It engages multiple players to participate in the film, play the roles and communicate with each other, which is more like a game, or even a social tool. Most importantly, like Fresh Out, the players can decide the direction of Willow\u2019s House. \u201cVR content is still in the preliminary stages in the consumer-oriented market,\u201d said Karen Zu, Marketing VP of PICO technology. After the audiences purchase the VR headsets, how to turn them into active users is still challenging for the whole industry. To solve that, thinking about how to improve the interactive experience would be a key factor. What Is The Role Of VR In Business World? When creators are struggling to create a comprehensive storyline and immersive VR experiences for the audience, corporations and organizations have already started to apply VR to their business. The two most significant applications are medical therapy and professional training. A study found that VR could be used to treat phobias. \u201cIn a clinical trial of a new virtual reality treatment for fear of heights, participants reported being much less afraid after using the program for just two weeks,\u201d the study said.  Shuai Yuan, Chief Growth Officer of insta360, shared a story accordant with the study results. A doctor from New York used insta360 Pro to treat autism and PTSD patients by filming the things that his patients were afraid of, the subway for instance and showed to his patients. By doing that, the patients can experience whatever they are afraid of in a safe environment, which helps them overcome their fears. Zu mentioned how VR used to treat drug addictions. Therapists will get the individual with the addiction put on a VR headset and navigate them through various scenarios. By using the exposure to the drugs they are misusing in a virtual environment, the therapists can monitor patients\u2019 responses and teach them the coping skills. Professional training is another field that VR has widespread uses. There are many professions in which making mistakes can be disastrous, such as those of a surgeon, pilot, soldier, race-car driver or other professionals. Because the simulative training in these fields has always been a challenge, a virtual environment can sufficiently help them prepare for the real-world scenarios. What Is the Next Tipping Point For Virtual Reality? There are still some glitches VR needs to fix before it becomes massive-marketable, but VR will continue to evolve in an ongoing process. One consensus was that social-driven content will accelerate the spread of VR. \u201cOnly social-driven content will increase the interaction amongst people, which makes the users stay longer on the platform,\u201d Shuai Yuan said. This viewpoint can\u2019t be denied since we\u2019ve already witnessed the success of multiple-player games. Although the preconditions for the massive adoption of VR are sufficient, the popular beliefs in VR are limited. \u201cThe VR headsets are cheap enough, and the contents are adequate,\u201d said Kevin Leung, GM of HTC Vive Shenzhen and Director of Vive X. He added, \u201cMany people don\u2019t understand VR, but they could spend plenty of times watching 2D videos. The real problem is how to change the perceptions of VR.\u201d  Other problems need to be fixed before the massive adoption of VR is to fill the knowledge gap and build the relevancy with the audience. \u201cThe VR education is costly,\u201d Zu mentioned. \u201cThere is no efficient medium to teach people what VR is and how to use it.\u201d Therefore, the audiences don\u2019t know how VR can be relevant to their real life. The tipping point for VR might reach three to five years later because of the high education costs. \u201cThe market penetration is still low in China,\u201d Leung said. \u201cThere are so many opportunities for VR, but the key is how to position it (in the market).\u201c Many of these innovations are promising us ways to change the way we live life in a more productive and connected manner. It\u2019s estimated that in the 2020\u2019s these technologies will converge into a synergistic human man-machine. Standalone Headsets Are the Mainstream VR Devices This one is pretty simple and may seem quite obvious. Facebook is launching the Oculus Go this year (hopefully) for an extremely low price of $200. Facebook is the technology empire to do this and fuel VR for the masses. According to John Carmack, Oculus CTO noted that the Oculus Go will perform \u201csignificantlybetter\u201d than the Samsung Gear. Oculus has also partnered with Xioami to create an Oculus Go version for China coined the \u201cMi VR Standalone\u201d that looks almost identical to the Go. I wrote another feature on VeeR of the 6 Best Standalone Virtual Reality (VR) Headsets in 2018. Oculus isn\u2019t the first and many more manufacturers are following the trend and coming out with their own standalone devices. The pinnacle of standalone performance is HTC Vive\u2019s Focus headset that uses \u201cworld-scale\u201d and is similar to the HTC vive, a powerful headset tethered to a PC. Depending on the success of the Oculus Go will decide how the industry moves forward. Facebook is going to use their technology infrastructure to make virtual reality popular, and I believe will open a VR standalone race between varies companies if the public decides the devices are good enough for the price.  2. Emergence of Augmented Reality will Fuel Virtual Reality Augmented reality is VR\u2019s sister industry. Based on statistics the augmented/mixed reality industry will be MUCH larger than VR by 2023. Virtual reality\u2019s reboot started in 2012 with Oculus\u2019 Kickstarter being successfully funded and purchased by Facebook. Why? VR from a time standpoint is much more time-consuming than augmented reality. Additionally, Magic Leap is one of the most funded startups in history. ML promises a mixed reality device that is coming soon for creators this year. Many speculate and say VR won\u2019t take off because it can\u2019t be used in public or in tandem with other activities. I believe this is a narrow point of view and doesn\u2019t address all of the uses that VR will mostly be used in entertainment, and other completely immersive scenarios. Common usage of augmented reality will lead people to fully immersive virtual reality experiences. By the time AR picks up in the coming years, VR content and experiences will be much better and appeal more to mainstream audiences rather than the current niche uses.  3. Limitless Unfathomable Experiences I interviewed Jay Samit on the Humans 2.0 Podcast. Jay is a major influencer in the world of mixed reality technology. He brought up a very interesting point during our conversation. He said when the iPhone came out, nobody had any idea what kind of mobile applications we could use. The early app store was filled with fart and gun apps with no real utility or purpose. Point being, even if VR / AR is being used for mundane trivial applications today, it doesn\u2019t mean it will look that way in 5 years. Due to limited processing power, virtual reality experiences are quite limited. Imagine the future metaverse as a limitless world of intention and thought. Virtual Reality is an idea of fully immersive technology-mediated dream worlds. Rendered mind spaces where the only limit is your imagination. My favorite example of an unfathomable VR experience today is GE Healthcare\u2019s virtual reality specialty software. It can help radiologists, doctors, and surgeons better read the human body, perform diagnoses and make their decisions. The VR app lets Doctors step inside internal organs and navigate, travel forward from side to side, and even search for polyps and other tumors.
