A $800 projector can give you a 120-inch picture, while a TV that is 80 inches expenses about $4,000 3 reason projectors replace Television 1. You can get a greater picture with a projector LCD video projector at business meeting Projectors offer greater pictures We as a whole realize that TVs are entirely costly. Also, any individual who's looked for a TV as of late realizes they will need to spend a lot of money to get a TV with an extra large screen. In any case, shockingly enough, you can get a major picture with a projector arrangement \u2014 without spending huge amounts of cash on the best in class innovation. For example, even shabby projectors can give you a picture that is 120 inches wide. Also, the widths that are conceivable simply go up from that point as your spending increments. Is it true that we are stating that the 120-inch picture from a sub-$100 projector will be equivalent to the image from an incredibly costly TV? In no way, shape or form. Regardless you have to do your examination and make sense of what you're truly getting. Yet, in the event that one of your fundamental needs is getting a major picture, and you would prefer not to spend an immense measure of cash to get it, a projector is completely worth looking into. 2. You'll most likely discover arrangement quite straightforward Video projector for work introduction Setting up a projector is shockingly simple A typical misguided judgment is that a projector arrangement is entangled, since you have both the projector and the screen to manage. Also, that is without considering. In any case, as a general rule, it isn't so hard to make sense of. You'll have to make sense of your sound arrangement, obviously, however you likely as of now have that hardware close by. (You can't in any way, shape or form be depending on the speakers that are worked in to your TV, can you?) And on the off chance that you purchase the correct hardware for your space, setting it up won't be that confounded. Then again, a few people expect that projectors are entirely low-tech gadgets and they probably won't most likely get a similar usefulness with a task that they get with their keen TV. However, on the off chance that you do your examination and gather the correct arrangement, you'll have the option to utilize the majority of your current contraptions, including things like an Apple TV, a Chromecast, your DVD or Blu-Ray player, and even your game support. 3. You don't have to devote floor or divider space to the arrangement Couple viewing a film A projector doesn't need to occupy as much room as a TV A conventional TV either should be put on an (enormous) household item, or should be mounted to the divider. Scarcely any individuals wind up mounting their TVs to the divider on account of the issue and the potential for harm. So chances are great that on the off chance that you have a major TV, you devote a lot of floor space to it. Furthermore, you likely organize the remainder of the furniture in your lounge around it. That makes it the not really esthetically satisfying point of convergence of the room, notwithstanding when it's off. A projector, then again, needn't bother with any devoted floor space. Also, it doesn't need to occupy any divider room, either. You can put the projector itself on a rack, or even on the roof. Furthermore, on the off chance that you purchase a retractable screen, the arrangement won't need to take up a lot of divider space, either. Simply withdraw the screen and drape a bit of craftsmanship. Then force the screen down exactly when you need it. In case you're not very worried about greatest picture quality, you can overlook the screen totally \u2014 a plain white divider will work. The best portable projectors are perfect for professionals who are often travelling for work or use in home, as it means you can conduct presentations quickly and easily using your own equipment \u2013 rather than having to fiddle around with cables in front of an audience. Personally, i am using Piqo projector for a couple of months. i am satisfied. You can also pick one for your portable projector needs.  ",

To my point of view, people who have their own property and live with their family will probably prefer television. Since family members usually sit in the living room and turn on the TV. On the other hand, the young generation who just move out to live alone might not wanna buy a television due to its high price and other disadvantages. Meanwhile they might get a projector. But actually at this moment, most people consider using a laptop and a smart phone is quiet enough. They don\u2019t even need a television, not to mention a projector. Pros of TV: High resolution.You can easily receive Native 4K from a TV.Good sound quality.Frame rate is perfect.
