            "answer_text": "Question: \u201cCan social workers tap your cell phone?\u201d The answer is easy, NO. And even if they could it would ALWAYS require a warrant predicated on probable cause. With that said it seems your question may be deeper. They certainly could record calls where they are a party. They could record in person interactions. They could put you on speaker for others to hear. In some states this may require notification and at minimum tacit acceptance, in most states there is one party consent, so either party or any party can record a phone call. In person recording may actually be simpler, they are the state, they have no privacy interest to protect, YOU have a privacy interest. This makes the argument simpler because you have a right to record public servants in the course of their official duties. I have seen a number of videos where a parent pulls out a phone and starts recording and the social worker tells them they can\u2019t. Well no, they can. They will often say it is their policy that you can\u2019t, doesn\u2019t matter, their policy does not bind you. My personal position would be very simple, there WILL be a recording in EVERY case, your notes will NOT be the only record of what goes on here. There WILL be an objective record and if you refuse then YOU are making that decision. It should be noted that they can stalk you on social media if you have a public profile. I would make one final point, social workers should not be considered your friend, you should view them with suspicion and caution. ",

            "answer_text": "Of course not... Social workers cannot tap anyone's phone. Afterall, social workers aren't law enforcement officers. I assume that you asked this question because you're under some type of (CPS) investigation wherein social workers are involved. If the above is the case, social workers CAN (and often do) monitor your social media accounts, especially, if they are public. So, always be careful about what you say and post online. Social workers can also record a conversation that you have had with them (with or without your permission depending on the state and whether or not they're using a personal phone). Moreover, social workers can place you on speaker phone at any time so that others can hear (and record and/or take notes on) the conversation. However, all this works both ways and as such I would suggest recording (or take detailed notes at the very minimum) any and all future interactions that you have with the social worker(s). This is the best way to protect yourself and avoid any discrepancies and/or misrepresentations. I hope that answers your question:) ",

            "answer_text": "No, and this social worker wouldn't want to. I can't even imagine a scenario where it might be useful. But I'm a case manager with developmentally disabled adults, I'm all about funding services and health. I have too much to do to care about phone calls. Phone tapping is something done by law enforcement in fairly major cases with judicial approval. It would be more likely that a tap ordered for other suspected criminal behavior in a household led to child (or dependent adult) welfare concerns. The role of the social worker requires trust from those we work with. While some social workers have some authority (such as removing a child) the evidence for decisions and recommendations would be far more conventional. We are mandated reporters of what we observe and are told, not mandated snoops. ",
