            "answer_text": "There are only two advantages A. Handy The smartphone camera is ridiculously handy, a device you probably have with you almost everytime. Say you are travelling and you take a pit stop for a minute or two, you can remove your phone and capture some great detail, while on the other hand a dslr use, needs to be planned and isn't as handy to carry along everywhere you go, even though the quality is no match to the dslr, but remember sometimes an okok photo is always better than no photo at all. B. AI Most smartphone cameras are aimed at amature photographers, hence a lot of photography decisions is taken by the camera software generally referred as AI, while it is important to note that not all smartphone cameras do not carry the same AI, for example the pixel 3 has a 12.2 mp single lens camera and captures way more better pictures than the 48mp camera on the Xiaomi note 7 pro, of course a lot depends on the aperture and sensor, but the major difference is the software. It is remarkable how far smart phone cameras have come, that I cannot believe that some photos were captured on a phone and not a dslr. My advice. Photography is an art and the best tool to practise that art is via a dslr where u control everything. But having and using a decent phone camera is also a great tool which cannot be ignored. Use both if u have the liberty to do so. I do. ",
