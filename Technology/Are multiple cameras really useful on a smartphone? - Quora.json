            "answer_text": "Well useful, to some degree yes. The lens on any phone is a single focal length, zoom lenses have been tried in the past but were far too bulky for the users. With a fixed focal length the only option for zooming is cropping the image which reduces resolution, increases the defects in the lens and overall makes an already not great image worse. Phone designers struggle with tiny lenses, fixed apertures, tiny sensors - all of which have serious limitations mostly imposed by physics. They use pixel binning to help increase dynamic range and reduce noise level of the sensors. To help reduce the amount of cropping necessary, they have brought in multiple lenses - each with a unique focal length. So yes it does help to prevent further degradation of the image. Are they as good as a DSLR with a zoom lens.. no not even close to an entry level DSLR with a budget lens. But they are good enough for many who take snapshots - they are not designed to replace the DSLR - but are targeted at the compact camera. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, it\u2019s useful to have multiple cameras. Professional photographers with big cameras use to have several big lenses, each for specific usage. Like, simplifying, one for portraits, one for landscapes, one for long distances etc. These lenses have different focal length and different optical schema and produce excellent pictures. Budget photographers have one \u2018all-purpose\u2019 zoom lens often, it\u2019s usually big but has complex optical schema and produces photos of average to low quality. Modern smartphones are very thin, while user\u2019s expectations are high. It is hard task to put a lens with zoom and complex optical schema inside a smartphone, and if such one would be designed, it would produce photos of very low quality. Thus vendors start to put several cameras with different focal length just like a pro-photographer carries several big lenses for single camera body. If you need to make landscape photo, a smartphone turns wide-angle camera, if you want to shoot a butterfly few steps away, telephoto camera would be enabled. ",

            "answer_text": "In my opinion, yes definitely useful. Since mobile phone is always with you and the main purpose is to document moments, you are most likely will encounter many different scene scenarios. Thus having multiples cameras (lenses) will allows you to maximize image quality in most situation. I have written short blog about taking travel photos with 3 lenses mobile phone, and you can see some situation might need tele zoom, or extra wide instead the standard wide lens.

Using multiple lenses is one way of reducing the deficiencies of the inadequate phone cameras. Those seriously interested in photography will want to use real cameras. ",
