            "answer_text": "Right now I have a desktop, laptop, smart phone, media center PC and satellite DVR.  Once upon a time I had a scanner, fax and printer that is now an all in one.  I predict that in the future each person will have one device the size of a smart phone and a dock in the house.  The dock will interface wirelessly to various devices such as a workcenter (display, mouse/key), AV receiver/TV, phone system and other uses.  Exciting new technology such as the memristor may put all of the processing and storage capability in such a small device. ",

            "answer_text": "Well it depends right, if it is a closed source technology that the company chooses not to improvise any further or slowly kill it, you are out of luck (case in point Microsoft Silverlight which MS is now beginning to ignore with the advent of HTML5). However if it is an open source technology, then chances are that you can keep customizing it as per your own needs and there is the odd chance that others using it will keep customizing it. as well !! Then again, you can be sure that there will be support for the technology to keep running, for e.g, you can still develop in MS silverlight, the issue is improvisations won't exist and you will feel the need to migrate to a new technology!
