            "answer_text": "The easiest way to access remote screen sharing is to have the device(of which screen you want to share) with configurations and settings published from a web-based iOS screen sharing and device management console.  This allows the admin to initiate the screen-sharing protocol after completing the initial device enrollment and basic configurations. The reason to choose remote screen sharing feature by Scalefusion is that it allows the admin to not only access screen remotely but also push much needed configurations over-the-air right from the single tab of your browser. You'd not need to toggle between the different solutions to manage device, access screen remotely, troubleshoot, raise a ticket if you happen to use Scalefusion ",

            "answer_text": "As of 2019, there\u2019s great built-in browser support (WebRTC) for screen sharing in Chrome, Firefox, and Opera. Whereby takes advantage of this and make it incredibly simple for people to join. It\u2019s free for a room of up to 4 people (unlike many other answers here, which have no free service). When I want to provide phone support for someone, I have them join my Whereby room. They click to allow permissions (no plug-in or any other downloads needed), and then they can share a specific window or their entire screen with me. Then I can walk them through whatever we were having trouble describing over the phone. ",
