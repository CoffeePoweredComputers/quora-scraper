            "answer_text": "First a bit of fun. Tech-free tricks, old-school sleight of hand: How modern magicians keep magic alive. At the Halifax Busker Festival in 1988 I saw a slight of hand performer swap a walnut for hazel nut under a bowler hat and two ball caps from the audience. He did the shell game three times removing the hazelnut for a walnut. Second time he showed you how he did it. Then when asked to point out the hazel nut, it was an orange. Then he showed it again this time very slowly, when asked to point out the orange, it was a walnut and the other two walnuts were cantaloupes. _____________________________________________ Change theoretically to philosophically and I will grant you it\u2019s an interesting notion.  Technology that would be magic to us but we could accept as technology. \u201cTraveling through hyperspace ain't like dusting crops, boy! Without precise calculations we could fly right through a star or bounce too close to a supernova and that'd end your trip real quick, wouldn't it?\u201d Han Solo, Star Wars: a New Hope - Magic \u201cKid, I've flown from one side of this galaxy to the other, and I've seen a lot of strange stuff, but I've never seen *anything* to make me believe that there's one all-powerful Force controlling everything. 'Cause no mystical energy field controls *my* destiny. It's all a lot of simple tricks and nonsense.\u201d Han Solo, Star Wars: a New Hope - \u201cI used to wonder about that myself. Thought it was a bunch of mumbo-jumbo. A magical power holding together good and evil, the dark side and the light. Crazy thing is... it's true. The Force. The Jedi... All of it... It's all true.\u201d Han Solo, Star Wars: the Force Awakens  When someone talks about CFD, I often jokingly say \u201cThat\u2019s borderline magic to me.\u201d Why? I believe CFD works (within reason) but it\u2019s inner workings are a bit of a mystery to me. Acknowledging an important point made by Esther Inglis-Arkell, someone can hold my hand, walk me through the details and procedures, and provided we don\u2019t strangle each other first, I could at least be a trained monkey and perform a CFD raindance. Maybe even understand some of it. It has foundation in this world so it is not \u201csupernatural\u201d. Like Pirsig\u2019s description of an engine in Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance every piece of steel existed as an idea in someones mind, and then abstracted, and completely communicated to someone else before it was made real. It was fully realized by not just one human mind, but many. If magic were to exist, it will have a fraction in the supernatural and a fraction in the natural otherwise the two wouldn\u2019t interact. We are into venn diagram territory here. If the details are hidden, how could we know? Getting a little \u201cBerty Russel\u201d here. One example. Some believe the multiverse is supernatural (aka BS or defies natural laws). Some theorize the multiverse is natural and obeys natures laws that we simply don\u2019t know yet. So which is magical? Another example, Faster than Light, FTL, warp speed, is supernatural right now as we perceive it. Yet few throw fictional depictions of it in the magic column. However, there was that Sam Neil \u201cEvent Horizon\u201d film which did a cross over. Or was that a slip into madness like the movie Boyle/Murphy film \u201cSunshine\u201d? And then there was 2001 and 2010. Which \u201cthey\u201d allowed what used to be David Bowman to return to give Dr. Floyd a warning and a promise of \u201csomething wonderful\u201d? Since I brought up 2001\u2026 Arthur C Clarke is often quoted: \"Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.\u201d Clarke didn\u2019t say super advanced tech is magic, just that we couldn\u2019t tell the difference. Again, with that reference frame stuff. The 2D analogy of the big bang with the dots on the balloon. The dots can only perceive the x/y on the balloons surface and height is meaningless to the balloon people. Here is a different point of view from someone who gets paid to think about things like this. Technology isn't Magic: Why Clarke's Third Law always bugged me ",

            "answer_text": "Magic is the body and spirit\u2019s way to use energy to interact with the world. When science works with \u201cdark energy\u201d and \u201cdark matter\u201d or electro-weak phenomena the way magic does, it will still be technology. We walk, we create a bicycle. we use the technology of a bicycle. Our physical interaction is slightly different. Magic is a discipline and a practice, versus being proficient at using a technology.
