            "answer_text": " Well... the latest version of android is the Android 6.0.1 or Android Marshmallow or just android M. The features of android m are:- Android Marshmallow design Android Marshmallow is visually similar to its predecessor, Lollipop, in many ways. Google\u2019s Material Design language is now more pervasive than ever before and the main areas of the UI \u2013 settings, notifications shade and navigation \u2013 remain the same. But Marshmallow does have some differences in appearance and new features. Settings shortcuts Android has let you create shortcuts to particular settings, such as the battery or display, for a while, but until Marshmallow, the icons for these shortcuts all looked the same. Now, the standard cog widget shape contains an icon depicting what that particular shortcut goes to, as shown in the screenshot below.   Animations and Easter Egg Animations and transitions make up an even larger part of Marshmallow than they did in Lollipop. Transitions between apps, pages and settings are quite often accompanied by animations, as is toggling features on and off within the various settings and menus. It\u2019s relatively minor stuff but it all adds to the polished feeling of Marshmallow. As always, there is a hidden Easter Egg in Marshmallow and it can be seen as a kind of metaphor for Marshmallow as a whole. In Android Lollipop the Easter Egg was a Flappy Bird clone. Just as Marshmallow looks an awful lot like Lollipop on the surface with lots of refinements and improvements underneath, the Flappy Bird Easter Egg returns, but with a bit of a makeover. It\u2019s accessed by repeatedly tapping Android version in the About phone section of the settings.  200 new emoji The update to Android 6.0.1 brought with it 200 new emoji. These are default Android emoji and should be compatible with any keyboard. A lot of the emoji that were added have been in use on iOS and Windows 10 for some time, but others are new. The list of new emoji includes the fabled unicorn, the tasty taco and the hungry squirrel. Dark theme and rotation support For unknown reasons, both the system-wide dark theme and support for a rotating home screen were removed from the final version of Marshmallow, despite appearing in versions of the developer preview. We may yet see these make a return in future updates to Marshmallow \u2013 they are frequently-requested features, after all \u2013 but for now they are not a part of the Android 6.0 release. Some eager code-sifters have uncovered evidence of a dark mode in the source code for Android Marshmallow, indicating that Google may still have plans to include it in a future version. The source code mentions Night Mode, which, as you may remember, sounds a lot like the automatic theme changing capabilities (based on the time of day) we saw in the Android M preview builds.  Google settings app As mentioned above, Google settings are now a dedicated part of the settings menu. Here is where you\u2019ll find privacy information, account preferences and more for your Google accounts. It\u2019s also where you can manage your OK, Google hotword detection and 'always listening' mode. But there\u2019s another new feature here, called Set up nearby device.  Set up nearby device is basically a settings menu version of Tap & Go that doesn\u2019t rely on NFC. Tap & Go handily loads your Google account, apps list and settings to a new device via Wi-Fi and Bluetooth, meaning if you\u2019re trying to set up an Android TV, for example, you can simply do it through this setting on your phone. Android Pay With the delivery of the fingerprint API and two new Nexus devices equipped with fingerprint scanners, Android Pay has arrived. Android Pay is one of a number of touchless payment systems including Apple Pay and Samsung Pay. Naturally, Android Pay will become the default solution on devices without a manufacturer solution like Samsung's. Android Pay is simple to set up but it requires an NFC-equipped terminal at participating retailers as well as an NFC-equipped smartphone. Samsung Pay has an advantage here because it also works on the existing magnetic strip readers already in stores. It\u2019s still early days for Android Pay but you can expect to see a lot more of it in the years to come. Android Pay vs Samsung Pay vs Apple Pay comparison Doze Doze is, after Google Now on Tap, perhaps the biggest thing in Marshmallow. Doze is an intelligent battery management feature that recognizes when your device is not is use, like when it has been lying on a bedside table for a while, and enters hibernation. It\u2019s more complicated than that, of course, but the battery savings are phenomenal. Where other devices lose an average of 15-25 percent of battery life overnight, Marshmallow can take that down to 3-5 percent, taking your standby time to nearly two weeks in the process.  Furthermore, manufacturers won\u2019t be able to mess with Doze mode. This doesn\u2019t mean that manufactures can\u2019t still apply their own battery saver modes to their skins of stock Android, but device standby will only be handled by an unmodified Doze. microSD support \u2013 Adaptable Storage Devices The battle to accept microSD cards has been one of the most interesting in Android history. Expandable storage used to be a mainstay of Android devices, but then Google decided it was bad for security and removed support for it in Android KitKat. Developers fought back and partial support was added in Lollipop. With the arrival of Marshmallow we're finally looking at full-fledged support for microSD expansion in Android devices. Under Marshmallow, microSD cards can be formatted to a specific device \u2013 meaning they will be unusable elsewhere \u2013 and treated as another part of internal storage by the Android system. How to never run out of storage space on Android While this means you won\u2019t be able to simply pull your microSD card out and pop it in another phone, it does mean you have system-level support for external storage. In Android Marshmallow, apps and the data they use can now be seamlessly stored on an external microSD card without having to be explicitly put there by the user. We've saw the first evidence of Marshmallow's Adaptable Storage Devices feature on the Marshmallow soak test for the Moto G (2014). One of our Brazilian readers in the Motorola update program alerted us to the update and shared some screenshots outlining new features, including ASD (because the Moto G (2014) has a microSD card slot).  Internal storage and file manager Marshmallow has also overhauled the Storage area of settings. Storage and USB now provides at-a-glance information on internal and external storage and adds a convenient stock file manager at the bottom of the list, called Explore. Fingerprint API Android Marshmallow introduces system-level fingerprint support via the new fingerprint API. Both new Nexus devices have a fingerprint scanner. The rollout of Android Pay and other touchless payment systems that rely on fingerprint scanners for authentication can now be handled by Android itself rather than a manufacturer add-on. Fortunately, Google has set minimum standards for scanner accuracy in order to pass its device certification. We've been very impressed with Nexus Imprint on the Nexus 5X and Nexus 6P, partially for the excellent Huawei hardware but also for Google's implementation of the software. Registering a fingerprint is faster than on any other device and the accuracy and speed of the scanner is second to none. All you need to do to set up fingerprint authentication in the Play Store for purchases is check a box in the settings.  Automatic app backup Historically, Android has offered a pretty weak app backup solution. The Backup and reset section in Lollipop was opt-in, vague and incomplete. Marshmallow can now automatically back up both your apps and data, so any apps restored from a backup will be the same as they were before \u2013 you\u2019ll be signed in and right where you left off. The explanations are much clearer in Marshmallow too and you can choose to opt out if you like (not everyone will be a fan of having their app data stored in the cloud, despite its convenience). The best part is that device and app data can be saved, so your passwords, settings and progress can all be restored with much less effort. How to back up everything on Android The android M has much more features and you can see it here:- Android 6.0 Marshmallow: all the key features explained - AndroidPIT Thank You. ",
