            "answer_text": "On my phones, Android Samsung Galaxy S7, S8, and S9, even though I've blocked calls they still show on my call log. I still get notified but my phone doesn't ring. I've also got a couple of call blockers so that might change things a bit. I can block numbers for text. Don't receive any notifications but can go into my message/text icon and go into the menu/settings and then into block numbers and pull up any blocked numbers texts. I only know Android. Apple/IOS I don't know how similar or different they operate. Again I can pull up my call log or blocked texts and still can monitor calls and texts I've blocked. They are a pain because they keep coming. P.S. Can't reproduce but my blocked calls show up with a back slash inside a circle. ",
