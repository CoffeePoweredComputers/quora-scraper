US and China variants come with Snapdragon 835 while others come with Exynos (homemade) chips; which are a little slower, but still fine. The \u201cSSD\u201d (overly simplified) type memory on Galaxy S6/S7/S8/Note 5 and other models of these lines were much faster than other memory types (that were around the speed of memory sticks). This does actually improve performance and battery (less time taken to do actions, thus more time in idle (relaxing basically)). The galaxy S8+ and exynos models of the Galaxy S8 have UFS 2.1, while all others mentioned have UFS 2.0, which is theoretically slower, but it no longer the limiting performance, as eMMC memory did (the memory stick relative to the SSD)Leading on from previous point, as phones are affected by not just CPU speeds, these are the other phones that combine high level (Snapdragon 835 or Samsung equivalent, no other CPU\u2019s can touch the 835) CPU with UFS 2.1 HTC U11Huawei P10 (Plus) * please read exceptions at the bottom of postSony Xperia XZSony Xperia XZ Premium (bigger XZ, with 4K screen)OnePlus 3 and 3TExceptions: Galaxy S8 Snapdragons (US/China) don\u2019t have UFS 2.1 (during the early days, from shortages, not sure about now)Huawei P10 (Plus), may have eMMC, UFS 2.0, UFS 2.1. There is no way to tell whether a handset has UFS 2.1/2.0/eMMC, so literally a hardware lottery. Huawei have since been told off by literally everyone and I think the supply issues are now resolved.source: Android Phones with UFS 2.0 Universal Flash Storage Internal Memory ",
