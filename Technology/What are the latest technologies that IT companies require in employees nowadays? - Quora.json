            "answer_text": "This is a tough question to answer and depends on the perspective of the person answering. The role of an IT company is changing. Initially it used to be that the client comes up with a requirement including a functional document and the IT team used to program. Now - clients come up with a business problem statement and the IT team along with functional experts need to come up with a solution. Conceptualizing solutions end up using multiple technologies. Companies now want employees to be strong in principles of software engineering and programming and would like employees to use the right tool for the particular problem statement. Based on demand and supply : today we have lesser employees with skills in technologies like React-Native, Golang, Game Programming, Leveraging Cloud, IT Security. This may shift to another in the next day or fortnight. On another note - employees with background in C++ have a distinct advantage in the coming days as tech requirements is now shifting to AR/VR, Blockchain, Embedded and developing high performance applications.
