            "answer_text": "Have a look at a touch screen smart phone from 1995, say the IBM Simon, and judge the rate of progress yourself, then speculate forward, given that 20 years ago (to quote Wikipedia): In addition to its ability to make and receive cellular phone calls, Simon was also able to send and receive faxes, e-mails and cellular pages. Simon featured many applications including an address book, calendar, appointment scheduler, calculator, world time clock, electronic note pad, handwritten annotations and standard and predictive stylus input screen keyboards.   Similarly do the same for tablets, PC's ... eg.  Ignoring the obvious: Smaller, more colourful, higher resolution screens, better voice and handwriting recognition, more app's written, faster comm's not that much has changed, especially on the UI / Desktop front, other than:  Digital cameras have been added to most mobile devices (70's technology)GPS is also common (80's tech)A few mobile devices have incorporated RFID / contactless payment functionality  (80's tech)A few devices have fingerprint scanners. (90's tech, see IAFIS)A few devices have moved from 32 to 64 bit processors (70's tech)Some have FM radios (60's Tech)Most play pre-recorded music (70's Tech)Which is fairly depressing, anyway think of a few existing (mature and commercially available) technologies that aren't yet incorporated into mobile devices, then I'll let you speculate forward, as to which get bolted on to what. Don't forget to speculate on what font / colour scheme changes there will be in the UI's. Consider:  What have the millions of computer scientists and engineers been doing during the time period from 1996 to 2015? What have they achieved? Do any phones incorporate environmental sensors: CO2, NO2, thermometer, practical counter,...? ",

A while ago people thought that wearable tech like the apple watch would be the future, but it didn't really catch on. I'd bet in foldable and hologram screens, maybe. also better resolution and processing power. One thing that could happen in 20 years is mobile CPUs catching up enough to PCs so at to make them run the current version of windows with minor limitations. Couple that with a USB-compliant interface for peripherals, and there's no need for laptop computers anymore. It's a very plausible scenario. ",

Starting in the late 1940s, the technology that would later be utilized as a part of today's PDAs was made and the idea of a mobile telephone was presented. This cell technology was initially utilized as a part of mobile apparatuses which was for the most part utilized as a part of taxis, police autos and other crisis vehicles and circumstances. Truckers likewise utilized a type of this technology to speak with one another. Much to their dismay how far their idea would progress to make it available to most of the populace. ",
