            "answer_text": "My most favorite case involved my own case of theft of my property, although it was not the most important case I ever used a ruse in order to catch a criminal. It was, however, the most important case that affected me personally, and it took several months to track down this hard to locate thief. During the time I worked on the boats, I dropped off my air tanks to be refilled at a local dive shop many of us used. I knew the people in the dive shop well, but a new employee gave my tanks to a guy (I'll call him John - not his real name) who claimed they were his, before I could make it back later in the afternoon. Of course the employee did not know who he gave the tanks to, but one of the guys in the shop said he thought he recognized John as an intermittent customer, he knew his name, that he is an average build and height white guy, with brown hair, and he dove for shellfish for a living. Nothing more. Not what city he lived in, or anything else. The guy always paid cash, so the invoices were mostly useless, and he supposedly lived on a boat, so there were no addresses on the invoices. This was the very early days of cell phones, so all the phone numbers were aquaintences, who all denied knowing where to find him, as is typical with thieves and criminals. The early days of people having cell phones turned out to be in my favor later on. Over the next several weeks, I figured out John drove a red pickup, and my roommate and I would intermittently surveil the parking lots at the marinas during our off time, even eating dinner there to no avail. I would surveil the marina parking when off duty, and my roommate, who worked in uniform patrol, would drive through the parking lots occasionally, to see if he could locate John's vehicle when he was on duty too but, without a make and model, it turned out to be wasted time. There were just too many red pickup trucks, and we did not really know what John even looked like. When re-looking at the invoices, one number that kept coming up was a lady's phone number and a name (I'll call her Jane - again, not the real name), though Jane denied knowing him well, it appeared she might be a girlfriend, or former girlfriend. I eventually called with the ruse that I was delivering flowers and candy for her, and got her address by telling her it was illegible on the invoice. She initially said something along the lines that \u201cif he thinks that is gonna fix everything, he has another thing coming\u201d. She was cagey, but the idea of flowers and candy was too much to turn down, and she gave me the address where she lived. When I went to the house, the lady was royally pissed that I had lied to her, and no flowers or candy would be forthcoming. She still denied knowing how to contact him, but did admit that they \u201cused to go out\u201d. I thought I'd hit a dead end, but I started driving by the house every so often. I even got John on the phone at the house once, and told him that if my tanks got dropped off at the dive shop, I'd drop the charges, no questions asked - I just wanted my tanks back. He laughed, and said he did not know what I was talking about, to which I replied something along the lines of he didn't know he was dealing with, that I was never going to give up or go away, and he'd always have to look over his shoulder. He hung up. Then pay dirt. I drove by late one night, and a red truck was in the driveway. I couldn't get a tag number without the neighbor's dog raising a ruckus, but I now knew he was driving a Chevy truck. Then, some days later, I had a very lucky coincidence, and heard a guy mention his name as a group was chatting over some beers and hanging out in the main marina. I said John and I were friends from school, and I asked how ol' John is doing, what's he up to, is he still driving that crappy looking red truck, etc. As part of the conversation, I now learned he was actually living with some friends in the bordering city, and what bar he frequented. Pay dirt X2. Now, in addition to Jane's house, I began surveilling the bar and, one night, lo and behold, in drives a red Chevy pickup. It was too dark, and I was too far away to really see who got out, and I still did not really know what John looked like, but I did have a department issued cell phone the size of a small briefcase (a Motorola bag phone). I called 411, and got the bar's phone number, then called and asked if John was there. I told the bartender I was a good friend trying to meet John for drinks. For those that are younger, in that era, bars would typically have a public pay phone at or near the bar for patrons to make and receive calls, prior to cell phones being small enough to conveniently carry in. I asked the bartender if he'd ask John to go to the phone when I called, and that I'd call back on the pay phone momentarily. My roommate, who luckily was with me, and I were positively giddy, and I made a plan to call as we observed who the bartender called out, then who, subsequently, went to the pay phone. The phone rang, the bartender called for John, and said he had a call. When he picked up the phone, I heard him say (in response to my roommate\u2019s question) \u201cyeah this is John\u201d. At that moment, I reached over, hung up the pay phone, and informed him he was under arrest for the felony theft of my tanks, pursuant to the warrant I had taken out. Got the local guys there, one of whom I knew, they confirmed the warrant was still valid and in hand, and he was transported to jail. While at the local PD, he wanted to know if the deal to return the tanks, no questions asked was still on the table. Nope, but a subsequent search warrant for the place he was living was, and many thefts were solved. It's been many years and I have solved every type of crime from petty theft to murder, but that case still makes me remember the shocked and mystified look on his face as I hung up the pay phone and arrested him. Other people have had a similar look on occasion, but it was never quite as satisfying. I told him I would never go away or forget, and I still have and use those two dive tanks many years later. I think of John every time I use them. ",

            "answer_text": "Many, many years ago. This one time\u2026 The Marshall's or FBI and I think 15 different sheriff's departments set up a little operation. There was a small shop set up in a down town area, it was set up with banners, balloons and signs stating to claim your new flat screen television. And 15 flatscreen TV boxes sitting around. The most wanted in all the counties participating were mailed a congratulations flyer as being selected to claim their free television It was set up as the entered the shop, they gave their names or flyer to the guys at the table, and then the department making the arrest was notified and plain clothes officers escorted them to the back room and as soon as they went in the back room, the uniformed deputies placed the under arrest. Many dangerous felons were arrested that day. The crazy part is people just walking in off the street wanting a free TV, and had warrants on them as well. They would provide their name, and information and a quick check confirmed they had warrants. In the end they were given free television in prison, but not a single television was given away. But man if people didn't flock to the fake shop giving away televisions. Goes without saying, if it's to good to be true, its probably not. ",
