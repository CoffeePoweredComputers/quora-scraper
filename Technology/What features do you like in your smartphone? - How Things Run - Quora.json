            "answer_text": "Hmm. I would like to have If not latest then powerful enough & most importantly power efficient SoC that also have Good quality ISP.Atleast Full HD+ display , I am not that interested in 90 Hz / 120 Hz display , but the display should have great outdoor visibility , good & balanced color reproduction & also shouldn't have any kind of screen flickering issues , AMOLED is welcome addition for me anyday.Atleast 18W fast charging support , because now days we have larger capacity batteries , so below 18W charging it doesn't make much of difference in terms of charging time , & atleast 4000 mAh battery capacity according to industry standards now a days.I can live with plastic build , but the build quality shouldn't feel cheap.I need , one main camera , doesn't necessarily want 64/48 MP but again should have good camera quality , and atleast 12/16 MP wide angle lens & proper dedicated telephoto zoom lens , I don't want macro & depth lens , because portrait shots can also be done with software algorithms. It will be nice if the main camera have an OIS/EIS.Single speaker doesn't bad at all , but it should be loud enough.Good to have an IP rating , but if it doesn't it should have splash resistance feature.And yes last but not the least , should have dedicated headphone jack.

            "answer_text": "My smartphone is Lenovo K6 Power which is 3 years and 8 months old. It was launched in September, 2016 with 4GB RAM and 32GB of internal storage. Features that I like in my smartphone are: Stock Android - At that time not every smartphone was launched with Stock Android.Large Battery - Now this might seem normal but 4000mAh battery with 32 bit OS gives 8\u20139 hours of SOT.Screen size - I prefer compact design rather than tall and bulky structures.RAM - 4 GB.Internal storage - 32 GB was not common at that time at least in the budget range.Camera - 13 MP Sony IMX258, nowadays marketing with camera sensor (Sony IMX586 0r 686) has become a trend but before not every OEM used to pack good sensor.Long screenshot - Who doesn\u2019t like this feature?Processor - SD 430, I know it is very old but still it loads up applications even today at medium speed.Speaker - Dolby Atmos.Dark Mode.Always on Display.Gaming mode.I got the above 3 features after flashing Custom ROM.
