            "answer_text": "If aliens managed to cross interstellar space, and they wanted our planet, there would be nothing that we could do to stop them. Fictional aliens come to Earth and seemingly refight the Second World War because that scenario sells books and movie tickets. Here are some nightmare scenarios that don't involve jets dogfighting with flying saucers: They park in the asteroid belt, affix engines and guidance systems to huge chunks of rock, then safely bombard us from where we can't strike back.They engineer a virus that is 100% contagious and 100% deadly to humans, then release it in our atmosphere. For bonus points, it vitrifies us so that they won't have to clean up 7.6 billion rotting corpses.They engineer a drug that is 100% addictive that also has extremely unpleasant withdrawal symptoms. Again, they release it in our atmosphere. They're perfectly willing to share it with us, if we'd just give them whatever they want. Did I say that there's no antidote? Because there's no antidote.They introduce us to a concept that causes humans to have severe psychological breakdowns, then they sit back and watch the mass suicides and murders.They give advanced technology, weapons, and defenses to ONE human faction that is particularly aggressively expansive, then stand back. Of course these \u201cgifts\" aren't advanced enough to pose a threat to the aliens.They release a biological or chemical weapon into the atmosphere that causes human sterility. They crossed interstellar space, surely they have the patience to wait the eighty so years that it would take humanity to go extinct.They show up with a fleet of ships that's impressive both in number, as well as in firepower. Then they tell us that they're here to protect us from the \u201cbad\" aliens. Now that we're \u201cfriends\u201d, they just need us to do a few favors, and give them a few gifts.They seed the planet with trillions of spores of their planet's version of kudzu or cane toads. Surprise! They're not simply plants or animals. Each organism is a component of a terraforming system. The goal is to make the planet inhospitable to us and cozy as an old quilt for them.",

            "answer_text": "Your question I assume is against an alien species that wants us gone. That answer would depend on several things They don\u2019t care about the planet they just want us gone planet to if needed.They want our planet for themselvesThey are similar to Hitler or the Roman Empire.Or they just want slaves.I\u2019ll answer these backwards But before I do lets look at their ship. In order for them to do any of these they would have had to discover what we haven\u2019t yet. Faster than light travel, or something similar. other wise just the trip would use up all their resource. But a ship traveling that fast would also need to be made very special a meter the size of a base ball at that speed could hit that ship with the force more powerful than a nuclear bomb. Radiation and heat plus other effect that would kill them or us would also need protection from. Thus such a ship that could make that trip would by default withstand every and anything we could use against it. That isn\u2019t because of war but just to survive the trip at such fast speeds. 4. They want slaves: Yes they are more advance than us. And can make robot slaves etc. But dollar for dollar. Even with the cost of space travel living slaves are far cheaper. You have a hundred 20 of them their work is farming for their kind and taking care of them the rest are basic slaves. By an alien race that has no value for human life. One steps out of line 20 die. Robot cost $20,000 human slave $300. Robot maintenance and repairs another $2,000 a year. Human maintenance $100 a year. They don\u2019t care that we have needs above food and shelter. 3. They are another Roman Empire but this time including the stars. They have the power to delete us and show us by deleting a few smaller continent in minutes rather than hours or days. Afterwords giving us the option of joining or die without the ability to defend ourselves. 2. They are far more advance than we are. We love to think the more advance a race is the more understanding and caring it becomes. But looking at us all it leads to is better and stronger ways to kill each other off. A few thousand years ago we killed each other with sticks and stones. As we advanced so did the weapons. Today we can not only kill each other but wipe out the planet. Imagine us tomorrow. We are very advance compared to our ancestor. We\u2019er not better people just more advanced. What makes us think they would be any different. They will still have the needs and wants their ancestors did. Such as greed and power. Just like us yesterday, today and a thousand years from now. Thus if they want our planet and want it without us on it. Their advancement would most likely make it very easy. 1. They wouldn\u2019t do it like Sci-fi does. That would be to expensive. I\u2019ve seen shows where nanobots go into our minds. But think about that if would have to be almost instantaneous on a global level to work and being that small would take several hundred per human. On a planet of over 7.8 billion the cost to the aliens would be overwhelming even if they only cost them $10 each. They also wouldn\u2019t expose themselves to attack when they can do so out of reach from us. until our numbers and weapons are all but almost gone. They could use ore asteroid belt against us destroying us in the millions but stopping short of destroying the planet. Doing that they could wipe out 70% of us without ever getting close enough to even know what they look like. Over all they could wipe us out in just a matter of a few months, and only the last few million people would be able to see what they look like. Making the death rate 7 billion to (0) They don\u2019t care just want us out of the way maybe even the planet to. The planet may be in the way of a bus line or something. They just hate us or they think we would make a great meal. In which case we would all be dead within hours of their arrival. possibility planet and all. Over all any alien race that wanted to do any of the above would do their main attack way out of range for us to fight back. Even if they used the moon as their home base. Us sending rockets or nukes take days to get there easy to shoot down. All they have to do is send cheaply redirect asteroids to earth in numbers that exceed our nuclear defense against them. that would be much cheaper than caring their own weapons of mass destruction. Leaving room for more supplies or troops. We as earthling wouldn\u2019t stand a chance against any race that could make the trip here in faster than light speed. That had the desire to take us over.
