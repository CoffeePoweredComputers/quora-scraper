            "answer_text": "It really depends. Different use cases have different hardware and software needs. I tend to focus on Business PCs for work and Gaming PCs for myself. I'll give you an idea of the hardware costs for a good mid-range PC. Anyway, first and foremost are the processor and the Systemboard. I'm not a fan of Intel for personal reasons and AMD's Ryzen series are all around better performing, and cost less. For something general purpose I'd recommend a 3rd Generation Ryzen 5 3600X, which runs around 175 to 200 dollars. The systemboard is next and you can get a decent one for 75 to 100. After that is the memory, you can do most tasks with 16GB but I recommend 32GB. You can get 16GB from Corsair (which is what I use) for about 75 dollars. So far we're looking at 325\u2013375 dollars. After memory comes an SSD, sure you could use a Mechanical/\u201dSpinning Rust\u201d HDD, but the performance gains you get from an SSD are worth the extra money. I only use Samsung SSDs, you can get a 512 GB 970 Pro for about 170. I recommend the Pro models over the Evo series as the Pros have better controllers and Firmware and a 5 year warranty. All of that brings us to 495. After that you need a GPU. You don't need anything super powerful for this, you would do fine with an RX 560, which runs about 100 dollars. So we're looking at 595. Lastly you need a power supply and a case, the case will run from about 30 to 50 if you don't want something flashy, and the PSU will be about 50, so you're looking at about 695 altogether without an operating system and other software. Considering a comparable AMO desktop from HP or Dell will cost you about twice as much, you save a lot of money by doing it yourself. ",

            "answer_text": "that is a very hard to answer question - it all depends on what range of activities you plan on doing - you also have to consider what you plan on doing and what hardware matches best with what your goals in getting it are. for example just planning to use it for the occasional word document and such with no real heavy load working on it and demanding system performance? probably a couple hundred will do you good enough - heck you can probably buy a used one for around $200-$300 at a small computer shop and then buy a newer OS - which will likely cost you a minimum of another $100 or so. plan on building something you can use to record videos and be a content creator doing regulare uploads to internet platforms like youtube - with any measure of performance and quality - while being able to heavily multi task and do a lot of things at once and keep it all at an acceptable standard of quality? probably a good baseline budget - is around $1500 - $2000 minimum. looking for top tier gaming quality that is so far ahead of what the industry is actually putting out really that it will likely last you the next decade? probably in the range of $3000 minimum for the lower end of the top shelf . see there is a broad spectrum. a small detail concerning everything is - what standard do you want? once you figure that out - you can then start researching parts - once you have those parts your content with figured out - then you can start looking at prices - that will give you an idea for a budget - also a lower mid tier gaming pc can be built for around $1200 - I did it. thing is if you buy pre made there is a rather noticable mark up you will pay for it - this is for assembly and getting everything loaded onto it and all that - labor expenses basically - because they built it for you - your just bringing it home pluging everything in and doing final setups - building it yourself has the benefit of taking that mark up and being able to either save it - or more productively reinvest it into parts to get a better standard - because your doing it all yourself - thus you don\u2019t pay out that mark up for others to do it for you meaning you can decide where to put that money. and the higher grade pre made you buy - the higher that markup generally is - if you think I am kidding - look at the parts in a $4k computer from bestbuy or somewhere - then look up the parts and how much for shipping and everything - chances are you will find that you could build a comparable system for less than you could buy it already made.
