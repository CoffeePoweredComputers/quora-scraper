            "answer_text": "Alexander Graham Bell, is accepted as the inventor. But a resolution of the US House of Representatives in June 2002 claimed that Bell had nefariously acquired and exploited an apparatus, the \u201cteletrophono\u201d, invented by Antonio Meucci long before Bell and Gray. Both Alexander Graham Bell, and Elisha Gray submitted independent patent applications concerning telephones to the patent office in Washington on February 14, 1876. Bell, in Boston at the time, was represented by his lawyers and had no idea that the application had been submitted. Gray\u2019s application arrived at the patent office a few hours before Bell\u2019s, but Bell\u2019s lawyers insisted on paying the application fee immediately; as a result, the heavily burdened office registered Bell\u2019s application first.
