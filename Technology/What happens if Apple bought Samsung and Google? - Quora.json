            "answer_text": "The government would never allow such a merger, and besides, Alphabet isn\u2019t dumb enough to sell Google because it\u2019s their most profitable asset. Even thought Apple has over 1 trillion dollars in revenues and profits, Alphabet also has 1 trillion dollars. Sorry, but Apple will never get their hands on Google! As for Samsung, Apple would need approval from both the US and Korean government and it\u2019s very unlikely that will happen. Samsung is a Korean tech giant and would not let Apple buy them anyways. Although it be cheaper to buy Samsung than Google. It\u2019s very unlikely Apple will buy Google or Samsung ",
