            "answer_text": "Looking back on history and to the present now I imagine a few characteristics of travel. The same - because of all kinds of reasons (development in a country, sustainability, culture etc) much of what we recognise in travel will still exists in parts of the world. Bled Lake in Slovenia doesn\u2019t allow any motorised boats on its waters even though the technology is there.More sustainable - this is already happening on a global scale and in the media. The push to make travel greener like less reliance on planes, electric fuelled cars etc. Expect to see more uptake yetFaster - this is the aim of the game for anyone that has a livelihood from tourist traffic. More people and turnover translate to more profits. So the more efficient we can be transported the greater opportunity there is for income. We already have planes that can fly faster than the speed of sound and magnetically levitating trains with Vactrains in the works (magnetically levitated train in a Vacuum tube to reduce resistance) which are predicting to be faster than commercial plane travel.More Authentic - already there has been a change in habit of staying in a hotel to platforms like AirBnb and couch surfing where tourists can stay with locals at reduced rates and have a genuine personal experience of the country. More travellers are seeking out individual experiences to be personalised and interactive rather than just behind a fence or on a viewing platform.Like fashion - as with the fashion world there are trends happening in travel in destination choices. Instagram and other social media have greatly influenced this ever changing appetite for places and experiences. I expect the thirst for newer, less travelled, unique, pristine will set the trend for where to next.",

            "answer_text": "Who could have predicted that in 2020 the entire world would have to stop travelling? We just don\u2019t know what to expect in the future. Many travel related companies will not survive this pandemic - airlines, hotels, tour companies, cruise lines, bus companies, restaurants. For sure travel will be a lot more expensive when we are allowed to tour again, but there may be some improvements to travel conditions. I am thinking there won\u2019t be jam packed plane loads of tourists flying here and there; seating will hopefully be more comfortable with passengers distancing from others. Another factor might be the decline of the oil and gas industry and the movement to more eco-friendly fuels. How will that affect air, sea and ground transportation? I think at the moment we can\u2019t even guess what travel will be like 20 years from now - or even if we will be able to do it. ",

            "answer_text": "Absolutely unknown. We cannot ever tell what it will be like next season. We are in unknown territory and it all depends on how soon we beat this virus. All we can say is that it is doubtful it will ever return to what it was in 2019. Because travel volumes will be lower, it will likely be more expensive for the individual traveller. As well because each existing plane will not have been used as much expect a lot more planes if 20+ Years if age to be in the air and fewer new ones. ",
