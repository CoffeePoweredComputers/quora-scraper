            "answer_text": "/* All the things which I\u2019 am about to write are purely my perspective. None of these things are intended to hurt anyone , if such a situation occurs I apologise for it in advance.*/ANSWER IS GIVEN FROM A BOY\u2019s VIEW POINT \u2026..  I find myself suitable while writing this answer, due to the fact that I have experienced it recently. What the regular answers to this question never says is the how part. How to get to the realization part ?How to convert it into a proper friendship ? How to end it ? etc\u2026 So, I choose to answer it straight - \u201cAll girls have a primary aim to check the settlement of the possible partner and all the other things bonding , personality , caring nature etc. comes after it\u201d . I\u2019 am not saying having money is all you need. NO. But , having a settled life already or a scope of having it in future is definitely a platform for you build on. Boys on the other hand \u201cPrimarily go for beauty and looks\u201d. Thus , when arrange marriages are actually arranged the Bride family talks about earning and Groom family about looks and height. How to detect is she interested in you or not or is she interested at all ?? Discuss with a friend :- What happens is that when you like someone you tend to slip the hints other person drops to show interest or dis-interest in you. This will basically help you to realize at an early time the current status you are undergoing.Tell your friend to be cruel , open , direct and to the point (introvert and non-diplomatic ). People tend to modify facts just for relationship stake , leaving there no reason for you to take his words seriously . He will speak things what you want to hear and not what you should hear . Thus, you will get a third person perspective to look upon.Don\u2019t decide anything on friend\u2019s opinion :-This point is included only to warn you that maybe your friend gets the perception wrong about a certain aspect. It is your duty to validate evry information before taking a decision.Talk to the girl :-Interact with her to get an idea about her , what she likes and dis-likes. Try to cultivate those aspects if possible. This will tell you the big question Is she your type ? Also you\u2019ll have an idea about the compatibility and does a future exist or not.Continuously but with time gap drop your indications that you like her maybe even praise her and she how she reacts. If her reaction is passive it is a good indication to back-off. Look out for her indications as well. Remember - \u201cAction speaks louder than words\u201d.Ask her out :-Who can tell better about her except herself. Ask her directly, sometimes girls like this kind of straight forward attitude. This the best way to avoid any future stress and will preserve friendship if it was meant to be.How to get over once the damage is done ?It gets very difficult to handle this situation when you share same workspace maybe same school/college/office. With time girls tend to forget and move on and even talk lightly about the time when you had close moments . Boys on the other hand keep track of the girl for a longer time and maybe even stalk her out.Following are the best ways of getting over :- Scientific :- Love according to science is nothing more than oxytoxin released into blood stream that causes relief. It is more or less similar to drugs except for the harm drugs do. But still it is known for a strong addiction.Like any other drug , the key to remove the addictive effect of such addiction is actually a different addiction. Thus, \u2018Go out fishing\u2019 , if you know what I mean. Try to find the bad things about that girl mentallly , NOT a good option to actually go and tell her. Find yourself a new girl.Get Busy :-This is the best way to get her out of your mind. What I did was joined a lot of college society ventures and tried to devote as much time as possible , first purposely and then out of interest.You can chose any other means of getting busy. Maybe a lost hobby , or a new one. Heartbreaks and lost crushes are best inspirations to prosper into a hobby and do wonders just like many people have done.Gyming and Sweat :-It is found that man can focus on a different kind of emotion from other emotion. Thus show anger , work out , get into shape and without any expectations go to the girl later and have a normal talk. \u201cLet her burn into self-regret\u201d. BUT BE CAREFUL if she talks coyingly never settle down .You can start small maybe 5 push-ups. But remember every next day increase the number. Make yourself a time-table.F.R.I.E.N.D.S. :-Be with your friends , never discuss this except to that one close friend. Learn to joke one the situation as your friends will do. After one or two good one liners you will be alright to more jokes therby making yourself comfortabke with the fact that you have moved on.Watch TV series , \u201cEven Ross got Rachel\u201d(FRIENDS). Get into facts or maybe read about different paradoxes. Quora is also a good option.Never Back Down :-Our job is to fish . Just look out for a next opportunity never dis-hearten yourself. Never stop enjoying. Attend more public meetings, go for movie more often , eat good food .You tube is filled with videos to hypnotize your mind . Get into a mindset and follow it sincerely. Never call her again , never message her , never listen to any audio , delete all images . Get that irritating aura out of yourself.What to see , to get mind away from it :- Garam-MasalaKis Kis ko pyaar karunGold DIgger PranksStandupThug Life compilationsAny childhood memory (Tom and Jerry / Ben10)When people show god skillsAT LAST , MAYBE ____ PRON (yes you know you read that right) .Happy Fishing ",
