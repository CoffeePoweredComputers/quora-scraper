I\u2019m not sure how many of which weapons you need to be considered \u201carmed to the teeth\u201d, but the chances of every human being voluntarily disarming are zero. Unless you count a world without humans as \u201ca world without arms\u201d. That\u2019s more likely than mandatory universal disarmament or a universal requirement to be armed. ",
