            "answer_text": "Optical Character Recognition \u2013 commonly known as OCR \u2013 is a technology used for the mechanical or electronic conversion of images (scanned or printed documents, etc.) into machine-encoded text. OCR, widely used as a way of information extraction from passports, invoices, identity documents, bank statements, etc., is a prevalent method for digitizing the image text. The extracted information may be electronically displayed, edited and stored, which can be further used for cognitive computing and machine learning. Simply put, OCR technology is used to read and extract the data from image documents and then further used for pattern recognition. The old-school OCR technology wasn\u2019t fully automated and couldn\u2019t operate properly with manual supervision. The proper functioning required strict rules and templates. Still, these solutions couldn\u2019t process context and had no self-regulating mechanisms; hence, making manual guidance mandatory. The traditional OCR works quite well when it deals with documents whose formats and templates were pre-loaded into the system. However, this comes with a significant problem of flexibility. It means for every type of document a new template model has to be designed and loaded into the system. This is quite time-consuming and costly processes similar to the manual data population. Therefore, artificial intelligence is being incorporated into OCR to come up with a flexible and reliable automated process. ",

            "answer_text": "This video How Does Optical Character Recognition (OCR) Work? would give you an easy-to-understand answer. OCR is a technology that converts printed text into a digital format that is searchable and editable. The variety of different fonts and ways of writing a single character makes this problem hard to solve. Before an OCR algorithm can be chosen, the image must undergo some preprocessing. In this step, the document is straightened, despeckled, and converted from color to a binary image - an image where the only two colors are black and white. The feature detection algorithm identifies a character by analyzing the lines and strokes that make it.  The second approach, pattern recognition, works by identifying the character as a whole. We can identify a line of text by looking for rows of white pixels with rows of black pixels in between. In the same way, we can identify where an individual character begins and ends.  Next, we convert the image of the character into a binary matrix where white pixels are 0s and black pixels are 1s. By using the distance formula, we can find the distance from the center of the matrix to the farthest 1. We then create a circle of that radius and split it up into more granular sections. At this point, the algorithm will compare every single subsection against a database of matrices representing characters with various fonts to find the character it statistically has the most in common with. Doing this for every line and every character makes it easy to bring printed media into the digital world. If you still be confused, this article can help you. How does OCR document scanning work?
