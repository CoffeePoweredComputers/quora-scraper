            "answer_text": "I think PBS, Bloomberg, C-SPAN, Reuters, Associated Press. (Off the top of my head.) Certainly, a lot of sources give unbiased news, but also have opinion pages. The best of them clearly identify opinions and editorials as such. I watch MSNBC a lot, because they cover news almost 24/7, giving them time to get more in depth. You can certainly count on CBS Evening News or NBC Nightly News, for top quality, unbiased reporting, but for a 30 minute broadcast. If you watch MSNBC, they will cover the big stories that you might find elsewhere, and they will even tell you, (exactly quoting,) what WAPO, or NYT, or Fox, and others have reported, because they can. Then they will report \u201cThe Rest Of The Story,\u201d (as Paul Harvey used to say,) as much as they can. And they will cover some stories that it seems no one else is investigating, or at least not yet. They take the time, because they have the time, and they have the resources, to go in depth.TRMS, (The Rachel Maddow Show,) is particularly great for covering important things that are likely to be too complex and complicated, or too, \u201coff the radar,\u201d for others.  Probably the single best thing about MSNBC, along with the excellent hosts and co-hosts, is that when something comes up that you need someone who knows the background and the subjects involved really well, MSNBC has an amazing \u201crolodex\u201d of people who bring expertise, and can clarify and enlighten on the topics. Recently, I have begun watching more CNN, as a result of seeing lots of criticism on QUORA. Normally, I would watch the Sunday shows on CNN, because I think they are really good, especially \u201cFareed Zackaria\u201d and \u201cReliable Sources,\u201d and sometimes, \u201cState Of The Union.\u201d The rest of the week I wouldn\u2019t watch CNN. But I am now made curious, by reading lots of complaints and disparagement directed toward CNN, and I am now tuning in to CNN at random times. What I have seen lately is very good, very fair, very thorough. Since they don\u2019t replay \u201cTRMS\u201d on MSNBC at the time I used to watch it, anymore, and since normally I have already seen, \u201cThe Eleventh Hour,\u201d I will be tuning in to CNN more, especially in the early am. So far, so good. (Thank you, QUORA.) ",

            "answer_text": "That's a very good question. All news and journalists have an opinion or are bias. There are a few journalists who write all the facts, but news and media sources are bias in many ways. There are media outlets such as All Sides, but there still is no such thing as an unbiased news group. During Donald Trump and Hilary Clinton's campaign I was sickened by the negligence of the media because he never truly answered the questions. Yet, they supported his candidacy, now they do not while he is in office. Mainly because of many questionable actions and incomplete \u201cBullethole Bills.\u201d These are bills that leave too many loopholes regarding how it should be perceived. There is always some truth in the media about the issues being said on both sides, but as an individual you need to listen to both sides carefully before making a decision. Regarding the NRA's behaviour toward those students and the media was beyond disrespectful. This is regarding the school shooting; however, they do make a valid argument. Most journalists also have opinions, but you'll want to avoid those cute little magazines they keep out by the cash register. They may seem interesting, but they aren't always true. A grain of salt of truth. The rest is formulated bias. Newspapers have their issues too, but you'll tend to see more facts. I hope this helps you in regard to your question. ",
