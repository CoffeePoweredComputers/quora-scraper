            "answer_text": "I lived in Norwich through the 1990\u2019s. My mortgage was about \u00a3300 per month. I sold the house a few months too early. Its value skyrocketed, thanks to the completion of the M11 and the development near Carrow Road (Norwich City FC ground). So today that mortgage would be \u00a31500 to \u00a32000 per month. I wish I had not have sold it. I did without a car for a little while, but that was not feasible, especially when I did not have access to a company vehicle any more and the bicycle was doable when I was working in Cambridge and using the train. Bicycle at each terminal. So now you are looking at over \u00a3500 per month to run a car, and I liked having a motorcycle also. Then house repairs, utility bills and upkeep, with VAT, you are looking at \u00a3200 per month. Phone \u00a350 per month. Food and beer, over \u00a3500 per month, clothing and sundries, \u00a3100 per month. I am not a natty dresser. And all that is not including my wife !! But at least there is a saving on health insurance, compared to the USA. So I would say easily \u00a33000 per month, and that is not grand luxury. The VAT (value added tax) and the gosoline cost are a killer. That is why I cycled as much as possible and for distances, used a small, but fast motorcycle. My last motorcycle over there was a Suzuki GSX-R 400, which would do 125 mph and about 75 mpg Imperial gallon. That is about 60 mpg US gallon. I had to do that as I was typically working around 100 miles away from home. Sometimes more than that. If I had a small apartment, living in a way cheaper place than London, such as Norfolk, I could probably shave \u00a31000 per month off of that. But I would say for a working, commuting person, it would be very difficult to live for less than \u00a31500 per month. You need at least \u00a32000 per month. That at the moment is about $3000 US. You would be in trouble living on that in a typical city, especially running a car and phaving to pay for your health insurance. ",

            "answer_text": "My opinion probably anything \u00a325k up wards but it all depends on your spending habits ect. I earn just shy of 19k a year I have 3 children so me and my partner on top get what you'd call benefits/social assistance of about \u00a31200 a month because of my low income. Our household would be classed as in poverty but we're not. We've got contracts phone we've got subscription TV services, new electrical items and a full fridge.i have a car on finance and two motorbikes. The kids never want for anything. To be honest it amazes me when people who earn more sit there and complain about lack of money. What are you doing. I know people that claim government assistance they're not entitled to they never have money in the bank yeh they're probably taking another \u00a3600 a month income then we are. They don't have a car or flashy stuff were does that go ? So yeh your wage is very dependent on management. I don't think it's too expensive to live in the UK and if you use common sense you can live comfortably on a smaller wage . So realistically a good salary depends on your circumstances unfortunately we're I live house prices are still reasonably high due to the fact were in a nice part of Suffolk and not that far from London . Renting is also extortionate at anywhere between \u00a3800-\u00a31200+ for a three bed house. Were lucky and again have a council house so rent is very reasonable but if your on a low income and have a higher rent in certain circumstances the government will give you may state assistance to balance that out. It's all common sense really if it only two of you in house why are you renting 3 bed ? If you have children and are working then you can apply for state help to counter act the lower income. Some people may see get a better paid job but someone has gotta do it we can't all earn millions. I have a skilled job in a very small industry but still earn a crap wage even though it's would be alot harder to find the skill to replace me but I like my job so you also have to take into it your mental well-being.

            "answer_text": "I live in Portsmouth, on the South Coast I imagine up the North of England it's drastically cheaper but here is what we pay. A four bedroom home, cable, WiFi, landline, all utilities, car, car insurance, council tax, groceries, four mobile phones, my family of 6 costs about \u00a31500 per month tops due to fluctuations, I could cut my budget to about \u00a31,300 if necessary. This is for an immigrant family with no recourse to public funds, so I find it quite reasonable. For a British citizen receiving child benefit it's probably much better. You would want to earn at least \u00a31,000 more a month to have disposable income, and enjoy life a bit, especially with lots of kids. I don't have much expectations to live a lavish lifestyle, I just want to pay my bills and enjoy a drive, a nice meal or a holiday. My work is just above minimum wage and it can cover almost all my monthly bills alone. So I think if you are a healthy person and able to get a basic job you can live. Don't be fooled by answers of people who are used to being rich they make it sound like living as a single person on \u00a31,000 a month means begging for change and starving. My city has studios for \u00a3350 per month, if you earn minimum wage and get a \u00a360 monthly bus pass you are pretty much almost \u00a3800 to spend on yourself for the rest of the month\u2026.thats pretty good. However if in outer london, a two bed flat could cost you \u00a31400 per month, plus \u00a3800 for food, electricity, internet, gas, water, council tax, mobile line for a couple only. excluding transport which could vary between \u00a360 per month to \u00a3300 per month per person that depends where you want to commute and what transportation to use. So if to budget your net and not gross income should be \u00a32600 per month minimum if both working and no cash to spend on entertainment or clothing or holidays or leisure. ",

            "answer_text": "I\u2019m going to talk about take home salary. This assumes you are living in a major city, and are a young person. \u00a31000 - you live in a shared house, and shop at budget supermarkets. You use public transport (no car) and you have a couple of nights a month socialising. It\u2019s not much fun, but it\u2019s doable. (Salary of \u00a313,000) \u00a31500 per month. You live in a shared house. You have your own cheap second hand car. Your social life is ok, you do stuff most weekends. You will be able to have a couple of cheap holidays in UK/Europe a year. (Salary of \u00a320,000) \u00a32000 per month. You can either rent your own flat and and live the same as the \u00a31500 per month person or keep living in a shared house and live a nice life with lots of luxuries. Or be sensible and save \u00a3500 a month. (salary of \u00a330,000) \u00a32500 per month. You\u2019re starting to make enough money that you might be able to get a mortgage and buy some shitty flat if your parents have \u00a350k lying around to give you as a deposit. If you\u2019re stupid, you can probably afford to finance a brand new car, or go on some outrageous holidays to make your Instagram followers jealous. This is where life starts to actually be quite fun. (salary of \u00a338,000) \u00a33000 per month. You can no now actually serisouly look into buying a flat and maybe even saving the deposit yourself over a few years. You can easily rent your own place, and have a very nice lifestyle, go on some nice holidays, or have a nice new car (Mercedes, BMW etc.) Whatever luxuries you like you can probably have if you don\u2019t go crazy. (Salary of \u00a348,000) Beyond this, not a lot changes. You either make sensible investments with the rest or live a playboy lifestyle. If you want to buy an actual house in the UK (not a flat), and don\u2019t have rich parents, you will need to earn significantly more than this, or have a partner with a good salary as well. The UK is a very expensive place to live, with good quality accommodation being hideously expensive these days. Down south, don\u2019t expect to buy much of a house for less than \u00a3400,000 ($500,000USD). A good cheap flat can be had for around \u00a3200,000 ($250,000USD) ",

            "answer_text": "Depends on what you understand as a good salary. Is it one that provides all of your basic needs such as shelter, sustenance and energy needs? Do you mean one which provides for luxuries such as eating out at expensive restautants, international holidays, large luxury cars, expensive jewellery, yachts plus excess for investments etc. Or is it one which provides the maximum financial rewards which are well above those needs and desires. Of course it also depends on the cost of living when making comparisons you live in a high cost of living area such as the USA or a low cost one such as Costa Rica. In the UK an income of \u00a325,000 ($32000) will suffice for basic needs and provide a little extra, a salary of $50000 ($64000) will provide for a very comfortable life, house ownership and a level of luxuries. Above these levels the sky is the limit. My wife is a self employed contractor and earns around \u00a3108,000 - \u00a3110,000 ($140,000 -$150,000 approx) which allows us a certain amout of luxury. These figures ar all PA of course. My pension is around \u00a32,000 ($32,000) which would pay all of our bills and living expenses but little luxury if we had to depend upon it. But remember our cost of living overall is much less than the UK despite what the gainsayers will have you believe. Quote: By that broad measure, the cost of living in the U.K. is 6.51% lower than the cost of living in the United States. Rent overall is about 27% lower in the U.K. (NOTE: I would include rent in the overall cost of living as shelter is an important basic need. and average house prices are cheaper in the UK than the US.) Is it Cheaper to Live in the U.K. Than in the U.S.? This is an overall comparison taking the most expensive cities together with the poorest in both countries. ",

Plenty of folk, living n the streets or moving from place to place, living in caravans/mobile homes, with no fixed abode, making money where and when they can, not paying tax, since they are below the threshold\u2026 and remember there is a great deal of truth in the saying \u201cMoney doesn\u2019t bring you happiness\u201d.. I have met many very happy, smiling folk, from all walks of life, in many different countries and the happiest are those with very little in the way of material goods.. Food, clean water, good health and a roof over their head. To live anywhere, you do not need a house with a certain number or rooms, you do not need al the fancy tech and crap that the majority of the civilised world hankers after\u2026 That is not what I call LIVING, that is called keeping up with the Jones's. To live anywhere, you need only the basics. A roof over you head, be it a tent, caravan, shed, flat, house, barn whatever, a place to keep you out of the elements, where you can keep warm and where you are much safer than laying on the pavement or a park bench. Good health, mostly down to you to keep yourself in good condition, but when you do get sick or need medical attention, the UK is one of the best countries for you, as we have the NHS. Nobody gets turned away, as they do in the States, simply because they don\u2019t have the money Food and clean water, obviously every single person alive today, needs to have both of these.. Yes there are many that don\u2019t have access to one or the other or sometimes both Clothing.. Not absolutely necessary, depending on where you want to live, but in the UK, if you want to go out and not get arrested for indecent exposure, then clothing would be a good idea. Everything else, is called material or in my book, immaterial if you simply want to live. So the answer is, that there is no set number, no set amount, that you need to live in the UK, until you know hoe and where you want to live.. Yes the government has a minimum wage.. and there are plenty of materialistic folk, who would say that is not enough, but they have been raised in a society that simply want more and more, for less and less.

            "answer_text": "It depends on where you live. However I can give you reference of where I lived and you can compare with where you want to live using this website Cost of Living. Also this answer assumes you are an immigrant. I lived in Northampton, Northamptonshire and found upwards of 60K is a decent salary especially for an immigrant. 80K would be nice. Now the mean and median salaries in Northampton are much lower but as an immigrant, you have to build everything from scratch and that costs money. You can find mean and median salaries here at Northamptonshire Average salary, household income. Another factor to consider is age. You will need to catch up on the savings that otherwise you would have built if you started working soon after uni. This plays a role on, by when you can afford a deposit on a house etc. Breakdown of some the basic expenses: Rent for a 2 bed flat: 800 - 1000 Car: You can get a decent car for about 4K-6K Groceries : Roughly 250 - 400 for a 2\u20133 member household. Car Insurance: This is a real stinger for new drivers. About 1800 - 3000 County Tax: If I remember correctly, it was about 80 per month Utilities : Roughly 300 for water, electricity and internet Phone: 20\u201330 per month Entertainment: 100 - infinity :). Other expenses to consider are petrol, shopping, eating out etc. Hope this helps. Cheers! ",

I have had ex students going on Starting salaries of over 50k straight out of uni so it\u2019s really not an easy answer to give but I assume that on anything over 30\u201335k you can live a settled, grown up, not scared of losing your job tomorrow and unable to eat kind of pretty happily in the UK (if not in London Itself). it\u2019s all about industries though, I\u2019ve spent a decade managing restaurants etc before going back to uni and in to teaching. As a General Manager of a restaurant business in a trendy part of London with up to 30 staff and 4million turnover a year i was making 30k-ish\u2026.the same as a teacher with 3 years under their belt.

Me and said partner have been lucky enough to have families that have helped us with the deposit on a house, we\u2019re moving an hour away from my work so that we can afford to buy a 3 bed house for \u00a3295,000- which for where we are is a great price. Our mortgage payments will be around \u00a3750 a month then onwards. If you can afford to put a deposit down, most places are affordable.

            "answer_text": "This kind of question seems like it could benefit from as many answers as possible, so I'll just answer you my story and it may help. The past four years I was a PhD student living in Edinburgh. I was earning a 'living allowance' of 14,000 per year, equalling about 1,200 per month, tax free. Rent is the biggest outgoing. Edinburgh is not a cheap city, especially for rent, but by shopping around I paid, at different times, 345 or 260 per month, and I lived in very 'trendy' places in the old town near the city center. Living further out you\u2019d get these prices more easily. I started my four years with -\u00a3500. When I finished I had \u00a318,000 saved. I went on one month long holiday to south East Asia, several ski trips, and I never said no to a beer. Basically, I lived a life that was frugal, but always enjoyable and never sacrificed my leisure spending. I was living alone and only had myself to support, but you can see that, even with a modest wage, that I would guess is equivalent to a full time minimum wage job, I had a lot of disposable income. Whenever I reflect on this, I feel immensely lucky to live in the country that I do :) ",

            "answer_text": "The cost of living varies significantly across the UK, largely driven by differences in property prices. As a guideline, based on work by a major poverty charity, a single person needs a minimum of around \u00a3850/month after tax excluding rent to have what most British people would consider a decent basic life. That includes some social activities, food, transport, clothing, and so on. You would not save any money, or travel internationally! You would clearly need to add rent to that to get the total after tax income required. You can use the Minimum Income Calculator to give you an estimate of an absolute floor, but be aware that rental costs can be very much higher if you live near London, and also bear in mind that you may not be eligible for some of the benefits the calculator assumes if you are not a current resident. The tool also allows you to identify the likely costs of different family sizes. I suggest that you identify the rental costs of wherever you are considering living, and work out a first stab at a budget based on that tool. ",

I live about half an hour drive outside London and here you can live comfortable for about 25k a year, but most people earning that much will not own their own house, but you can rent a decent place. Everyone has a different idea of what a good salary is for me anything 25k plus is good, for this I can afford nice flat, nice food, holidays. For others would have to 40k plus to be considered a good salary. ",

That\u2019s assuming you are living alone and not running a car and are clear of debt. That is primarily in working class areas, affluent boroughs the rent will go up considerably. I know people who live alone only taking home a grand, but they struggle and live in crap apartments in poor areas. If you want to live in a major City Centre apartment such as Manchester you\u2019ll need another \u00a3300 on top, as rent is an extra \u00a3200 - \u00a3300 a month than in the suburbs or smaller town centres. If you have to ask, you probably can\u2019t afford London and unless you are a very high earner its impossible to live there on your own. I\u2019ve made it sound depressing but that is the absolute minimum to live. If you flat share or have a partner you\u2019ll have a much better quality of life. ",

Because of the way that people are taxed in the UK, earning above \u00a3100K means you pay a lot of tax. ",
