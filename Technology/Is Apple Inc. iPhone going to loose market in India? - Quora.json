            "answer_text": "According to Apple CEO Tim Cook sales in many developing countries including in India is decreasing because of three main reasons\u2026  First of all people having iPhones are not upgrading to the latest versions of the iPhones which is affecting its sells in developing countries.   Second is the foreign exchange value which has increased too much which is finally increasing the value of dollar in comparison to the local currencies of the developing countries.  Third reason is there battery replacement programme which made it inexpensive and efficient to replace the battery and hold onto their existing iPhones a bit longer he explained.  But besides these reasons one more reason that Apple's CEO would not like to mention it is that from Apple's older iPhone let us take for example iPhone SE to iPhone XS max there is no major update in iphones if we leave face unlock, rather than increasing display size. Now people want some major updates in iPhone which encourage them to buy newer iphones. Apple should take this seriously otherwise sales worldwide will fall steeply and they can do nothing rather than watch . Updates upto 6 April 2019 It seems that company has finally decided to expand it's market in South East Asia ( in other words Indian market ) because company has initiated its iPhone 7 assembling in India with Taiwanese supplier Wistron also Apple is going to start manufacturing of X series iPhones in trial with Foxconn Technology Group and if it works than company is all set for setting it's manufacturing plant in Chennai and Bangalore.  For more information you can visit[1] for more details. Finally it seems that company is focusing on 3 rd biggest smartphone market after taking lessons from previous incidents. Updates upto 13 Aug 2019 So now Apple has terminated the selling of entry level iPhone models such as iPhone SE, iPhone 6/6 Plus and iPhone 6s/6s Plus in India to maximize its profits. We are only a month away from launch of new iPhone 11 but rumours are that it will not be 5G enabled. So if again company price its iPhone appprox 1 lakh than I think no one is going to buy this time because OnePlus has already launched its OnePlus 7 which is cost effective with great features. Updates upto 21 Oct 2019 As of now I hope you all have seen new iPhones. Available in three models iPhone 11($699) , iPhone 11 Pro($999), iPhone 11 Pro Max($1099). But it will get more costly after import taxes will be imposed by respective country.  Most awaited Features: \u2022 Fast Charging Many iPhone users are crying for this because Android at very cheaper rate comes with fast charging. Now since all three models support fast charging but only 11 pro and pro max comes with fast charger. iPhone 11 supports fast charging but you need to purchase it from Apple store. \u2022 Battery backup For long time Android smartphones are beating iPhones when compared with battery backup. But now this will not happen anymore. iphone 11 pro max which comes with approx. 4000mah battery has successfully beaten Android smartphones makers mainly Samsung & Huawei. Their top notch smartphones having battery size of approx. 4500mah failed to last longer in comparison to pro max battery by almost 30 min. Battery Drain test : [2] iPhone+Huawei+Samsung \u2022 Camera iPhones have a major problem in camera segment is that the night mode but now those are things of past. Now iPhone 11 series comes with night mode which gets enable automatically when you are in dark. This year iphone pro and pro max launched with wide & ultra wide lens and also with telephoto lens which enchances photography to the whole new level. Front facing camera(12 MP) supports 4K video recording.  Minus Point : We all expected that this year's iphone will be 5G compatible but still these expensive iphones are incompatible with 5G. For more features: iPhone 11[3] iPhone 11 pro & iPhone 11 pro max[4] Company's Feature Strategy: According to Apple their is no loss to company in not launching 5G incompatible iphones because 5G is still in testing phase and needs time to be fully available to citizens across globe, their are only very few operators those who provide 5G network. Therefore nothing to worry about it. Also it is clear that 2020 iphones will be 5G compatible. Apple has already bought Intel's modem development unit in order to develop 5G modems which will be fit into the iphones and hence they are working towards removing dependancy on Qualcomm.  Also this year Apple shows some bold decisions to not to increase prices of iPhones but to increase profit of company by selling services to customers like TV+ and Arcade.  For more details: Apple Arcade [5] Apple tv+[6] According to rumors 2020 iPhones will have no Notch. That's a big news for iphone lovers. Also company is seemed to be planning to launch updated model of iPhone SE in 2020. Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo has predicted that Apple will launch at least one iPhone with very small notch.

            "answer_text": "The iPhone is the major Apple product that seems to be failing in India. Its projected sales for 2018 showed a significant fall (in terms of unit sales).  The main reasons for the failure of iPhone in India are: Price: This is the main reason. According to Conde Nast Traveller, iPhone X prices in India range from Rs 99,900\u2014Rs 1,09,900, where as in the US, they range from $999 (Rs 71,800)\u2014$1,349 (Rs 97,000). The prices in India are higher due to the high import duties levied by the government (protectionist policies) and the involvement of a number of middlemen as the phones are sold through third party retailers. Being a developing country, even for middle class Indians, iPhones are extremely expensive and they cannot afford them. With a per capita income of INR 1,13,000, majority of Indians can certainly not even think of buying an iPhone. They might be common in Western countries, but in India its more of a status symbol.Is it Worth the Money? : A lot of people believe that Apple has stopped innovating. Many are disappointed with iPhone X as it doesn\u2019t offer something that is worth so much money. A lot of other smartphone brands offer a good value for money. For example, under Rs 20,000 one can get a Xiaomi phone that takes beautiful and sharp images. OnePlus and Xiaomi provide phones with great value for money at a cost that is a fraction of that of iPhone X. When one can get great functionality for lower costs, then why would one bother about Apple?No Dual SIM Support: After spending so much money on an iPhone, you won't have dual SIM facility! A lot of people prefer having such a facility because the strength of mobile networks keep fluctuating from one place to another. A particular SIM\u2019s network may be strong in a particular area but might deteriorate in some other place. Dual SIM facility offers a LOT of flexibility, including having different SIMs for calls and data.Apps and Compatibility: Apple Maps doesn\u2019t work well at all in India. It has sparse data about the routes, and provides poor navigation facility. Also, the AI assistant provided by Google works better than that if iPhone (especially struggles to recognise accent). Sending files from an iPhone to a non-iPhone and vice versa is a headache.",
