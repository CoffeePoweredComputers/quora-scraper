            "answer_text": "I\u2019ve worked at a dozen companies in my career and Microchip is by far the most successful, having had 109 consecutive quarters of profitability and grown from a $200M company when I joined in 2010 to more than $4B eight years later. The recent acquisition of Microsemi is certain to nearly double that in the near future. In addition, Microchip has a great culture and employees who all get along and strive to continually learn, grow, reduce costs and increase profits. Finally, Microchip has an outstanding management team. ",

            "answer_text": "Hi, I have worked at MCHP for nearly one year. This is new environment for me since i\u2019ve just graduated from college. To me, I've studied a lot from working here, by an open and so friendly environment. I faced lots of issues during my projects because I haven't had many experience from the beginning. So I asked other members in my team for guides. They helped me effectively by giving me helpful guides and let me solve problems by myself. Then they also showed me some better ways. Moreover, in meeting with other teams, or allhand meetings, for technical issues or others, open discussion is always. ",
