            "answer_text": "It\u2019s fairly simple (in theory): If the temperature is above the cooling set-point, turn the cooler on.If the temperature is below the heating set-point, turn the heater on.There are complexities such as minimum run-time, \u201canti-cycling\u201d timers, de-icing, etc, but the above two points summarise the main functions. The heating set-point should be maintained at least a degree or two (or more) below the cooling set-point, so the unit doesn\u2019t cycle madly between the two modes. ",
