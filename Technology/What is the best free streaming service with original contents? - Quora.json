            "answer_text": "There are several streaming services available. Some services are free, while others have free trials. It depends on what you want to watch. If you like cartoons, Crunchyroll and Funimation offer free streaming of their shows. You just have to watch the advertisements. Netflix has a one-week free trial. Just make sure to cancel your subscription before the trial period ends.  If you like horror movies, you might want to give Shudder a try. They have a one week free trial of their service. Hulu, Sling TV, and DC Universe also have one-week free trial deals. CBS All Access usually offers a one-week trial. There are also plenty of free streaming services out there if you don't want to use the free trials: BYUtv, Tubi TV, Pluto TV, Airy TV, iQIYI, Crackle, Xumo, and many more. Of these, I only used BYUtv and Pluto TV. ",
