            "answer_text": "Improved communication making it possible to run businesses or trade with other businesses on the other side of the world. Or even deliver online goods and servicesCheaper transportationBefore modern technology, the only way to communicate with people far away was to send a letter by sea or maybe wagon if there was a land route. The telegraph made it easier to communicate overland; then came the telephone and eventually underwater cables. You could pick up the phone in Europe and talk, in real time, with the Americas, Asia, or Oz/NZ. Fax machines made it possible to exchange documents. Then, with the internet we had virtually zero-cost messaging (and voice). And organizations could exchange photos and technical drawings for marketing and engineering. The huge advance other than communication was the development of containerships. Using standard sized locked boxes that can be loaded and unloaded quickly (the time-consuming tasks of dealing with odd-shaped items and the packing material to prevent damage in transit moved from the ship to the sender and the buyer, allowing the ship to spend less time in port and thus make more voyages). And of course pilferage was dramatically reduced. ",

            "answer_text": "Within only the last ten years, one person can write a software application and deploy it to the cloud where, with appropriate marketing or placement (e.g., App Store). it can reach a global audience. The cloud enables the application to scale on demand so the developer only incurs expenses relative to the demand for the application. The ability to do this has enabled companies like Uber, Netflix, Amazon, TripAdvisor, etc., to reach a global audience very quickly and dominate or at least reach very high market saturation. Additionally, the extensive analytics provided by cloud services allow data mining of click-through rates, page popularity, audience demographics, to continuously improve efficiency of delivery and reach a larger global audience.
