            "answer_text": "Display advertising has and always will be ad units consisting of text+image. The standards around the creative format are changing and many more units are emerging beyond the familiar banner ads for desktop and mobile. Coupled with better targeting and placement, display advertising is evolving to be more friendly to consumers, advertisers, and publishers.  OverviewDisplay advertising will be much more programmatic in the future. Already, much of display ad space is bought/sold programmatically by automated bidders/exchanges. This is because there is just much and more inventory being added. However, the next stage will be programmatic creatives -- ads designed by machine. Programmatic real time buying has unlocked a lot of new inventory/capabilities but people now need to fill it with the appropriate style ads which is pretty hard to scale by hand. With so many new formats and placements, everything has to be more automated. Creatives: Responsive Web Design Display AdsPublishers have begun moving towards responsive web design for websites to work on desktop and mobile devices. As a result, the ad units filing spaces between editorial content are changing. Here are good examples from Quartz and SAY Media:     Creatives: Native Display Ad UnitsNative advertising is emerging as a hot trend whereby publishers and advertisers customize ads to look more like their surroundings on the webpage rather than just more beautifully integrate/place it. Facebook pioneered this type of non-standard display. LinkedIn, Foursquare, Twitter, and Yahoo are all following with their own paid placement of text+image units. You can expect these formats to get more common over time for publishers that reach a certain scale.   Creatives: Search Display Ad UnitsEven search ads are becoming more like display. Arguably, search is purely form of native display ad units since you are using a search engine to find something and you're just getting a richer content version of the search results.   Targeting: Search RetargetingGoogle, eBay, Yahoo and Amazon are all major players just beginning to play with targeting data built around what keywords consumers searched for. So you'll soon be able to augment your search advertising or listing advertising by showing the same audience your ad elsewhere on the web. The performance nature (or direct response aspect) of display will certainly get a huge boast from this new capability. Targeting: Custom AudiencesFacebook, LiveRamp, and anyone in re-targeting have already begun offering the ability to reach very specific customers. We're going from just anonymous cookies of people who may have visited your site to much more granular 1:1 targeting where you can upload your CRM or customer list and find matching users in other ad inventory systems. Once you match them, you can serve a highly customized ad to that user group.  tl;dr SummaryExpect display ads to look better and more relevant to you. Also expect more of the work will be done by machines which design ads and buy ads automatically as more display inventory gets created and harder to manage manually. ",

            "answer_text": "The future of display advertising is a reflection of today\u2019s industry: current trends will gradually transform into tomorrow\u2019s standards. Whether you\u2019re a developer advertising an app, a website owner monetizing your site, or an advertiser promoting a product, studying the state of today\u2019s advertising market will help prepare you for tomorrow\u2019s changes.  Google\u2019s VP of display advertising, who is well worth hearing in his own right. Here are the highlights of what they had to say: Advertising is the lifeblood of the Internet, she says. But it\u2019s undergoing tremendous change. We need to move as fast as the users. So I spend a lot of time at Google thinking about the future of advertising and how we\u2019re going to reinvent it. The first thing we do is think about users and where they\u2019re going. The market is shifting toward the leading autonomous marketing platforms. Spending on digital display advertising in the US will total $27.05 billion in 2015 and Twitter will surpass Yahoo in total U.S. digital display ad revenues for the first time this year. Facebook and Twitter will take 33 percent share of US digital display market by 2017, according to new figures from eMarketer. Have a look at Top 10 Mistakes You Should Never Do In Display Advertising in the future The Display Ads of Tomorrow Tomorrow\u2019s display ads will be customer-focused, and, as mentioned, highly personalized. There are many factors that will affect the evolution and the future of display advertising: Apps will continue to take more time away from the web \u2013 The world wide web is losing ground to apps. Customers, on average, spend an average of 30 hours per month using apps, according to a Nielsen study. This increase in app market share is paralleled by a decrease in desktop web surfing, as well as mobile web surfing.The implication, of course, is that display advertising \u2013 which is continuing to grow \u2013 will earn more money in apps than it will on the web. New technology will increase advertising\u2019s capabilities \u2013 Bandwidth usage is growing every month, and will only continue to increase over time. The more that people use streaming video on wireless devices and wearable technology, the more we\u2019ll see display ads transforming into interactive ads, video ads, and so on. New customer data will enhance content value, advertising value, and marketing precision \u2013 The Internet of Things and its predecessor, wearable technology, are bringing with them vast troves of customer data. This data will be used to construct the detailed customer profiles that will allow advertisers to personalize their marketing campaigns on mass scales.Deeper insight into customer psychology and the needs of individuals will also enhance the quality and precision of app content, web content, and advertising content. This suggests that the field will become highly competitive and even more complex than it is today. The future of display advertising will continue to evolve from its present state. With the continued evolution of technology, we\u2019ll see algorithms and automation drive the evolution of display advertising and the data that fuels it. But the future of display advertising isn\u2019t entirely automated: human creativity and strategic know-how will continue to pilot the most successful advertising networks.

The not-so-strategic strategy behind those tiresome display ads? Blasting a brand\u2019s message anywhere and everywhere to see what would happen. While some marketers still stand behind what Brad Bender of Google calls the \u201cblast your story everywhere and see what happens philosophy,\u201d we\u2019re fans of things like intent-based audiences to get the right message to the right people at the right time on every platform. It\u2019s all a part of creating better, personally relevant experiences. We think these three takeaways from Bender\u2019s 15 years at Google in this Marketing Land article are a great indication of what\u2019s to come in display advertising. Automate and Scale Delivering personally relevant ad experiences at the right moment increases the success of an ad. However, when you have hundreds or even thousands of customer segments, delivering those experiences each time can be quite time consuming.

Innovate Google is no stranger to developing innovative solutions and products, like their ad format called conversational display ads.
