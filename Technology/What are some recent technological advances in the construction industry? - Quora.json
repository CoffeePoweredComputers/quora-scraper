            "answer_text": "There has been momentum building up recently in the construction industry regarding technological advances and there is tremendous opportunities coming up in the next 20 years. Being one of the biggest sector of the global economy and coming from so far behind, most of the build environment is still being constructed the same way then 100 years ago, there is lot of potential for improvement. Here is a list of a few technologies that have been coming forward lately : BIM ( Building information modeling ) has been one of the biggest change in the last 15 years. By creating a 3d model of the whole building and putting a maximum of information in it, you get a very practical tool for all stakeholders in the building process. It\u2019s getting more and more mainstream but, still haven\u2019t realized its full potential.Prefabrication : Even though it\u2019s not a technology per se, it is a serious solution to productivity improvement on a job site. There is a few companies that have been pushing the limits lately, BSB on the high rise side and Sekisui heim on the single family house side are putting a lots of advanced manufacturing tech in practice.3D printing : This is probably one of the most talked about technology in this sector even though its jobsite use have been limited so far. MX3D has been doing some great progress towards buildings a bridge with their technology, also Winsun in China has a giant 3D printer for concrete but, its main use its to prefabricate panels to be assembled traditionaly.Smart tracking : Basically knowing where things are and their status. It has been used on material via RFID tags and scanner at strategic locations. You can have it on all kinds of equipment, excavator, dump truck, etc., sky is the limit for this application, from knowing rpm and exact location of assets to maintenance schedule and breakdown. Last but not least, manpower, some big compagnies are now using wi-fi enabled tracking device to know in real time where their workers are and how much time do they spend in that location also, can be used to find the personnel in case of emergency.3D scan : Whether its a point cloud that you can import in your computer program or an actual 3d rendering for simulations purposes, this is getting more and more popular. Survey material equipment manufacturer like Leica, Faro and Trimble are all producing systems to different level of accuracy. The most accurate one will give you a scan of any indoor location to degree a precision unimaginable a few years ago. This make some interesting combination with the 3d model of the building.This is a brief summary of the technologies in application at the moment, there is a lot more out there and still more coming to give a refresher to our favorite industry.

            "answer_text": "Technology has made its way into every aspect of our lives, be it personal or professional. The gravity of penetration is such enormous that it has become applicable in the least technical sector as well. It is the construction industry. These rapid advancements have made it easier and safer for almost everyone who is related to this field.  3D Printing and Robotics From healthcare to manufacturing, robots can help workers in almost every field. With the help of 3D printers, the robot makers can now design and print their own parts and shells. All this can be done using affordable design tools. Just a few years ago, these tools didn\u2019t exist.  More Robust Machining Equipment When talking about construction, one can simply not ignore drilling. It is, in fact, one of the most essential parts of the industry. The construction sites are not always big, and when such is the case, it becomes difficult for machines to reach the hidden yet crucial points.But thanks to the technological advancements that there now exist limited access drill rigs, which can reach every place on any construction site.  Drones These unmanned aerial vehicles are rapidly gaining the popularity in the construction field. Contractors have been using this super sophisticated flying equipment to survey the land. By using drones, they are able to save quite a lot of time and money, and the efficiency is at its all-time high as well.By capturing all the necessary data into its system, a drone reduces the chances of error. Human eyes can miss something, but the cameras on drones pick up even the slightest details from the worksite.  Predictive Analysis  There are two types of construction companies; successful and struggling. One major difference between these two is the risk management. Predictive analytics help companies manage their risk effectively. ",
