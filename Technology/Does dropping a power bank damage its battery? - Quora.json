            "answer_text": "It really depends on the powerbank\u2019s design and quality of manufacture \u2014 any preexisting faults and/or factory defects may be exacerbated by the drop (this includes the cell\u2019s manufacture defects, if any). Still, it shouldn\u2019t unless it\u2019s a considerable fall (enough force to give quite a rattle to the things inside), or you\u2019re particularly unlucky in that instance. There are so many possible factors, that the best arbiter is direct experience: if you dropped it and it stopped working, the drop damaged something inside. However, it\u2019s rather unlikely that it\u2019s the battery \u2014 I would sooner wager the electronics board, or a broken connection outright (all things a friendly soldering iron owner can probably fix for you).

            "answer_text": "No, and yes. Dropping does not damage anything. It is the physical shock of the sudden stop at the end of the fall that does the damage. The amount of damage, if any, depends on the rate of change of velocity, the angle of the force, and the design of the object dropped. There are so many factors involved that an accurate yes or no statement is impossible. ",
