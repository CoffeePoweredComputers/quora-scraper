            "answer_text": "As per a report by market research firm Strategy Analytics, though Samsung would begin 2020 as the leader in 5G smartphone, Apple would take the lead in the 5G race by the end of next year. The report says that the South Korean tech giant would rely majorly on the cheaper Galaxy A90G before launching the 5G versions of Galaxy S11, S11+ and S11e. With all these 5G devices, Samsung 5G devices are expected to constitute 40 percent of the total 5G smartphone sales during the first three months of 2020. The next company to dominate would be Huawei, with both cheaper and flagship 5G variants of smartphones. The forecast predicts that the Samsung rival would start eating into the 5G smartphone sales through the April-June quarter. Huawei is expected to launch the Huawei P40 and P40 Pro flagships with 5G support to counter the Galaxy S11 series by Samsung. Towards the end of the year, however, there may be a major change as both Samsung and Huawei will be toppled by Apple with the 5G-ready iPhone 12 lineup of the iPhone 12, iPhone 12 Pro and iPhone 12 Pro Max. The predictions say that the Cupertino-based tech giant would account for 40% of all the 5G smartphone sales during the third quarter and almost 50% during the last quarter of 2020. Might just be the case of slow and steady wins the race. ",
