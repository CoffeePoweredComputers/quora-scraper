            "answer_text": "I would not recommend it. First of all dish soap and laundry detergents contain different chemicals. Dish soap produces far too many suds for use in a washing machine and could cause the machine to overflow and will not get your clothes clean. Dish soap is designed to cut through kitchen grease.Laundry soap produces less suds so will not ruin your washing machine or clog your drains and is chemically designed to dissolve soil in fabrics.The cost of dish detergent and laundry detergent are close enough so there should be no reason to use dish soap for your laundry - so why would you even consider doing this?If budget is an issue for you, I buy most of my laundry detergent and other laundry products at Walgreen\u2019s where they always have some brand of detergent on sale, and I buy whatever brand happens to be on sale, and my clothes always gets clean.If you have just a couple items to hand wash in the sink (like socks or underwear) it would probably be OK and not cause any permanent damage to your clothes or your plumbing, but you shouldn\u2019t make a habit of it.",

            "answer_text": "It is okay to use dish soap instead of laundry detergent in the washer. Dish soap can cost less and clean your clothes almost as well as laundry detergent. However, depending on the type of washer you have, it could cause a few problems. If it\u2019s a top loader, a small amount of dish soap won\u2019t be terrible, but with a front loader, I would wait till you\u2019ve had time to get the proper detergent. The reasons for this is because laundry detergent has specific ingredients that are meant to clean clothes. For example, there are chemicals in detergent that level the PH of water as well as other ingredients to be soft and gentle on clothing. It also has other ingredients which level the soap suds, a factor that dish soap does not have. Furthermore, keep this in mind when trying to substitute laundry detergents for other soaps. For the best outcome on clothing, use laundry detergent. ",
