            "answer_text": "Hi.. If you have a smart Antenna\u2026 you got it made..or is it to install the antenna smartly.. I get those 2 mixed up a lot\u2026 BUT, a smart TV, has some software and some app\u2019s you can program and use to make life simple for you. if you can get a signal over the antenna, your TV should be able to lock on and show you what it sees. Just select something (remote input selection) that says antenna or TV input, might even say something like \u201cAnalog\u201d \u2026which is kinda old school, signals over the air are all digital now.. Maybe a look at the Amazon web, to see the various antennas on the market. The page should give specs on how it work\u2026.Good Luck\u2026 Ya know, this is old school technology\u2026But if you pick up \u201cI Love Lucy\u201d and it looks way clear\u2026everything is working fine\u2026 Good Luck Dave ",

            "answer_text": "\u201cSmart TV\u201d means one that streams content over the internet. An antenna tunes in to content broadcast on radio waves. Your smart TV doesn\u2019t ONLY get content over the internet. It can also get content from your blu-ray player, your DVR, and your gaming console. It can get content from your camcorder. And it has an antenna that can tune in to broadcasts. So, yes and no, depending on what you mean. Do you mean does the smart TV\u2019s streaming content come in over the antenna? No, it does not. But do you mean that your smart TV has an antenna that can tune into television broadcasts? Yes, it does, unless maybe it\u2019s a super cheap model. ",
