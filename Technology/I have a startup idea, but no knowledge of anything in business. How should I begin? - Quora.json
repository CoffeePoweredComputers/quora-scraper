            "answer_text": "One of the easiest way is to create a business model canvas. This will help you to look at your idea holistically and gauge if it makes commercial sense to pursue it. Also keep attending activities locally where you will find people who are approachable and can guide you on taking things ahead. As far as registering the company is concerned thats not required for starters and dont think about getting the investors now. Team members also you will find either in those local activities or collaborate with friends, relatives or other like minded people! ",

I would instead suggest you the following, Check if somebody already has a version of a similar business model, and whether it works for themTest out your idea with a \u201cprototype\u201d which barely works.Find a co-founder who understands and is ready to invest their time on itTake it from there.If it does not work in this order, Stop. You are too young to work on something that either is already done, is not sellable, or you don\u2019t have knowledgeable partners that can stand behind the idea. ",
