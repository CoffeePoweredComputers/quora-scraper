            "answer_text": "The key technology may be the fact that the EV\u2019s become more and more computerized and will be able to serve us in more versatile ways, with eventually becoming automatic and able to drive you to and from your house or workplace without you touching anything, unless you want to. This computer technology opens up for a lot of new functions, especially in the city. They will get more and more features, like cameras and sensors inside and out that will detect any health issues with the people inside and can advice you to seek medical attention, or insist on driving automatically if the driver has been drinking or is very tired. They will alert if accidents have happened and record video of anything out of the normal function, just like Tesla\u2019s sentry mode. We will of course have a suitable automatic charge network for our cars, so that we don\u2019t need to plug anything in, or even need to park the car near our house. The car will come to pick you up at the time you choose. The car will go by an automatic car wash to clean up when it detects that it has become dirty, and go to get a cleanup on the inside when that is needed. Most people will choose not to buy a car of their own, and instead use an automatic Tesla, Taxi or Uber to travel, or rent a vehicle for longer distances. ",
