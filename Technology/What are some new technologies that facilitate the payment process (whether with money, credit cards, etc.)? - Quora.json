            "answer_text": "There are several aspects to this question: \u00b7 Old technologies used differently that facilitate payment process Old one that facilitate payment process: *QR codes in payment are not new; they\u2019ve been around for a few years in different industry; they were banned at some point in China. They streamline the act of payment as there are no more \u2018friction\u2019 ie no card swiping/dipping etc. The ability to combine existing technology into easier payment is spreading. Paying phone bills, power bills etc. used to be a hassle: checks sign and mail; now via a mobile banking application they are all paid in 5 minutes. What changed? not the technology but rather the mind set at the banks; they\u2019ve opened up their system using API\u2019s and existing technologies to facilitate these recurring payments. That in itself is a major improvement in the payment process! Some companies are referring to this as using enterprise serial bus payment ability but it is just fancy wording for various interfaces coming together. \u00b7 New technologies that also facilitate payment process *Contactless (NFC etc) are new as they allow to tap and go without having to swipe or dip. Also, very nice as it removes the pain of dealing with small amounts and coins! The security aspect took a while to be sorted out before going mainstream but it is all good now. Enjoy the tap and go. Next coming technologies are difficult to predict accurately but here is my take: Wallet payment will take off in 1st word countries. Yes, I know, these payments mean are old in Africa (check out M-Pesa - Wikipedia) but stopped/blocked/not adopted in Europe/USA hence new simplified payment means. These will no longer require a card (goodbye Visa, MC, Amex etc.? no but they have serious challenges coming to them). These wallet payments will greatly improve everyone\u2019s payment hassles. Mobile application loan application/approval to pay/split a trip to your best friend across the word? Sure! and all within the same application with the dashboard informing in real time progress and status Embedded payments in cars, clothes, watches etc. will go out of fashion; too many channels for anyone to keep track of how your money is spent (unless you are not counting!) Embedded chip in human body part will also follow a similar path. AI spending on your behalf: awesome! just make sure to train your AI to not take a loan to support xxx charity because you\u2019ve checked out 17 times their web site. More seriously, integrating the payment dimension into your personal calendar with their reminder with passive approval within certain guidelines will be coming soon and I\u2019ll be trying it out soon! Hope this helped ! ",
