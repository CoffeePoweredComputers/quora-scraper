            "answer_text": "In practice, cell sites are grouped in areas of high population density, with the most potential users. Cell phone traffic through a single site is limited by the base station's capacity; there is a finite number of calls or data traffic that a base station can handle at once. This limitation is another factor affecting the spacing of cell mast sites. In suburban areas, masts are commonly spaced 1\u20132 miles (2\u20133 km) apart and in dense urban areas, masts may be as close as \u00bc-\u00bd mile (400\u2013800 m) apart. The maximum range of a [Cell tower] (where it is not limited by interference with other masts nearby) depends on the same circumstances. Some technologies, such as GSM, normally have a fixed maximum range of 35 kilometres (22 mi), which is imposed by technical limitations. CDMA and IDEN have no built-in limit, but the limiting factor is the ability of a low-powered personal cell phone to transmit back to the mast. As a rough guide, based on a tall mast and flat terrain, it is possible to get between 50 and 70 km (30\u201345 miles). When the terrain is hilly, the maximum distance can vary from as little as 5 kilometres (3.1 mi) to 8 kilometres (5.0 mi) due to encroachment of intermediate objects into the wide center fresnel zone of the signal. [5] Depending on terrain and other circumstances, a GSM Tower can replace between 2 and 50 miles (80 km) of cabling for fixed wireless networks. [6] Source: Cell site - Wikipedia ",

            "answer_text": "Like all non-trivial questions, the answer is \u201cit depends\u201d. The signal can be \u201ctransmitted\u201d across the universe. It spreads out as a function of the square of the distance, but it\u2019s still there. The signal can be \u201creceived\u201d at great distances, depending on how large the receiving antenna is, and how good the receiver is, especially it\u2019s \u201cnoise figure\u201d and temperature. But your question is probably how large a distance a phone can work from a base station. Again this depends on the particular system and installation. It can work over a very long distance by the user of repeaters\u2014devices that receive the signal and then amplify it. I\u2019m told that in the early days of cdma, much of I5 in central California was covered this way. Without repeaters, the connection is limited by power, bandwidth, and antenna gain, as well as some parameters in that particular system that limit the distance. I\u2019ve heard stories of \u201cboomer\u201d cell sites in Australia that cover many miles, probably using particularly high antenna gain; the number 35 sticks in my head. As this is about 1/2 way to the horizon, it\u2019s more-or-less believable. Note that there\u2019s a practical limit on how much power the base station can have to transmit\u2014and that\u2019s the power that the phone (\u201cUE\u201d in industry parlance) can transmit, as well as how much better the receiver is in the base station than the receiver in the phones. At some point the phone can\u2019t reach the base station, so there is no point for the base station to try and transmit any farther (especially as the phone has to acknowledge those transmissions).
