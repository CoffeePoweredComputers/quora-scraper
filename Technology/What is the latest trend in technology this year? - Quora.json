            "answer_text": "Technology is evolving at such a rapid pace that any predictions of trends can seem out-of-date even before its out in the market. Any trends i talk about, already have some presence, in every possible industry you can think of. To give you a gist of trends what will be big this year, Virtual Reality: Virtual reality is a way to create a virtual i.e. a computer-generated environment that immerses the user into a virtual, unreal world. VR uses computer technology to create a simulated, three-dimensional world that a user can manipulate and explore while feeling as if he were in that world. Currently being implemented the most in gaming industry. Augmented reality: Contrary to VR, Augmented Reality does not let the user lose touch with reality. AR technology lets users see the real world and projects digital information onto the existing environment making it a mix of virtual reality and actual reality. Artificial Intelligence: From SIRI to self-driving cars, artificial intelligence is progressing rapidly. Artificial intelligence makes it possible for machines to learn from experience, adjust to new inputs and perform human-like tasks. AI rely heavily on deep learning and natural language processing. Cloud Computing: The cloud has been a revolution for companies of all sizes, causing significant restructuring of businesses as a whole. Cloud computing enables you to link, update and share data in real time with multiple sources when needed. Cloud computing provides access to information from any mobile device at any point of time, with data encryption offering great security and privacy. Cloud computing also decreases the costs as there is no need of any physical servers to store and manage data 5G: 5G technology is going to refine processing speeds by more than 10 times, literally. We will be able to browse the Internet on a smartphone at a speed that will reach 10 gigabytes/second. This technology will be responsible for much of the technological expectations. From manufacturing to retail to healthcare, these technological trends are going to leave their impact on each and every industry. Apart from these, Digital Twins, Blockchain, IoT and many such more trends in technology can be seen at a bigger level. Hope i did justice to your question! ",

            "answer_text": "Hi the best kitchen tools you have used This is a list I found at the famous site of best 8 alternatives If you would like to buy products, you have placed the article link where you find product links in Amazon >>>> coolest kitchen gadgets 50 the coolest kitchen gadgets that many people don\u2019t know about 2018 I have to say, there is a kitchen gadget for just about everyone! Whether you\u2019re a professional chef or just an occasional cook, there are so many different cool kitchen utensils and tools. After spending so much time rounding these up, I\u2019ve been extremely inspired to organize my kitchen and get to cooking. Here are a few of my favorite kitchen gadgets that I think are not only genius, but also very useful! I\u2019m excited because I didn\u2019t know most of these existed until now! 01. Herb Mill  Fresh herbs just got easier! This herb mill is very similar to a pepper grinder, only it\u2019s made to grind fresh herbs like rosemary, parsley, dill, and sage. What a flavor difference compared to dried herbs. 02. Easy Pineapple Slicer  I can\u2019t wrap my brain around how this kitchen gadget actually works, but it seems to have great reviews. It peels, cores, and slices a pineapple in just a matter of seconds! 03. Silicone Bowls   I\u2019m a proud new owner of these amazing silicone bowls. I\u2019m not sure how I ever lived without them! I use them mostly for muffins and pancakes \u2014 you can mix up your ingredients in the bowl, and then easily pinch to pour just the right amount into a muffin tin or pan. The silicone measuring cups also eliminates your need to measure with a separate tool. Measure, mix, then pour! 04. Frozen Fruit Treat Maker  Have you ever used your food processor to make what tastes and looks like soft serve ice cream out of frozen bananas?! I started doing this last summer, and it is amazing! The process is a little tedious, though. I usually have to take the cap off about a dozen times to stir before I get the right consistency. I had no idea there was a machine made just for this! Just pop your frozen fruit in to make a much healthier and all natural version of \u201cice cream\u201d. 05. Cake Batter Dispenser  This clever gadget neatly dispenses the perfect amount of cake or muffin batter without the mess. You can use it for pancakes, too! 06. Julienne Peeler Blade  This peeler is great for creating thin julienne sticks on carrots, squash, zucchini, and cucumbers. It\u2019s like veggie \u201cpasta\u201d! It\u2019s practical and small, so it will easily fit into your utensil drawer. 07. Spiral Vegetable Slicer  This veggie slicer turns your fruit and vegetables into something extraordinary! You can make curly fries, vegetable noodles, or fancy toppings for just about any dish. It has over 1,600 positive reviews on Amazon. 08. Over-The-Sink Strainer Board  Do your washing, slicing and dicing right over the sink! This is especially nice for a small kitchen that doesn\u2019t have a lot of counter space. It also collapses for easy storage. 09. Water Bottle Ice Cube Tray  The funny thing is, I actually have one of these in my tupperware cabinet, but I had no clue where I got it and what it was for. This makes sense! Regular ice cubes don\u2019t fit in a water bottle no matter how hard you try to cram them through the small opening. 10. Spaghetti Measure  Do you make pasta for 17 people when you only have a small family to feed like me? Let this little gadget do the guess work for you! 11. I Could Eat A Horse  Here\u2019s another pasta measuring gadget but with a sense of humor! Are you feeding a horse? Or, perhaps just 2 adults and a child? The horse actually measures for 4 people, but I love the quirky way this was designed. 12. Clip-On Pouring Spout  Clip this neat silicone kitchen tool onto a pot, pan or serving bowl to drain the liquid while still holding the contents! It\u2019s perfect for draining the fat out of your ground beef or water out of your cooked veggies. 13. Yolk Extractor  Whether you\u2019re a fitness fanatic who likes your morning egg white omelet, or perhaps you just need to separate the yolk from an egg for a specific recipe, this will make the job so much easier! 14. Flameless Marshmallow Roaster  Ok, this may lean towards the impractical side, but I\u2019ve always wanted to be able to roast marshmallows in my kitchen! The kids love s\u2019mores (me too!), so who says you have wait for a camping trip to enjoy them! This would be so much for a sleepover. 15. Expandable Drawer Dividers  I\u2019ve been known to spend hours in the aisles of the Container Store. I can\u2019t help it if I like every nook and cranny in my home to be well organized! I bought a few of these adjustable drawer dividers for my kitchen drawers, and I love them! You can completely customize the size of each slot. 16. Never-Soggy Cereal Bowl  With this clever bowl design, you don\u2019t have to scarf your cereal down knowing that it\u2019s going to be soggy before you get a chance to finish it all. It\u2019s also great for chips and dip, soup and crackers, or cookies with milk! 17. Zipzicles  Make your own ice pops with fresh and healthy ingredients! Fill them with juice, smoothies, yogurt, or anything else you can dream up. And, they have a zip top so they don\u2019t have to be eaten all at once. 18. Pancake Pen  I\u2019ve been doing this with my daughter for a few months now, only we\u2019ve been using those cheap plastic ketchup squeeze bottles. They work ok, but the batter tends to get stuck in the small opening, so I have to make it thinner than preferred. This bottle is made specifically for pancake art! It also works great to fill cupcake liners without the mess. The top and bottom screw off for easy cleaning, and the tip is heat resistant. 19. Onion Holder  This handy gadget not only holds the onion for you (no more stinky hands), but also guides your knife for perfectly even slices. And, I\u2019m not certain how this works, but apparently the stainless steel part of the grip removes onion odor from your hands. Why would that be necessary if you\u2019re not having to touch the onion? Don\u2019t know, but it couldn\u2019t hurt! 20. Citrus Sprayer  Spray fresh lemon juice right out of a lemon? What?! Yes, and even limes, grapefruit, oranges, and other citrus! This is great for salads, fish, shrimp, etc. You can also spray your unused avocado halves with it to keep them from browning. 21. Corn Zipper  Use a corn zipper to effortlessly and cleanly remove kernels off of the cob! It quickly removes several rows at once, yet is safer than a knife. 22. Dice & Slice Chopper  With a single swift motion, this kitchen gadget evenly chops onions and other vegetables. It\u2019s perfect for salsa, vegetables, boiled eggs, nuts and fruit. It comes with 3 interchangeable blades so you can chop your desired size. 23. Rocking Garlic Crusher  Easy to use and easy to clean! This sleek garlic crusher allows you to crush and mince garlic with ease. The scooped design holds the garlic like a bowl, allowing the garlic to be scraped into a bowl or pan. 24. Double Dish  What a great concept! Especially if you like to eat pistachios while watching tv (guilty). This bowl works great for edamame, cherries, olives, pistachios, wrapped candy, and sunflower seeds. Basically anything that you would eat and need to discard a seed, shell, or wrapper. Fabulous gift idea! 25. Pot Clip  What to do with that dripping spoon. Hmm, how about a pot clip that allows you to rest your utensils right over the pot!? It will keep your stovetop clean and your spoon handy. 26. 2-in-1 Silicone Whisk  It\u2019s two essential tools in one sleek design! And, the silicone coated wire is perfect for your non-stick pots and pans. Use it to whisk your ingredients together, and then with a simple twist, use the same tool to scrape the ingredients out of your bowl or pan. 27. Party Bowls On Ice  Keep your vegetable or fruit trays cold for long periods of time! This is especially helpful if you are attending a party and have quite a drive ahead of you. The larger bowl has a detachable divider, so you can also use it for salad or other cold dishes. 28. Grill Clips  Hold your veggies together on the grill without the risk of them falling through the grates! Use your grilling tongs to easily flip and remove them from the grill. 29. Rinse Bowl & Strainer  This 2-in-1 food bowl allows you to strain the water out with a quick slide up of the integrated strainer. Perfect for washing fruits and veggies! 30. Apple Corer  Quickly and easily removes unwanted cores! Perfect gadget and gift for the holidays when apple pies are a must. Also great for kids so they can eat the apple in it\u2019s whole form without worrying about the core and seeds. 31. Marinade Infusing Meat Tenderizer  The perfect kitchen gadget for men! This 2-in-1 kitchen tool softens the meat and injects flavor enhancing marinade at the same time. 32. Compact Food Prep Set  It\u2019s pretty and functional! The perfect housewarming gift for someone with a small home or apartment as it occupies the absolute minimum amount of space. This set includes a colander, sieve, mixing bowls, and measuring cups. 33. Flour Keeper  Store your flour and sugar with confidence! I prefer to keep my occasionally-used food products in air tight containers just for the peace of mind alone. Sometimes I go months without touching my flour, so this makes sense. They are also constructed with a convenient lever for accurate scoop measurements. 34. Pasta Pot  If you\u2019re a pasta lover, this may come in really handy! The unique colander lid snaps right into place, and the pot itself is in an oval shape \u2014 better for long pasta and for fitting on a back burner when you have other pots or pans on the front. 35. Portion Control Dressing Cap  Have you noticed that a lot of the salad dressing brands have taken out the little cap on the top of their bottles that had a small hole to control the amount of dressing that comes out? It\u2019s really irritating! My kids love the Kraft Ranch brand, but the cap opening is so darn big, they end up pouring out 4 times what they need (UPDATE: Kraft has a new pour control cap and awesome new flavors!) But, for those other dressings that are missing this tiny but useful detail, I\u2019ve found a solution. This portion control dressing cap also accurately dispenses one sized serving of dressing at a time (2 tbsp). This is especially handy if you\u2019re trying to keep track of your calories. 36. Tabletop Oil Mister  More flavor with less fat! This is the best way to control the amount of oil you spray on your salad, cookie sheets, and baking pans. It reminds me of Pam except for it\u2019s chemical-free and you can flavor it however you\u2019d like. I suppose you could even pour your favorite salad dressing in there to make it last longer and watch your calorie intake. 37. Space Saving Grater  Not only does this fold flat kitchen grater save space in a drawer, you can also place it vertically on a cupboard or pantry shelf. When unfolded it looks just like a regular grater except for it has a handy comfort grip handle, making it easier to grate cheese and vegetables! 38. Professional Multi-Chopper  With 3 pushers and 4 interchangeable blades, you can easily prep everything from potatoes to onions and carrots. The measuring container allows you to see how much you\u2019ve already cut, and you can remove the base to use the chopper right over your cutting board. 39. Fridgepad For iPad  I use my iPad in the kitchen a lot when I\u2019m referring to an online recipe or playing music from my iTunes while cooking. This is the perfect place to store it and be able to easily view and access it. Heck, this also turns it into a small flat screen TV! There is also an optional wall mount kit, so you can put it on a wall or cabinet instead of the fridge. 40. Dip Clips  Clip these mini side bowls on to just about any plate! Use them for dressings, dips, salsa, or guacamole. This is especially handy for runny dips like salsa to keep it from spreading all over the plate. 41. Hands-Free Bag Holder  This is like having an extra set of hands in the kitchen! It adjusts to fit most bags, and holds it open and steady while you fill it up. When you\u2019re finished, it folds up for easy storage. 42. In-Drawer Knife Organizer  Keep your knives organized and out of site with an knife organizing and storage tray that fits perfectly in a drawer. Perfect solution if you don\u2019t have a lot of counter space! 43. Chef\u2019s Torch  It not only caramelizes sugar and browns meringue, but it\u2019s also handy for melting cheese or adding a little extra crisp to anything grilled. 44. Cracker Containers  For those cookies and crackers (Ritz & Saltines!) that don\u2019t come with a resealable bag! Keep them fresher longer with plastic containers that are made to fit them perfectly. 45. 3-Tier Oven Rack  This tiered oven rack only takes up about half the space of your built in racks, so you can cook several casseroles and dishes at once while still having room for that huge turnkey! 46. Wide Bag Cap  This makes just about any bag a reusable container! Why bother with bulky tupperware when you can just add a lid to your chips, cereal bags, and much more. Seal in the freshness! 47. Quick Snap Ice Tray  Instead of having to pry your ice cubes out of the tray with your fingernail, just give this tray a quick snap to release one cube at a time! Definitely worth it if you don\u2019t have an ice maker. 48. Garlic Peeler  The easiest way to peel garlic! The unique shape keeps the garlic inside while rolling, and the peels stick to the tube while the garlic cloves comes out. keeps your hands from stinking, too! 49. Scrap Collector  Attach the wire hook to any drawer near your work surface, and then easily scrape your scraps off the counter into the bin. It keeps your work surface clean and is easy to dump into your compost pile instead of stinking up the trash can. 50. Mandoline Slicer  This is one of my favorite kitchen gadgets. It makes slicing so much fun! You can even adjust the thickness of your slices with the simple turn of a knob. I use it a lot for potatoes and cucumbers. source: 50 the coolest kitchen gadgets that many people don\u2019t know about 2018 ",

            "answer_text": "Since the year 2000, there has been continued growth in VR technology and is arguably the period with the most tremendous innovation since VR\u2019s inception. In 2001, SAS Cube created the first PC based cubic room that then led to the development of Virtools VR pack, a library pack add-on. After its 2007 release of google Street View, in 2010, google introduced stereoscopic 3D mode for Street View. This allowed users to stand on the street and physically look around the 3D image. It was also in 2010 that 18-year-old Palmer Luckey created the first prototype of Oculus Rift, the famous VR headset. It was the first time a 90-degree field of vision was used, and the new oculus rift headset relied on processing power of a computer to render its visuals. This reinvigorated interest in the VR space. 2012 was also a big year for Palmer Luckey, he launched a Kickstarter campaign for Oculus Rift that raised $2.4 million USD in funding. Two years later, in 2014, Facebook bought Oculus VR company for 2 billion USD. 2014 was an exciting year for the VR community. Not only was Oculus VR company purchased by Facebook, but Sony announced their VR headset for the PS4 under the name \u2018Project Morpheus\u2019. 2014 was also the year that Samsung announced the Samsung VR gear that would eventually be released in 2016. In 2016, HTC Vive, Oculus Rift and Playstation VR were all released. It is also the first year, many say, that VR became accessible to consumers in their own homes for gaming and media entertainment. All headsets had accompanying hand-held devices that allowed for movement and use of hands when interfacing with VR. Because of how pricey the VR headsets and handsets were, most of the VR users in 2016 were underwhelmed with the VR\u2019s affordability. It\u2019s also important to note that June 2016 is the birth month of Veer! 2017 was the year that bridged the gap between expectations and reality. In 2016, many were excited about VR potential, but thought that the content was sparse and the price of VR headsets too expensive. In 2017, Sony bundled PS4 consoles with PSVR headsets in order to attract more users. This fact paired with Oculus\u2019 summer sale of hardware spurred the purchasing of VR headsets and gear. 2017 is also the year that Microsoft entered the VR industry.  This past September Oculus hosted the OC5, their annual conference detailing hardware, software and content innovation in VR. At the conference, they announced: The Oculus Quest, available in Spring 2019, which is their first all-in-one headset with positionally tracked controllers; an exclusive Star Wars game that allows the player to take up a lightsaber like a Jedi; and a professional-grade, set ready 3D/360 camera created in partnership with Facebook and RED. At the E3 video game conference, HTC announced an adapter for the Vive to make it wireless which is set to launch this summer.  AR Technology According to Lumus By 2025, AR will be big in the video game market, accounting for an estimated $11.6 billion out of what will probably be a trillion-dollar business by that time. (That's a conservative number for AR gaming.) And there are plenty of other industries where AR (and virtual reality) will contribute to revenue by 2025. Healthcare at $5.1 billion (imagine devices that can find veins faster than a phlebotomist), engineering at $4.7 billion, live events (picture Kanye dancing...with Kanye!) at $4.1 billion, the military at $1.6 billion, and the list goes on. Even at the low end, the education market will make $7 million using AR products. Looking at some specific industries, the infographic indicates that in real estate and home improvement, for example, $2.6 billion in 2025 will be driven by features such as interactive 3D walkthroughs using VR headsets and using AR to drive by a home and instantly get information on it using your mobile device, no Zillow search required. Ikea is already in on the act: It has an app that scales its items for sale to depict what they'd look like in pictures of your own home. There are other industries like the Retail industry that AR and VR technology its takin over and have a really big future as well. This is a great example so you can have a good inside about AR and VR in the retail industry.  Other industries that are using AR and VR technology are Videos games, Real estate, Military, Education, etc. This is a great infographic that I found that explains a bit more the potential that AR has in the future  Do you like VR videos and immerse yourself in a VR World?

            "answer_text": "Technology Trends related to 5G progress In recent years, this technology has emerged and has grown to become very popular. Technology revolutionizes our daily lives and there are several technology trends that will help you in the years to come, and which should be known. So let's find out exactly what Technology Trends related to this technology that will improve standard of communication and improve on standard of living in Cities and daily lives 1. Artificial Intelligence AI is about all intelligent machines that will artificially act like talking, reading, watching, recognizing things and emotions like humans. Using algorithms and code, the machine can perform tasks that are very burdensome for us. And that too with accuracy and efficiency. AI began to be used well everywhere from health services to banking. It can be used on gadgets too. Various voice assistants such as Google Assistant are operated by Artificial Intelligence (AI). Today, many researchers and companies will work in this region to really help us in our daily lives. AI has created possibilities in specific ways , in areas as AI in health services .  2. Machine Learning and mechatronic application Trends in Machine Learning technology Another interesting and emerging technology is machine learning. This is an integral part of AI, which can be a machine's ability to understand, analyze, and track itself. In other words, placing skills to be understood in machines or computers is Machine Learning, which offers the ability to know data. That's possible through algorithms. The possibility of hand held device might come out with diagnostic models due to fast data processing allowing AI to be integrated in such areas will see faster and even accurate option of better healthcare or even or in most areas of application that requires computing solution that can be provide thru high speed data acquisition and computation allowing for better developed software to make use dedicated equipment able to acquire data acquisition to enable higher response rate and data processing  ( available on googleplay and Amazon kindle - Apple- Ibook - Dwayne Anderson ) 3. IoT Internet of Things technology trends IoT is one of the fastest growing technologies in recent years. \"Internet of Things\" is just a concept or concept through which all smart devices can connect to each other using the internet. The Internet of Things is a network that uses applications, electronics, and the internet to really help connect devices, gadgets, or equipment to each other. Once they are connected, they can communicate and exchange information. Radio frequency identification (RFID), sensors, wireless, and QR codes are IoT applications. Similarly, AI and Machine Learning will also be connected with thinking about the Internet. If you are aware of Smart Homes and Home Automation, IoT is the main idea behind the device and the type of equipment that makes your home Smart. Smarter cities will then include integration of smarter facilities and also smart homes into a smart digital hub for everybody to live , work and play 4. Augmented Reality AR is increasingly being applied today. Already used in various activities including art, entertainment, trade, education and the army. And also available on your own smart device. Augmented Reality (AR) improves user experience with sound overlays, videos, graphics, etc. On the real things. Unlike VR, AR develops the facts by enveloping digital elements on it which could act as interactive sensor that allow data manipulation and communication The Augmented Reality application is growing rapidly. It is important to realize that it has an extraordinary ability to change our perception of humans. AR is also used in industries such as health, public safety, tourism and many other industries 5. 5G Technology 5G is the next generation mobile network technology that will provide much faster speed than today's 4G LTE network .there are 2 major manufacturer namely Nokia and Huawei both working and competing for '5G First'. Similarly, phone manufacturers focus on devices prepared for 5G. However, 5G technology may be commercially available in 2020, but has Huawei has push and started launching in China and in the UK when recently USA started tariff related trade war with CHINA , and was try to put up technological restraint especially on Huawei World Gobe 5 G mobile for Smartphone The trend of mobile technology in 2019 is much more excited than the previous year. However, in 2018 many new concepts and things related to the latest mobile technology emerged. We started talking about 5G technology and eSIM. Similarly, some phones come with a wave of multiple cameras on the back, front unlocking and top-notch screen on the smartphone. Yes, it is true that the 5G wave has spread in the smartphone market. In addition, network companies have begun to think about the release of 5G. Although it will take more time, it may be up to 2020, but the focus of phone manufacturers is on this. And the next phones can be released this year with 5G compatibility. One of Samsung's main mobile phones has announced its 5G phone model: Galaxy S10 5G. Not all, but some of us can enjoy 5G speed smartphones. The reason behind this limitation is the execution of 5G. It seems that in 2019, 5G can only be implemented in some states of the world. \u00e9 SIM With the launch of Apple iPhone Xs and iPhone Xr, eSIM came into the spotlight. Many network providers started eSIM services around the world. This is also good news for smart phone companies because, with this technology, they can count on better features on their phones. As eSIM has some advantages, smartphone manufacturers are also considering this for their next range. Inside the smartphone, the eSIM is just a small built-in chip, which can save space inside and can help manufacturers make a thinner phone. Customers can also get the benefits of eSIM technology. Folding screen From the last quarter of 2018, you will hear some rumors about the folding of mobile technology. Many of the big phone manufacturers are in the race to make phones with folding or dual screens. In fact, most of them have demonstrated their fold-able smartphones in various phone exposures. According to rumors, many companies like Samsung, Xiaomi, Huawei, LG and Motorola can launch their folding phones soon. And you can start a new trend of mobile technology in 2019. With folding technology, the phone has the maximum screen size and the minimum phone size. However, it is difficult to say how successful the initial folding phones will be. Because in some of the demonstrations, the phones have faults, have dents on the screen and are very expensive. But technology is evolving as such, Google is aligning the folding screen prototype. ",

The idea was great, but the execution and development weren\u2019t.  Intel recently revealed its smart glass called Vaunt. Vaunt looks a lot like a regular set of glasses at first glance and they are nearly indistinguishable from regular glasses and they only weigh about 50 grams. At its core, Vaunt is simply a system for displaying a small heads-up style display in your peripheral vision. It is designed to show very simple basic information in one of your eye. It can show you simple messages like directions or notifications. It works over Bluetooth with either an Android phone or an iPhone much in the same way your smartwatch does, taking commands from an app that runs in the background to control it. If there is any notification it can be read or dismissed using certain head gestures.  It has little red monochrome projector. that shines an image on the holographic mirror which bounces it directly into the eyeball.  Notification can only be seen if you are look down at the display. It does interfere with the standard line of vision.  This was the technology which every college kids dreamt and now Intel has finally built it.\ufeff Thankyou ",

            "answer_text": "These days, market researchers and analysts publish their forecasts for the coming year. Which topics shape the IT industry in the next twelve months? Digitization and digital transformation are and will continue to be the driving forces behind the sustainable change. Companies will want to increase the efficiency of their business processes in 2019. There are also projects that increasingly enrich existing business models and services with digital solutions in order to create added value. The first projects, especially of start-ups, are aimed at completely new services and business models that are intended to open up new potential and customer groups. Higher-level topics such as Customer Experience (CX), IoT and automation, new ecosystems, digital platforms but also a shortage of skilled workers as well as security issues and the correct handling of data will continue to accompany us in 2019.  The forecasts of the large IT consulting firms are similar. The top 10 topics in the coming year are: Artificial Intelligence (AI) will make the leap from niche technology to widespread enterprise use. There is a very wide range of possible fields of the application here: from customer relations to the optimization of business processes. AI affects almost all company segments and processes.Robotic Process Automation (RPA). Automating simple, manual workflows based on a set of rules is a subset of AI and is on the rise in 2019. More and more AI elements in self-learning, self-deciding and self-repairing systems are finding their way into companies, such as Chatbots and Roboadvisor. RPA is an issue that can increase business efficiency. Here one can also observe a shift in business process outsourcing (BPO), which is increasingly being replaced by automation.IoT Security and ICS (Industrial Control Systems) Security have been one of the most important issues for IT managers for years. Security issues are becoming increasingly important due to the increasing IoT networking of production facilities, devices, and machines. This creates greater risks for attacks from outside. It is not just about the protection of assets, but also about the detection of attacks and damage and also about regulatory issues such as reporting obligations. Here, it is important to develop company-wide security strategies.Individual software development was once considered a problem child, because of which it was difficult to maintain applications that were very expensive during operation. Today, many companies run custom digitization projects to differentiate themselves from competitors through innovation. The development is based on PaaS platforms. Low-code platforms also allow non-programmers to develop simple applications.Open, Technology-Based Ecosystems. With digitization, there is a new trend towards openness through Open API, Open Data and Open Innovation. Open systems and environments are the basis for new eco-systems that offer and develop innovative services and solutions.Cloud computing. There is a strong trend towards public cloud solutions, not only for development and test projects but also for mission-critical workloads to production. First companies want to establish the public cloud as an alternative to the data center.Edge Computing is an extension of the central cloud idea to a decentralized component and a hardware issue. Edge computing devices can be small controllers in sensors, single-board PCs that are close to the production line, or mini-data centers. The computing power is available where it is needed for analysis, which is especially important for real-time applications because otherwise, the runtimes are too long.With Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT), there is an increasing level of enterprise technology maturity. There is also a trend toward protocols that are different from pure blockchains, such as IOTA, a digital payment system or the Lightning Network, a protocol for scaling blockchain technologies, which first introduced off-chain transactions in the bitcoin environment. There are many application scenarios in banks, insurance companies; in tracking and tracing in trade and goods transport.Business Innovation Architecture. Existing IT architectures often do not meet the requirements for new and rapidly implemented solutions. In 2019, new approaches will be needed to place the data at the center of company processes and enable the loose coupling of different technologies.Virtual Data Platforms. Today, there are a lot of data in companies that are stored in different silos, departments, formats, and databases. For the 360-degree view of the customer, however, all available data must be consolidated and put together in the required form. Virtual, shared data platforms integrate all data sources; serve as a data hub for all business processes, enabling flexible use of data. In addition to technical and organizational issues in 2019: The skills shortage will be one of the key challenges of the coming years. Digitization has further aggravated this situation, as classic user companies are also looking for IT specialists. Major corporations such as Bosch, Siemens and Allianz now have their own IT subsidiaries, but companies from the second or third row are also working on digitization and are looking for specialists.Low-code platforms are a possible approach, in which even people without explicit software know-how can develop simple applications. Innovative sourcing concepts involve experts from near and offshore areas in agile software development.\"The upcoming developments mean that organizations have to reorganize internally and become much more agile and flexible\", Karel Dorner, senior partner and specialist for digitization and e-commerce at McKinsey & Company says. The transformation needs employees and executives who are able to find their way in agile teams in which technicians and experts from the specialist areas work closely together.The situation will continue to worsen the more advanced analytics and AI practices have entered the enterprise. Businesses should, therefore, seek outside talent, build partnerships, or work with start-ups to accelerate their innovation and digitization efforts. In the long term, however, only building up your own capacities and competencies will help.But the biggest challenge of the future, Dorner judges, is \"looking at technological innovation not just through IT glasses\".

            "answer_text": "9 Technology Mega Trends That Will Change The World In 2018  Some tech trends fizzle out and die a quiet death, while others are so significant that they transform our world and how we live in it. Here are the top nine tech mega-trends that I believe will define 2018 and beyond. Trend 1: The increasing datafication of our lives From chatting to friends in a messaging app or buying a coffee, to tapping in and out with an Oyster card or streaming music, today almost everything we do leaves a trail of data breadcrumbs. And this increasing datafication of our world has led to an unprecedented explosion in data. Just in the average minute, Facebook receives 900,000 logins, more than 450,000 Tweets are posted, and 156 million emails and 15 million texts are sent.With numbers like that, it\u2019s no wonder we\u2019re essentially doubling the amount of data created in the world roughly every two years. Trend 2: The Internet of Things (IoT) and how everyday devices are becoming more \u2018smart\u2019 The IoT \u2013 which encompasses smart, connected products like smart phones and smart watches \u2013is a major contributing factor in this exponential increase in data. That\u2019s because all these smart devices are constantly gathering data, connecting to other devices and sharing that data \u2013 all without human intervention (your Fitbit synching data to your phone, for instance). Pretty much anything can be made smart these days. Our cars are becoming increasingly connected; by 2020, a quarter of a billion carswill be hooked up to the Internet. For our homes, there are obvious smart products like TVs,and less obvious ones, like yoga mats that trackyour Downward Dog. And, of course, many of us have voice-enabled personal assistants like Alexa \u2013 another example of an IoT device. That\u2019s already a lot of devices, but the IoT is just getting started. IHS has predicted there\u2019ll be 75 billion connected devices by 2020. Trend 3: Exponential growth in computing power is fueling massive tech advances None of this incredible growth in data, nor the billions of IoT devices available,would be possible without the enormous leaps in computing power that we\u2019ve made. Between 1975 and 2015, computing power doubled at a rate of every two years, before slowing to the current rate of approximately every two and a half years. But we\u2019re reaching the limits of what traditional computing power can handle. Thankfully, on the horizon, we have quantum computing. Probably the most significant transformation of computing power ever, quantum computing will see computers become millions of times faster than they are right now.Tech leaders are in a race to launch the first commercially viable quantum computer, capable of solving problems that today\u2019s computers can\u2019t handle. Capable, even, of solving problems that we can\u2019t even imagine yet. Trend 4: The incredible rise of artificial intelligence (AI) Computers are now able to learn in much the same way as we humans do, and this leap in AI capabilities has been made possible by the massive increases in data and computing power. It\u2019s the incredible explosion in data that has allowed AI to advance so quickly over the last couple of years; the more data an AI system has, the quicker it can learn and the more accurate it becomes. This huge step forward in AI mean computers can now undertake more and more human tasks. In fact, it\u2019s AI that allows computers to see (e.g. facial recognition software), read (e.g. analyzing social media messages), listen (e.g. Alexa standing by to answer your every command), speak (e.g. Alexa being able to answer you) and gauge our emotions (e.g. affective computing). Trend 5: The unstoppable freight train that is automation The more intelligent machines become, the more they can do for us. That means even more processes, decisions, functions and systems can be automated and carried out by algorithms or robots. Eventually, a wide range of industries and jobs will be impacted by automation. However, for now, the first wave of jobs that machines are taking can be categorized using the four Ds: dull, dirty, dangerous and dear. This means humans will no longer be needed to do the jobs that machines can do faster, safer, cheaper and more accurately. Beyond the four Ds, machines, robots and algorithms will replace \u2013 oraugment \u2013 many human jobs, including professional jobs in fields like law or accounting. From truck drivers to bricklayers to doctors, the list of jobs that are likely to be affected by automation is surprising. One estimate reckons that 47 percent of US jobs are at risk of automation. Trend 6: 3D printing opens up amazing opportunities for manufacturers (and others) Related to increasing automation, the invention of 3D printing is disrupting manufacturing, and other industries, in many positive ways. In traditional (subtractive) manufacturing, objects are cut or hollowed out of material, such as metal, using something like a cutting tool. But in 3D printing (also known as additive manufacturing), the object is created by laying down, or adding, layers of material. The materials used in 3D printing can be pretty much anything: plastic, metal, concrete, liquid, powder, even chocolate or human tissue! With 3D printing, far more complex shapes can be created than in traditional manufacturing \u2013 and using less material, too. It also allows for much greater customization of products, without worrying about economies of scale. Trend 7: We\u2019re interacting with technology in very different ways The way we interact with technology has changed dramatically in recent years \u2013 and is still changing. Thanks to smart phones and tablets, we can carry out a whole range of tasks on the move simply by touching a screen. Mobile web usage has increased to the point where, in 2016, it overtook web usage through traditional computers. Google has also confirmed that searches on mobile devices now outstrip desktop searches. We\u2019re also talking to our devices, using voice searches via Siri and the like. Estimates suggest that, by 2020, 50 percent of all searches will be voice searches, and around 30 percent will involve no screen whatsoever. As a result, all kinds of businesses are gradually integrating their products with the likes of Siri, Alexa and Google Assistant. For example, Alexa is being integrated into BMWs from 2018. Virtual reality and augmented reality represent the next huge leap in interface innovation, transforming how businesses interact with customers. Trend 8: Blockchains: An invention that could change our world Blockchain technology is a very practical solution to the problem of storing, authenticating and protecting data. Think of a blockchain as a decentralized, extremely secure database. Or, to get slightly more technical, it\u2019s a distributed, peer-to-peer ledger of records. While nothing is ever totally \u2018hack-proof\u2019, blockchain represents a huge leap forward compared to our current data security technology as, unlike a centralized database, there\u2019s no one single point of failure. The records in a blockchain are called \u2018blocks\u2019 and every block is connected to the previous block (hence, \u2018block\u2019 and \u2018chain\u2019). The whole chain is self-managed, which means there\u2019s no one person or organization in charge of the entire chain. If that sounds familiar, it might be because the virtual currency Bitcoin functions on blockchain technology. Financial services, insurance and healthcare are just some of the sectors where blockchains are likely to be heavily adopted. In fact, 90 percent of major European and North American banks are exploring blockchain solutions. Trend 9: Platforms are the way forward for businesses A platform is essentially a network (digital or physical) that creates value for participants by facilitating connections and exchanges between people for services, products or information. The platform is rarely the actual service provider; instead, it acts as a facilitator for the crowd, making interactions possible, easy, and safe for participants. Platforms have given rise to businesses like Airbnb, Uber and Amazon, and are also the foundation of what Facebook and Twitter do. However, platforms offer growth opportunities across all kinds of businesses, industries and sectors \u2013 not just tech companies. Even long-running businesses with more traditional business models, like Ford, are beginning to develop platform strategies. By:- Bernard Marr Source:- Forbes ",

            "answer_text": "New Study Confirms That the Future of Data Storage Is in DNA With the evolution of both science and technology, we live in a world where everything is digitalized, which can also include human DNA. As we witness the rise of efforts associated with DNA data storage, it is impossible not to wonder about its purpose in health, science, or technology itself. Scientists across the globe are conducting research as to how DNA can help storing data. Because DNA remains for the longer period for thousands of years- if researchers found the way to store data using DNA, it cannot be deteriorated for thousands of years are thus important records can be stored for a longer period. For More Future Trends & Growth, Download PDF Brochure Several organizations, for instance, Microsoft have invested a huge amount in this research project. Actually, DNA contains information about a living creature that pushed such organization to do research on the possibilities of storing data using DNA. Another important thing about DNA is that it\u2019s very compact. A small piece of DNA can store huge amount of data. DNA data storage is a complicated process and the reality is that scientists are still working on methods that would make it easier, more stable, and convenient. Here is a simple explanation: in order to encode binary digital files into DNA sequence, it is necessary to convert the individual bits from 1 and 0 to letters A, C, G, and T. Implications of DNA data storage Implications of DNA data storage are numerous and they go beyond encoding a photo or book into the DNA sequence. Thanks to the amazing breakthrough of science and the wonderful combination of biology and technology, Microsoft decided to develop an apparatus whose purpose will be to use biology to replace tape drives.
