            "answer_text": "Technology has brought about a massive and welcome change to the healthcare industry. Patients now have access to some of the best diagnostic tools, new and cutting-edge treatments, and a myriad of minimally-invasive procedures resulting in less pain and quicker healing. Remote consultations with specialists, targeted treatments, and the availability of intuitive mobile apps have led to improved patient care and a superior healthcare experience overall. Additionally, the availability of newer treatment technologies leading to better outcomes has enhanced the quality of life of the patients as well. Browse in Google for Denial Management Software: Bridgestone Hrs  The following aspects explain how technology has changed the healthcare industry. Digitization of Health Records Dusty and bulky paper files are slowly giving way to streamlined digital records that are securely uploaded to the cloud and made accessible remotely to patients and healthcare professionals. By this, storing, management, and transmission of data becomes easy and quick. Support for clinical decisions is made available to professionals and patients; making it possible to take better, more informed medical decisions. Digitization of health records also facilitates efficiency and delivery of healthcare to remote or inaccessible locations. This digitization has the potential to streamline processes, improve patient outcomes, and reduce costs. Mobile App Technology in the Medical Field Not only do patients have access to quick and accurate medical information using their handheld devices, but they can also use apps to keep track of doctor\u2019s appointments, get reminders to take their medications. Health and fitness apps help people get healthier by tracking their food intake and activity levels and offering customized solutions. These apps can also help physicians in high-stress jobs by reducing time spent in the filing, record maintenance, and other routine tasks. Mobile apps provide access to drug information to help prevent side effects and interactions, solve problems, and improve diagnosis. Doctors can communicate directly with their patients, record their vital signs accurately, maintain logs about visits and consultations, and achieve greater procedural efficiency. Electronic Medical Records Electronic medical records or Electronic Health Records (EHRs) consist of digital summaries of a patient\u2019s medical records. They could include diagnoses, lab reports, and details about hospital stays, surgical interventions, and prescriptions. They offer an overview of a patient\u2019s health; permitting a more accurate diagnosis and improved patient care. These electronic records facilitate the easy sharing of information and collaboration between labs and specialists without the time and resource expenditure on physical transmission. EHRs provide healthcare professionals with information about patient allergies and intolerances and anything else that may be relevant; particularly important if the patient is unconscious. When properly maintained and implemented, EHR protocols can also help increase accountability and reduce malpractice. Electronic records are easier and less time to consume to create and maintain. They make life easier for medical accountants and reduce the chance of mistakes being made. Big Data and the Cloud Big data is a buzzword in different industries, including healthcare. This is because the generation and collection of huge amounts of data from a number of different sources in the healthcare field are now possible. This data is then used for analytics, making predictions about possible epidemics and ultimately preventing deaths. Cloud storage of data helps improve efficiency and accessibility while reducing wastage. This also helps in research and development of new treatment protocols and lifesaving pharmaceutical formulations. In fact, cloud services can be invaluable for medical research, providing vast amounts of research and analysis and facilitating efficient health information exchange. The cloud provides secure and cost-effective storage solutions, with backup and recovery features, but without the hassle and cost of maintaining additional server hardware. Improved Patient Care Technology has placed at the disposal of the healthcare community various potent tools to improve patient care. Since EHRs are easily available to physicians, they can access complete medical histories of patients and make the most well-considered medical decisions. Doctors can quickly identify possible medication errors. They can do this by using apps such as barcode scanners and patient safety improves as a result. RFID (radio-frequency identification) technology also helps enhance patient care by providing information about the patient\u2019s vital signs, and temperature. It facilitates real-time tracking of location, communication, and identification. There are other ways in which technology has to improve patient care: 3D printing is now used to create prosthetics, customized dental devices, and even hearing aids. Virtual reality devices and apps help ease symptoms of depression and anxiety in older people and patients with mental illnesses and can also help people with their postoperative recovery process. The augmented reality now helps surgeons and their teams perform complex operations. Virtual and augmented reality devices can also help improve health and fitness outcomes among patients. With the availability of procedures like robotic knee replacement and the use of gene therapy in cancer treatment, it is evident that the role of technology in healthcare is bound to grow exponentially in the time to come. Information and Communication Technology Developments in information and communication technology are constantly improving and streamlining how the healthcare industry functions and how patients interact with their care providers. Medical experts have access to comprehensive research studies as well as diverse population groups that offer new insight into genetics, diseases and care outcomes. ",

            "answer_text": "I can answer about the impact of Electronic Medical Records for Offices and small clinics. I\u2019m the Operations Manager for a small Pediatric Clinic\u2014 meaning I\u2019m the Everything Guy, from \u2018Patient Needs a Letter\u2019 to \u2018I don\u2019t have Internet\u2019 to \u201cEww, there\u2019s a dead mouse!!!!\u201d We went thru a long arduous transition at my Clinic. Getting the staff used to interacting with the online program.Getting the Doctors to acknowledge that the Keyboard and Screen was sitting there and waiting for them in every patient room.Waiting for the screams of \u201cSomeone Get me the Chart!\u201d to disappear.Dealing with Medical Management or Pharmacy Management while trying to read Medical School Chicken ScratchThe never ending paper chase of trying to find the \u2018You Can\u2019t Find me, Ha Ha Ha!\u2019 pieces of paper when, I swear, a chart would literally sprout little cartoon legs and jump out of the cabinet and scamper off to the damndest places.Doctors who said, when I pointed towards the Keyboard and screen: \u201cOver My Dead Body!\u201dThen two Outside factors hit\u2014 The State Made Electronic Prescriptions MANDATORYHurricane Sandy blew in in October 2012 and the Patient File Cabinets swam with the fishesAdministrative Positives\u2014 Charts no longer run away. Point & Click and THERE IT IS. No more Doctor Chicken Scratch. Medication Names & Dosage, Symptoms and Diagnosis are clear readable FONTS. No More Guesswork. No more running to find the Doctor and asking \u201cWhat the heck is this scrawl?\u201d This means administrative staffers and nurses can directly and quickly deal with Medical Management, Pharmacy Management and Insurance Company Bureaucracy with greater efficiency. Pharmacy & Medication Formulary Issues becomes easier to deal with since the Medication and the patient\u2019s Medication HISTORY is LISTED in the EHR, all in one place. The Nurse or Doctor dealing with Formulary Prior Authorization issues has everything they need right there in front of them on the screen. It only takes a few mouse clicks to get to the relevant Insurance Formulary Website, read and decide whether to fight with Pharmacy Mgmt on the phone, or just go with the formulary suggestion. No More flipping through pages and pages of a paper chart to see what was dispensed in the past\u2026and then the doctor discovers that he or she cannot read the chicken scratch of his Associate \u2026 (This a Professional Pride thing. They\u2019ll never admit they can\u2019t read each other\u2019s chicken scratch!) Calls from Pharmacists because they couldn\u2019t read the Prescription chicken scratch are ELIMINATED. Less work for the Front Desk. Less Annoyance to the Doctors \u2026 (Again, they\u2019ll NEVER admit it!) HMO Insurance Quality Review\u2014 More and more insurances, especially with Pediatrics are engaging their practitioners in periodic Chart Reviews. EHR\u2019s take half the preparatory work out of Chart reviews. Again\u2014 Point & Click and there it is. The Doctor can still revisit and touch up or addendum their notes. Critical Patient Issues\u2014 With an EHR, it is now possible to flag patients according to various Critical issues such as Diagnosis (Diabetes, Heart problems, etc). You can pull up reports on who was seen in a time frame and decide to contact and follow up. When a Critical Patient is a paper chart\u2014 once the Chart in in the File Cabinet, it can be as if the patient ceases to exist until they call for an appointment. An EHR gives an office the capability to be proactive and truly preventative for a patient with Critical needs. Problematics of the EHR\u2014 Doctor Habits\u2014 It can take more effort for a doctor who\u2019s spent decades with Paper charts to adjust from a piece of paper to a Screen and Keyboard. Though I acidly joke about the chicken scratch issue\u2026to be fair it\u2019s also a personalized \u2018Short-hand\u2019 It\u2019s looks like chicken scratch to me \u2026 but to the Doctor, That Squiggle always means Dysphagia and that loopy swoop is always Children\u2019s Motrin. The Short-hand develops over time as a means of efficiently completing a chart for Patient A so the Doctor can move onto Patient B. The EHR re-imposes phrases and sentences. It demands the EXACT Diagnosis. Some EHR\u2019s demand that a Prescription be accompanied by a RELEVANT Diagnosis in the Visit Page. This means the Doctor has to slow down and re-learn new habits, or if the EHR allows, spend the extra time customizing the interface dropdowns\u2026and yes, that means the Doctor and ONLY THE DOCTOR must sit down in front of a screen for at least an Hour or so customizing. It\u2019s annoying\u2026but they only have to do it once. Staff Access to the Patient Chart\u2014 In the Good Ole Days, if you had the Chart folder in your hands, you could do whatever was needed, whether you were front desk or the Nurse or the Office Manager. Squiggle-swoop with the pen and then Boom-Boom with the stamp. Done. With the EHR, you may now have to deal with Login Specific Authority. A Front Desk Login may only be able to LOOK at a Chart and Make Appointments. The NURSE Login may only be limited to charts Notes and NOT prescriptions. Usually the DOCTOR has Full Authority to touch every part of the Chart, but in the past he relied on the Front Desk staffer to take care of what previously were just \u2018little details\u2019 If you are transitioning to a EHR\u2014 you need to query about LEVELS of Chart Access Authority. READING CHART INFORMATION & the Myth of the Paperless Office\u2014 This sounds a little ridiculous to some..but everyone has had a moment when they get an important document emailed to them. You CAN read a short two paragraph PDF on your laptop\u2026but if it\u2019s a long essay you click the PRINT button and then sit back and read it with more ease with the paper in your hand. This is normal. A Lot of Doctor\u2019s prefer to be handed the Specialist Report, the Xray Report, the Lab Report as paper in their hand. It\u2019s NO slower or Faster than reading it on the screen\u2026but it is EASIER on the Eyes. PLUS\u2014 it\u2019s helpful to the Doctor Patient interaction when the Doctor can do something While Facing the Patient. But let me tell you right now\u2026you will be doing a bit more Printing & Shredding than you realize. Doctor Patient Interaction\u2014 One common complaint that arose with the introduction of an EHR into a Patient room is Where the Doctor\u2019s ATTENTION WAS. With a Paper Chart, the chart would be in the Doctor\u2019s hand as they were engaging with the patient. Or even if the chart was on a desk, the Doctor would only casually deal with the paper, turning back to occasionally note something in his chicken-scratch short-hand. But the imposition of a Screen and Keyboard seems to ENFORCE the Doctor User to FOCUS on the Screen. You may need alternative desk/Screen placement scenarios or go the route of Separate Scribe personnel. And Never forget\u2014 there is still the TIME factor. You will need to allow a little extra time for a conscientious doctor to pickypeck his notes in and properly close the chart. Last Problematic \u2014 TECHNOLOGY If you only ever had to call your supplier to order chart folders and reams of paper\u2026you\u2019re in for a whole new ball game. PCs or Thinclients for each Patient RoomA Server for the ThinclientsThe OS for the Server\u2026(Oh No, you don\u2019t get that for Free!)NETWORK Infrastructure. A Firewall Router and a Switch. And NO\u2014 that Cheep! Cheep! Netgear from Staples ain\u2019t gonna cut it.NETWORK Infrastructure (again) Those things need to be CONNECTED. That means CABLING. And let me tell you from experience: WIRED ALWAYS WORKS.WIRELESS that ALWAYS WORKS\u2026Always Works because THAT Kind of Wireless is called ENTERPRISE WIRELESS. And You won\u2019t Find that at Staples\u2026.Printers\u2026you\u2019re gonna be doing a heck of a lot more Printing than you realize! DON\u2019T get the Cheep! Cheep! one.IT \u2026. You\u2019re gonna need someone to be your Tech Support. Figure it into your Budget and swallow it.And Believe me when I say it sardonically: \u2018Have Fun!\u2019 ",

            "answer_text": "One could write a novella to answer this question. You didn\u2019t put any limits on your question and the impact of technology is felt in EVERY aspect of healthcare. The impacts to patient care may be the greatest. Technology impacts diagnosis, treatment, and recovery. The business side is also impacted heavily through the increasing use of software to handle multiple processes. I think we are very much in a transition period that will last several years or more than a decade possibly. Getting existing members of the field up to speed on tech and adding new staff both clinical and office that are more comfortable with technology will take many more years but will have move forward some each year. All of this will lead to more transparency, better treatment, shorter recoveries, and overall better care. That is the goal of the technology gains we are making in this field. ",

            "answer_text": "If you are a clinician who is 35 or younger, paper charts have probably been a rare sighting during your career. If you are a mid- to late- career, however, you may yearn for the days when they were part of your routine. Perhaps it seems like simpler times when staff put each chart on the exam room door, and you thumbed through it before seeing the patient. Although that routine may seem simple, a paper chart came with many limitations, including: it could be used by only one person at a time;there was no way to access it from home or the hospital;clinical data reporting required manual abstraction, many human hours, and because of this - often a grant;you had to rely on your memory and a manual review of the Physician\u2019s Desk Reference (PDR) to avoid drug-drug interactions;once the patient left the exam room you essentially hoped for the best, because there was no practical way to manage the patient\u2019s condition or track progress remotely.Here are 5 reasons why technology is such an important part of healthcare today. 1. The efficiency of one, real time record, accessible to everyone, all the time 2. Significant clinical data for analysis and treatment 3. Improved medication safety. 4. Better medication reconciliation 5. Higher quality communication and connectivity ",
