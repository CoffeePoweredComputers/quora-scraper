            "answer_text": "When I drive small little cubes trigger me to anticipate possible situations. An example of chidren playing with a ball on the sidewalk. It occurs to me that the ball can roll into the street a a little child can emerge from between to parked cars so I prepare to brake. I am not sure that AI can anticipate predict what pedestrians aactions might be but highway driving where pedestrians are restricted a self driving mode may be safe enough and even more responsive than the state of mind the driver might be in a daydream. Highway driving can be much more hypnotic with those white lines just coming at you. I had noticed a big difference concerning my sleep apnea. I never really had a chance to fall asleep but on the highway I always had to pull off the road. This is also being implemented in the rail road systems because some of the most catastrophic train accidents were do to sleep apnea..Self driving capabilities could be a good back up system.a in any case ",

            "answer_text": "I think they are the future of motoring. I think they will evolve gradually from fancy cruise-control systems to something that you can just say \u201cDrive Me Home\u201d - and fall asleep with. I think we\u2019re only just beginning to glimpse the potential of these systems to improve human life. Even in their present primitive state - they are already saving lives. I recently spent $6,000 when I bought my Tesla to include the \u201cFuture Full Self Driving\u201d option. That was (in effect) a bet that this will happen. I\u2019m not usually a gambling man\u2026so I\u2019m fairly confident that we\u2019ll have this capability within a few years. ",
