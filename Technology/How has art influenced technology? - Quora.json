            "answer_text": "Interesting question but I would like to think that in our modern times \u2018technology is shaping art. The latter would be easy to answer since we have a proliferation of digital art which continues to gather pace due to the popularity of phones, tablets and computers. From the point of view that art changes technology, we have had centuries of development in this field. Imagine being propelled back to 200 years ago, there was no photography and artwork was cherished mainly by the upper class and rich establishments of that time. The drive towards improving the \u2018technology\u2019 in art became increasingly clear fueled by the demand. We had advances in brushes, pigments in color, improvements to canvases etc. This brought about changes to the mediums that was available to artist and as a result their artwork would have a different kind of aesthetic beauty. Examples include watercolors, acrylics, oils, pastels, graphite and so on. The advances in the artwork can be a result of these mediums taking shape allowing artists to expand their creativity. Perhaps the movements we have seen in the last centuries such as impressionism, pointillism, surrealism, abstract etc. is a reflection of this. Naturally, the demand for technical advances in the art field will be spurred on by people\u2019s craving for such artwork. The digital field is alive with many interesting works of art since many people can now venture into this without having the expensive computer or graphics tablets. Expect more artwork to be coming along in this way in the near future! ",
