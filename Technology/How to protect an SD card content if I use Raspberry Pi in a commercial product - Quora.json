Change the \u201cpi\u201d user password to a secure password. Additionally you could password protect or encrypt particular files or diectories that are particularly sensitive.

Encryption process mention in one of the answer is good idea but it is an experiment and also user need to enter password while booting. So it won't be automated process. ",
