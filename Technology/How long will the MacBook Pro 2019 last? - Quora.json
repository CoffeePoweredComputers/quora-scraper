            "answer_text": "Thanks for asking. I typically get around 5 years of use as a primary computer (4 under warranty with the extended AppleCare that takes the standard 1 year and adds 3). I usually stretch it another year with supported updates from Apple, and then effectively indefinite use as a secondary machine. Some supporting detail: You\u2019ve got your warranty, and if you take the AppleCare extension, it\u2019s good to take it in and get it checked over before that runs out (three additional years!). The current Pros, both 13 and 15, are also well equipped in terms of being powerful enough to keep handling additional work over the effective lifetime of the hardware, assuming you pick the right amount of storage and RAM. Since you are asking about how long it will last, I would also suggest that you err on the side of more RAM and storage space. Additional storage space in the solid state drive will also actually make it last longer, as current technology does actually wear, and the wear-leveling algorithm to distribute wear works better if there\u2019s more empty space. Now, that said, you can damage it unrepairably by physical damage or abuse or just bad luck and wear. Here\u2019s couple of data points: My elderly MacBook Pro 15 is completely dead, likely the thermal GPU failure that particular year was known for. I bought it used, replaced the battery, and for years of use out of it, so it doesn\u2019t owe me anything, and it\u2019s so old it\u2019s only barely worth repairing. My 2009 iMac is still running well; I upgraded the RAM and replaced the hard drive that was failing when it was 5 years old, and Apple kept supporting that model with releases for another 3 years. There\u2019s no guarantee that the 2019 model will have 8 years of support, but from a \u201cwill it have the hardware that\u2019s mainstream enough to keep supporting\u201d perspective, it\u2019s in a relatively recent hardware generation, so it should be similar enough to the next few years that it makes economic sense for Apple to keep supporting it.

            "answer_text": "Thanks for A2A, How long? I would have to give out few answers since you did not specify what you mean how long. 4 Points. How long the battery is: In practical situation, forget about lab situation, its battery would last up to 9hours (13in Macbook i5) and around 7hours for real work.How long the limited lifespan, imagine you use this machine for daily work, 40hours a week, in most time, you use battery. Then, it should be around 3yrs.As for the designed lifespan, it should be able to last like 3\u20134years within Apple care+ at least.Safely usage life, about 10years. Though many people would not abandon it even after that long time.Above ",
