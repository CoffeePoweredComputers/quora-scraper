            "answer_text": "Yes . Artificial intelligence in various forms will become part of \u2018 no contact\u2019 service. This has already happened in automobile sector and will get further excerberated . It would also result in layoffs and loss of incomes . Loss of incomes has huge consequences for growth and development. Wider applications in medical science , service to customers , cleaning and sanitation areas could become the preferred the mode . Also newer gadgets controlled by AI would also happen in home conditions . The effort of the well off and middle class would be keep human contact to the minimum. This would entail loss of jobs for the poor and the marginalized leading to different consequences for them and the society . It would also result in increase in distance between the haves and have nots . This could easily churn the society with joblessness increasing and huge income losses . This could be the scenario played out say over the next five years . One thing we can be sure of : the society will no longer be what it was pre pandemic in India. Edit one . I missed out on an example . I believe the institution of home serving Dhobis died out with middle class going in for installing washing machines . The dhobis of yesterday then became just \u2018 iron man \u2018 for survival or changed profession. ",
