            "answer_text": "In today\u2019s Digital era it is obvious that we will opt for digital even in the case of VISITING CARDS. Ahead are some points that you need to know about \u201cDIGI CARDS\u201d CREATION You can use apps to help make a digital visiting card, or \u2018digi Card\u2019. The problem is that technology is always growing and changing so you will have to update your virtual card along with it or it may become outdated. ALTERATIONS One problem that physical cards have is when you make a mistake with your phone number, email, or website details. You should never strike out the mistake or correct it with a pen. Writing on the card, unless specific to the customer, should be avoided at all costs. Thus, you will have to print a fresh batch of cards with every change you make, whether it is just one letter or an entire company rebranding. This is also why you should check and proofread your business cards before you print them out. Digital cards are so much simpler and easier to change. All you have to do is just type in the new changes. Digital cards can be edited whenever you want, so you can always keep them up-to-date. There\u2019s no need to fear that you might make a mistake. No doubt digital visiting cards are definitely better on this front. ADVANCE Digital cards are advanced. They look cooler than physical cards. So it will create a great impression on your client. MANAGEMENT/STORAGE Physical cards are more likely to end up lost. A visiting card file or holder is a great way to keep track of your physical visiting cards. You can organize the cards instead of leaving them scattered all over the place. For storing your own cards, get a good visiting card holder. Virtual cards are much easier to store and manage. You have the entire collection of cards sorted out for you. Since they\u2019re stored in an app, all one has to do is search for it in the search bar. Plus, since they can sort by company or person, they can find the details quickly. The only drawback is that the cards usually need internet access to view, but that is negligible. That\u2019s it!! These are the things why you need a digital visiting card. ",
