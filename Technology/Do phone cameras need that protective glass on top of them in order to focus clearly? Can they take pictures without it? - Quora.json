            "answer_text": "The protective bit of glass (often sapphire glass or higher-hardness Gorilla Glass than the rest of the phone) is there to, well, protect the phone\u2019s lens. It has absolutely nothing to do with focusing. Why? Well, two big reasons. The first one is that many phone cameras use very soft plastic lenses. So rather than expose a front lens element that would be scratched after your phone\u2019s first week of pocket life and the occasional lens-wipe-on-the-shirttail, it\u2019s behind a piece of glass that can only be scratched by diamonds and otherwise takes any likely abuse. The second reason is that just about any phone camera with image stabilization has a floating camera assembly. The front of the sensor assembly isn\u2019t fixed to the body of the phone at all. Without that protective cover, the area around the camera module would fill with all kinds of schmutz. Eventually, it wouldn\u2019t just fuzz out your shot, but get caught up in the works of the camera itself. So I know what you\u2019re thinking \u2014 maybe you know how image stabilization works in \u201creal\u201d cameras, eh? Well, maybe\u2026 there are actually three methods. The first is optical image stabilization (OIS), in which an element group in the lens is magnetically \u201cfloating\u201d. Motion detectors feed to the magnets controlling the float, causing the element to pivot and, within reason, to correct for that motion. And there\u2019s also in-body image stabilization (IBIS). This makes the sensor subassembly magnetically suspended. Motion detectors detect camera movement and offset that motion by tilting the sensor in various ways. But we can also stabilize a camera by moving the whole camera against motion. This is what gimbal mounts like Steadicams do.  Some tiny phone cameras have used OIS methods, but with such a small lens it\u2019s quite difficult. And it would be similarly difficult to move just the sensor. So why not move the whole camera: sensor, lens, and all. And so that\u2019s what the best image stabilization systems on phones do: they move the camera. But in order for that to work, the camera compartment has to be sealed from the outside. Thus the protective glass. The snippet of patent here, by the way, is from Apple. Plenty of companies had this sort of phone stabilization prior to Apple, but they have their own ideas about it, of course. ",

            "answer_text": "By \u201cprotective glass\u201d are you referring to the gorilla glass covering phone\u2019s camera lenses. If so, then yes. You wouldn\u2019t need it if you put you\u2019re phone on a flat surface with no foreign particles. Otherwise, you do. Think about it, you carry your phone with you and your pocket and it\u2019s usually not there alone. Usually you have keys or something metallic like a lighter. The point is without glass your lenses are extremely vulnerable to the environment. Don\u2019t worry too much about the glass itself being damaged. Most high-end smartphones use gorilla glass or sapphire to prevent any scratches (visible ones at least). Your keys are usually made of a softer brass so even then the likelyhood of scratch marks appearing on the lenses are rare. I hope i answered your question :) ",
