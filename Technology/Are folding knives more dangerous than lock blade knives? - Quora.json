            "answer_text": "Are folding knives more dangerous than lock blade knives? This question has existed since the first non-fixed knife was invented. The answer is simple; it is dangerous if you don\u2019t know it\u2019s not a non-locking knife. You approach a slipjoint folder with the same methods and handling you\u2019d used for a fixed-blade knife, yes, it can close on your fingers. However, this almost entirely requires you to be pressing firmly on the point of the knife in a stabby/pokey fashion\u2026which is not how the knife was designed and not what it\u2019s made for. In a slipjoint folding knife there\u2019s a spring that holds the blade in the open position. As long as you\u2019re applying force with the knife blade against that spring as you cut, you\u2019re fine. When the blade opens all the way and stops, apply force with the sharpened side of the blade, not the spine. If you keep this in mind, you\u2019ll have very few problems. Additionally, if the knife is kept sharp\u2026you shouldn\u2019t be needing to apply the kind of force that makes the knife design a factor. The edge should *cut* when it touches something it can cut. If you\u2019re having to get the power of your forearm, elbow, and shoulder into the effort, you\u2019re handling a knife dull enough that it\u2019s presenting a danger to you no matter what design. Or you\u2019re trying to make a cut the knife just can\u2019t make. You\u2019re not cutting through a piece of oak as thick as your wrist in a single slice with a three-inch blade. Rule #1 of Physics that\u2019s not in the books; all physics is relative to Murphy\u2019s Law. If it\u2019d be bad for this knife to slip because you\u2019re applying too much force, it will and at the worst possible moment. How would I define worst? I\u2019ve got a nice scar and a memory of four stitches at the knuckle of my left thumb. The carving project I was doing was going nicely and the design was really coming together. My carving knife was getting a little bit blunt but I had only had a little bit left to do so I didn\u2019t strop it; why make it like a lightsaber now when I always sharpen-to-hair-popping after every session and would be sharpening, carving for fewer than ten minutes, and then sharpening again? Meh, leave it, it\u2019s still plenty sharp enough. Came up to a knot in the wood and, because the blade wouldn\u2019t swish through it, I tried more force. Ah, can\u2019t grip it well, so shift my grip a bit, lever the knife in, and woops. Right into my thumb to the bone. One internal stitch, three external. (Ah, the fun and joys of being old enough to know better, but being too young to care. Glad I grew up some.) Folding knives are designed to be used in ways that compliment their design. Even with a lock-back, I\u2019d be leery to apply a lot of force against the lock because the lock was built in a manner chosen to generate a market-priced knife and could be faulty. Victorinox is one of the most prolific knife companies in the world with their Swiss Army Knife designs that have stood the test of time using the basic slipjoint non-locking design. In the hands of someone sensible to use the knife as designed, it is as safe as anything else in that person\u2019s hands. If you need an ice-pick to do stabby work with high force on the same axis as the blade, get an ice-pick. People often get one concept wrong in relation to knives. \u201cThe knife cut me\u201d or \u201cThe knife slipped and bit me!\u201d Nope. My carving knife didn\u2019t cut me; I cut me because I was stupid, the knife just helped by allowing my stupidity to become relevant in the moment. When you pick up any knife, look at it, grasp the blade (not on the cutting side) and wiggle it. Which way does it move easiest? Oh, toward the way the blade folds into the handle? Then in the course of use, don\u2019t force the blade to bend/flex/fold that direction. Be smarter than the knife you\u2019re using. It\u2019s plain stupid, only does what you direct it to do. Since it doesn\u2019t have a brain at all, you have to use yours. If, for some reason, that\u2019s not possible\u2026lay the knife down and ask somebody else to use it for you. Additionally, you have a standard lock-back like the Buck 110 folder? It\u2019s got a lock and it\u2019s a good sturdy lock, but it can still fail. Remember what I said about Murphy\u2019s Law? If it\u2019d be a really bad time for that lock to fail, it will fail at that moment. A friend of mine broke a liner-lock knife and it left a beautiful scar along the back of all four of his fingers. You can look at the line of the scars and see how he was holding the knife when the lock failed. Just because this blade can be locked open or closed, it\u2019s a fool\u2019s errand to rely on that too heavily because that lock can fail. The knife doesn\u2019t know the difference between what you want to cut and what you don\u2019t want to cut because it doesn\u2019t have a brain, use yours. ",

            "answer_text": "Folding knives come in a lot of varieties and with many different styles of locking or non-locking mechanisms to hold the blade in the open position. The simple old jackknife style uses a flat leaf spring and cam action to hold the blade(s) in position, open and closed. Lock blade folders use liner locks, frame locks, lock back, axis locks, and others, to keep the blade in the open position until it is intentionally released. A jackknife can accidentally close if pressure is put on the back of the blade, possibly catching the fingers under the sharp edge. Locking blades are not supposed to do that. However, neither style will normally have a well defined quillion or hand guard like most fixed blade knives, so the hand can slip onto the blade with forward pressure, stabbing motion. ",

This prevents any accidental nicks and cuts. A properly stored fixed blade knife takes up a lot more space and can get in the way if not worn effectively. A fixed blade also signals to people that you\u2019re carrying a potentially lethal weapon. Depending on where you are, this may or may not be a disadvantage. ",
