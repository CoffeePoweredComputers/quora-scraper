            "answer_text": "Velodyne Lidar is still the preferred choice for most autonomous vehicle development groups, however there are many different Lidar manufacturers for different applications. Ibeo markets Lidar systems to use in validating camera/radar ADAS systems. Neptech technologies markets high end Lidar with higher range for applications like giant shipping boats, military helicopters etc\u2026 In general though the high quality Lidars on the market (the ones that would generally be used for self driving cars) are quite expensive.
