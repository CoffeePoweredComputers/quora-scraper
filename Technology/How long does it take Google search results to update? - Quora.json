            "answer_text": "Good question, but ambiguous. The simplest answer,,, It\u2019s updating the search results 24/7 and is an ongoing process that never ends. I personally think you meant\u2026\u2026. How long it takes to update the indexed content of a website. Each site is actually treated differently. Important sites, like the New York Times are crawled \u201cOFTEN\u201d and \u201cMEASURED IN HOURS\u201d. Where as you may have a site that is a blog about where to take your next vacation. If your site was the #1 vacation site of the world you could expect the same crawl rate, but as is most cases, it realistically takes days or weeks. Just for the record, most sites take about two weeks. So don\u2019t expect to see improvements in search results for two weeks when you update content on your site. So if you want to know how long it takes for you site, do the following. Do a search with a term that you now shows your site. Look at the cache date and record that date. Now you monitor that particular search and check the cache date for the page every couple of days. When you see the date change you have your answer. You compare the two dates and then you know how often Google will update your content in the index. As I stated above, generally it is two weeks, ( 14 days ) for most sites that have traffic. If your site is not popular it could take much longer. ",
