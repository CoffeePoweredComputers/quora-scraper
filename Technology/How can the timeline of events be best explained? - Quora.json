            "answer_text": "hi Utsav, I have very minimal knowledge on Worm holes and black holes, This has lot to do with quantum physics and Relativity.Even i am trying to understand them as its evolving every day and Thanks for asking.  As far as the movie is concerned , if you are good with the Indian Puranas, This movie would have been a known subject for you. The Last scene were cooper meets older murph, were she become older due to relativity, is already been recorded in our puranaDuring the period of krutha yuga (1st yuga), Kustuba (name may be wrong) had a daughter called Revati, since she was so beautiful, he was not able to find a good match , hence he went to brahma loka ..to ask brahma, when he reached brahma loka brahma told that he is in a very strong time relativity hence 1 min in brahma loka is some years on Earth. So when revathi came back its was dwapara yuga ..at that the time the best match for her was found to be balaram brother of krishna. This shows a strong time dilation. ThanksSoman ",
