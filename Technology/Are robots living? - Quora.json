            "answer_text": "Ah, life. The conundrum of life. Did you know that viruses are technically not living beings in a strict biological, chemical sense? Although they can reproduce, they need a host cell to do so. The definition of life is a tricky question that even biologists can argue about. So are robots living beings? No, at least not right now, according to my own definition of \u201calive\u201d. I am more inclined to use a more systemic view on the matter, instead of a strict chemical one. In my opinion living beings need to have some kind of \u201cdrive\u201d to keep spreading the fire of live. Either by helping others or by helping themselves. This drive can take on many forms. From reproducing, to helping friends in need, to the plain old fight or flight response used for self preservation in times of dire need. It does not even have to be constrained to one species. Raising a dog from pup to old age, and afterwards mourning the loss of a dear friend is definitely a meaningful and emotional experience that counts in my book. Robots are not alive, since they currently are mindless things, programmed to do a few specific tasks and to do them well. Yes, they can \u201clearn\u201d to do these specific tasks from huge amounts of data or many many tries, but they do not have this \u201cdrive\u201d to keep live from burning out. This does not mean that artificial live can never be possible. If, because of any mysterious case of events, we can produce sentient robots that can love and care for others (and themselves, everyone deserves some love for themselves!)\u2026 \u2026 then robots will be alive from my point of view!

            "answer_text": "Kind of. Biologically no. They don't have any living cell. Software wise, yes. A software process is said to be \u201calive\u201d or \u201crunning\u201d when is in an active state. Since the robot is running a program, when it is working it is \u201calive\u201d. All around a robot could be said to be alive if it reacts to environment and can move. Tough differently than biological beings, the mind can be backed up, and restored. Religiously most of the religions agree that robots are not alive. Phylosophically what is life after all? Are we alive? ",
