            "answer_text": "It's a lot like the differences between kittens, potatoes and purple. Entirely independent concepts with very minimal overlap with the minor exception that both kittens and potatoes can in some circumstances be purple. Ethernet has a reasonably specific meaning.  It is a set of hardware and protocol specifications for creating a local area network.  That puts it at layer one and two. An Intranet is essentially a private region of the internet.  Using any of a variety of techniques a business (typically) will wall off one or more subnetworks.  Its protocols are the same as the internet in general, in some cases with more permissive security under the assumption that internal users are trustworthy.  Conceptually an Intranet is a layer 3/4 construct. So what is the difference, well... they are almost entirely different.  The intersection between them is that an Intranet is almost certainly using Ethernet at the physical and data link layers. Homework assignment:  OSI model ",

            "answer_text": "The Internet is a collection of networks that uses the Internet Protocol (IP), and that collection of networks, both public and private, span the globe. An intranet, by contrast, is a private or corporate network that uses IP, and the term may refer to a web-based portal in a private network or a VPN that is used within an organization and it\u2019s partners and/or customers. It is usually not accessible from the Internet without an additional encrypted tunnel or proxy. Ethernet is a completely different animal. It is used to encapsulate or carry internet protocol traffic, among other network layer protocols. Ethernet is used to form a local are network (LAN), the scope of which might be a room, a house, a data center, an office, a building, a campus, etc. Ethernet can be extended to a metropolitan area by leasing an Ethernet connection from a metro Ethernet or metropolitan area network (MAN) provider. Since Ethernet is an underlying set of protocols that define the physical media and the media access control, it can carry network layer protocols like IP and, therefore, be used to build an intranet or be used as Internet infrastructure.
