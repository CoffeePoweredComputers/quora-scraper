            "answer_text": "No one actually knows. There are trends beginning to offer signs as to where humanity is headed. Overpopulation will be a significant factor on many levels. Religious and political fanaticism another. Economic viability a very important factor. And, of course, nuclear proliferation and epidemics of unknown biological agents offer truly scary scenarios. Food and energy production/consumption will be the most critical factors as to where humanity goes in the future. Plus, social and political decay will also be major factors. I have become absolutely convinced that a nuclear device will be used as a \"terrorist\" event in the very near future. And the consequences of this action will be unbelievably dramatic, drastic and far reaching. Moreover, I wouldn't be too quick to believe or accept the media offered \"causalities\" behind this event. If a self supporting, growing human colony can be established somewhere off planet, this may lend credence to a more permanent existence for humans in this universe. Otherwise, things are not looking that positive. ",

            "answer_text": "Fifty centuries ago a great Aryan sage looked into the future and told us what to expect. . .An  address based on the Srimad-Bhagavatam of Krsna-Dvaipayana Vyasa,   given by His Divine Grace A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada in Los   Angeles during the summer of 1974.Excerpted from Back to Godhead Magazine\u201cMy  dear King, with each day religion, truthfulness,  cleanliness,  forgiveness, mercy, duration of life, bodily strength, and  memory will  all decrease more and more by the mighty force of time.\u201d (Srimad-Bhagavatam 12.2.1)This  description of the Kali-yuga [the present Age of Quarrel and   Hypocrisy] is given in the Twelfth Canto of Srimad-Bhagavatam.   Srimad-Bhagavatam was written five thousand years ago, when the   Kali-yuga was about to begin, and many things that would happen in the   future are spoken of there. Therefore we accept Srimad-Bhagavatam as   sastra [revealed scripture]. The compiler of sastra (the sastra-kara)   must be a liberated person so that he can describe past, present, and   future.In Srimad-Bhagavatam you will find many things which are  foretold.  There is mention of Lord Buddha\u2019s appearance and Lord  Kalki\u2019s  appearance. [Lord Kalki will appear at the end of the  Kali-yuga.] There  is also mention of Lord Caitanya\u2019s appearance,  although the Bhagavatam  was written five thousand years ago. Tri-kala-jna: the writer knew past, present, and future.So here Sukadeva Gosvami is describing the chief symptoms of this age. He says,tatas canudinam: with the progress of this age (Kali-yuga), dharma, religious principles; satyam, truthfulness; saucam, cleanliness; ksama,forgiveness; daya, mercifulness; ayur, duration of life; balam, bodily strength; smrti, memory\u2014these eight things will gradually decrease to nil or almost nil.Of  course, there are other yugas besides Kali-yuga. During the   Satya-yuga, which lasted eighteen hundred thousand years, human beings   lived for one hundred thousand years. The duration of the next age, the   Treta-yuga, was twelve hundred thousand years, and the people of that   age used to live for ten thousand years. In other words, the duration  of  life was ten times reduced. In the next age, Dvapara-yuga, the life   span was again ten times reduced\u2014people used to live for one thousand   years\u2014and the duration of the Dvapara Age was eight hundred thousand   years. Then, in the next age, this Kali-yuga, we can live up to one   hundred years at the utmost: We are not living one hundred years, but   still, the limit is one hundred years. So just see: from one hundred   years the average duration of life has decreased to about seventy  years.  And it will eventually decrease to the point where if a man  lives for  twenty to thirty years, he will be considered a very old man.Another symptom of the Kali-yuga predicted in the Srimad-Bhagavatam is the decrease in memory (smrti). We see nowadays that people do not have very sharp   memories\u2014they forget easily. They may hear something daily, yet still   they forget it. Similarly, bodily strength (balam) is decreasing. You   can all understand this, because you know that your father or   grandfather was physically stronger than you are. So, bodily strength  is  decreasing, memory is decreasing, and the duration of life is   decreasing\u2014and all of this is predicted in Srimad-Bhagavatam.Another symptom of Kali-yuga is the decrease in religion.   There is practically no question of religion in this age\u2014it has almost   decreased to nil. No one is interested in religion. The churches and   temples are being closed, locked up. The building we are sitting in was   once a church, but it was sold because no one was coming. Similarly,  we  are purchasing a very big church in Australia, and in London I have  seen  many hundred of vacant churches\u2014no one is going there. And not  only  churches: in India also, except for a few important temples, the   ordinary, small temples are being closed. They have become the   habitation of the dogs. So dharma(virtue), religion, is decreasing. Source: http://www.dailystormer.com/symp... ",
