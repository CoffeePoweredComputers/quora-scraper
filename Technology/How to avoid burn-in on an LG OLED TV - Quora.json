            "answer_text": "The short answer is you can\u2019t. The nature of OLEDs is that the blue phosphor will age faster than the others. The TV compensates for this phenomenon by keeping track of every pixel\u2019s run time and intensity history, and stores this history of every pixel in protected memory on the control board. As the blue (particularly) phosphor darkens, the TV increases the drive to the pixel using it\u2019s learned map to compensate. The screen seems unburned but it\u2019s actually masked. This is apparent when the OLED control board (where the memory is kept) is replaced. With no mapping of pixel history for the original screen, the burns appear out of nowhere in full glory. Now, the longer answer is that you can mitigate the burn by reducing the contrast/picture control. The TV as delivered drives the pixels way too hard. Pick up a calibration DVD (assuming you still have a player) and follow calibration procedures, particularly for black level and contrast. Or, simply reduce the contrast/picture control by half..

I use my OLED primarily for watching movies and TV series (without logos on them) and the risk of burn-in is absolutely minimal as the image constantly changes. Using OLED for computer work or gaming might lead to burn in, which is why I don\u2019t use it for those things. Also, I don\u2019t play video games. ",
