            "answer_text": "Now that public cloud has reached a key peak in growth, there\u2019s a common theme. While new services and products continue to develop, more and more of them are focusing on not just creating capabilities that were previously lacking \u2013 they\u2019re focused on optimizing what already exists. Here are 3 key trends we see for the future of cloud computing: Containers Become Mainstream: Application containerization is more than just a new buzz-word in cloud computing; it is changing the way in which resources are deployed into the cloud. More and more companies utilized containers in 2018. This is another trend that will continue into 2019 and beyond. How it Optimizes: at a development level, containerization allows applications to be developed and deployed faster than ever before. If used efficiently, they can also result in a lower cloud bill.Multi-Cloud and Hybrid Cloud: Once predicted as the future, the time of multi-cloud and hybrid cloud has arrived and will continue to grow. Most enterprises (74 percent) described their strategy as hybrid/multi-cloud in 2018. In addition, 62 percent of public cloud adopters are using 2+ unique cloud environments/platforms. These numbers will only go up in 2019. While this offers plenty of advantages to organizations looking to benefit from different cloud capabilities, using more than one CSP complicates governance, cost optimization, and cloud management further as native CSP tools are not multi-cloud. As cloud computing costs remain a primary concern, it\u2019s crucial for organizations to stay ahead with insight into cloud usage trends to manage spend (and prevent waste). How it Optimizes: it\u2019s a complex problem, but we do see many organizations adopting a multi-cloud strategy with cost control in mind, as it avoids vendor lock-in and allows flexibility for deploying workloads in the most cost-efficient manner (and at a high level, keeps the cloud providers competitive against each other to continually lower prices).Growth of Managed Services: The global cloud managed services market grew rapidly in 2018 and is expected to reach USD 82.51 billion by 2025, according to a study conducted by Grand View Research, Inc. Enterprises are focusing on their primary business operations, which results in higher cloud managed services adoption. Business services, security services, network services, data center services, and mobility services are major categories in the cloud managed services market. Implementation of these services will help enterprises reduce IT and operations costs and will also enhance productivity of those enterprises. How it Optimizes: managed service providers \u2013 the good ones, anyway \u2013 are experts in their field and some of the most informed consumers of public cloud. By handing cloud operations off to an outside provider, companies are not only optimizing their own time and human resources \u2013 they\u2019re also pushing MSPs to become efficient cloud managers so they can remain competitive and keep costs down for themselves and their customers.Everything is pointing toward optimization.

            "answer_text": "Reproduced from my blog Cloud Computing Future Trends The rise of the hybrid cloudHybrid clouds feature an infrastructure that combines private cloud security with cost-effective, powerful and scalable public cloud attributes. IT executives get more choices for personalized solutions while big data advocates and security experts are still satisfied. As hybrid models become mainstream, more companies are likely to adopt this cloud deployment model. Big data AnalyticsMany organizations are realizing that it may be much simpler and more beneficial to combine big data analytics with cloud computing than to choose one over the other Big data as a service seems like one of the most practical options for big data analytics, as it is scalable and within the reach of any organisation, no matter its size or resources. These cloud providers are also overcoming the technical barrier by transforming Hadoop from an open source platform to an enterprise-ready service, all without the need for a data scientist. Graphics as a ServiceTypically, running high-end graphics applications requires substantial hardware infrastructure investment. However, cloud computing is changing this reality. There are a number of new cloud-based graphics technologies from prominent graphics companies, including NVIDIA and AMD that allow end users to run high-end graphic design applications with a simple HTML5 web browser. Identity Management and ProtectionSecurity has always been a major concern with cloud computing. As more businesses move more information and data into cloud servers, this concern is more important than ever. It is anticipated that over the few years, there will be identity management solutions based on new cloud based security paradigms. Web-Powered AppsAs efficiency and scalability are among the primary benefits of cloud computing, then it only makes sense to start developing cloud-based applications that are compatible with multiple platforms. Standardization will take center-stageThe cloud ecosystem today is characterized by a plethora of standards, mostly unique to service providers and therefore incompatible with other platforms. Currently more than 160 different standards govern cloud computing systems. This situation has the potential to dampen the growth prospects of the cloud. The shift towards common or open standards for cloud deployments will be central to the development of the cloud model, especially if features like interoperability and portability are to be realized. Consortiums like the Open Data Center Alliance (ODCA), framed to focus attention on the crying need for a dependable framework to progress the evolution of organizational standards, that streamline the cloud journey, will grow in stature.
