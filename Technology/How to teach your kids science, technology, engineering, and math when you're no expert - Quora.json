            "answer_text": "A huge piece of this answer comes from the notion that education is based on layers, and that we don\u2019t start teaching 1st graders plate tectonics or the quadratic equation for a reason. Education in all its forms is in the shape of a \u201cV\u201d, with the bottom being where EVERYONE starts out, meaning not knowing much of anything, then, as you get older, you learn the building blocks that will act as stepping stones to help you learn more complicated things in the future. (We call them \u201chooks\u201d, as in \u201cstudents are instructed to \u2018hook\u2019 their new knowledge to their existing knowledge\u201d. This is what is called learning. We, meaning humanity, all do it this way and have done so since time immortal.) I am ASSUMING you are asking the question from the premise that, say, elementary school and middle school teachers (and even into high school) are not experts, correct? Sure, once you get into college, then the level of necessary expertise does indeed increase, but for me, a 6th-grade teacher of math and science, I don\u2019t need to be an \u2018expert\u2019 in much of anything. However, please do not forget we teachers ARE college graduates and have passed exams that say we at least know enough to teach our assigned competencies. Lastly, please rest assured that the understanding of science and scientific concepts is (thankfully) well documented, especially these days where one has a tremendous amount of material at our disposal. And math is math - not terribly challenging if you\u2019re competent. So, what knowledge one needs to teach at any given level of education is \u2018out there\u2019 and, again for a competent, intelligent \u201cteacher\u201d, it should be a given we\u2019re able to find and understand the material that is supposed to be taught. (There is a reason why I am not asked to teach, nor expected to teach, music or art.) The real skill, or expertise, is in the delivery of information. Disseminating info from one person to the next is the challenging part. Why is one teacher considered \u201cterrible\u201d and one \u201cgood\u201d? The difference between one and the other largely comes down to only a handful of things. Teaching in a classroom setting of 30 kids (as opposed to a one-on-one setting, which is a HUGELY different animal) a teacher has to have control of the classroom (to provide a supportive learning environment), an innate ability to read whether the student is absorbing what is being taught, and (to what your question gets at), the competencies to deliver correct, accurate information that is understandable.

            "answer_text": "Take the help of technology. It is accessible to your finger tips. So much information is available on the internet, you can look for illustrations of principles which are explained in layman's terms. Look for websites which have simulations of complex experiments with explanation. Sometimes complex phenomena are explained in simple terms with the help of experiments. Many do it yourself experiments are suggested which can be tried at home on your own. Many books are available in the market which explain concepts of science in a simple and logical manner. I remember long back Doordarshan used to run a science based program called \u201c Kyon air kyse\u201d which would explain many phenomena that occur around us in a logical manner. Go to science museums, you can observe lot of models that illustrate many science principles. Science and mathematics are based on logic. Anyone who has good amount of common sense and reasoning should be able to understand elementary science and mathematics with some effort. Brush up your basics with the help of all the above tools which are at your disposal and then I am sure you will be able to teach them some fundamentals. You may not be able to solve complex problems or do huge derivations but atleast you will be able to extend reasonable help to your children. ",
