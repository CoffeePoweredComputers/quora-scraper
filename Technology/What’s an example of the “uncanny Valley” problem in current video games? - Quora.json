            "answer_text": "Edit:I might\u2019ve answered a bit different question than what was meant, so I added this first paragraph.The uncanny valley refers to human and human-like characters that are clearly recognisable as such, but not quite natural. My answer below is a bit of an angle from that, as in what other aspects of CGI feels unnatural in games. I think we\u2019re past worst of the uncanny valley problems with human characters in games(and movies). Not because all of game characters are realistic, not at all, but most are good enough to not weird you out - and we have the know-how from decades of movie VFX on how to create lifelike characters, that we can leverage for games as tech gets better.A hilarious example of the classic uncanny valley problem would be Mass Effect Andromeda:  Some of the best quality we can create in commercial game can be found in Senua\u2019s Sacrifice, which is closing in on movie quality though not quite there yet.  I think physics is one of the valleys that have been left uncanny for so long that we don\u2019t even care. Our games basically have no material properties other than visual rendering and a simple friction value. Objects cannot break other than by pre-fracturing or creating low-resolution fractal chunks of it(and this is already advanced and rarely seen, for some examples: Force Unleashed and Red Faction: Guerrilla). Our character joints break and act un-naturally in any little bit difficult situation; the meshes go inside each other and the colliders on everything are heavy heavy approximations instead of the actual surfaces of meshes(for example collider for a head is a sphere or a capsule, not the actual head shape). We don\u2019t have muscles for almost anything, clothing is simulated rarely or barely, liquid is just a surface plane and some effects,etc.Muscle and skin physics would help a lot for the human characters level of realism as well. The problem with all of this is of course lack of processing power and great enough algorithms. Basically it\u2019s a mess that somehow manages to look very impressive every now and then, especially in limited scenarios, but it\u2019s mostly because we expect almost nothing from the physics. Things falling and a heavy thing being heavier than a light thing is pretty much it. There are new physics algorithms being developed of course and a lot of this is getting better. I\u2019m personally waiting for someone to create a seamless game-physics engine that has some kind of molecular-level properties for everything.Well, I mean that\u2019s DMM from Force Unleashed, but that\u2019s what I want, but better. Why didn\u2019t we follow that route with physics I ask?  Here are some recent advancements, though it\u2019s difficult to say when these kind of things come available for game devs as tools:    ",

            "answer_text": "Mass Effect Andromeda, it suffered heavily. The characters tried to emulate human facial motion without knowing the ingredients, they looked human enough untill they started talking, then they looked so unhuman it broke the immersion. What also didn't help was the frankly badly written conversations, such as the infamous \u201csorry, my face is tired\" which while something someone would say, would most likely be said by someone that doesn't natively speak english. English speakers would instead talk about headaches or being tired. I like to think of the uncanny valley as being 2 parts face and 1 part behaviour, if they look human, they can be brought down by horribly written behaviour and vice versa, people will not feel comfortable with a bad looking character staring at them while speaking with well written lines. It can get creepy or just toss immersion to the side. We can make human characters that look and feel human, it takes a lot of effort and a lot of time, but it works. Like in Detroit: Become Human, they got around mildly off behaviour by having most characters be androids. People are more likely to believe the off behaviour as being part of the universe and not just bad game design. ",
