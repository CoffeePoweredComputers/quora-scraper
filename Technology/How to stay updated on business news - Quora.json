            "answer_text": "To stay updated on business news, you should read periodicals* that focus on business in general and periodicals that focus on the industries you are interested in. In addition, read general news to gain knowledge of world and national happenings and politics that can impact business. Finally, pay attention to technology that can impact industries of interest.  You should also read applicable business texts and books, attend classes etc. as the knowledge you gain that way is often a distillation of information gleaned from many many sources.  Don't just rely on the Internet solely. Unless the periodical in question publishes an image of the issue, you might miss some things that could be of interest. The best piece of investment information I found was a three line blurb in the Wall Street Journal. Had I not seen it in print, I doubt it would have caught my attention on a computer screen.  * I used the word periodicals, above, for simplicity. You should interpret that word to mean newspapers, magazines, books, pamphlets etc. found at a newsstand or bookstore as well as their equivalent on the Internet.  ",

            "answer_text": "Like many others answered, in order to stay up to date you need to stay connected as many ways as possible. With internet, books, magazines, etc. it\u2019s easy to stay up to date but knowing what the best options to pay attention to helps you to do it efficiently. I am personally subscribed to Businessweek magazine and get a ton of great information for business in the US and globally- https://www.bloomberg.com/businessweek/subscribe Business tv channels (like Bloomberg) also help keep an update on the DOW and provide news on everything pertaining to the stock market. Local business news can usually be found in local newspapers or their websites. It\u2019s important to remember that business news on a large scale can vary greatly to small businesses in your state or hometown and keeping up with both of them can help keep your knowledge up immensely. If you can, daily or weekly email newsletters to your inbox can also help you get your daily dose of news in a quick way. ",
