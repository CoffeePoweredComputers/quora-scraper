            "answer_text": "I like this question. I will share with you what I think is true. Can\u2019t prove anything one way or the other. A functional human is made up of two parts, the hardware shell (the body) and the operating system [Windows/Mac/Linux] (the soul). The human doesn\u2019t function properly without both. The soul can function all by itself without the body. When the soul is within the body and functioning as a human, the soul is limited to the functions of the body and the brain. In other words, a human is a dumbed down version of the soul. We don\u2019t really die. The soul lives on, the body and brain dies. We define death when the body and brain dies. The good news is the soul lives on, forever. The soul is our true consciousness. The soul is a concentration of energy that is self-aware. We never lose this self-awareness. When we leave a non functioning body, we are met by our spiritual guide and some loved ones who have already passed into the afterlife. There is no pain or misery in the afterlife. We feel overwhelming love and see fantastic beauty. It\u2019s a wonderful \u201cstate\u201d and we prefer it over physical incarnations. Incarnating into physical hosts gives us the opportunity to learn what I call the six major life lessons. They are love, compassion, compersion, humility, forgiveness, and patience. In order to thoroughly learn these lessons, we must experience both the positive and negative aspects of these lessons. The positive sides are great, but the negative sides can be quite painful. This explains a lot of the pain people suffer through life. The other pain people feel is karmic paybacks. We must feel the pain that we cause others. If I cause pain to another, I must feel that pain, in return, to balance it out. This process is commonly known as negative karma or paying off karmic debts. For me, I will hold on to my physical life here as long as I can. I still have more to do here, and much more that I can learn in this life. I also know the afterlife will be great and it will be a really nice break between physical incarnations. Eventually, I will get to the point where it won\u2019t be necessary for me to incarnate into physical hosts any longer, and I can enjoy the afterlife, permanently. ",

            "answer_text": "Wow!!! Awakening of the dead In literal context, certainly livings are not qualified to answer this question. But hold on!!! Do you think that Luv is dead? What??? My Oh My!!! He is still alive and trying to understand the several meanings of dead. Okay, continuing our journey, the first dead to come across us is a zombie. And their existence is undeniable - at least on Luv\u2019s iPhone dictionary;  And we have references as well to support our theory:  When zombies all around, certainly the place is so dead. Would you still consider zombieses to be in their pedagogic state of mind to enlighten you the advantages of their existence? Hmmm\u2026  On second thought\u2026. Oh yes!!! They are always looking for warm blooded humans as their disciples. Why are we running away? Or have we found the way to deal with them? The second hault in the journey has rendezvous with when we are made to work like a beast of burden and the lion hunter would not stop whipping us. Tired! Dead tired!!!  Oh yeah!!! And anybody can tell how it's like to be dead in bed after dead tired :  Awesome. Do L\u00fcvv still need to impart the advantages of this form of dead ? (Ah! Forget it! You're already dead\u2026) And then there are few dawn of our life when we are like Walking dead:  There's no further explanation that Luv could give satisfactorly, because this is a clinical issue and Amy E. Brown is more qualified to answer this medical condition. (Hey! Amy, would you like to tell the readers about this walking dead condition? ) Let's keep the ball rolling and we are now seriously dead!!! You gotcha !!! This dead\u2026  I don't know what John did but am sure he must have pissed off daddy red and blue. I wonder how advantageous is such situation. Honey, don't contemplate anything. DO NOT ENVISAGE ANYTHING. YOU ARE DEAD WITHOUT ENJOYING ANY PRIVILEGE OF BEING DEAD!!! ",
