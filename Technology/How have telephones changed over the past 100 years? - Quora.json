            "answer_text": "Some old phones in the 1920s were \u201ccandlestick\u201d phones. Most of the box-on-the-wall phones with no dial but a crank (to get some electricity into the system and alert the operator that her attention was required) had disappeared by 1920, at least in towns and cities.  Kellogg model 44 candlestick phone (about 1920). The ear piece and mouth piece are entirely separate. Phones used to be quite heavy. I think my grandmother\u2019s was made of some sturdy metal, as I remember as a child struggling to lift the handset!  Phone similar to my grandmother\u2019s: a metal swivel plate dial phone with a typical braided cloth-covered cord.  Our phone looked like this. It looked a lot like Grandma\u2019s, but was sturdy plastic instead of metal. Note the neat little drawer in the bottom. It had space to write down your frequently dialled numbers. Our phone at home was of some sort of very, very sturdy plastic (probably bakelite). Both Grandma\u2019s and our phones were black, which was the only colour available (at least from Bell Systems in the USA; elsewhere there seems to have been some choice). The handset was linked to the body of the phone by a thick, cloth-covered cord, often braided, with another, similar cord linking the telephone itself to the telephone outlet on the wall. These phones all had a dial. To dial a number, you stuck a finger in the hole with the number you wanted, turned the dial clockwise until your finger met a metal \u201cfinger stop\u201d, then you pulled your finger out to let the dial return to its rest position. As it returned to the rest position, the phone \u201cclicked\u201d the number you\u2019d just dialled (dialling six produced a rapid click-click-click-click-click-click as it returned to the rest position). At the local exchange, this caused a series of electro-mechanical gears to twist the requisite number of places and then to connect to the next gear in the sequence.  Strowger gear step-by-step exchange (Youtube of AT&T training film) If you wanted to phone outside your own area, you had to dial the operator and ask her (almost inevitably operators were female) to put you through to your number. What she did was put you through to the next exchange along the line until a whole series of exchanges were linked up and a connection was made between you and the distant number you had asked for. Later, direct distance dialling (DDD, known in the UK as STD, for subscriber trunk dialling) came in; you could dial those more distant folk yourself by adding a code to the beginning of the number. Phones gradually got smaller from the late 1950s. Lighter plastics came into use, making for lighter-weight telephones. Cables were cloaked in plastic, had also lightened up, and become stretchable (they were coiled in a helix). This change had two down sides \u2014 I remember more than once leaning away from the phone to get a paper and pencil and having the phone fly off the desk and hit me in the back of the head. The other problem was that the helix tended over time to get horribly tangled up. Phones stopped being universally black and mostly shaped the same way.  1960s style phone. Lighter, more colourful, with helix-coiled cable. Happy to fly off the table and whack the caller in the back of the head if the cord got too stretched. (Alamy stock photo)  \u201cPrincess\u201d phones. Smaller, more colourful yet, and beginning to appear with buttons instead of the dial (but they still worked by sending clicks). (Wikimedia Commons photo) Buttons started replacing the dial, and the use of tones to signal the number replaced the clicks. The gears at the exchange that translated clicks into connections were replaced by their electronic, non-moving equivalents. Finally, international direct dialling came in, by adding an international access code to the beginning of the number. And then came the mobile (cell) phone. From Brick to Slick: A History of Mobile Phones The first one I ever used was the size of a large brick and weighed nearly a kilogram. In the UK, at least, these early mobiles were popular with two different constituencies: young men (usually) in the City who wanted to show how plugged into their important business lives they always were (and that they could afford the brick); and workmen who found them handy for work on the move. One gas meter-reader was saved by his new-fangled mobile phone after he bent down to read a meter and the irate householder shoved him ino a cupboard under the stairs and locked him in. The householder then left the house, presumably hoping the meter-reader would die of thirst or starvation (or at least suffer) before he was found. Mobile phones got smaller, starting folding (the clamshell phone) in order to fit into a pocket or handbag, and uses extended to the taking and sending of text messages. Finally mobile phones incorporated cameras, microphones and apps for diary appointments, then surfing the web, etc., and have hundreds of times more memory than there was on the first mainframe IBM computer I ever programmed for (128K). And, of course, the infrastructure for mobile telephony is very, very different from that of the old \u201clandline\u201d phones. NOTE: I am grateful for all this information to my master\u2019s degree in Data Communications and Distributed Systems. I was interested in the distributed systems part, but to get there I had to learn more about telephony than I ever wanted to know. If I\u2019ve misremembered anything, feel free to comment. I did try to forget all the telephony stuff immediately after my exams. ",
