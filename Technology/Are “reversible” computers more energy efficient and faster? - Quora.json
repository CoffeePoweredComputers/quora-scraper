            "answer_text": "In theory, a reversible logic operation can be designed to use zero energy. In the real world, there is little point to doing this, because of the fact that current computer technology does so much for so little energy that it is pointless to double the complexity of the system for a minor energy savings. The major exception is in Quantum Computer technology, where the loss of even a tiny amount of energy from the system may cause unacceptable loss of information. So, the general answer to your question is \u201csort of\u201d. While reversible logic looks good on paper, the existing technology is very, very good, and there is little incentive to develop it. ",
