            "answer_text": "Yes, but it looks worse then 2k from a blueray disc as soon as anything moves in the scene. This is because to much compression, so what is seen is compression artifacts. You will not notice unless you checkout both media types at the same time. But for scenes that mainly are static it do look great. And if your TV set supports HDR some content do look fantastic. But you need to have at least a 25Mbit/S connection but I do recommend it to be (above) 50Mbit/s connection. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes. They do have some shows that are on their 4K section however, most movies/shows may have been shot in 4K with 4K cameras, but not mastered in 4K. Most movies out today on TV are upscaled to 4K not native. Also, movies shot on 4K are usually at 24f/s. Video 4K is usually shot at either 30f/s or 60f/s which is what most TV retail stores show demos of video to promote 4K TV\u2019s. makes it look much better. ",
