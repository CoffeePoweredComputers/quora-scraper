            "answer_text": "Thanks for A2A !! The basic difference between ISO 9001:2015 and ISO 19011:2011 is as follows ISO 19011:2011 (Guidelines for auditing management systems) This standard provides guidance on auditing management systems, including the principles of auditing, managing an audit programme and conducting management system audits, as well as guidance on the evaluation of competence of individuals involved in the audit process, including the person managing the audit programme, auditors and audit teams. ISO 19011:2011 is applicable to all organizations that need to conduct internal or external audits of management systems or manage an audit programme. The application of ISO 19011:2011 to other types of audits is possible, provided that special consideration is given to the specific competence needed. ISO 9001:2015 (Guidelines for implementing Quality Management System) ISO 9001:2015 specifies requirements for a quality management system when an organization: a) needs to demonstrate its ability to consistently provide products and services that meet customer and applicable statutory and regulatory requirements, and b) aims to enhance customer satisfaction through the effective application of the system, including processes for improvement of the system and the assurance of conformity to customer and applicable statutory and regulatory requirements. All the requirements of ISO 9001:2015 are generic and are intended to be applicable to any organization, regardless of its type or size, or the products and services it provides. Hope so this will help you !! Peace !!! ",
