            "answer_text": "If the goal is to irrigate crops or obtain water, there are better ways to do it. Let's see, you want to use an inefficient device (maybe 10% on a semiconductor laser, far less on a huge chemical laser that might actually evaporate some considerable amount of water), to get the hope that clouds will form above your land and not dispersed, and that they might just bring rainfall.  You would be better off connecting a huge heater grid to a power plant directly if your goal was to do a big hotplate out of a seashore.  There's another problem with water and light: water is not very good at absorbing all light, you would need a specific wavelength of a laser that is quickly absorbed by the water but not by the air. Wait, that's not possible, air does have some water vapour... back to square 1. You don't want the laser to penetrate the water surface too much because you won't be heating the top of the water, but some middle layer, where heat convects and you lose any benefit... If you want to collect water, use an active or passive windtrap/dehumidifier in a buildings HVAC. Traditional middle eastern architecture has this built-in the cooling towers of the designs, one would just need to make some simple alterations to trap the moisture rather than discard it with the rest of the hot air.

            "answer_text": "You shouldn't try to do so - not that you can't but there are various repercussions when you try to heat up sea water.  Sea water contains a lot of sea life - that would be destroyed by the heat you introduced.  Also there is no guarantee that the water vapor you send up in the sky will necessarily end up as rain fall at the place you desire it to precipitate. You haven't stated the amount of water you desire to evaporate - but you may want to calculate the energy requirements.  Depending on your locality sea water temperature can vary greatly - but let's help you along and assume that you are dealing with water at around a nice 20 degrees centigrade. Now the specific heat capacity of water is around 4200 J/kg.K - what this actually means is that if you want to heat up 1 kg of water by 1 degrees - you will need to give it 4,200J.  So to heat up water from 20 degrees until 100 degrees you will need at least 336,000 J per kg of water. But wait, to convert water from liquid to gas (change of state requires another level of heating - called the enthalpy of vaporization) - that will be another 2, 257,000 J per kg of water. So in essence you will need about 2.6MJ of energy, considering that 1  Watt is 1 J/s, you can calculate what type of lasers you need and how powerful it should be taking into consideration how much time you want to spend heating the water.
