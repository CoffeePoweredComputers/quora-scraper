            "answer_text": "\u2018Everybody\u2019 is a stretch. But I could tell you of an incident where a dare did prove everyone who proposed the dare wrong. When he was in his 20s, one of my mom\u2019s cousins was often teased by his chums that he didn\u2019t have a girlfriend because he couldn\u2019t get one. When he told them it\u2019s because he didn\u2019t want one and not because he couldn\u2019t get one, they dared him to try and bait a girl of their choice. Yeah, it was just to bait her\u2026 nothing more. I guess they just wanted to prove their point that he was boring and no girl would have him. On an annoyed whim, he agreed. They looked around and pointed at a random girl walking on the street and asked him to get her if he could. They didn\u2019t know who she was or any other details about her. She was just a random girl walking down the street. It took him eight months of persistent trying to get her to say yes and five more months to get married to her. It all started as a simple dare. Today they are parents of two and grandparents of three. \ud83d\ude0a ",

He was smitten with her, not because of her beauty nor her grace but that boy thing I better not mention now. We just dared him for Rs100 to make her fall for him in front of Rex movie theatre at Brigade road in Bangalore in 1991 in seven days. Oh Boy! He was way ahead of all of us. Well, he strived! On fifth day she woke up to see sun rise with him. That togetherness has grown since then. After 200 odd AD films under Thinkpot banner, they are still going strong. Happy anniversary Manoj - Geetha!
