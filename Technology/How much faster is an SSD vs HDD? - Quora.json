            "answer_text": "Somewhere from 5 times to 1000 times faster, depending on how you read the files and which ssd you are talking about. On sequential reads and writes the ssd is 5\u201320 times faster. Sequential reads happen when you are playing movies or copying files. We are talking 10mb to 50gb reads. On random reads and writes, ssds are 50\u20131000 times faster. Random reads is opening programs, configuration files, reading databases. Random writes, is writing configuration files, writing to databases etc. During normal work, when you aren\u2019t playing movies, almost all reads and writes are of the second kind. So SSDs make a huge difference. The difference is magnified because hard drives and your internet connection are the last two slow components of your PC. If you have a decent fiber connection, and an SSD, you won\u2019t have any slow components in your PC. That makes a significant difference in user experience. ",

            "answer_text": "Usually an SSD is faster than an HDD. If you compare the performance of SSD with an HDD for I/O operations of a system, SSD is 10000 times faster than an HDD. An HDD performs 50\u201360 I/O operations per second where are an SSD performs 100 000 I/O operations per second. You can check the read/write speed of an SSD and HDD storage drive using a benchmark software like CrystalDiskInfo, HDD Scan, ATTO Disk Benchmark etc. You can then compare disk read and write speed for HDD and SSD.
