            "answer_text": "The faster the CPU clock speed, th better the performance of the computer and the better gaming experience for the gamer. This is particularly the case for games that are programmed to run on a single processor. Even games that can run on multiple cores are benefited from a faster CPU. This is because CPU controls the whole system. The CPU executes the instructions of the computer program. ",

If your GPU does not saturate your CPU, then it bottlenecks the system and you wont get desired performance. i.e. you have a gtx 750 GPU and Ryzen 5 3600. In this case CPU\u2019s clock speed does not relevant bec. of outdated and low performance gpu. ",
