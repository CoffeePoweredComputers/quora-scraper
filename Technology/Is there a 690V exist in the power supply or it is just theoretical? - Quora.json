            "answer_text": "I'm not sure exactly what you are asking. If you are asking are there power supplies that will output that voltage, yes 0\u20131000 volt power supplies are common. Here is a page of transformers that are 690v output. http://www.newark.com/isolation-transformers/isolation-transformer-primary-voltages/1-x-690v I don't know that there is necessarily a reason to use 690v over let's say 650v or 720 volts, but that would be up to the designer. The voltages wouldn't be out of line for a tube amplifier. It's the sort of voltage that a horizontal deflection amplifier tube would have run in a color tv. If there was a set that actually did I don't know. ",
