            "answer_text": "Computer Networks is a very broad field.. you might think that a packet just goes from here to there but internally A LOT happens to just fetch a page from Google. This should be your first baby step in understanding Computer Networks: What are the series of steps that happen when a URL is requested from the address field of a browser? Once you're done with that.. here's a whitepaper you might want to read: How Does the Internet Work? This might be a bit dry but give you a complete nutshell picture of how the Internet actually works. Now you'd know the big picture of computer networking, you'd want to have a reference handy so that you can lookup terms with ease. Before diving into anything else you'll also need to understand a bit about computer security. Quoting your example, here are two terms you should know: OpenSSH - the way you operate on a remote machine without being snooped upon. This was on what Mark Zuckerberg was asking interviewees to gain root access into.The Open Source toolkit for SSL/TLS - You might have noticed that green icon in the left part of your browser's address bar when you hit Google? This says that nobody else apart from Google can know what you search. This is where SSL comes into picture. It encrypts traffic between you and the server. So once you've successfully hacked into the server you could use a packet sniffing tool like tcpdump and see what is being sent out of the server.Moving on.. you'd want to know some tools and terms in the trade. You have to be familiar with them: Wireshark \u00b7 Go Deep.- The king of all network tools! You can view the traffic going out of your laptop to Google, you can see what exactly goes on the wire. This is also used as a packet sniffing tool by which you can reconstruct the network traffic which was sent by you. Command line alternatives you might be interested in: TCPDUMP/LIBPCAP public repositorytraceroute - tells you where all your packet has travelled before it reaches Google! or any other websiteBy no means this list is exhaustive. I've heard about Kali Linux, you might want to check that out as well. ",

            "answer_text": "Networking for me is always \u201cdo and learn\u201d experience. There is as such no hard and first rule for the networking. Though I am not an expert in this, but the experience I have gained in recent couple of years, as an engineer, it's always required to go to technical conferences, meetups and similar events. Websites like LinkedIn and XING also provide very good platform to connect to people sharing the common area of interests. Reaching out to people is always easy when you know whom you are talking to (not personally, but professionally). ",
