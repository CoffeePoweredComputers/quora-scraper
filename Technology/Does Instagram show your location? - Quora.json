            "answer_text": "Is There a Chance Instagram Will Show Your Location If You Didn\u2019t Tag It? While location tagging can be very useful, many users prefer not to give out this type of information. If you dislike sharing your location data, using Instagram can be daunting. So is there a chance of a data leak when you decide not to location tag your post? At the moment, your location is only visible if you want it to be. If you don\u2019t tag it or mention it in your captions, nobody will know where you\u2019re posting from. However, this wasn\u2019t always true. If you\u2019ve been on Instagram for a while, you may remember the Photo Map option. This map was visible from your profile page. It displayed your location even if your posts weren\u2019t tagged with it. Because the function wasn\u2019t widely used, Instagram quietly got rid of it. But it left an impression on Instagram users. There might be more changes in the future.  ",

When you upload a picture or a video and add location then the location is visible to others. Do thumbs up and follow back if this information helps. Thank you. ",
