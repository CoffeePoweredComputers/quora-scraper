            "answer_text": "The modern computer uses upwards of 8 billion transistors, but the transistor was only invented and mass produced in the 1960\u2019s. Before transistor technology, we used vacuum tubes to store the bits of digital information that make up digital computers.  Pictured: vacuum tubes used for a different purpose. While the transistor was a revolutionary development in the history of electronics, the vacuum tube was an equally important development that also forms the basis of early computer screen technology as well: the cathode ray tube. However and astonishingly enough, computers predate even vacuum tubes! Analog mechanical and electro-mechanical computers were used to quickly calculate a firing solution for artillery during world war II.  Pictured: a 1950\u2019s era mechanical computer The first true computer (in the modern sense of the word, defined as \u201cTuring complete\u201d) was Charles Babbage's Analytical Engine:  There's a fascinating history to computers that is too long for me to detail here, so I hope with this answer you are inspired to do further research on your own.
