            "answer_text": " Have you ever met a woman and everything seemed to be going great, only for it to fizzle out through text? Only for it to leave you wondering \u201cHow to text a girl you like?\u201d Perhaps you met her through online dating, and you\u2019re about to set up a date. Maybe you just met her while out and about in the world. Or maybe you\u2019ve even been on a date or two with a girl. Either way, we need to know how to text a girl we like to get her on a date with us. This answer is close to the biggest deal-breaker for women (the other is being too needy); men who are overly serious and boring. Women like stoic men. Men also like emotional guys. Women just like guys in general. But women don\u2019t like men who are overly serious. Even stoic men find ways to tease women, and even stoic guys aren\u2019t always stone-faced. They still find ways to have fun (at least, the successful-with-women ones do). This is doubly important if you\u2019re meeting her through an app like Tinder, where some light teasing is practically mandatory to getting her out on a date with you (learn more about that here). \nWhy? Rather than talk at you about how to text a girl I\u2019m going to show you some examples:   Backstory: this is a woman I met with a friend. We ended up hitting it off while we were all at the zoo. Because it\u2019s fun for me, I ended up taking some candy wrappers and putting them in her hood. She ended up playing along and throughout the night that night we kept trying to stash them on each other.That\u2019s an example of being playful with women in real life. It doesn\u2019t have to be some ordeal, just do something that you find amusing. Channel your inner 8 year old and amuse yourself. Have fun and run with it which can also be said on how to text a girl. The women that like you will love it while the ones that don\u2019t like you will run away. That\u2019s what we want! Now, on this example what you don\u2019t see is that she sent me a GIF (it was a little dog pestering a tiger and the tiger didn\u2019t give a shit at all). I shared my thoughts and she related her own to me. Nothing fancy here, just relating to each other. Then she sent a follow-up \u201cthats mee right theree haha i may be lil but i dont careee!!!\u201d. That, gentlemen, is a possible teasing moment served up on a silver platter. Seeing that, I immediately used this to tease her. I did this by relating her to the \u2018little turd pestering the tiger\u2019. It\u2019s obvious that I\u2019m joking which keeps it from being mean. This is fun for women, it showcases a host of great things about you. After that I took it a little bit further by telling her to make me hush, making it vaguely sexual. This shows her that I\u2019m not afraid to act on my sexual desires. It lets her know that this isn\u2019t a strictly \u2018friendly\u2019 interaction. I don\u2019t just jump into sexualizing everything, and even this is a very light example. This is how you want to start with things; slowly and with subtlety. After that, she asked about the wrappers because there was nowhere else to take the conversation. This tells me that she likes me a lot. First; she complimented me, always a great thing. Second; the follow-up message is her way of keeping the interaction going. She wants more and she\u2019s willing to invest herself to get more from me. Because of this high degree of interest I went further by calling myself a \u2018sexy dork\u2019. This is me \u2018misinterpreting\u2018 what she said and taking it just one step further. Normally you don\u2019t want to do this, but because of her high degree of interest I went for it just to solidify that idea of me in her mind. It also acknowledges her compliment so she doesn\u2019t feel ignored. Because when women are chasing you this much they\u2019ll be watching for signs if you like her or not, and if she feels like you might not like her at all then she\u2019ll pull back to save face. Like everything in life, it\u2019s all about balance. After that we started chatting about the candy wrappers to help bring the interaction down a little bit. You don\u2019t want to just keep piling on the sexual humor. It\u2019s like a potent spice, just need a little bit. Keep Moving Forward-Alexander Want more on how to text a girl?

            "answer_text": "She- Naman you are hopeless and awkward and desperate for love. *lol* Me- Ohh baby, if you care enough, then be my girlfriend.*heart* She- You ain't getting me this easy, stupid *kiss emoji* Me- I was just kidding. Just be a good friend and find me a perfect match.*wink* She- I see, Why should I do this favour ? what will I get in return ?. Me- Okay I can share kisses with you. Fine nah ?*kiss emoji* She- You boys never cease a chance to flirt with us. Paglet *kiss emoji*. So I had this conversation yesterday with my friend. It was pure flirting. See, Flirting is not a rocket science that you need to learn. Flirting comes naturally if you are talking with your girl friend. But you can't talk like this with a girl whom you barely know I ain't a tall drink of water myself but I can tell you, what most of the boys do wrong, is they try to fit a google pick up line in every text of their very first conversation and eventually get tagged as pervert. See, flirting is a game, and like every game you first need to understand the basic rules, and the basic rule of flirting is FRIENDSHIP. You first need to build your friendship and how can you build your friendship ?, By winning their trust and it takes time. I know my friend from 2 years. We both gave time to our friendship. Our bond got stronger day by day and now at this stage no matter how cheap my texts goes, it will only make our bond stronger.  First try to win the trust of a girl, flirting will come naturally. Till then keep your hormones in control. PS- By \u201ckisses\u201d I meant this  Image source- Google images Happy flirting Naman ",
