            "answer_text": "Job wise, being effective with Java and its ecosystem of tools, libraries and OOP approach will always be an advantage. It is a good foundation. Work is currently split, driven by cloud use at the server side and mobile/web use at the front end. Java sees a lot of use inside microservices often running in cloud containers. All-Microsoft shops use Azure and C# dot net core. There is no reason to use Java there even though you could. Serverless cloud native designs often don\u2019t use Java, as it has a startup time of a few seconds. Short for a long running server usage, but very long for Serverless where the app is restarted frequently. I have not seen any Java or C# killer languages yet. I have seen use of TypeScript, Go, Kotlin, Rust where Java would have been the first choice. So I think during 2020\u20132030 there will still be a lot of Java use; but it will be in a mixed landscape of languages. Inevitably, we need to know Java as well as other languages and tools. ",

It is not very easy to predict anything today; in case we take into account that most (83%) Java based software use Java 8 Long Term Support version in 2020 which was released in March 2014, which has Extended support until December 2030;there is around 3 billion Android devices which still support Java as one of the platform languages;for the last 2-3 decades Java was the most popular language and after 1965 until 2019 it is the second popular after the C language;JavaScript syntax (which is the most popular language) is also a C-like syntax similar to Java;Java has become a standard language program for large organizations and enterprises as a general purpose language;in the world of open source software, Java is among the top 3 languages in 2020;then the future decade of Java is still promising!
