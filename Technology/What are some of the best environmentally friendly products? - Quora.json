            "answer_text": "Beauty - Makeup Remover Face Cleansing Cloth This cloth replaces all your makeup remover wipes. It even takes off waterproof mascara. And you don\u2019t need any cleansers. Just wet and wipe. If you have extras, you can just throw them in with the rest of the laundry. If not, just put some soap or shampoo on the cloths, rub tiger, rinse, and hang to dry. Amazon.com: Makeup Remover Face Cleansing Cloth - Chemical-free Microfiber Reusable Facial Clean Towel, Remove Makeup Instantly with Only Water (1 Gray): Beauty Personal care - Water flosser Water flossers, such as Waterpik, are a good alternative to regular floss. There is is no waste, and it seems to do an even better job of cleaning in between your teeth. It is especially great for people wearing braces. Amazon.com: Waterpik Water Flosser Electric Dental Countertop Oral Irrigator For Teeth \u2013 Aquarius Professional, WP-660 White: Beauty Personal care - reusable feminine hygiene products Silicone menstrual cups, such as the Diva Cup, can take a little getting used to but will last for many years. If you don\u2019t see them in your pharmacy, you can order them from Amazon. Menstrual pads will only be found online through sites such as Amazon or Etsy. They are best as backups to the cups or as daily liners. I personally do not like having to clean these so I avoid using them as my primary menstrual pad. But if you do use them, be sure to have some laundry stain remover ready. Rinse them in the washing mashing before washing. Cleaning - baking soda Baking soda is my favorite non-toxic cleanser for the bathtub and pots/pans. Just wet the area, sprinkle it on, scrub, and rinse. It gets rid of soap scum as well as stuck on food stains. Cleaning - Seventh Generation Seventh Generation dishwashing soap, laundry soap, and cleaning and disinfecting sprays are consistently on top of the list of environmentally friendly cleaning products. Paper towel alternative - old clothes Cut up unwanted t-shirts, sweats, and other clothing into squares. Place in a large container on your kitchen counter. Great for cleaning up messes, used as dinner napkins, and can be laundered for reuse or thrown away. Best of all, it\u2019s free. I do this to clothing that cannot be given away or donated, such as team shirts or stained clothing. Electricity - solar panels If you can, invest in some solar panels for your home. It will save you money on electricity as well as being better for the environment. Pest control - peppermint essential oil ant repellent If you\u2019ve ever had an ant infestation at your home, you know how hard they are to get rid of. Get a spray bottle and mix some water with drops of peppermint essential oil. Lemon essential oil can be added too. Spray around doorways and anywhere you see ants to keep them away. Lemon juice will wreck your spray nozzle but can be used to wipe counters, walls, floors, and window sills. These essential oils work and smell amazing. They are especially great if you have babies or pets around. ",

            "answer_text": "The Loveable Loo. Composting excreta (urine and feces). It can done in a hygenic way. Developing these systems greatly benefits public health in rural areas with hygiene issues. Humanure composting creates an eco-friendly cycle because plants are seeking the nitrogen and other nutrients from manure. This is the best fertilizer! In turn, plants are the most nutrient-dense foods for humans. This is the cycle as it was originally designed to function (in the same way that plants and animal respiration is interdependent, where one breathes what the other produces - oxygen and carbon dioxide). Also, we are not wasting water with toilet flushing. We are not polluting potable water and turning it into wastewater that requires chemicals and energy to clean.  We are not discarding as waste what actually is beneficial for ground soil creation and the production of nutrious food. We are not using synthetic nitogen fertilizers whose manufacture and use pollute and disrupt ecosytems. The key is to generate microbial activity (thus, heat) by adding plant material. Sawdust can block odors in the restroom.The material can be collected in 5 gallon buckets and added to an outdoor compost pile along with kitchen and yard scraps. In the bathroom, completely cover your contribution with sawdust after each use. It naturally decomposes and if done properly, will be ready as clean compost, without pathogens, in 2 years. A Chicago city collection study saw the process complete much faster (more mass generated more heat). See www.humanurehandbook.com for the details. Also, a small container to urinate into. To not wait 2 years, dilute fresh urine in water 1:10, and pour on the base of plants, ideally under mulch, or on your lawn. Fresh urine is aseptic and contains nitrogen in the form most bioavailable to plants. ",
