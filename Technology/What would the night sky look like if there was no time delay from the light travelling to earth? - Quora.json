            "answer_text": "This would imply a universe with an infinite speed of light, and thus no principle of locality. Locality is so ingrained in the laws of physics that it\u2019s unlikely any such self-consistent universe could exist, and so there wouldn\u2019t be any night sky to observe. A closely related question, though, is what if the universe were infinitely old and static, so that the light from all stars in the universe had had time to reach you? To answer that question, you can make a couple of interesting observations about stars in the sky: A star\u2019s brightness attenuates with the square of its distance.A star\u2019s angular area in the sky decreases by the square of its distance.Combine those two facts and you\u2019ll come to the really cool conclusion that a star\u2019s areal intensity is constant, and doesn\u2019t depend on distance. In an infinitely old and static universe, where approximately infinite stars have had time for their light to reach Earth, every line of sight in Earth\u2019s sky would end on a star. And so, from the areal intensity argument above, the entire night sky should be at least as bright[1] as the surface of a star. The fact that it isn\u2019t is known as Olbers\u2019 paradox, and was one of the early arguments against an infinitely old, static, universe. [1] Note that every star in such a universe is also absorbing heat from every star within its line of sight, and so we\u2019d expect additional brightening due to that fact. ",

            "answer_text": "If light had infinite velocity then that would mean there would be no boundary to the observable universe. The night sky would be bright white because you\u2019d be able to see light from every star in the Univese. If the Universe is infinite then there would be no direction in which there isn\u2019t eventually a star. If the Universe isn\u2019t infinite, but only very, very, very, very large, then there would still be no direction in which there isn\u2019t eventually a star due to the Universe wrapping back around on itself. The night sky would be no different than the day sky. We\u2019d never be able to investigate the early Universe, in fact we\u2019d never even know there WAS a Universe beyond Earth. The sky would just be white all the time. I\u2019m not sure if we\u2019d see the moon or not, so there might be something we\u2019d be interested in. ",
