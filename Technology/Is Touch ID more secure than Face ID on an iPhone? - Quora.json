Think of it this way: if you were at an NFL football game in the Before Times when the stadiums were packed, 2 people (on average) would be able to unlock your phone with their fingerprint using Touch ID. With Face ID you would have to go to 15 separate games to find one person who could unlock your phone just by looking at it. ",
