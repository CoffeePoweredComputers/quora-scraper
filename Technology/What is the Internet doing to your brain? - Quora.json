            "answer_text": "How is the internet affecting our intelligence? YES! Both positive and negative effects are occurring. Just as the written word negatively affected our intelligence when it was introduced, so does the internet affect our thinking. After the written word flourished, after the Gutenberg press, our intelligence was exposed to both positive and negative intelligence effects. Then, resolution expanded and audio information flourished, and a whole nation could listen to a \u201cFireside Chat\u201d, all at the same time \u201ctogether\u201d, all over the country. Television soon followed thereafter, and audio was joined with video motion images, first in black and white, followed by color. Since that point the resolution expanded and television received the review it deserved. With the most recent stage of RESOLUTION increase, the internet, where all media is combined with interaction, our intelligence has dwindled for all the obvious reasons. Intelligence that does not have the ability to identify it\u2019s own programming/biases, is in fact, not intelligence in the first place. If you follow the trail above and note that \u201cResolution and Thought\u201d are inverses, you can answer this question for yourself. IF NOT\u201d? Then perhaps you wish to note one of those forehead slappers you never faced before? What is your best grade in the classes called; Thinking, Thought, or How to Think? Intelligent people prove themselves as such, by not reaching for their \u201cRefute\u201d button to prevent themselves from thinking, as such they think things through. Programmed people never let their \u201cRefute\u201d button out of their reach. Then Never Know\u2026 when they are going to need it. ",

            "answer_text": "It is unlikely that the internet has caused the dysgenic effect that we are experiencing. Intelligence has been declining for over a century. This decline is g loaded (meaning it is a Jensen Effect and applies to real intelligence). It has been masked by score gains in IQ tests (Flynn Effect), which are not Jensen Effects and have been shown to be due to factors such as increased guessing and artifacts of the test scoring procedure. The decline in real intelligence has been shown by slower reaction times, lower vocabulary, fewer major scientific discoveries, and decreased backward digit span. The rate of decline is smaller than the rate of score changes (Flynn Effect) that have been seen in some nations. The decline in intelligence is believed to be driven by the negative correlation between IQ and fertility rate and possibly by increased mutation load due to improved medical technology. {Today babies survive with mutations that would have taken them out of the gene pool in the past.}  Source of the image above: Herrnstein, R.
