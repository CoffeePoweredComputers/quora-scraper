            "answer_text": "Apples airpods have some 'proprietary ' features that other alternatives also feature, such as automatic pairing with a phone when the charging case is opened. Features like this any most others are compatible with either android or iPhone as it's down the the pods themselves and hardware. The only feature I'm aware of that differs when using a non apple phone is some of the info available on the airpods charger to read is not present Onan android device. However it doesn't really effect use or operation at all. Besides that the apple airpods feature sub optimal sound quality and fitment that is really divisive. Some people find it fits better, others find them uncomfortable or painful to wear. ( They sound like generic 20$ corner store earbuds.) Other alternatives like jabra's wireless bt earbuds offer much better sound quality and the same features for the same price. They look more like the Samsung galaxy buds in appearance. The Samsung galaxy buds by contrast also work with either apple or iPhone devices, and offer noticeably better audio quality then the current generation airpods at a lower cost as well. Both the Jabra and galaxy buds feature gel buds that can be swapped out if one size is too big or small unlike the hard airpods which can cause issues with fitment. So no airpods don't work only with apple devices, and they kind of suck for more money \u2026 ",
