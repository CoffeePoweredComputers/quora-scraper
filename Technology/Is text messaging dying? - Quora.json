            "answer_text": "No, it\u2019s not! Although many claims differently, SMS is not dying. On the contrary. All important things, like login details, passcodes, bank pins, Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Google login details, confirmations, all this is sent to you via SMS! Not email, or any messaging app, but SMS. Why? Because it\u2019s the safest communication channel, each mobile phone has this functionality built-in, everyone knows how to open, read and write an SMS. Moreover, SMS has the highest open rate, more than 90%, and read rate also above 90%, meaning that each SMS is read within 3\u20135 minutes after arriving at your mobile phone. I hope this helps! ",
