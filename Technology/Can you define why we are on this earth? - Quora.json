            "answer_text": "In simplistic terms there is no more meaning or purpose behind life than what you can put into it. The obvious purpose of life is to live as long as possible and as happily as possible. While lasting happiness eludes us most of the time, suddenly the end comes before we could make anything out of life. The absurdity of life is in fact appalling. For billions of years before our birth we were nowhere and for billions of years after death we will again be nowhere. We perform a show for a very brief period compared to that of the universe and later vanish for all time to come making us wonder about the absurdity of this drama called life. However on a deeper reflection and logical analysis we can realise that the above conclusion can not be true. It is not at all correct to aver that space-time-matter had been existing for billions of years before our birth. The concept of existence itself is due to our mind and consciousness. It is our mind that gives rise to the concept of space-time-matter making possible existence itself. As such the argument that something like this universe had been existing for billions of years in the absence of our mind is untenable. Existence of space-time-matter universe is like a picture on a canvas, where the mind serves like a canvas. Just like the fact that a picture does not exist without the canvas as the base, existence of any entity is not possible without the mind. The past does not exist per se. It can exist only in the present as thought. Without the mind there is no entity like space-time-matter and we can not imagine a past when the mind had not existed. Time itself exists only because of the memory and intelligence of the mind. Space-matter exist as mental concepts only as whenever we see an object, we actually see it in our brains only leading to the fact that our consciousness permeates the entire universe. As such there is no point in raising any questions which presume the absolute existence of space-time-matter universe independent of mind like how and why the universe came on to exist or how and why the human life emerged on the scene. These questions turn out to be illogical in the face of the supremacy of the human mind. The best answer for the question why we are here in this earth is that we need to celebrate human life as a rare phenomenon and make the most of it while it is there. It is all in your hands and there is no more purpose or meaning behind this life than what you can put into it. ",

            "answer_text": "To actualise and fulfil our purpose of life. And that there is only one purpose of life. Wrong to think in terms of spiritual purpose, material purpose etc. My guide tells that we should not compartmentalise life. We have different role plays that we do. We are daughter, son, wife, father, sub-ordinate, superior etc. However we should look towards life as a whole. Another teaching, from my heartfulness guide Kamlesh D Patel which is revolutionary is that we need to balance our spiritual and material life. Like a bird flying on two wings, both material and spiritual is necessary. Without any one we will not be able to sail through this life. And we have to integrate both. No separate existance. So to find the true purpose of my existence i need to find tools which can help me in this pursuit. Meditation will help you in this search definitely. Let me know if you want to know more about meditation. Similar question which is associated to above can also viewed for more explanation Why were we following the same 3 rules in life, education, job, and marriage? ",
