            "answer_text": "I take \u2018quantity\u2019 to mean any measurable value directly associated with the asteroid. It would increase in brightness as it neared the Earth, because it would be reflecting sunlight more efficiently, from our point of view. It\u2019s orbit would be changed slightly by its interaction with Earth\u2019s gravity. It\u2019s velocity relative to Earth could increase, for the same reason. ",

            "answer_text": "There is no reason for the object to change at all. Now if you were talking about an object coming from deep space, like the Kuiper belt or the Oort Cloud, then it could have icy material that would sublimate and boil off as it gets closer to the Sun, because the intensity of sunlight is inversely proportional to the square of the object\u2019s distance from the Sun. This has nothing to do with the Earth. ",

            "answer_text": "It\u2019s mass would remain, but its weight would increase as the gravitational field enveloped it. We would not notice it unless it stopped here, when kinetic energy was released. On the way, ke is increasing, and weight as a result of momentum. The point is that the mass might be movable, and the asteroid be \u201csteered\u201d or deflected as long as it just happened to be heading towards Earth, but it gets much harder once it\u2019s attracted by our gravity. If it only skims the atmosphere (a bolide), it will lose mass and weight if it fragments, or may gain mass by oxidation if it does not. ",
