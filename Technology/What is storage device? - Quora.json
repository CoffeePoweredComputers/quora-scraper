            "answer_text": "Storage device- Storage devices hold and store information both temporarily and permanently, and can be internal or external to a computer, server or any similar computing device. There are two types of storage device: secondary storage device and primary storage device. Primary Storage - Primary storage is the main memory of the computer system. Primary storage called temporary memory or cache memory.The capacity of primary memory is very much limited and is always smaller compares to secondary memory. Examples of Primary Storage- ROM: Unlike RAM, Read Only Memory (ROM) is both a non-volatile and permanent form of primary storage.RAM (Random Access Memory)Random access memory which is also known as RAM is generally known as a main memory of the computer system. It is called temporary memory or cache memory. The information stored in this type of memory is lost when the power supply to the PC or laptop is switched off.ROM stands for Read Only Memory. The memory from which we can only read but cannot write on it. This type of memory is non-volatile. The information is stored permanently in such memories during manufacture. A ROM stores such instructions that are required to start a computer.Secondary storage device A secondary storage device has a larger storage capacity and can store data permanently. The device can be both external and internal to a computer and includes; compact disk, USB drive, hard disk, etc. ",

            "answer_text": "this question is asked a LOT on this site. A storage device is a term used for anything in which items or information may be stored. Its a very broad term as well. In your home a storage device can be a closet or a pantry/cabinet; if you have a garage, that\u2019s a storage device. In your car, your trunk and glove compartments are storage devices. In a computer, your hard drive is a storage device used to store information. So, in conclusion, if it can store or hold something in it, it\u2019s a storage device! (sounds pretty simple enough) ",
