If not, a standard clamshell notebook may be a better choice.Chromebooks are good for kids. Windows laptops and MacBooks both offer plenty of functionality; which platform you prefer is a matter of personal tasteThe top 10 things to consider when buying a new laptop Here\u2019s what to look for if you want to buy the best laptop possible When people ask us which laptop is best for their needs, the first thing we tell them is that there is no clear answer. There are too many different types of laptops, and different price categories to suit them. However, we do give people a checklist that they should consider before splurging on a new device. 1. Size If portability is your main concern, then you need to consider a notebook that has a small-ish screen and a light weight. Any laptop marketed as an Ultrabook should fit your bill here, as they are designed to be slim and light. More to the point, though, look for a laptop with a screen that\u2019s 12.5-13.3 inches in size, and a weight that is from 1-1.5kg. 2. Screen quality You\u2019ll be staring at your laptop for many hours every day, so you want to make sure you get a screen that is comfortable to look at. Many laptops these days also have touchscreens, which means they are glossy. Glossy screens lead to reflections, so consider a laptop that doesn\u2019t have a touchscreen. Next, look at the resolution. A 1920x1080-pixel resolution (aka Full HD) should be considered if you want plenty of space to line up windows and keep things in view. Finally, the viewing angles are extremely important. A laptop screen that touts IPS (in-plane switching) technology offers the widest viewing angles and the best user comfort. Try not to buy blind. If possible, go into a store and see the screen for yourself. Otherwise, rely on multiple reviews to get a good overview of the product. 3. Keyboard quality For long typing sessions, you must get a laptop that has a comfortable keyboard. You don\u2019t want to get a keyboard that packs in every key under the sun (think keyboards that have squished in number pads) because that can translate to a poor overall user experience when hunting for keys like the arrows. You want a keyboard that has a comfortable layout with full-sized keys and some space around the arrow keys. The keys should have adequate travel on the downstroke and snappy responsiveness when you let them go. Make sure the keyboard is also backlit, so that you can type with an easier view on the keys in dimly lit environments. As with the screen, it helps to try before you buy, especially if your main task will be typing. 4. CPU It\u2019s hard to go past any of Intel\u2019s Core-based CPUs when buying a new laptop. Think Core i3, Core i5, and Core i7. These CPUs offer the best performance when it comes to multitasking and multimedia tasks. Core i3-based notebooks are generally found in entry-level systems, while Core i5 makes up the majority of mainstream computers. Core i7-based systems are for those of you who want the best performance from your laptop. However, note that with a Core i7-based system, heat coming through the base of the laptop can be cause for concern, especially if you plan to actually use the laptop on your lap a lot of the time. 5. RAM You need 4GB of RAM or more to get the best out of your system. More RAM allows for more applications to be run at the same time, and for more data to be quickly accessible by the system at any one time, which comes in handy for tasks such as editing photos. I thik it's helpful for you. Thank you. ",

            "answer_text": "Totally depends on what you are looking for - CPU - Depends on what you need , but the i5 8th gen is more than enough for almost everything , the i7 8th gen has tons of processing power with 6 cores and the i3 is a little under powered but still really good at it\u2019s price point .GPU - Totally depends on what you want to do , a good GPU laptop comes in the higher range only especially gaming ones or ones in which you want to do stuff like 3D rendering and all .RAM - 4GB is the bare minimum these days for mostly anything , 8GB is good enough for almost everything , but if you use a lot of stuff then 16GB makes sense too , 32GB is kind of overkill though .Screen - 1080p is pretty standard these days , but you should see the kind of panel too if you have to work on it eventually , the colour accuracy needs to be of some importance if you actually want to do work properly .Storage - Usually the best price combination is an SSD+HDD combination . But if you can , go only for the SSD if you don\u2019t need a lot of storage in your laptop .Ports - Connectivity is also important for most of the people , so just check it has mostly everything that you need over a long period of time r laptop for a pretty long time .Battery - These days battery life is increasing a lot on laptops , but only a few laptops offer stunning battery life , some like the Macbook Pro , XPS 13 etc.Service - You should also check for the service center and all close-by so that if you have any problem , you can get it solved immediately without a lot of hassles at all .Hope this helps \u2026..
