However, if I am correct about perpetual motion, there will be a degree of unpredictability past the point of inventing it, as it will open avenues to many new areas of research. PERPETUAL MOTION As of right now as far as I know, complete perpetual motion hasn't been built yet. However, some of my experiments indicate up-and-down movement from rest with no batteries or magnets. Designs:   The diagrams are basically free to build and develop. However, I cannot provide money. Some sort of prize or royalties are recommended to be given to me, but only if one or more of my designs works with profit.

You're right. This is possible.

            "answer_text": "Technology means tools. The limits of tools are the limits of physics. There is no reason to believe we are unable to: Perform whatever desired changes on the molecular level, when and where want them. Manipulate large masses to rearrange stellar systems or even galactic clusters. And everything in-between. But whether we do or not, is up to us. To date, we have done an awful job of predicting the side-effects of our technologies in use, particularly when scaled up. Nanotech Ethics studies were begun almost as soon as nanotechnology became known to the public was because K. Eric Drexler immediately saw the huge potential for damage by the use or abuse of the technology years before he published. In the ancient past we have caused huge devastation because of such ignorance. the well-known rocky crags and desert across the Mediterranean, North Africa, Lebanon, Syria, Iraq were all once covered in dense forests, and much of it was turned to desert directly by people doing exactly as they are today in the Amazon. It is our desires, rather than our needs which tend to push invention, along boredom, curiosity and many other factors, and those tend to push technology. ",
