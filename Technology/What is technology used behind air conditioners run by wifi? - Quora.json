            "answer_text": "I haven't worked in any air-conditioning company for WiFi routing branch although there's no connection between ac and WiFi tech.WiFi is nothing but a wirelessly accessible set of frequency through which connected devices can comminicate.WiFi device has an installed operating system which in most of the cases is Linux (don't be confused by imagining that WiFi modem has Ubuntu , Linux kernel based custom os that runs as an application to control WiFi hardware)Now this can be configured to perform different operations.So WiFi card basically routes a frequency band to which you connect your device.Your device then sends some command through app as an IP packet (TCP/to tech) .WiFi router receives this and converts into a an os application operation which then further sends this request into air-conditioner's processor chip and thus it performs the requestion action by the user.
