            "answer_text": "What type of teacher are you talking about exactly as if we talk about India we have three types of teachers generally Teachers that are really interested in helping out students : these are the ones who teach great and listen to the feedback and improvise. They feed students curiosity, are most respected by students and remembered till the end by their students. They can make a student a good human being.Teachers who are only professional their only concern is to teach. They are good in knowledge and teaching but they don't care about understanding of the students they care only about teaching giving assignments checking them giving marks that's it their work is done.Teachers who neither care about students nor they know how to teach.So from above three generalization I made on my experience of teachers I got in my school time, the teacher no.1 will be the best leader in public dealing as they care about students and know how to improvise on feedback as well as is wise enough to take decisions Teacher no.2 will be great for roles like economic , education, health etc side departments of the government as they are professional and can take the 'hard decisions' that are required to be made for betterment of the society. Teacher no.3 they can relax and find out their passion like the rest of us are doing.  My second answer on Quora if anyone didn't like it please feel free to comment I like to hear opinions and corrections as I am bad at english as I got teacher no.3 in English ",
