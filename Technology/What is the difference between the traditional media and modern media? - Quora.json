            "answer_text": "Traditional or legacy media are pre-digital media organizations built on, and continue to primarily rely upon, traditional/analog ways of content creation and distribution. Transmitters and Towers for TV and Radio, Printing Presses for Magazines and Newspapers, all possessing large staffs needed to execute a business model that has increasingly become far less fiscally viable and relevancy challenged. These businesses were built upon a one size fits all/mass appeal analog distribution and consumption model. Today we live in an on demand personalized entertainment and content world. Outside of Sports and Live events consumers now expect to consume whatever they want, wherever they want, whenever they want on whatever device they want! The strain of this analog/dated business model currently has legacy media in the midst of what\u2019s commonly referred to as \u201cdigital disruption\u201d. Digital disruption can be loosely defined as new digital ways to gain access to audiences that does not include Towers and Transmitters, large staffs, etc., only an internet connection, a URL, and a scalable service/portal that users find value in. So the cost of entry in potentially accessing a worldwide audience is now reduced to just a fraction of what traditional/legacy media had to spend upon their market launches decades ago. The good news is many legacy media brands have access to very valuable audiences built up over many years of loyal consumption of their content. These companies are now retro-fitting their original analog business models to also encompass digital distribution of their content; a difficult task not unlike trying to change the tire on the car you\u2019re currently driving! Traditional media outlets are trying to keep, in what in most cases is still, their primary analog revenue sources intact (while that too is changing rapidly), while building a bridge to digital distribution for their known/valuable brands (multi-platform content). This digital evolution, or migration, of legacy brands is solely focused on making their content available, anywhere, anytime and on any device. This is what the marketplace now expects when they watch/hear/ read their favorite content. One interesting note, we\u2019re starting to see digital outlets disrupt themselves as in the case of Facebook buying Instagram. Facebook has challenges with some younger demos who perceive it as their Mom and Dad\u2019s social media platform. Facebook buys Instagram, which does very well with younger users, problem solved! End note: We\u2019re living in a interesting time of digital disruption. One constant remains\u2026.Truly great brands, driven by truly great content, and truly great personalities always prevail. Without compelling content it does not matter how much audience you have\u2026..because without breakthrough content, you won\u2019t have that audience long\u2026 ",

            "answer_text": "I think Terry pretty much nailed it here. I usually think of Traditional advertising as: Print (including Direct Mail), Broadcast, and Outdoor. I think of Modern advertising as: Online, In-App, and Experiential, including POP (point-of-presence store displays, etc.) For a while there, I think all Traditional media venues billed ad agencies a \u201cnet\u201d amount which was 15% (commission) less than the \u201cgross\u201d communicated to the clients. Modern ad venues did not. But this is not a distinguishing difference anymore. ",
