            "answer_text": "Some of these other answers are missing the mark. The question isn\u2019t what is the oldest CPU that YOU would run Windows 10 on, it\u2019s what is the oldest CPU that CAN run Windows 10. This question has been answered before on Quora, but it was asked a little differently, so I\u2019ll answer this to clear up confusion. The answer is basically the Pentium 4 Prescott series processor or later, specifically the E0 revision. This is the first Intel CPU to support NX, which is a requirement of the CPU in Windows 10 (along with PAE and SSE2). I\u2019ve personally run Windows 10 on a Core2 Duo, but nothing as old as a Pentium 4, nor would I want to try. ",

            "answer_text": "I would recommend minimum of Intel Sandy Bridge series (Core ix 2xxx). AKA 2nd generation Core i series of 2011. It basically can do most of the latest (10th gen) Intel or AMD (Ryzen) CPU. For example, a Core i7 3770 is still quite powerful and have many upgrades options includes NVMe SSD support (if you want to run Win 10 smoothly) ",
