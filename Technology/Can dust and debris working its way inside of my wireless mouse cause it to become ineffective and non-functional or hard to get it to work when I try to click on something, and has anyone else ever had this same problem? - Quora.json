Apart from a build up of debris that may affect the optical sensor, which I have not experienced personally, the only issues I have had were intermittent operation of the mouse buttons, particularly the left click button and the scroll wheel became intermittent in its operation. I was able to clean the scroll wheel, but the microswitches for the buttons were sealed and it would have been a case of replacement rather than cleaning, so I replaced the whole mouse with a different make.

            "answer_text": "As far as movement is concerned, only to extent that it blocks the light path from source to surface and back to the sensor. However, you can see that area and it should be easy to clean out. As far as the switches are concerned, it is certainly possible. It is even fairly common for a scroll wheel. Not so common for the other switches. (They are usually pretty well sealed.) ",
