            "answer_text": "A fusion reactor is currently the best sustainable technology. Luckily, we have a nice reliable one at a safe 93 million miles away the delivers energy free to the entire surface of the earth for about half of every day. Electricity generated from the sun is the best sustainable technology. PV (photovoltaic) solar components are off the shelf, can be installed with a relatively small amount of training, and can be installed quickly and incrementally. The wind is also powered by the sun, but because energy capture is the cube of the wind speed, it is only economical in specific locations where the mean constant wind speed is more than 13mph (5.8 m/sec). The best region for solar PV in the US is in the Southwest, but some of the worst places, such as Seattle, produce about 65% of the optimum. With PV panels becoming so much less expensive, it is now becoming economical in cloudy areas. For example, Germany which is much smaller than the US with the solar input of Alaska has 5 times more PV installed than in the US. The most common criticism of solar energy is that it is intermittent, but consolidating daytime solar with wind in the US, over large areas, ameliorates this. We need to install a whole lot before this and storage for overnight becomes a problem. Because the sun is entirely sustainable, it will be the final solution for generating power as storage problems are solved. There is one other existing currently economic and renewable technology that could provide base power to fill in for a variable daytime and overnight supply. California is generating electricity with hot rock geothermal facilities. There are a lot of areas in the US where this mature technology could be reliably producing power. Geothermal plants aren\u2019t so complicated and dangerous that they require a large overload of regulation, and when they have a problem, they aren\u2019t a radiation hazard. ",

            "answer_text": "Sustainable technology has to be powered by or consume renewable resources, and then it has to do its magic without emitting any bad waste. If it doesn\u2019t work like that, it will either use up all the fuel it relies on and/or it will damage the environment with its emissions. Not sustainable. At the moment, making just about anything (and manufacturing any technology) involves burning fossil fuels. So whether this is new tools, new chemicals, new genetics, new machines, fossil fuels got burned and carbon emissions were released. This is going to remain true for a while, like 20 years. This makes it rather hard to do stuff sustainably because all new things are born with a \u201ccarbon debt\u201d they need to pay back. Until all manufacturing fuels and energy sources are renewable (such as powered by solar, hydrogen, biofuels etc), very little of what we do is sustainable. For example, a ceramic \u201ckeep cup\u201d has so much embedded carbon in it, you have to use it each day for three years (instead of styrene cups) to have it pay back its debt. The same goes for a raft of technologies that reduce waste. Glass wool home insulation can never get its carbon debt paid back in the lifetime of the house (hint: you have to use polyester insulation, this has a lower carbon debt). Basically, for the next 20 years, the most sustainble activities you can undertake are simply to consume less. Reuse more. Buy less stuff. I know, it\u2019s boring. Still, sustainable technologies need to be developed and many are. The premise is that those technologies do so much good that they pay back their carbon debt. The poster child for this is the solar panel. Very energy intensive to make. Lots of CO2. But it pays this back in two years. Then it really is a sustainable technology. It\u2019s sustainable because it gets its fuel from the sun, which is a renewable resource and it makes electricity which means I don\u2019t have to burn fossil fuels any more. After two years the solar panel has provided me with the energy that went into making the solar panel. Its a miracle. Not many other technologies can do this unless they are pure renewable generators like wind, tidal, ocean current generators. So these are the technologies we should be scaling up as fast as possible. As soon as we can use these generators to power manufacturing, the sooner we can really start making lots of things that can help us pollute less. It\u2019s Ragtime. Wear your pants till they rip. Invest in solar and hydro power. #BuyNothingNewDecade ",
