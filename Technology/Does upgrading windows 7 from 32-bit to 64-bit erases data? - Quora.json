            "answer_text": "Hi! You cannot upgrade from 32bit to 64bit windows. You have to do a clean install i.e. You will have to format the C: drive of your system and as you know formatting erases data. I suggest you to take a backup of your C: drive and perform the installation. Kindly rename your C: drive to OS so that you do not accidently format other drives during installation process. If you have 4GB or more RAM then it is advisable to install a 64 bit Windows. ",
