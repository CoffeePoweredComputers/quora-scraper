            "answer_text": "The two main factors boil down to cost and performance measurement. Customer service is expensive, and in most organizations the bulk of the budget goes to revenue generating departments, not cost centers. That means that you have to fight for every dime of budget and what money you have gets spread thin. Hiring the best people means having wages and benefits which compete well with the competition. Making employees skilled requires a talented and dedicated training and quality staff. All these people need sophisticated systems and tools to leverage. These costs are why so many customer service departments got outsourced to India a few years ago, and still are, thought it\u2019s a little less common now. Outsourced CS is simply less expensive. The second factor is measurement. Take the Comcast example. They got a lot of attention a year or so ago because of recordings of their cancellation/retention center\u2019s behavior. My guess is these were not malicious people trying to give a bad experience to customers. This was a call center whose incentives and metrics were not tied to the Customer experience. \u201cYou get what you measure, \u201c is a good rule of thumb. In this case, the agents were likely being measured and evaluated based on how many accounts they saved, or worse, how many customers they lost. That gives incentive to agents to get people to hang up, because that keeps them off your scorecard. The problem in many cases is doing the right thing for a customer is expensive. You can save a lot of money by cutting corners in CS, and people get nice bonuses and promotions for saving money. Here again, companies are \u201caccidentally\u201d incentivising their employees to create a poorer customer experience. They often don\u2019t notice the impact until the bad CS experience starts impacting sales and PR. I don\u2019t think bad CS happens on purpose, but it is an easy trap to fall into. ",

            "answer_text": "Just want to throw this out there, Y\u2019all good to disagree. Living in Britain, all you get on the counter of most betting shops these days, I\u2019m afraid, are young girls that just want you to go away so they can get back on their phones. They are paid minimum wage and generally also have minimum interest. I am not like them, I know how to settle bets manually (not just beep the barcode and pay out what it says) and also know how to work out, for example, how many doubles in combinations bets using formulas, etc. I know the all the terminology (including reading form and deconstructing the lingo) so you\u2019re not talking to a brick wall, I\u2019m old school (45yrs) and have old school knowledge; for instance, jusk ask someone behind the counter who matches the description I\u2019ve given and see if they can answer you with ease how many doubles in 8 races (it\u2019s 28 btw). The answer should be virtually instant if they know the formula. They might have to wait \u2018until a manager comes back\u2019 because it\u2019s too much for them. Even sometimes the manager doesn\u2019t know either and it\u2019s frustrating, especially when they calculate your winnings wrong (which I had recently) but they didn\u2019t have the ability or authority to correct it. Instead they said I should ring customer services. Why couldn\u2019t they resettle it in the shop? Because not even the manager new how, it\u2019s all done by a head office and the counter staff just beep the barcode and blindly pay out what it says on the screen. I walked out of Ladbrokes over this and have never gone back, but sadly they\u2019re all like it now, it\u2019s down to cost cutting. Minimum wage, minimum interest and knowledge, as I said earlier. Anyway, maybe I could become a tipster! sshhh, you won\u2019t go too far wrong with a \u00a31 win double on Defi de Seuil for the Champion Chase at Cheltenham with Magic of Light in the Grand National approx a couple of weeks later, but don\u2019t tell everyone will you\u2026 ",
