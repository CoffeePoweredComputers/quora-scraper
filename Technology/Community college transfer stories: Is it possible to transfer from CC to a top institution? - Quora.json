            "answer_text": "It's definitely possible to transfer from a community college to a top university. I was admitted to UC Berkeley with a Regents Scholarship, UCLA, and few other UC schools transferring from a comunnity college. I ultimately decided on Berkeley. Some of my peers transferred to UCLA, Stanford, Brown, Columbia, Cornell, and other top flagship universities. General Advice For community college students, if you have the opportunity to take advanced classes/honors courses take them, they will help you prepare for the road ahead. Consider looking into opportunities to do research under a professor or organization, look into cross enrolling into a nearby university, if the there's a concurrent enrollment program connected with your community college. Do activities which you are genuinely interested in; if you concerned that you activity isn\u2019t as \u2018cool\u2019 or \u2018prestigious\u2019, don\u2019t worry, you can make them \u2018prestigious\u2019 by showing your tremendous dedication, and effort toward that activity. In my experience the path towards transferring to a top-public university is fairly straightforward, given that most state universities have explicit transfer agreements with community colleges. For example, in California, if you wanted to transfer to any of the 9 University of California (UC's) or 23 California State University's (CSU's) campuses you could see all of the classes you would need to take on ASSIST.org, which is an online student-transfer information system specifically designed to help students & counselors at community colleges determine the courses needed to transfer to a UC or CSU. What if you wanted to transfer to a private school? The best option you have is to visit the website of the institution you plan on transferring into and find their transfer resources or contact the university to talk to an admissions specialist. Concerning community college transferable work to private university transferable coursework, I had a friend who transferred to Stanford. He originally had no intentions on even applying there, but decided on applying last-minute. To his surprise, he discovered that the rigorous coursework he had been taking to transfer to UC Berkeley was comparable to Stanford.  Concerning Grades, Standing Out & Telling Your Story: A few anecdotes: I applied to Berkeley with a 3.9/4.0 GPA, had taken a several honors courses at my community college, conducted research under my professors, demonstrated deep level commitment to the volunteer work I did outside of school because I genuinely found it interesting, I took an unplanned gap year during my second year at community college to work to alleviate financial strains at home and spent a lot of time trying out new things to find out what I really enjoyed doing and what I wanted to do. You\u2019d be surprised how fast you can grow both academically and personally when you are truly pursuing something you find interesting.A friend of mine who transferred to Stanford (also admitted to UC Berkeley) had about a 3.9 GPA, good SAT scores, had taken honors level courses, presented research at symposiums and had a diverse set of life experiences. After graduating high school, he took two years off from school, traveled many places and worked.Another friend transferred to Cornell with about 3.8+, took honors courses, was active on campus, worked, and also presented research at symposiums.It goes without saying, you need to demonstrate that your academically capable and able to compete at the same level as the students at the universities you want to transfer into. In my opinion & from what I've gathered, it's not just about grades (though you be aiming for the best grades you can). Demonstrating grit, a genuine interest in what you do and you're uniqueness is important, especially since most students on paper look very similiar when vying for places at competitive institutions. If you feel that you are an \u2018untraditional\u2019 student, that is you come from a non-traditional background (military, student parent, re-entry student etc), I believe that only helps you more since you can bring to the classroom a set of experiences that are uncommon in classroom.

            "answer_text": "It is possible, but if you are referring to top private colleges, it is not likely. Community colleges usually have two goals: Prepare students to transfer to a public university in the same state and vocational training. Almost no students are accepted  into \"Ivy League\" colleges, because community colleges are not \"cool\".  Students who opt for community colleges because 4 year colleges are too expensive usually find that private colleges are still too expensive. Students who start with community colleges, because they don't qualify for the 4 year colleges of their choice rarely improve enough to qualify for top private colleges. Many US states have guaranteed admission to public universities if the student complete a community college program (sometimes with a specific minimum GPA). On the other hand, in California and many other states, the top public university is a top 100 or even top 30 college. UC Berkeley, UC Los Angeles, Rutgers, and NYU are all top 30 colleges. ",

Obviously, on top of having essentially perfect grades and test scores, they have to display considerable achievement in some field of interest, demonstrate that they are making unique contributions to the state of the art and/or body of knowledge in that field. And on top of that, they have to demonstrate that they take time to think about the important things in life and read for their own pleasure and edification. Yes, the top schools do sometimes ask on their application forms about what you have been reading. But the main way you will demonstrate this is with a personal statement that tells a unique and memorable story.

            "answer_text": "I only ever saw one community college transfer at my time at MIT.  My two sons saw zero.  The one I saw had transferred from a CC in Wadhington, DC.  He joined our fraternity.  Nice guy, but I think he passed zero classes.  It was pretty obvious his knowledge base was not a good fit.  He lasted a year and everyone tried to help him. Whether this is true at other elite universities, I cannot tell.  Some state schools have the community colleges as a feeder system for their main campus. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes! I transferred from a community college to Caltech. It's definitely not common, but it is possible. I was fortunate to be at a community college with a very rigorous series of physics classes. I finished all of the hardest math and science classes with straight A's, and dominated the school's math competition. I also had really great recommendation letters. ",
