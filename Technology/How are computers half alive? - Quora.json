Look at how I use these words Quora, I\u2019ll bet you\u2019re pleased. Anyway. Computers are not half alive. They are electrical devices, just like a microwave, or even a light bulb. There is no life, just electricity. They are machines, no life. ",

            "answer_text": "There is a legend that computers are \u2018electronic brains\u2019 and those who run them are \u2018supermen\u2019 . But the truth is computers are very stupid and the people who programme them are normal human beings. It is very misleading to imagine that computers can \u2018think\u2019 like people. They cannot. However theyvmake it possible for people to \u2018bottle\u2019 thought. You work out how to solve a problem. Write a program and computer will apply your thinking to that problem as long and often as you like. In this sense computers are half alive because they perpetuate the thinking of their creators. ",
