This medium, just like many other mediums, can be exploited and manipulated to send crafted data packets. You can craft these data packets to listen to conversations, look in through your camera, or whatever the hacker intends on doing. Most of the things your device is capable will be able to be manipulated to do the hackers bidding. One exploit for Bluetooth is BlueBorne.
