            "answer_text": "Ethernet is the most popular standard for connection between computers in a local network. Ethernet was created in the early 1970s at Xerox PARC by Bob MetCalfe. The idea was to be able to exchange information between computers inside the same building - hence the term LAN, which means \"Local Area Network\". At first, Ethernet used a simple coaxial cable to connect all computers together. Everyone could transmit messages (called \"Ethernet frames\") over the wire at any time. All the other computers in the wire would listen to the frames and select the ones that were destined to them. This is a very simple system that requires the minimum wiring, but at a cost: two computers can start transmitting at the same time, mixing and garbling the frames. To avoid this situation Ethernet used a special algorithm, called \"CSMA/CD\" (\"Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Detection). This was the prime feature of Ethernet in its early years and gave it a unfair reputation as a unpredictable and unreliable networking technology - which proved to be false, as Ethernet grew to be the de facto standard to connect computers nowadays. The name \"Ethernet\" derives from the simple system explained above. The wire was the \"Ether\" - the medium that earlier physics believed to fill the universe and that allowed for the transmission of light. As Ethernet evolved, it lost the need for the shared medium. Since the introduction of Ethernet switches in the mid 1990s Ethernet is characterized by a \"star\" topology, where each computer has its own dedicated wire, connected to a Ethernet switch, which receives and relays frames destined to the other computers in the network. That development made Ethernet truly \"plug and play\" and gave it a enormous price/performance advantage over any other  competing networking technology. Today, when people talk about Ethernet, they can be referring to either of two things: (a) the basic Ethernet technology,, in the form of a switch that can be used to connect computers, or (b) the Ethernet frame format, which is used to encode the messages that are transmitted over the network. The Ethernet frame format is used by several different technologies, some entirely unrelated to the original Ethernet standard, or even proprietary. It allows different pieces of equipment to be connected to Ethernet networks. Some examples are the WiFi and WiMAX standards, and also proprietary radios and SDH transmission systems. Ethernet also gained lots of features over the years, including advanced management options (the Ethernet OAM standard) which allow its use for professional telecommunications applications. Ethernet is now used everywhere, but it's still very simple to understand at heart. ",

            "answer_text": "I'll take it back a few levels... Ethernet started out as radio networking over a wire. The origins was in something called ALOHAnet which was developed at the University of Hawaii. They had a problem trying to connect the islands, and used radio. And discovered things about packet data transmission - such as what happens if you have two \"talkers\" at the same time, and how to manage congestion, and other things. It was one of the first, if not the first, network in which all participants shared a connection to a common medium (as opposed to individual links between the participants in a ring, star, hub, or mesh configuration). Bob Metcalfe had studied the experiment as part of his PhD work, and while at Xerox PARC in the early 70s, decided that the radio part was getting  in the way of speed, so put all that analog magic on a wire, creating the first version of Ethernet.   Originally, it was a thick RG-8 coax, with \"vampire transceivers\" which pierced the shield and connected the electronics to the core wire without causing a break in the cable. You connected your computer to it using  an 8-pin AUI cable (upper right corner). Speed limit was 10Mbps. Distance was 1.5km - if you could afford that much cable. In the late 70s, \"plain\" cable was about $2/foot, and the Teflon coated stuff that was required for in-ceiling cabling to meet fire code was over $8/foot. That eventually evolved in to RG-58 \"Thinnet\", and RJ-45 twisted pair networking that you're likely familiar with today, plus fiber based solutions. To paraphrase from Demolition Man, \"In the future, all networks are Ethernet\" ",
