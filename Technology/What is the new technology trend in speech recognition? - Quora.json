            "answer_text": "Over the last decade, voice recognition technology has made some major advances. Using speech technology ten years ago was more of a headache than the value that it was proposing to bring. As evidenced by the popularity of Siri, Google Voice and Dragon Assistant, speech technology has come a long way. Today you can find the technology in most smart phones and on many laptops and tablets sitting on our store shelves. Big companies like Apple, Google, Intel, Microsoft and Nuance are investing heavily in research and development. Each of them sees a future potential in voice recognition and they are all racing to become the industry leader. We researched some of today\u2019s voice recognition breakthroughs and took a sneak peek at what the future of voice recognition might look like. ",

            "answer_text": "These days (September 2014) all trends are set by Google and Microsoft, most work is on pushing neural networks and deep learning everywhere. Acoustic model is already replaced with network, now the task is to replace the language model and the whole search with neural network.  You can get idea about recent research from the following papers: Asynchronous, Online, GMM-free Training of a Context Dependent Acoustic Model for Speech RecognitionPage on googleusercontent.com  Word Embeddings for Speech RecognitionPage on googleusercontent.com Hybrid Speech Recognition With Deep Bidirectional LSTMAlex Graves, Navdeep Jaitly and Abdel-rahman MohamedPage on toronto.edu There are few unsolved problems here so it will take few more years of research to sort everything out.
