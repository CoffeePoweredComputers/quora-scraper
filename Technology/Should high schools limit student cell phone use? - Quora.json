            "answer_text": "Yes, absolutely. There is no human right to use your phone whenever and wherever you are. That\u2019s why many states ban cell phone use while driving and strongly advise against staring at your phone while walking outside. Personal cell phone use is also strongly discouraged in a work environment, in theaters, and in church because it distracts the user as well as those around him or her. So if I were teaching a high school class, I would expect phones to be turned off. I would expect the same of teachers. While it would be OK to have phones on buzz, the problem is that too many people are tempted to look at them as soon as they hear the buzz, so it\u2019s distracting. Checking your phone at lunch would be OK, or in study hall. But looking at your phone while walking between classes is hazardous to you and others. ",
