            "answer_text": "GPS is a method of working out exactly where something is. It works to provide information on exact location. It can also track the movement of a vehicle or person. So does it work and can be tracked? A GPS tracking system uses the Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) network. This network incorporates a range of satellites that use microwave signals that are transmitted to GPS devices to give information on location, vehicle speed, time and direction. GPS provides special satellite signals, which are processed by a receiver. These GPS receivers not only track the exact location but can also compute velocity and time. The positions can even be computed in three-dimensional views with the help of four GPS satellite signals. The Space Segment of the Global Positioning System consists of 27 Earth-orbiting GPS satellites. There are 24 operational and 3 extra (in case one fails) satellites that move round the Earth each 12 hours and send radio signals from space that are received by the GPS receiver. The control of the Positioning System consists of different tracking stations that are located across the globe. These monitoring stations help in tracking signals from the GPS satellites that are continuously orbiting the earth. Space vehicles transmit microwave carrier signals. The users of Global Positioning Systems have GPS receivers that convert these satellite signals so that one can estimate the actual position, velocity and time. ",

            "answer_text": "I didn't understand, what do you mean by tracking a GPS. assuming you meant\u2019 how do you track a gps receiver?\u2019 my answer is GPS receiver is a passive device, which can receive signals from GPS satellites and calculate it's position. We cannot track such a passive device, when it is not radiating out transmitting Amy signals. So it is not possible to track a GPS receiver, where is present. Only if it has some additional add-on like some cellular phone or mobile phone add on, then that may be able to transmit the gps receiver location, then using those mobile signals, GPS receiver may be tracked.

            "answer_text": "As others have noted, GPS receivers don't intentionally transmit anything. A tracking device might transmit the GPS determined position using a separate communication link. That link might be detectable and tracable, but residual emissions from the GPS receiver itself would be hard to detect, other than it's an electronic device that makes some noise, like any other electronic device. GPS receivers often use specific internal oscillators which might be detected, but those frequencies aren't that unique and all the various other devices we use, including other devices that contain GPS receivers, could easily drown out the desired receiver. While it's possible to detect them if you can isolate where you think the tracker is well enough, if someone really wanted for the receiver to be able to evade detection, they could make the GPS receiver quiet enough to be virtually undetectable.

            "answer_text": "No. Not \u201cGPS\u201d only devices. GPS is a receivers only. They receive the transmissions from GPS satellites and use the information to calculate their position. If you want to track a GPS device, it must have a transmitter of some sort. For example, most GPS Trackers have a Cellular Radio to connect to a cell network. From there, they can upload their position to servers for others to track. Smartphones are a common example of GPS devices with transmitters. ",
