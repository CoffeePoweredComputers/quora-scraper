            "answer_text": "Think about the number of distinct job titles/responsibilities that are needed by McDonalds Corporation. With 1.8 million employees in 112 countries, my guess is that they probably have hundreds\u2014if not over a thousand\u2014separate roles to be filled. These range from the CEO, to a counter person in the Wichita downtown drive-through; from Director of Human Resources to US Quality Systems/Food Safety Manager (Potato & Oil Products).   In contrast, consider a hot dog vendor on a street corner. The fact is that virtually all of those same roles are required...it's just that they're all filled by the same person. The counter-person making your hot dog happens to be the CEO of the company, who also manages his own health insurance and, by the way, is responsible for the fact that his potato knishes are safe to eat.   Similarly, in a startup there are a nearly infinite number of roles that can be filled, but all of them are multi tasking. For example, in the canonical \"hacker/hustler\" startup team, the former may combine every role from CTO to Junior Assistant Regression Tester in the Quality Assurance Department, and the latter every role from CEO to night shift call center operator in the Customer Service Department. What this means is that a startup will generally take all the help it can afford, shedding whatever burden is possible off the shoulders of the Founder(s), who are the default incumbents in every other role. The new hires will be prioritized to take on the most urgently needed activities, with the specific positions being a function of (a) the unique business of the startup, and (b) the unique skill sets of the Founder(s). As an example, if the tech founder happens to be a superb product designer as well as a skilled coder, the earliest hires are likely to be in the area of sales and marketing. But if the tech founder is primarily a hardcore hacker, the most urgent need may be for a visual designer. Along the same lines, if the business founder is primarily finance-oriented, the first hires might well be sales people. But if she is herself a consummate salesperson, then the initial hires may be an operations person to handle ordering and fulfillment. The bottom line is that every startup needs a host of non-technical early team members, but the specific roles will differ, just as each startup is different. So rather than dealing in generalizations, go right to the source and let them tell you what positions they're seeking to fill: startuphire.comstartuply.comventureloop.cominsidestartups.org ",

            "answer_text": "Just to add to the excellent answer by David Rose, there are far more non-technical people who want to start/ join tech business - they generally (and possibly rightfully so) have a lot more to prove becuase their contribution seems intangible until they bring some users or paying customers to the table. That bit can only happens after a product has been built.  So what should a non-technical person do in the meantime I.e while the product is being worked on? 1) Build a list of qualified prospects - Getting qualified traffic to give you an email is not always easy. One of the first steps to list building is creating landing pages that covert - ie where traffic that lands on your page can give you their contact info. However you don't have to stick to digital marketing for list building. Pick up the phone and make cold calls or attend Meetups and networking events. Basically, do anything to add one more name to your list. Building a list early and marketing content to them can help you get a jump start on customer/ user acquisitions when you launch.  2) Website optimization - When you first buy your domain name, your domain's authority (DA) is going to be zero. So, it is upto you to start building it up. Writing the kind of content that will attract qualified traffic to your site is one way to do it. This will also help you get ahead with showing up organically on search results over time, which generally has the lowest cost of acquisition (COA) 3) Partnerships - This is also a good time for you to find/ screen and validate potential partners in the space. Your best partners are going to be ones that target the same market with a different product and who will also 'win' with the alliance - which makes them more motivated to invest time in the partnership. 4) Investor relationships - Funding takes a long time to close and someone needs to be the point person on the job to continuously work the relationships. You can be that person. Build the pitch deck, organize meeting with angels/ vc's, pitch to them and iterate from there. Investors often 'watch' your company from a distance and see if you are making progress on all the things you said you were going to do. Keep them excited with updates and you will have played a major role in the company's success. Good luck! ",
