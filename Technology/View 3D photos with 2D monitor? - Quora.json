            "answer_text": "A normal LCD screen won't work for polarized (or passive) 3D because both the screen and the glasses need to be polarized. Passive 3D works like this on 3D monitors and TV's: Two images are shown at the same time, one for the right eye, and one for the left eye. In order to show these images on screen at the same time, each image is given half of the screen's pixels to use. So for example, the first line of horizontal pixels is for one eye, then the next line down is for the other eye. This alternates all the way down the screen. Each line of pixels is polarized, and with polarized glasses on, the lines for the other eye are blocked out so that each eye only sees the pixels meant for it. Another good explanation of how this works is found here:3D Display Technology: Passive Polarized Vs. Active Shutter - HP 2311 gt 23  Monitor Review: Passive, Polarized 3D On A Budget Since normal LCD screens aren't polarized in this manner, it isn't possible to use polarized glasses with any old screen. It's not a matter of framerates, but rather physical technology that isn't found in ordinary LCD screens. ",
