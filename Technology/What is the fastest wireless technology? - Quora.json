            "answer_text": "The very fast wireless technologies are those that use very wideband widths.These potentially offer far faster than the ~100Mbps of technologies you offer, but with the severe trade-off of very short range (Bluetooth or less), or point-point / line of sight. Point-point wireless routinely delivers >1Gbs today. the 60GHz band could allow 5+Gbps for short-range WiFi eg ''WiGig''http://www.tomsguide.com/us/Wi-Fi-WiGig-Wimax-Wifi,news-6739.htmlhttp://www.tensorcom.com/ UWB (ultrawideband) offered similar data rates but with similar range limitations and has not suceeded in the market ",

            "answer_text": "The fastest wireless technology that will soon be out (in about 1 to 2 years) is the second version of WiGig: 802.11ay. Early 802.11ay chips will aggregate two ~2 GHz-wide channels to achieve about 10 Gbps. Eventually, more capable chips will aggregate four channels and use massive MIMO to reach speeds approaching or even surpassing 100 Gbps. ",
