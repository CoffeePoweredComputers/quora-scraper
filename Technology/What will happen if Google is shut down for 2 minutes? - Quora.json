            "answer_text": "A2A :) Oh wow! 2 minutes is a LONG time for Google to go down! Let\u2019s break this down: Overall internet traffic will see a drop of close to 40%.Google will lose out on about 8 million searches and the resulting ad revenue.About 9 million potential video views on YouTube will be lost, along with the ad revenue from there.Gmail will build up a backlog of over 80 million unsent emails.Google might stand to lose up to half a million USD in ad revenue overall.Bing and DuckDuckGo will see a major spike in search traffic for those two minutes - however, people will most probably revert to Google after 2 minutes.Those with Google as their default page will turn to Facebook to check their internet connectivity. Facebook will see a major, but short-lived spike in traffic.Google services served from applications (Chrome, Maps) will function fine. Chrome will be able to access all other websites and while GPS might be flaky on Maps, people are unlikely to lose their way. Maps will just switch to offline navigation.We at Google will see diagnostic emails coming in left, right, and center. We will also be entertaining quite a few angry advertisers and YT content creators**This is assuming that the internal Google services are up and running - otherwise, Google\u2019s ability to troubleshoot the issue might also be greatly hampered.But here\u2019s the deal though: Google is extremely careful about this. If an entire server site goes offline, there are multiple other sites that will immediately take its place. It is extremely unlikely that Google will go offline - even if it does, it\u2019s even more unlikely that all Google services will go offline at the same time - even if it does, it\u2019s almost impossible that it will stay offline for 2 minutes. You\u2019ll have more luck winning the lottery, twice, with the same ticket.
