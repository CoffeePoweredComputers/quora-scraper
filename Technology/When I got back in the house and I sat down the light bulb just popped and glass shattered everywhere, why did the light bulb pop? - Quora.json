            "answer_text": "It\u2019s very unlikely that your return and sitting-down had anything to do with the light-bulb failure, beyond that you apparently turned it on when you returned :-) I had a similar experience, 200W 240V incandescent went *bang*, put broken glass all over the carpet, and left me in the dark (in part because it tripped the breaker). The usual cause is:- the filament fails, open, whilst hot / energized- the gap in the filament causes an arc, which creates plasma, which is conductive- the plasma shorts the bulb- the breaker is (maybe) 32A, so a *lot* of current goes through the bulb, causing explosive heating- the gas (argon, nitrogen) in the bulb, causes the envelope to break (explode) ",
