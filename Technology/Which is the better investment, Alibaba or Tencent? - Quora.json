            "answer_text": "Tencent is wonderful company to invest in. It has a dominating esport platform and a social media gem known as wechat. Tencent is in the business of engaging the mind. There are millions of people in china who have not been introduced to tencent products yet but as technology infrastructure gets better (increase in internet/smartphone/ techy savvy youth), tencent will continue to increase market share and influence. Tencent has a dominating esport also known as riot LOL. America might have NFL, NBA, MLB but China needs to carve out a niche for itself which is esport. Something they are great at and invoke nationalistic pride. People often compare tencent to other tech Chinese companies such as alibaba or baidu. Although they are all considered technology companies, they are very different. At its core Alibaba is a marketplace platform. Alibaba is stuck selling cheap commodity products. An analogy would be the world largest dollar tree store. No one in the developed world or middle class Chinese respects anything that is made in China other than for its price point. There are no brands in China that evoke splurging in high marginalized item. As the Chinese middle class grows bigger, they will be more engage in buying western brands than generic stuff produce in China. Alibaba will have a growth problem. I think Baidu is a great company too in China, however I don\u2019t think they will be as successful as Tencent in China. At its core, Baidu is like a think tank for China. The services that they create are useful but not as irreplaceable and they have to retain that culture to attract the highest talent to their organization. A lot of great technology has been created but there value is not as easily capture. I believe the mind has to be engaged and i see that Tencent will be the company with most influence in the next 5 years. ",
