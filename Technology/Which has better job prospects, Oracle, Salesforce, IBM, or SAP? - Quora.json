Here are some other thoughts: I am in SAP and I still see after 18 years already inside it that it is a wonderful career to make money and to create some impact in business. I dont see any competition in near future. For me, SAP will be number 1 choice.Being a cloud application, Salesforce has big potential but generally projects dont need that many resources and rate is lower than SAP for consultants.Oracle: I am not sure, which product of Oracle, are you referring here? But in general it does not come in my top choice.IBM: It has many products, some products are better than other. Still it is not my top choice.So I will go with SAP and then Salesforce. ",
