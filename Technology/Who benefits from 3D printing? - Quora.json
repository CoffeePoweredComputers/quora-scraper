            "answer_text": "The benefits of 3D printing are currently quite inconsequential. However, the potential is huge - an order of magnitude similar to the Industrial Revolution. A lot of it depends on a few specifics that are yet to be fully resolved.1) Mixed material 3D printing - specifically being able to print both plastics and metals, although glass and ceramic would be nice too2) Speed and resolution - obviously prints are either smooth and slow or fast and pixelated (or fast and blobby)3) Molecular manipulation as opposed to polymerization or sintering (this is in its infancy at the moment)4) A plan/vision for civic/social engineering by way of 3D printing could be very useful.5) A Le Corbusier-type visionary who embodies and promotes the values and \u2018virtues\u2019 of this process in dramatic and globally visible ways. That all said, there are myriad ways that 3D printing could re-engineer the world. You might want to read Neal Stephenson\u2019s The Diamond Age for a glimpse into what could be (but that\u2019s just one vision). There are of course down-sides to a 3D printed world as well. In the short run, aside from new forms that are not possible through traditional manufacturing (see the furniture work of Joris Laarman, futuristic fashion of Iris Van Herpen, and the housewares company OTHR). It allows for non-serialized production (custom manufacturing as production). When it is currently utilized, it is in vertical markets that have specific needs like architecture, aerospace, medical, etc. that have specific needs that cannot be served with traditional manufacturing methods and that have deep enough pockets to absorb the cost of a process still in its infancy. And potentially most importantly (short-term), it allows for decentralized manufacturing - that is, things don\u2019t need to be made in a centralized factory and could be made in local micro-factories or even farmed out to private small businesses, eliminating transport costs and environmental impact while promoting a more circular economy and allowing the general (middle class) populace to benefit rather just those in a position of priviledge. Anyone want to give that one a try? Best of luck. ",

            "answer_text": "Everyone who uses it. As far back as 10 years ago my employer at the time started using them to make parts in our warehouses, We were paying 1$12.00 for a part that we coup make for about 0.40 cents. It was a part we went through hundred every year. It was not simply a great saving, it was a huge time saver too. Once management saw how useful it was we started manufacturing all kinds of things with very similar results. In our studios we used clear acrylic ro make prop holders and frames that significantly reduced the cost and time to do high volume production photography and video. I could give dozens of examples. The point is anyone can benefit form having a 3D printer around once they start learning how to use them. In commercial settings 3D printing is now heavily used in automotive and aerospace manufacturing, in home furniture, in prototyping, etc. 3D printer can now use all kinds of products from resin, to plastic, and even metal. Even medial devices, safety masks and ventilators to help keep uo with COVID demands. I suggest anyone who wants to get a better idea about industrial and commercial 3D printers should consider this link and subscribe to their free newsletter. 3D Printing Industry-The Authority on 3D Printing & Additive Manufacturing ",
