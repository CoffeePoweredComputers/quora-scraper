            "answer_text": "It is never a good idea to stop making the monthly payments on your cell phone plan if you have signed a contract (usually for 2 years). An online electronic signature is a legally binding signature, usually in the form of a box that states \u201cI agree\u201d ( with the online terms and conditions set forth by the cell phone provider or service). If you are locked into a contract with your cell phone company and stop making payments before the contract expires, here is what will happen: (1) Your phone service will be terminated for non-payment (2) You may be subject to a hefty \u201cfine\u201d due to your failure to fulfill your contract obligation to your cell phone service provider. and your Credit Score will take a damaging hit when your cell phone company files a derogatory report, which can remain on your credit reports (with all 3 U.S. Credit Reporting Agencies) for 7 years unless the debt is satisfied or otherwise successfully disputed and removed- - which is no easy task !

            "answer_text": "First, your service gets disconnected. If you still don\u2019t pay up they will start calling to try and collect. Eventually they will write it off as a loss and sell your debt to a credit connection service. When that happens your credit rating takes a serious hit making it harder for you to get service with any other phone company, or credit cards, or car loans, or mortgages, etc. After that the calls and letters will start. Collection agencies are ruthless. They will call you, and anybody else they think they can bully into paying. You will be dealing with them on a daily basis for the next seven years or more. Depending on the amount you owe, they may sue you and garnishee your wages. ",

            "answer_text": "From experience: They will shut you down from making or receiving phone calls and text messages. It will simply be a great wi-fi MP3 player or web surfer. Just go out and buy a cheap pre-paid phone and say goodbye to contracts. Save your money and buy an unlocked phone that you can take to any carrier you choose. I was able to save enough money in a few months when I told Verizon to go suck it to get the XR and go with a solid Pre-Paid plan from Visible with unlimited and unthrottled EVERYTHING for $40 (flat rate/no fees or taxes) per month. Liberating!!!!! ",
