            "answer_text": "To distil the differences between these technologies into the most concise little nugget, LED LCD displays use a backlight to illuminate their pixels while OLED\u2019s pixels actually produce their own light. You might hear OLED\u2019s pixels called \u2018emissive\u2019. What this means is that the brightness of an OLED display can be controlled pixel-by-pixel. This sort of control just isn\u2019t possible with an LED LCD. In cheaper TVs and LCD-screen phones (that\u2019ll be most of them), LED LCD screens use LED backlights that actually sit to the side of the display, not right behind it. The light from these LEDs is then fired through a matrix that feeds it through the red green and blue pixels and into our eyes. So with LED LCD screens, control over the level of brightness across the display is limited. Take an LCD display into a darkened room and you\u2019ll notice that parts of an image aren\u2019t perfectly black, because you can still see the backlight showing through. ",

            "answer_text": "OLEDs create their own light not at all like LCDs which require a backlight that implies less parts. Another favorable position that this presents is the lower power consumption; an incredible measure of the power consumed by LCDs goes to the backlight, subsequently the huge power difference. The absence of a backlight likewise implies that an OLED display can be fundamentally slimmer than a LCD display. OLEDs have likewise been seen to show hotter pictures with better complexity making their picture quality far prevalent than what LCDs right now accomplish. ",
