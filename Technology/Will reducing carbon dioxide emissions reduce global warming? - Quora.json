            "answer_text": "How about an answer that makes sense, because it is not coming from any religious belief either that \u201cclimate change\u201d is happening or that it is not happening? Climate changes for many reasons. Before mankind put carbon dioxide from fossil fuel into the air these changes were all caused by \u201cnatural causes\u201d, of which there are many. One of these \u201cnatural causes\u201d is the eruption of \u201csupervolcanoes\u201d. These put so much \u201cash\u201d in the sky that the \u201caverage global temperature\u201d of sea water decreases, because the light from the Sun is reduced. See the reference below for the \u201cextiniction event\u201d associated with this phenomena. Deccan Traps - Wikipedia The release of volcanic gases, particularly sulfur dioxide, during the formation of the traps contributed to climate change. Data point to an average drop in temperature of about 2 \u00b0C (3.6 \u00b0F) in this period.Because of its magnitude, scientists have speculated that the gases released during the formation of the Deccan Traps played a role in the Cretaceous\u2013Paleogene (K\u2013Pg) extinction event (also known as the Cretaceous\u2013Tertiary or K-T extinction). It has been theorized that sudden cooling due to sulfurous volcanic gases released by the formation of the traps and toxic gas emissions may have contributed significantly to the K\u2013Pg, as well as other, mass extinctions. However, the most popular current consensus among the scientific community is that the extinction was triggered by the Chicxulub impact event in North America, which would have produced a sunlight-blocking dust cloud that killed much of the plant life and reduced global temperature (this cooling is called an impact winter). Another \u201cnatural cause\u201d is the impact of a very large meteor, because the \u201cimpact fallout\u201d it has a similar effect on climate. See the reference below for the \u201cextinction event\u201d associated with this phenomena. Chicxulub crater - Wikipedia The emission of dust and particles could have covered the entire surface of the Earth for several years, possibly a decade, creating a harsh environment for living things. The shock production of carbon dioxide caused by the destruction of carbonate rocks would have led to a sudden greenhouse effect. Over a decade or longer, sunlight would have been blocked from reaching the surface of the Earth by the dust particles in the atmosphere, cooling the surface dramatically. Photosynthesis by plants would also have been interrupted, affecting the entire food chain. A model of the event developed by Lomax et al. (2001) suggests that net primary productivity (NPP) rates may have increased to higher than pre-impact levels over the long term because of the high carbon dioxide concentrations. So now please note that in both references one can be easily confused. Did the non-bird dinosaurs become extinct because of the consequences of global warming caused by the meteor strike, by the consequences of global cooling caused by the meteor strike, by the consequences of global warming when supervolcanoes release carbon dioxide, or by the consequences of global cooling when supervolcanoes release ash and dust? So let me restate what we have established so far: Climate changes for natural causes, and this can either be a \u201cwarming\u201d or a \u201ccooling\u201d.Cooling is caused by \u201csomething getting in the way of sunlight\u201d. And this can be a \u201cgreenhouse gas\u201d like water vapour (clouds).Warming is caused by \u201csomething getting in the way of INFRARED radiation.Now to give you some idea of why you can believe what I tell you MORE than most who comment on \u201cclimate change\u201d. I know how to describe the \u201cgreenhouse effect\u201d correctly. But the chances are that the DENIER of \u201cman made global climate change\u201d - because that is what you are asking about - does not. So now to answer your question: No, we can\u2019t stop climate change, in the way you imply. And this is for two reasons.One - climate changes naturally as well as for reasons associated with putting more greenhouse gas in the air.Two - it takes a while for the increase in greenhouse gas to have an effect. Therefore even if we \u201ctake carbon dioxide out of the air\u201d it will take a while for the Earth\u2019s climate to change DIFFERENTLY than it is doing now.And the climate is \u201cchanging differently\u201d. ALL the evidence NOW is that not only does man have to have at least SOME effect on climate, he has already HAD a SIGNIFICANT effect, and even if we stop increasing the concentration of greenhouse gas it will take a while for the climate to return to one where the \u201caverage global temperature of sea water\u201d will not change as much as it does now.Which is a very poor way of describing the evidence, but as water plays such an important part in climate (polar ice caps, clouds, and sea water are all fundamental FACTORS in climate), it is the best I can do, if I am trying to explain it to someone who really does not know the astrophysics.Which even I do not do that well, since climate is so complex a subject. Now I hear the IGNORANT and STUPID denier saying \u201cyou see, he does not know EITHER\u201d, just like the ignorant and stupid \u201ccreationist\u201d I argue with. But I know how to describe the \u201cgreenhouse effect\u201d and they usually can\u2019t. And I know that they can\u2019t because every time I argue with them they are unable to explain it correctly. And it is just \u201chigh school physics\u201d. When you consider that common sense should tell us that if we do not know the physics, we do not argue with those that do, and when common sense should tell us that man has to have SOME effect on climate, if he puts more carbon dioxide in the air than is taken out, each year, it is obvious that One - we need to do something about it, if the effects are significant.Two - it will not be easy to do something about it, because natural causes are involved too, and because the greenhouse effect is cumulative.Three - we can\u2019t just STOP it.So now to answer the intent of your question. Which is to ask if there is something we can do to REDUCE the natural consequences of additional carbon dioxide. I hope you understand at this point in my answer that climate change is both a natural consequence of natural causes, like the supervolcano converting calcium carbonates to carbon dioxide, or the meteor impact reducing the amount of sunlight reaching the ground, and a natural consequence of man made causes. Like the conversion of fossil fuel \u201ccarbon\u201d built up over 300 million years into carbon dioxide over 300 years. So I have already said that it is too late to reverse the damage that has been done already. But what we can do is to STOP increasing the level of carbon dioxide we have already. And this is a good answer for several reasons. Nature already has many ways to compensate for an increased level of carbon dioxide. Just by increasing the number of plants and ensuring that the phytoplankton in the sea are at \u201cnormal levels\u201d this carbon dioxide can be converted back to carbohydrates.If the ONLY hydrocarbons that we burn as fuel in one year were carbohydrates made the previous year, that is \u201ccarbon neutral\u201d BIO-FUEL.Sustainable energy sources, whether as bio-fuel, or as SOLAR ENERGY that does not have an ORGANIC CHEMICAL intermediate stage (hydropower, wind power, ocean thermal gradient power, solar photovoltaic cells, solar water heat exchangers, and so forth), mean that we do not have to put any MORE in than there is now.And then all we have to do is to ensure that there are as many plants as possible, and that our seas are free from polution, so that the phytoplankton can survive, and we may even find that we start LOSING some of that extra carbon dioxide.But only after a thousand years from now, which is a time frame the DENIER never thinks about, in his selfishly ignorant and stupid way.One thing that I find in common with the DENIER and the RELIGIOUS is their tendency to EXTREMES. Either they FIRST say \u201cthere is no evidence at all of man made global climate change\u201d, which is an absurd thing to say, even if there is no evidence they know about.Or, when you convince them that the reason why our predictions for the future are now so extreme, because idiots like him refused to listen until it was too late, they will just say \u201cit is too late anyway\u201d. And then carry on their selfish, ignorant and stupid way, just like the cigarette smoker already diagnosed with cancer.So please do not let my answer give you that selfish, slightly less ignorant, and STILL stupid attitude. We can always STILL do something. It is one thing for my children to tell their grandchildren that I did nothing about it, except to teach basic astrophysics on Quora. It is another thing for my children to THINK that they can do nothing, because Man is inherently stupid and ignorant, especially when selfishness is involved. You CAN do something. You can first learn how to correctly describe the greenhouse effect. And then when an ignorant and stupid denier tells you what it is not, you can first tell him what it is, and then you can ask him why he is so certain, without a degree in astrophysics, why the same physics that applies to greenhouses does not apply to Earth. Oh, and rather than just tell you how to describe it, I will first challenge a denier, ANY denier (and I accept some of them MAY have some knowledge of what I consider high school physics). Tell us what you think it is and why it does not apply. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, however, that\u2019s only reducing AGW. The only way to get rid of the excess is to have plants convert it into new and better soil. Say we all quit using fossil fuels. The world will still warm up because this big planet\u2019s biosphere hasn\u2019t reached equilibrium. We are storing the extra heat in the oceans, slowly but surely. As they warm up, more active weather accelerates the melting of glaciers. When they\u2019re gone, then we\u2019ll know for sure that the scientists were correct to be concerned about AGW, as there probably wouldn\u2019t be any snow. Before they melt, there should be more snow, because the intensity of storms should be stronger in a warmer world. Now, if we all of a sudden got rid of the excess (like magically) then the biosphere would slowly cool back down to natural levels. We might want a little extra warmth, say that which results from 320 ppm, instead of today\u2019s 410 ppm, as compared to the natural being just 280 ppm back at the start of the digging of fossil fuels. It would slowly cool because the oceans already have some stored heat, which might take decades (not sure) to get back to normal. So, we\u2019ve probably crossed the \u201cdo nothing\u201d tipping point, meaning that if we do nothing (like all die tomorrow) the world will just continue to heat up. Not just from it\u2019s still adjusting to the excess CO2, but because that excess has already set in motion some other actions. Since there is less reflective ice, the Earth has a lower albedo (less reflectivity). This means that the warmth from the sunlight will be absorbed, rather than reflected back into space. Also, a warmer biosphere will release more naturally stored methane, which is also a GHG. Also, a warmer world will hold more water vapor, also a GHG. Put the three positive feedback effects together and chances are, they will counter any negative (which are positive to us in an overly warm world) feedback effects, such as more clouds reflecting more sunlight back into space. Compounding feedback effects could accelerate GW faster than imagined, hence why we need to both get off fossil fuels and get rid of the excess CO2! The best way to get off of FFs is to simply design the best nuclear reactor design, such as Alvin Weinberg\u2019s Molten Salt Reactor. A new 21st century approach might make them last longer. The following is just one of many different designs that I found using the keywords \u201cMolten salt reactor fuel in rods\u201d (I couldn\u2019t find the one I was looking for, which only would have to replace the fuelrods, which are not normally needed in any MSR).  We could go full on solar and wind, but that would require a global grid. Otherwise, many countries would be in poverty conditions during their winter. The global grid would distribute solar to night, windy to non windy. However, the global grid would cost about 5 million dollars/GW line/km. Add up hundreds of thousands of km and, you get the point. we could probably do it for just a few trillion. Then we\u2019d have to install all that cheap solar and wind, doubly, to make up for intermittency. However, the economic prosperity arising from such a global grid would probably more than justify. That would help enable solutions. But then again, how many reliable nuclear plants could be built for 5 trillion dollars? Note that the best design will be about an order of magnitude less expensive that today\u2019s Light Water Reactor. That\u2019s because the LWR requires a very large containment dome, requires engineered safety (since it is not passively safe) and is prone to the politics of fear (which equate to much higher insurance costs). And they have been known to actually melt down! Figure about $5/watt (instead of 12 to 15) for modularly factory assembled machines that convert heavy metal to energy at 6x the efficiency than the LWR, produces less long lived wastes and which can not melt down. Half of that figure would be in certification, insurance, etc! In other words, the intrinsic costs of the best reactor design would be cheaper than the intrinsic costs of renewable energy, per 24/7 unit of energy. Because less materials are needed for a very powerful reliable source, like, much less energy storage and much less actual structure and land needed per kWh. There is enough thorium and uranium on Earth\u2019s crust to power humanity till we get full blown space solar power! ",
