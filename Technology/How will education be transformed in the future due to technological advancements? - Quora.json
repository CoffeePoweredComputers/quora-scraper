            "answer_text": "Today, the entire education system is evolving to become more digitized, and there are new and rapidly changing disciplines taught outside the walls of traditional education providers in this knowledge-based society, where technology is continuously exploring new ways in which traditionally disseminated. It is time to understand how practical solutions can optimize the system. Why is traditional education no longer viable? How Is Technology Changing Education! Traditional teaching methods, including textbooks, are quickly becoming inefficient and outdated. Traditional classroom teaching is now led by educational technologists who design and develop curriculum content, according to the CTC (College Transition Collaborative) researchers. Today, traditional education providers are under extreme pressure to bring technology to campus. While many universities and colleges welcome this change, the business model implemented by most institutes is holding it back. University lecturers are permanently employed, their knowledge and expertise are lacking revision, and they cannot develop new courses fast enough, especially technology-related courses. Similarly, we no longer rely on the \"next big thing\" in education to push us forward and use technology in the classroom. Why tech in education? When students have difficulty learning at a reasonable pace, teaching methods can be changed to meet their needs. Technology's a powerful tool that can support and transform education in many ways. New educational technologies and tools enable everyone to have a piece of good knowledge. New scientific methods include the use of educational software and the display of videos to help students understand a topic through animations and interactive content, making it easier for students to focus on the subject through engaging and attractive videos and slides. In the last ten years, technology has changed the way we work and communicate with each other. But the way we interact outside the classroom has also changed. As our generation changes with technology, we are also changing who we are and what we understand about the power of technology. Indeed, some educators argue that technology can improve the classroom by eliminating the need for a physical class and allowing students to learn where they do their best work. Although it is too early to know the most effective way of teaching, it is vital to keep abreast of innovations in education and see what we can learn from them. Online learning has the potential to improve the quality of education by accelerating learning levels, making use of learning time during school hours, reducing the cost of educational resources, and making use of teachers' time. Online learning, combined with school-based teaching, is often used to take into account student's \"different learning styles and enable them to function in a way that is not possible in traditional full-time teaching. In rural areas, where combined and online learning can help teachers and students overcome distances, the use of learning apps is also useful. Blended learning programs include face-to-face and online learning opportunities and the use of social media and social networks. The future: Virtual reality education is on the horizon, and no doubt, it will change the world as we know it. The 21st-century classroom will be a technologically advanced learning space, with VR significantly increasing students \"engagement in learning. VR experiences will inspire us to innovate and change our world, not only for the better but also for our future. As more online resources become available to help students learn, education will change. As STEM subjects receive more attention and develop their skills, children will learn skills that did not exist before. Besides, this means the way people learn will change, even if the teacher writes on the blackboard. An example of this is a study on the difficulties students face in some disciplines. It suggests that these challenges will get addressed by combining online learning and distance learning with campus-based education. The time may come when education assessors and teachers will not have to travel to a school location to assess teachers for training but will do so using audiovisual technology. Education remains the driving force behind national development in many countries around the world. ",
