            "answer_text": "Even with the best engineers available and unlimited budget and resources, the fastest I could see us building a copy of the great pyramid would be something like 5\u201310 years. That\u2019s with every possible resource thrown at it, realistically, this is going to be a much longer project. Even though the challenge of moving 2.5 ton blocks into place is well within the capabilities of modern construction cranes, the great pyramid has 2.5 million blocks. The logistics of precision placing each block would be the bottleneck of this operation. You can scale up everything else, how many people you have cutting and shipping stone blocks to the site. Throwing more people at those tasks will speed them along. But they cannot just fit an infinite amount of cranes into that finite space. The more cranes you can safely fit into the area, the more blocks you can place per day. Note: Egyptology claims that the Great Pyramid was built in 20 years but this cannot be true. Assuming they only worked during the daytime and never took a day off for holidays or weekends, that comes out to them placing a block every 2.1 minutes. Picture how long you think it would take to for a team of men to finish placing a block, go get a new 2.5 ton block from a staging area, haul it to its final location and place that flush up against the last one they had just placed. Now, how many separate teams of men can you fit into an ever shrinking platform\u2026 Other things to consider include weekends, holidays, multi-day dust storms, famine, war, drought. When you compound this with the insistence by Egyptologists that they were built by farmers during the 2 months out of the year the Nile was flooded. And, oh yeah Egyptology also insists that Sneferu - Wikipedia kept running into problems during construction and kept having to start over but still managed to build three large pyramids in under 50 years\u2026 It becomes very clear that Egyptologists have no clue what they are talking about when it comes answering the questions related to construction times.
