            "answer_text": "There is no app that will give you \u201cfree Wi-Fi\u201d Wi-Fi is just wireless LAN connectivity (like using an Ethernet cable, but wirelessly), in order to get Wi-Fi (that is connected to the Internet) you need an ISP (service), a Modem to connect to that ISP, a router and a WAP (Wireless Access Point, the Wi-Fi) In order to get \u201cfree Wi-Fi\u201d, you need to be in range of an open (unprotected) Access Point You can usually get free Wi-Fi at a Starbucks or at fast food places like McDonald\u2019s, the idea is that they aren\u2019t exactly free, but you pay by being a paying customer, like when you use Starbuck\u2019s free Wi-Fi, chances are you are going to get a coffee anyway (though there is nothing preventing you from using the Wi-Fi without the purchase of a coffee) In that case, Starbucks (or whatever business providing Wi-Fi) pays the ISP for Internet service and provides Wi-Fi with an on-site router and WAP You can download an app that uses your GPS location to show you places near you where you can get free Wi-Fi, but these apps require an Internet connection to work, which kind of defeats the purpose ",
