            "answer_text": "There is a paper-clip accessible reset button on the back of the TI-84+. There is also a software reset method that you should try first before you resort to the hard-reset. If you can operate your calculator, press [2nd] [Memory], then you can explore that menu. One thing to try before you do a RESET is to delete programs that you are no longer using. Perhaps your system is too full of junk. You can clear all lists which will get rid of L1 to L6 and any custom lists you created.  Mem Management/Delete lets you delete programs, variables, matrices and more. Group lets you save things into group files. Anyway, if you STILL need to do a reset after doing all that you can with memory management, clear lists, etc., then try the seventh option, RESET, but I am not going to try to explain it because I\u2019m not going to simulate it.
