            "answer_text": "It would appear that you have found the Wikipedia entry unhelpful, perhaps misleading, over-edited in a biased fashion by wikipedian nano-SS and nano-partisan guerrillas ...you are correct to never trust anything printed on electrons, but the Wikipedia entry is not completely bogus ... there are small mistakes, very small ones ... I'd still start there;  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanotechnology  Unless of course, you asked this question to obtain alternative views of what nanotechnology is from the quorasphere ...in that case, nanotechnology is:   A new, very small religion based upon the nanotheological worship of infallibility of science [and the need for unlimited spending by government on bureacratically-administered scientific research] advocated by the high priest of this religion such as Richard Feynman, Ray Kurzweil, Steven Chu ... mantras of this new religion include:  \"There's plenty of room at the bottom!   \"The singularity is near!\"  \"Yes, we can!\"  It's tough to argue against the followers of this religion -- they've watched every Discovery program known to humankind!  Their faith is very real to them.  A research blackhole drawing seemingly infinite amounts of basic research funding and some applied R&D capital from large research organizations in different nations around the world ... corporations are not investing -- corporations don't invest in real R&D, they acquire [although they wont' be able to find nano companies for awhile]... all sides agree that the fruits of this research have been very small.  Russia has been one of the leaders in supporting nanotechnology research; certainly the leader in percentage of GDP ... which sort of tells you something.  It's important to remember that when it comes to copying what other people are doing, the Russians have developed undisputed first mover advantage.  Industrial espionage and copying are a core competency in the administration of Russian research.Something that you can make fun of endlessly ... it the same as making fun of short people -- it's too easy, like shooting fish in a barrel -- small, short fish.  You should make your jokes now, because there are some rumors circulating that jokes about nanotechnology will be outlawed by the Geneva Conventions on Crimes Against Humor ... of course, the response to that is: \"Small chance!\" Something you can't ignore and probably should follow [with a tiny amount of your free time] because, every now and then somebody pulls off something truly spectacular that makes me stop and think, \"Wow!  I dunno, but that might be really important!   Maybe not as big as the George Foreman grill, but maybe pretty important ...\"   For example http://www.rdmag.com/News/2010/09/Energy-Solar-Energy-Solar-Cells-Thinner-Than-Wavelengths-Of-Light-Hold-Huge-Energy-Potential/  Ever time I see things like that, I make another small investment in nanotechnology ... if you squint, you can almost see my acquired earnings right here.

            "answer_text": "Nanotechnology: Where Imagination Meets Reality  \u201cNanotechnology is the idea that we can create devices and machines all the way down to the nanometer scale, which is a billionth of a meter, about half the width of a human DNA molecule\u201d \u2013 Paul McEuen The ship of the science sailed through the imagination to reality. Science empowered every industry structure by improving their work efficiency, products, strength and by reducing cost expenses. The term of Nano-technology had been first coined by Norio Taniguchi in 1974, since then it is utilized to change the application of material. Every industry is now exploring the possibilities with this new technology. Industries like Healthcare, Sports, Automobiles, Electronics, and Environment are particularly witnessed fruitful benefits of nanotech. Reforming Future of Healthcare Various industries are considering different aspects of Nano tech and employing this technology to generate more and more benefits. Medicinal industries are deploying the modern Nano tech fueled machines to provide exceptional health profits, like curing cancer and slowing down the natural aging. With the help of Nano-tech, cell walls penetrate easily and help cancer treatment. Nano bots can localize the disease site and deliver the drug precisely in right part of the body and releases the drug according to the schedule. The conventional treatments for cancer involve radiotherapy or chemotherapy, both the processes are very painful, changing the procedure and employing Nano bots the process becomes less painful for the patient. \u201cNanotechnology in medicine is going to have a major impact on the survival of the human race\u201d. Bernard Marcus Automotive: Not Just a Four Wheel Thing In automotive industries Nano-tech considered as the game changer. Automotive Industry as whole relies on the compatibility and modern technology which can benefit in low fuel consumption, safety, comfort, eco-friendly and budget oriented in material. With the wide scope of this technology Nano tech offers the light weight, reduction in friction and emissions by the engine, reduced corrosion resistance, UV resistance, and advanced electronics and sensors.
