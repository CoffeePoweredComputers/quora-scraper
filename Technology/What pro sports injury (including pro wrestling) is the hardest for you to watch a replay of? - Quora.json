            "answer_text": "I don't wish to celebrate pain for anyone.  But here are a few types of stomach-turning injuries I've seen in sports: 1. A NASCAR wreck or horse racing wreck that results in fatality is the worst.  2. A football hit that paralyzes a player.  I'm not going to include videos of Darryl Stingley (with Jack Tatum hitting him), Marc Buonoconti, or Mike Utley... and more recently, Eric LeGrand of Rutgers. 3.  Hockey injuries.   WARNING: Here's a skate injury to the throat that almost killed Clint Malarchuk (he survived), that involved a sickening amount of blood:   I could include (but won't) many hockey videos of eye injuries, or pucks to the face, just awful stuff. 4. Boxing and MMA knockouts, and hockey fights, where the victim is truly knocked out (not just TKOs).  Again, dozens of videos available. 5) Any sort of speed injury -- downhill skiing, skydiving, motorcyle racing, etc.See Mr. Agony, about fifteen seconds in:   6) Football knee and leg injuries. 7) Baseball injuries like pitches to the head, or line drives off pitchers. 8) Awkward landing injuries in basketball. 9) Gymnastics and cheerleading injuries -- especially vault and parallel bars injuries. 10) Any groin area injury -- ouch.

            "answer_text": "I don\u2019t watch replays of them. The original times were bad enough. I can think of two people who broke their shins playing NFL football. Their shins took on an unnatural bend. One was Joe Theismann. As soon as I typed his name, Google autocompleted \u201cjoe theismann leg\u201d. Theismann was a QB and his career ending-injury happened when he was sacked by Lawrence Taylor on November 18, 1985. The other was Tim Krumrie. When I typed in his name, Google autocompleted \u201ctim krumrie leg injury video\u201d. His injury occurred when he tried to tackle Roger CraIg in Super Bowl XXIII. Krumrie actually played six more years. I didn\u2019t watch either just now. Those sickened me way back when, and I haven\u2019t watched them since. ",
