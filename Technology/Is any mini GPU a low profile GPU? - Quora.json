            "answer_text": "Low profiles have certain height measurements to fit in those narrow, flat small form factor cases. They\u2019re often not as fast, but they have to be small to fit in those tiny cases. A \u201cMini\u201d GPU can vary, cuz there\u2019s a brand out there that actually uses it as a part of the brand. Might be EVGA or GIGABYTE, but i\u2019ve seen some GPU\u2019s labled mini which fit into SFF cases, and some which were actually just shorter but full height and designed to fit in short stout cases like mini ATX cases. So I think the order goes: low profile is for small form factor or SFF PC\u2019s, Mini is for MINI ATX cases, M.2 is for laptops, and everything else is for fullsized ATX cases and such. ",
