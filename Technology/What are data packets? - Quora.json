In addition to a piece of raw data, it also contains a \u201cpayload\u201d; information used to identify the data\u2019s source and destination. This is how information is transmitted on the internet. Information (data) is broken up into small packets and transmitted through a \u201cpacket-switched network\u201d (I.e. The internet). It gets reassembled at the destination with the other associated data packets. What you're reading now was packetized and transmitted to your device and put back together so you can view this webpage or answer. ",
