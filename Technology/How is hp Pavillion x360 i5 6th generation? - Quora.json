            "answer_text": "It's a great laptop for daily light to moderate use, it got a 13' full HD touch display which is one of the best 13' display I had seen. Portability is not a issue here, it's a very light beautiful laptop, and battery life is good (7-8.5h). But unfortunately the list of good thing finishes here, lack of RAM (only 4GB) and Good graphics cases very average gaming laptop, (and personally I am not a fan of 13' screens, I think 14' should be minimum display size for laptops).  Any graphics intense software is lagging for long then got stabilized (I don't know it's windows 10 or the laptop hardware). Yes you can increase the RAM, but a laptop of 55-56k should have at least 8GB RAM out of box, right?   ",
