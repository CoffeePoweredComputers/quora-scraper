            "answer_text": "They\u2019re not, but then neither are anybody else's. Sony is a huge company, twice the sales of Canon but is relatively new to the high end Camera market. When Minolta fell on hard times, Sony bought them out about 13 years ago and build on their technology. They mad some good cameras but not great cameras. However, Sony has been the hand-down leader in mirrorless cameras and as they introduced the (reasonably) affordable full frame a7 line things began to change. With the introduction of the a7 Mark III, Sony has passed Nikon as the number two camera maker. That of course may change but both lag far behind Canon. Now it seems that both Canon and Nikon are catching up to and maybe even caught Sony in mirrorless, that would depend on the camera, and Sony users are complaining that sony is not cutting edge any more. be that as it may, Sony makes a very good product as does Canon and Nikon and Olympus and Pentax. I expect to see the smaller companies falling farther behind, ",
