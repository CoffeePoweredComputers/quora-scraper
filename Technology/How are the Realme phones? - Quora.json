            "answer_text": "Realme chose to take its stand in the market, away from the parent \u2018Oppo\u2019 and has been quite successful in the matter. The smart and budget-friendly smartphones are loved by many and these are the ones competing with many big brands in the market. Let us take an example. What do you imagine to get if you need a smartphone under 8000? Would you get a decent processor? Good storage? Decent camera? And even a good battery? Yes, you can easily obtain all of these in a single pack at a really affordable price when you get Realme C2 as your smartphone. Powered by high-quality MediaTek Helio P22 processor with 8 cores and 2.0GHz speed, the smartphone arrives with the latest Android 9.0 Pie as its OS. It has a 6.1-inch screen and brilliant diamond-cut design with HD+ display. As far as its storage is concerned, it contains 32GB of ROM and the RAM is 3GB. No wonder, whether you multi-task or play games, you always have the edge. The brilliant 13MP + 2MP dual rear camera comes with a flash and allows taking high-quality images & videos. Plus, you get 5MP front camera that guarantees great selfies. And to juice-up all these features, you get a majestic 4000mAh of battery which helps your smartphone stay alive for a long period of time. With all these features within your budget, I think Realme C2 is a great option and you can actually trust Realme phones. ",

I have been using Realme 2 pro for past 9 months.I have the 4+64 GB variant and my experience so far has been above satisfactory.  The phone has never \u201changed\u201d(or maybe once).I didn't have much trouble adopting to ColorOS.Infact I like some of the features it brings on the table,like all those gestures and smart sidebars etc.The battery performance is pretty good, though it has started to deteriorate a little now. I never had to contact Realme customer care for any trouble,so I can't tell anything about that. Overall I am having a good experience with a Realme phone. ",
