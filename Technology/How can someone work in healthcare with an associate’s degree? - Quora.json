            "answer_text": "I\u2019m not really sure about the reason for your question. As Ms. Voss stated, there are many careers you can pursue in the medical field with little or no additional education after High School. If you want something more than your AA, but you\u2019re not looking to get your RN, BSN, I would suggest a vocational school. You can receive schooling in Medical Billing and other front office services, Phlebotomy and other training needed to be an MA. You\u2019ll have a better place in line for a job than others who have no additional training. ",

I know that the carers that work with my dad had to either finish a 8 month course to become a CNA or have experience which was usually 1 year of caring for an elderly family member. Many of the lab jobs have on the job training. Many things like phlebotomist have certification training. ",
