            "answer_text": "What do you mean by worst? Telstra before competition was introduced was bound by its charter to a Universal Service Obligation. That is, to provide an affordable telephone service that met a minimum standard to everyone in Australia. Granted, if you live in suburban Sydney then the charge for installing a telephone line to your house would cost a lot less than if you live 300 km north of whoop-whoop. But if you have a problem with your telephone, the callout fee for a technician would be the same: nothing. You pay rental on your phone and your line, they maintain it without charging extra for repairs. Telstra after competition was introduced was bound by, guess what? Yep, the same USO. But if you\u2019re a competitor coming into the market do you go after the high-density population areas or the low? So Telstra lost some market share, and not across the board but in the populated, thus profitable, areas. But if you move to somewhere 300 km north of whoop-whoop, can you still get a telephone installed? Of course you can. Who you gonna call\u2026? Same for the mobile networks. There is no other telco, and by this I mean specifically telco that provides its own infrastructure and not a reseller, that offers better mobile coverage than Telstra. There is not even another telco that comes close. Have Vodafone? Sorry, you can\u2019t use your mobile outside major population areas. Have Optus? Better, but still not even close. Drive in a straight line for a few hundred kilometres with an Optus mobile service and you will get something like: service \u2026 no service \u2026 no service \u2026 no service \u2026 service \u2026 no service \u2026 no service \u2026 service\u2026 or with Telstra: service \u2026 service \u2026 service \u2026 no service \u2026 service \u2026 service \u2026 no service \u2026 service \u2026 service \u2026 Telstra\u2019s service in Telstra shops, from customer service representatives and service centres / call centres can vary widely depending on who you get, but for coverage and network technology they can\u2019t be beaten.

            "answer_text": "No. It\u2019s not always the cheapest but over all it\u2019s the best. Its mobile service has the best coverage, it has far fewer black spots than its nearest competitor. Its customer service isn\u2019t crippled by its competitor\u2019s mantra of saying \u201cYes\u201d even when it can\u2019t do what you want - some years ago when I was on Optus for my home internet I couldn\u2019t connect for days, the best that the Optus rep could come up with was \u201csorry but you\u2019re too far away from the exchange to have service in peak times\u201d. I live less than 4km from the Sydney CBD - basically, they were just lying because they couldn\u2019t solve the problem. Vodafone had huge problems a couple of years ago when its customer base was accidentally released publicly. To my knowledge this has never happened with either Telstra or Optus. I wouldn\u2019t become a Vodafone customer at any price. ",
