            "answer_text": "Hall effect sensors detect magnetic fields. They are versatile, and can be used in many automotive applications, as there are digital versions and analog versions of the hall sensor. Analog versions can be used to sense current flow in a wire without touching the wire like conventional means (cutting the wire and inserting a shunt resistor). thus in an automotive application current measuring would be simpler and less intrusive. Analog hall sensors can detect distance to a magnet, or even implement a compass for navigation. Digital hall sensors are either fully on or fully off, thus are suited for crankshaft position sensing. See Tech Feature: Understanding the Differences, Challenges Between Crankshaft Position Sensors Or, they can be used in ABS braking systems, where the rotation of the wheel needs to be known, Hall effect ABS sensor measurement They even have an absolute hall encoder, which I haven\u2019t see yet on automobiles, that can very accurately (tenths of a degree) determine the position of a shaft (could be a knob, too), see http://www.mouser.com/ds/2/734/MLX90316-Datasheet-Melexis-953286.pdf There are magnetic reluctance sensors that also work as magnetic field sensors, which produce a sine wave output which can be decoded and perform in most ways act like the hall shaft position sensors, though at very low speeds this sensor doesn\u2019t produce much signal, see Variable reluctance sensor - Wikipedia ",

            "answer_text": "This question is so unspecific, I can\u2019t really figure out what kind of answer you\u2019re hoping to get. In the automotive industry we use all kind of sensors. From magnetic field sensors for example to measure wheel speed or crankshaft speed, temperature en pressure sensors in various applications, radar and other visual sensors for self-driving applications, accleration sensors for example for your airbags, etc. If you need more specific answers, please rephrase your question..
