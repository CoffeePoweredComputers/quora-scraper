            "answer_text": "clip on lens for cameras in phones are only effective in emptying your wallet, the fact is the cameras themselves are tiny and although they may offer reasonable resolution in terms of pixels, they are really for the most part fairly poor when compared to a good quality dslr, what is called the image engine on say a Nikon or Canon is many times better than phone cameras, thats why the dslr costs several times the price of any smart phone, smart phones take great snaps and fair quality photos but you only get what you pay for, and those clip on lens`` are cheap and poor quality in nearly every case they will quickly be in the rubbish ",

            "answer_text": "My answer to that is, look at the finely machined bayonet mounts used for interchangeable lens cameras from Leicas of the 1950's and SLRs of the 60-90's and DSLRs ever since to know how precision optics are mounted and aligned. The rest of the typical camera lens has equal attention to precision. I don't think those little toy lenses can compete. The smartphone cameras were just not designed to attach precision accessories and maintain such precision. ",
