            "answer_text": "The docking port was probably strategically engineered to be located at or very near to the mean gravitational center of the mass of the Endurance. If you designed all spacecraft with the same principle in mind, all that would be required for docking would be a matching angular momentum, which would be centered around both ports, which would hold true no matter the rate of rotation, it just wouldn't be comfortable for people at higher RPM. For a rotating space station, or vehicle that simulated gravity by centrifugal force, it would seem very advantageous to design the docking ports this way. I believe that may be the premise the climax of the movie was dependent on. ",

            "answer_text": "According to the video clip you provided, the ports on both station and ship are at the center of gravity, and therefore theit axis of rotoation, so it was a simple matter of matching rotational velocities. While the station is damaged and its mass therefore was somewhat redistributed, the video clip shows the \u2018wobbling\u2019 effect was minimal enough not to make docking impossible. I guess they were lucky with that\u2026 ",
