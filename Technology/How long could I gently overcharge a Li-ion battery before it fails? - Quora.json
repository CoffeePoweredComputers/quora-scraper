            "answer_text": "With most consumer devices that have Li-Ion batteries there is a protection circuit built in that will limit the charge so as to not overcharge or completely drain the battery. When they shut down because of low power the battery actually has some more juice in it but it can't be accessed. A Li-Ion battery if drain to its absolute = state will ruin the battery. Also if it chargers past its given safety state it can explode, catch fire, or vent violently that can cause personal injury and destruction of property. I don't know how you are \u201cgently overcharging\u201d your battery unless it is an unregulated battery that is not designed for your device. ",

            "answer_text": "It doesn\u2019t matter how gently you overcharge it. Heat from overcharging is not the only reason Li-Ion cells can catastrophically fail if overcharged. Overcharging the battery can grow metal whiskers inside the cell that create a short circuit in a tiny spot. The cell, being fully charged, contains a lot of energy. And that tiny short is all it takes to act like a fuse that sets of a chain reaction that lets all that energy out at once. Just like the fuse on a firecracker\u2026 ",
