I call it the Idea Generator, but it is actually more of a challenge generator, because a full-blown \u201cidea\u201d would require functional detail to be spelled out, which this concept doesn\u2019t do (\u2026 yet. Give it a few years and some A.I. plug-ins, and I might have that part ready, too). So what does it do? It tells you your options. As a lecturer in industrial design, I always come upon the same problem with my students at the start of the semester, where everyone is allowed to pick their own project: \u201cOh gosh, what shall I undertake?\u201d Anything goes. And before you know it, all the guys are doing a skateboard, and all the gals are doing a lamp. It seems to be some sort of law of nature. Hair raising. So I decided to make my students use my generator to help them see how many amazing things they could be doing. It\u2019s very well-liked, and I am happy to share it here. As to how it works: I believe that any solution consists of certain key aspects, which can be predetermined. So we make a list for each key aspect. And then we simply connect at random to see what options we can consider. Some will be hilarious, some will be complete nonsense - but we\u2019ll tickle out the options we have to the extreme, and without impediment of the mind, because we are forcing things together that normally have nothing at all to do with each other. It is therefore a sort of \u201cforced creativity exercise.\u201d It can look like this:  ",

Its simplicity, cheapness ($12), effectiveness, will help people: To be and feel cleaner.Unable to use t. paper.To face t. paper shortage.Reduce high HAI rates in hospitals.*\u201cFECAL DUST: It comes from fecal residue, left AFTER wiping with t. paper (complete or, worse of course, incomplete) . Through drying and friction it turns out to dust and through air is going to all surfaces, at first stage the uro-genital organs, causing UTI, and later to all house, causing food contamination. That phenomenon is more intense in hospitals, as the patients are usually debilitated, weak, with mobility restriction etc, particularly if there are hemorrhoids or anus hair and are unable to wipe properly. So the flying fecal dust reaches to all ward surfaces, dispersing its pathogenic microbes and so being the cause, among others, of the known fatal HA INFECTIONS. The flying fecal dust emerges mainly from cloths of patients that can MOVE around, not the ones that are on pampers. Have in mind that in a more than 2 beds hospital wards, moisture and temperature conditions harbor microbes and also microbe density, due to constant feeding from feces residue on patients, is a one more factor that increases microbe chances in developing antibiotic resistance. It is obvious that the known hygiene measures, as is hand washing etc, are not enough, as now a new microbe source, up to now ignored, is added. Up to now NOT A SINGLE scientific study have ever doubted fecal dust\u2019s existence and its role on microbe dispersion, but however no hygiene measures are imposed or advice is given by Health Institutes, particularly to women to prevent UTI, or any guiding to hospital hygiene managers to reduce HAI and the growing danger of microbe resistant to antibiotics. Why a comparison test is not made between a hospital, where all the special measures to prevent human fecal dust forming are taken and those, where no special care is taken, as the usual practice is, regarding the HA infection rates, so a safe scientific decision to be made about fecal dust\u2019s role on causing HA infection? On the case this test is not done promptly, everyone is entitled to think, that there are very strong reasons that other interests, than public health protection, are guiding science research.\u201d ",
