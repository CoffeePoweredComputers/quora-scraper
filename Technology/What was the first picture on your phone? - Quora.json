Around this time, I'd gotten my new phone and was obsessed with taking pictures (obsessed is a bit of an exaggeration). I had 3 cats at this time (it's 5 now). The one pictured has many names. NovaSphinxNinaBig babyI wanted to test my camera and the kitty was just sitting there, having just woken up from her nap and I took a picture. For a bonus, here's a companion:  The then-middle child of the cat family. Also goes by many names BobPhoenixBobby babyShe's a very shy cat. Doesn't like to be touched or anything. She's also very submissive when it comes to food and lets the other cats take her food. For those curious about my 5 cats, here they are in order from oldest to youngest:  Crystal  Bob  Nova  Quill  Kara Yes. I just used this as an excuse to share photos of my cats. Here are\u200b my dogs as well. I promise this will be the end \u200bof the answer.  The bottom one is Ace and the top one is Arrow! ",
