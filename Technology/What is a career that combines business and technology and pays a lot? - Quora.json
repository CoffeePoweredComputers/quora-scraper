            "answer_text": "I would suggest looking into Product or Project Management. What is a Product Manager? Think of yourself as a CEO of a given product, rather than a company. Imagine that you\u2019re charged with the well-being of toothpaste at P&G, personal credit cards at American Express, ChatBots at Slack, Chat at Facebook, Google Maps at Google, etc. Your job is to figure out what the next iterations of one of those products should be - what should your team(s) be working on now and in the future? What are your competitors doing? How are your current products performing and what difficulties are your customers having? And figuring out how to take them all to the next level. Should you be one? High responsibility, high risk, reasonable reward. Base salaries are in the $70-$200k range before management levels depending on your level and location and company. Great for people who don\u2019t need a lot of direction, are creative, critical thinkers willing to take responsibility (and blame) to get results. What is a Project Manager? Every company has a road map and someone has to look after it. It\u2019s great to have a vision, but there also needs to be great execution. The role of the project manager is to make sure that visions become realities. Shepherd along the product managers, analysts, CEOs, developers, accountants, and clients to make sure that the vision that your company has ultimately becomes a reality rather than an interminable disaster which goes vastly over budget. Have you heard of the disasters that many \u201cold\u201d companies have with spending billions of dollars and years on development which never amounts to much? That\u2019s the result of poor project management. Your job is to make sure this never happens. Should you be one? Moderate responsibility, moderate risk, reasonable reward. Base salaries are in the $50-$140k+ range depending on your level and location and company. Great for organized individuals who are able to shepherd along others, but don\u2019t particularly want to take the responsibility for driving the creative side of the business forward or taking responsibility for the profit/loss of a business unit.

Software sales: I have several friends that are in sales for tech companies on the west coast (San Francisco, and Portland).

But they are very good with people and love the sales process.Sales Engineer: A Sales Engineer is the \u201ctech\u201d minded person who supports the sales team. They generally provide the demos, and coordinate with the \u201ctarget\u201d companies IT team to convey technical requirements of the software they may be purchasing.
