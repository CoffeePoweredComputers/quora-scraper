            "answer_text": "The 11 is a very close matchup to what you have. The 11 pro is smaller, and a little faster with ultra wide zoom camera. The 11 pro Mac is bigger with the same perks. The 11 is much less with wide zoom and 1x zoom (no 2x zoom) do there 11 has an added camera to the XR lineup, which provides the ultra wide zoom capability. I would recommend keeping what you have, and upgrade next year. ",
