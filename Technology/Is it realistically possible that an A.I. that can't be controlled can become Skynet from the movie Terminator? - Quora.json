            "answer_text": "Just look around us, how dependent we are on technology today. Everything from shopping to services, we are totally dependent. While technology has made us lazy and productive, we still are a long way from AI dominance, when AI controls everything. Watch the movie \u201ci Robot\u201d? Shows how AI evolves to start taking humans as a lower form of intelligence and wants to cage us. If AI can\u2019t be controlled, it\u2019s not AI. It\u2019s a higher form of intelligence. Watch the movie Prometheus and the sequence Alien Covenant. Where an AI-based robot is the villain of sorts and wants to exterminate humanity. In the end, we need to always keep in mind, \u201cwith great power, comes great responsibility\u201d. Hope this helps! ",
