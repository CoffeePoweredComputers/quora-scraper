            "answer_text": "Session work is simple, a musician is hired to play at a recording session. Sometimes this work is for a flat fee, sometimes with performance royalties in addition to a fee. Musicians who undertake session work are required to do a job, to sing a song, play guitar, bass, drums etc in a way that suits the song without getting in the way of the star, often without rehearsal and often sight reading from sheet music. The session player may never even see the artist on who\u2019s music they\u2019re performing\u2026 how many bricklayers meet the person who buys the house? It\u2019s not work for anyone who wants to be a star, few make it out of that role, and can be a grind as you\u2019re more often than not required to suppress your own creativity and just play the part as written. It is, however, great work for anyone who want\u2019s to make a living from music, so long as they are really good players and don\u2019t mind the grind and practice on the way to getting there, the long hours, the lack of adulation\u2026 Over the years there have been session players, and studio bands who have made it big. Pretty much everyone in Toto were session guys, you hear Steve Lukather\u2019s guitar all over MJ\u2019s Thriller album. The Swampers were the Muscle Shoals house band, immortalised lyrically in Sweet Home Alabama. Booker T and the MGs were the house band of STAX records and performed on all kinds of soul and blues tunes in addition to their own releases. Jimmy Page played guitar on Tom Jones\u2019 It\u2019s Not Unusual before joining the Yardbirds and later forming Zeppelin. These are just the exception, not the rule. It makes me want to ask some questions though. Why did you take your daughter to a studio? Had she sung or played before \u2018the guy\u2019 asked? How old is she? Does she want to be a star? Objectively, is she any good? ",

They are usually exceptionally flexible in styles and sounds, and if they play an instrument they usually have am arsenal of weapons to pull out at anytime. They are renowned for being disciplined as they aren't just musos they are businrssmsn who keep their own diaries and must be on time. Word of mouth business is critical for them so they are often heard and not seen ! ",
