            "answer_text": "There are not too many DVD players made anymore - most are Blu-ray/DVD players - which play Blu-ray Discs, DVDs, and CDs. As far as what to look for - the features are all pretty standard, but here are some tips: Buy a recognizable brand name - Sony, LG, Panasonic are good choices. Most DVD players and all Blu-ray Disc players have HDMI outputs - that is important if you are connecting to an HD or 4K UHD TV. If you going to be using the player with a surround sound system, in addition to HDMI, check to see if the player has a digital optical audio output in case you need to use that option for audio. If you are a video streaming fan - most Blu-ray Disc players have access to streaming apps and built-in WiFi (DVD-only players do not have these features). Make sure the remote control and the on-screen menu system is easy for you to use. ",
