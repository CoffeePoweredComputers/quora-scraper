            "answer_text": "First, let\u2019s see, what is a software technology, It\u2019s the use of a set of instructions, data or programs programmed to run the equipment i.e, Computer to perform a targeted function, or it is nothing but systems that run on information (provided by the system-Software code) by making use of Technology (Hardware). We are currently in the era of high dependence on information systems to ease our daily operations, and This comes with its own set of pros and cons. There is a rapid change in technology, this fast change is unnoticeable for some. Based on the stats, a total of 3.8 Billion people around the world are using the internet in 2020, and more than 8 Billion systems are connected to the internet. India alone has over 560 million internet users, making it 2nd largest online market. This dependence has advantages and disadvantages of software technology which is discussed below. Pros of Software technology, Increases ProductionAdoption of software helps to streamline operations in a company, leveraging them to focus on core company goals. First, technical advances will raise productivity in all production factors. Secondly, IT increases productivity among the labourers, reducing the risk company being stationary with their creativity. Increase in production aids the overall growth of the industry. IT Streamlines CommunicationCommunication is a fundamental requirement for a company. It is seen to advance the technology footprint in a company, and enable communication satisfaction and organizational learning. Once the importance is known, the communication channel is streamlined to provide good exposure towards the development of company technological needs. Improving the overall communication of the company aids in better management. IT Stores and Safeguards Valuable InformationData storage is very vital for any company. Either it\u2019s the personal information of the employees, or the company trade secret, it needs to be stored well so that adversaries do not take advantage or cause harm. Using a software-based storage method provides companies with more room to produce, manage and retrieve data when required, allowing companies to achieve Authentication, Authorization and Accounting with the data. Better AccountingThe biggest impact software technology has on accounting is the capability of companies to enable them to record, store, and manage financial transactions, transfers. Accounting software provides a good platform to retrieve data on time, and provide reports to the management, the management take better decisions. Other things like accuracy, security, data sharing methods are also achieved. Auditing is one of the key requirements for companies\u2019 financial management. By manual process, the auditing is time consuming and there is a chance for errors.. By using software technology, auditing becomes more liquidated as well as error-free. Facilitates better educationSoftware management requires skilled professionals, this leads users to learn and train people for effective use of the technology. Software is helpful and easy to use, if the correct usage method and best practices is known or working and troubleshooting becomes difficult. Cons of software technologies Internet Security Issuesprimarily software technologies were not developed with security in mind. Security and security features evolved as the risk of data loss was showcased. Security is of big concern, and several security features and tools have been developed to stop the attack. Still security hackers use new methodologies to cause data loss, making security the main concern before considering software technologies. Over-Dependence on Information TechnologyThis topic warrants a big debate. While some are of the opinion that creativity is lost with the use of new software technology, several software and technological developments have shown that creativity can also be achieved with the help of creative minds in developing creative software. Job lossesYes, automation causes job losses, but the advantages of software technologies are higher. With the ease of doing work, it reduces job strain. But still, requirements for using, developing and managing that software technology will be on the rise. Conclusion Software technologies can help productions cut cost and time, advance communication, shape recognition and bring more innovative and advanced products. These are the advantages and disadvantages of software technology. ",

            "answer_text": "Johann Wolfgang von Goethe once said: \u201cDream no small dreams, for they have no power to move the hearts of men.\u201d But for a glorious while, there was an exception. In the 1980s, PCs were so limited that their commerically viable applications could be developed by a handful of people, even one person. The first version of Adobe Illustrator, for example, is well within the grasp of a student working over the summer. I knew a colleague who, like Dan Bricklin, wrote his own spreadsheet app (and speaking of which, Mitch Kapor wrote the first version of Lotus 1\u20132\u20133 in assembler). There were also word processors that had single authors, even operating systems like CP/M and 86-DOS. Gates wrote his BASIC interpreter almost by himself too (his partner Paul Allen did the floating-point features). Examining the \u201cAbout\u201d dialogs of most apps would usually reveal a handful of names instead of a long list. So the dreams were small. Not that anyone planned it that way; they simply had no choice. But the barrier to entry was low \u2014 a single individual could, in less than a year or two, create something of enormous value. There was not only wealth but glory; it was a time when programmers\u2019 names were well known. These days, computers are stupefyingly spacious and powerful. Accordingly, the barrier has risen \u2014 the smallest commercially viable app or website today will almost certainly be something requiring a team of people. One can still write small programs and get paid, but these tend to be custom solutions for individual clients instead of widely useful mainstream apps. In the 1990s John Carmack could develop a mainstream game engine by himself; today, Unreal Engine, Unity and the like consume the efforts of hundreds of people. Even if one has all the source code, no one person understands all of it; it\u2019s simply too complex. So these days, one has to dream big. Software is great, but if you don\u2019t have a plan to enlist the aid of many people, you\u2019re not going to crack the barrier to entry. With powerful computers come huge expectations, and modern software is concordantly large and bloated, nothing is small and elegant anymore. If you become a developer, it\u2019s almost certain you won\u2019t be creating anything new but instead will help others adjust and extend existing code. ",
