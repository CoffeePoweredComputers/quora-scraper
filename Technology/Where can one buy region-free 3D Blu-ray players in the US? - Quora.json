            "answer_text": "I found the website http://220-electronics.com to be perfect when I was looking for a Region Free 3D Blu-Ray Player back in 2017. I imported one of their players and have been using it for more than a year. Region Free players usually are standard players which are modified to fit the bill, and need a click on the remote (or keying in of a certain sequence from the remote) to switch between the 3 regions. I myself have not come across a player which is region free by default but these modified players are a decent bet if you are looking for a quick fix. ",
