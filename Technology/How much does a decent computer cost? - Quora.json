            "answer_text": "As Vic Ba said; But if you want a rough guideline though, I consider that a small simple laptop or station in the 300's is good enough for basic stuff, office internet browsing and music listening. At least double that for a computer that is capable of higher quality video reproduction from DVD's or the internet. At least double that again for the first reasonable gamer computer, and double that again for the start of proffessional video and graphic use. So, 3, 6, 12, 24.  Those are the starting ratio's in the shop where I sub contract as an IT repair guy.  Our price ranges for a  gamer computer start at 1200\u20ac for entry models, and then all the way up to 5000\u20ac and above. People who buy from us to do video work and graphic design spend more than the gamers. I would always buy something that can be evolved, (station) rather than one that is totally obsolete in four years. Laptops are harder, as they are not easy to evolve, unless you buy into the uber rich versions. If you buy the cheapest \"decent\" you will be dissapointed as you improve your skills. If you buy way too expensive, then you will find that you become frustrated to have a ferrari and not be able to drive it properly. Most people who come into the shop, are buying a computer that is roughly half a months' pay.  I hope this helps. Be aware of buying \"bells and whistles\"  It might look marvelous, but is it really under the plastic?  And try and buy one that stays cool instead of melting the surface it is sitting on, they never really last long. ",

            "answer_text": "Let\u2019s look at two desktop computers I\u2019ve bought this year. Both are very usable for normal activities people do such as web browsing, word processing, spreadsheets.. Raspberry Pi 4 4 GB, $55 at pishop.us. 15W power brick $8. Sandisk 16 GB ultra memory card $5.99. Total $69.custom PC, I chose the parts, paid someone else to assemble and test it. AMD ThreadRipper 2990wx, Gigabyte x399 AORUS TR4 motherboard, 128 GB DDR4\u20132400 RAM, 1 TB Samsaung 970 Pro M.2 SSD, 3 TB hard disk, GeForce 1050 Ti 4 GB video card, Corsair Hydro H100\u2013110 cooler, Thermaltake 850W gold poewr supply, Cooler Master Mastercase 5 ATX mid tower case, network card etc: $4795.84Both systems share keyboard, mouse, monitor and WIFI/ethernet internet as needed so I haven\u2019t counted that against either of them. You can get a decent Microsoft wireless kb&mouse combo for $30 or AmazonBasics USB wired Kb&mouse combo for $15. Monitor is up to you \u2026 I\u2019m using a $399 Samsung 32\u2033 4k monitor, but you can get a 19\u2033 to 22\u2033 1920x1080 LED monitor for around $65. So you could do a pretty nice system for $150 all up. p.s. the ThreadRipper system cost 32 times more than the Raspberry Pi 4 system (adding $15 kb&mouse and $65 monitor to both). It\u2019s around 3.5 times faster single-core and has eight times more cores, so actually is something around 30 times faster on some tasks. One software build I do frequently takes 6 minutes on the ThreadRipper and three hours on the Pi\u2026 ",
