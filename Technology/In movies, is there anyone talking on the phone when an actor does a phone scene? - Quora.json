            "answer_text": "It really depends. Many times, if it\u2019s a short phone call, then no. I mean, they\u2019re actors, they should be able to act a phone call. However, some directors and actors love having someone on the other end to play off of. If they\u2019re not on the phone, then they\u2019re off camera giving the actor the \u201cvoice\u201d from the other end of the line. Then there\u2019s the random film I got to work on called \u201cColumbus Day\u201d with Val Kilmer, Marg Helgenberger, Wilmer Valderrama and others. Because so much of the film takes place over phone calls, the director definitely wanted working phones and voices on the other end for the actors to play off of. I had known the Casting Director for a while and he called and asked if I\u2019d be interested. Good pay, working with a new director and some good names, and I don\u2019t have to memorize anything? Sure! It was a blast because they did have working phones, and I got to portray a number of characters on the other end of the line (including my take on Val and Wilmer). It was a unique situation, to be sure, but to answer your question: Sometimes they do. And even if it doesn\u2019t include screen-time, it can still be pretty fun! ",

            "answer_text": "Some years ago, I was a guest at Armageddon Con in New Zealand. One of the other guests was the voice actor Roger L. Jackson. Roger was amazing, and I had the pleasure of doing a panel with him. He is, perhaps, best known for voicing Ghostface in the \u201cScream\u201d horror franchise. Roger told me (and a room full of excited fans) that he had originally been cast as a placeholder voice, as the director really wanted the actors to be talking to an actual person when they were supposed to be on the phone with the homicidal maniac. As it turned out, Roger creeped out the lead actresses so much, he went on to be used as the actual voice of Ghostface. If you\u2019ve ever heard him, you\u2019ll understand why. So that\u2019s at least one example of a movie wherein an actor actually was on the phone during the story\u2019s phone calls. ",
