            "answer_text": "By \u201ckeyboard\u201d, I assume you mean the computer keyboard. In which case, the history of the invention of the device largely consists of the invention of the teleprinter and the keypuncher, whose histories consist of the creation of the grand-daddy of all input devices: the typewriter. The modern typewriter we know and love was introduced to the world in the form of the \u201cSholes and Glidden Typewriter\u201d, which was invented by Christopher Sholes, Frank Hall, Carlos Glidden, and Samuel Soule, in 1868. Improving on the \u201cHansen Writing Ball\u201d which was invented by Rev. Rasmus Malling-Hansen, it had a QWERTY layout, and it was this major breakthrough that slowly led to other typewriter manufactures adopting the layout for their typewriters. The modern teleprinter was invented by Charles Krum in the 1900s, and it was popularly used to type and transmit stock market data through telegraph lines to stock ticker machines. The first successful keypunch, on the other hand, was invented by Herman Hollerith in the 1890s. It used to, well, punch cards; and those punched cards were used to accomplish endless tasks, including programming computers. Hollerith then went on to develop the \u201cKeyboard Punch\u201d, which was much easier to use than his original creation. When it comes to keypunch innovation, it could be said that Hollerith did much of the work. The teleprinter, keypunch, and typewriter, slowly evolved into \u201ccomputer terminals\u201d, which could both facilitate the input of data by the user and the showing of output by the computer to the user. The \u201ckeyboard\u201d part of the terminals then probably got separated from the video-based output screens, and evolved into what I just used to type this answer. Even though I did simplify things to a great extent to fit the answer into four paragraphs, it\u2019s always great to use that amazing keyboard of yours to explore the Internet, and find out more. Fun ride, wasn\u2019t it? Further reading: Typewriter Teleprinter Keypunch Computer keyboard ",

            "answer_text": "Michael Wright mentions Dieterich Buxtehude, who is an important figure to be sure, but I would give that honor to the Renaissance greats who come before the great Baroque composers. One obvious candidate is Girolamo Frescobaldi, but his works rely on just temperament to such an extent that pianists rarely if ever try to perform them on the equal-temperament keyboard for which Bach\u2019s Well-Tempered Clavier is so obvious a touchstone.  After Frescobaldi, and among such truly brilliant candidates as Jakob Froberger, John Bull, Orlando Gibbons, William Mundy, and a host of others whose names many people don't know, I\u2019d single out the same figure Glenn Gould did: William Byrd. Have a listen to \u201cThe Carman\u2019s Whistle,\u201d \u201cSellinger\u2019s Round,\u201d \u201cThe Bells\u201d (a masterpiece of mimetic composition \u2014 it chimes relentlessly), \u201cQui passe for my Lady Nevell,\u201d \u201cAll in a Garden Greene,\u201d to name just a few, or his many brilliant pavanes and galliards (his keyboard transcription of Dowland\u2019s \u201cLachrymae Pavane\u201d is astonishing). Here's Gould playing \u201cSellinger\u2019s Round\u201d:  Here's Alan Feinberg, on his wondrous Steinway & Sons album Basically Bull, playing \u201cQui Passe\u201d:  Beyond Byrd we have to consider figures like Jan Pieterszoon Sweelinck and Henry Purcell, too, before we come to the Baroque period, and Buxtehude. Early modern music is often overlooked, but it can be virtuosic, melodious, ingenious, compelling stuff. The harpsichordist Pieter-Jan Belder has been recording the Fitzwilliam Virginal Book for Brilliant Classics \u2014 it is a stunning parade of keyboard treasures. Enjoy \u2014 and if you don't know Buxtehude, you\u2019ll want to make his acquaintance as well. There are quite a few titans who precede the \u201cclass of 1685\u201d (J. S. Bach, Domenico Scarlatti, Handel, and Telemann). ",
