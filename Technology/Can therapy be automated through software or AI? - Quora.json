            "answer_text": "Therapy may not be the right word for it, but A.I. could definitely be programmed to provide information to people that would provide the knowledge to become healthier happier, more productive etc. For example what to eat, how to forecast savings, and the benefit of improving credit score, where to go for the best deals, (lower prices) what to wear (dress for success) how to budget money, and many more important aspects of successful living. We can look them up on line, but having a bot suggest things, based on people\u2019s lifestyle choices, and other information that is already available on people (more than we are aware of our own selves most likely) - it would help to make suggestions, and to inform us of the benefits, and possibly make therapy unnecessary, and as well improve our physical and mental health.
