            "answer_text": "Geology is the study of the Earth. This includes everything from the origin of the earth to the various speculations in the future. It covers a wide range of subjects and theories. Engineering geology is an applied discipline of geological studies. It aims at applying the knowledge of geology to smoothly conduct and to sustain civil engineering structures. Engineering geologists are not civil engineers. They don\u2019t design buildings, bridges or dams but they study the geology of the area (rock type, soil type, slopes, foundation problems and solutions, hazard management and so on). So, here you go: Geologists study the rocks, soils, geomorphic features, faults and folds. Engineering geologists study all these topics from the perspective of engineering constructions. ",
