            "answer_text": "The market has gained alot since the first crash in 2020 and is now hitting new highs but many analysts are predicting a huge crash in late 2020 or 2021. The crash will be for following reasons. A second wave of illness Regardless of where you stand, the current lack of vaccine means there\u2019s is at least a chance of countries being hit with a second wave of illness. Health officials and organizations around the world are warning of an impending \"second wave,\" i.e. a repeated increase in the numbers of new instances of infection. 2. Stimulus packages are temporary In the US and India . and many other countries, governments have provided stimulus packages for businesses and additional unemployment benefits for individuals. This cash injection might be partly responsible for the slight recovery of the stock market that we\u2019ve seen in recent weeks. However, this was a temporary boost \u2013 once this money runs out, businesses and individuals will struggle again to pay mortgages, rent and will limit their spending, possibly leading to another rapid drop in stocks. 3. Irreversible damage to small businesses Despite government help, many small businesses are struggling to keep afloat \u2013 and many others have already been forced to cut down on staffing or close down entirely. A continued decrease in small business activity will cause unemployment levels to remain elevated, negatively impacting the economy. 4. Unemployment will continue for longer than the crisis itself Even once the threat has passed, we can\u2019t realistically expect everything to go back to the way it was before this hit. Even in an optimistic scenario, it will take months for businesses to return to full capacity \u2013 and for new companies to take the place of those that didn't survive. Unemployment is at a record high in the U.S. and many other countries, and this will continue to put a strain on the economy.8. Looming recession In terms of how this crisis has affected the global economy, most people agree that things will have to get worse before they can start to get better. Experts are expecting the U.S. to have to face a post-crash recession, with little hope of the Federal Reserve bailing Wall Street out this time. 5 Continued fear and uncertainty It\u2019s important to keep in mind that often-overlooked influences like panic and fear can fuel an economic downturn as effectively as any other factors. With the public health emergency still a largely unknown entity to healthcare professionals and the public alike, it\u2019s difficult to make informed decisions about anything \u2013 including investing. Uncertainty leads to erratic decisions and inaction, which can cause economic damage and stagnation, respectively. This is a great video I have found where they have deeply explained it in a very lucent manner . A must watch video if you really need the answer  ",

            "answer_text": "I wish that Quora and the internet had existed since 1900. They would have found people predicting crashes in: 19001901190219031904190519061907All the way to 2019!There have always been people predicting doom and gloom, and always will be. All the while, the markets have increased from 66 in 1900, to 2,000 30 years ago, to 28,000 today. Markets do crash. They always have. They always will. That doesn\u2019t mean we can predict when they can happen or market time. That also doesn\u2019t mean markets don\u2019t come back. Look at December and January. Markets fell by 20%-25% in one month. They recovered 2\u20133 years later and are at record highs now. How about 2008\u20132009. Fell by 50%. Took 3 years to recover. Or 1999. The Nasdaq fell 76% from top to bottom! S&P500 about 50%. And yet, the Nasdaq has returned 13% per year in the last 25 years, despite two huge crashes. So there is no need to fear market falls. You are just buying at cheaper prices. So remember that Nobody knows. Not you, me or anybody else here. All the information is publicly available. There are too many unknown unknowns and known unknowns to predict these things\u201cExperts\u201d in the financial media exist to make palm readers look good ass Buffett saidThere is also little or no correlation between:Stock market performance and geopolitical riskStock market performance and social movementsStock Market performance and PresidentsStock Market performance and interest ratesStock Market performance and GDP growthStock Market performance and p/e ratios of marketsStock markets have gone up, and down, during: WarsVarious geopolitical crisisVarious PresidentsVarious GDP scenariosHowever, they have also gone down, and crashed, under the same scenarios! Look at recent years. Markets have increased during geopolitical crisis like North Korea and China. They have also gone down during those periods. Markets had their best month in January, after an awful December, despite the government shut down. Researcher have found that there is a correlation between markets and various P/E ratios, HOWEVER it isn\u2019t an incredible strong one. Meaning, it isn\u2019t simple to just say `P/E ratios are this amount, so we should invest in those markets`. Again, look around the world, in recent years. The US Markets, on paper, look more overvalued than UK, European and some emerging markets. Not as overvalued as 1999, or even close to those P/E levels as shown below;  A few years ago, many people, sensing Trump\u2019s victory, put more money in the UK and other markets. They justified that with sentences like `the UK FTSE has a yield of 4.5%, about double the Dow`\u2026..and `the FTSE P/E ratios looks more undervalued`. However, the US Markets have continued to outperform European ones. I am sure that will change, and European markets will outperform like they did in 2000\u20132008, one day. The reason I am giving this example, is to show that you can\u2019t `market pick` based on p/e ratios. Let\u2019s put this another way. How many people do I know, who have successfully `market picked` over a 1 year period? Many. I know many people who have beaten say the Dow, or MSCI World, by picking ETFs in certain markets. 10 years? I don\u2019t know anybody. Market timing has an even worse record. Jack Bogle, who had 50\u201370 years experience, said a few years ago,`I have never met somebody who has successfully beaten the market by timing over the long-term`. So even if markets crash next year, you won\u2019t beat the market by keeping money in cash, waiting for that crash, to mysteriously get in at exactly the right time! Market crashes come with the territory. Love them rather than fear them. It is an opportunity to move money from bonds to stock indexes. A sensible portfolio should have 10%-40% in bond indexes, depending on your age. Bonds tend to rise, when markets fall. When markets fall, you are buying business earnings at cheaper prices. The problem is, newer investors always want the wrong result. Let\u2019s compare two people. Both are investing $1,000 a month for 30 years. Person 1, who gets 16% for 15 years, and then 4% from years 16\u201330, will earn less than person 2, who gets 0% for 15 years and then 15% from years 16\u201330. The reason? Compounding. Person 2\u2019s account is going up by 15% during the years when his or her account is worth more. In the real world, investors want good returns in the first few years, forgetting the arithmetic. Investing is easy but not simple, on the emotions especially.
