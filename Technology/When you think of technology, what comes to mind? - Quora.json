            "answer_text": "First I think of the many technologies of today- the car, the smartphone, medical wonders saving lives today. Life wouldn\u2019t be as we knew it without those, surely. But then I stop and think. I remember the many history prompts that school has given me, and they remind me that technology is more than what we think of today. The plow, the carriage, the house- all examples of technology. Even non-physical things can be technology. Crop rotation was a technology that allowed for more substantial stores of food to be gained to sustain more people. And that goes even for the latest procedures. Technology is anything that we, the human race, have created to benefit ourselves or others. That encapsulates so many realms that it is nearly impossible to dictate the quantity. And we will continue to create more technologies until the modern ones become old news and are replaced by even newer ones. ",

            "answer_text": "As a biblical scholar and Bible teacher, I think of how humanity\u2019s humane side cannot keep pace with humanity\u2019s dark side, which almost inevitably turns a technological innovation, originally designed to make life easier, safer, and more efficient, into a tool of exploitation, violence, and unspeakable\u2014and often unanticipated\u2014crimes against humanity. I supposed the potential for good exists in virtually every technological breakthrough, provided it is invented with the best of intentions. Even before the technology has been applied universally and its beta trial proved safe and beneficial, however, evil people have co-opted it for nefarious purposes. \u2018 I too ask with the prophet Jeremiah, The heart is more deceitful than all elseAnd is desperately sick;Who can understand it? (Chapter 17, verse 9) The hearts of the people who constitute humankind are capable of all manner of wickedness. Our only hope for the future of humankind is found in God, whom Jeremiah quoted in the next verse of the same chapter: I, the Lord, search the heart,I test the mind,Even to give to each man according to his ways,According to the results of his deeds. God will one day call into account the deeds of each member of the human race, and those who used technology to perpetrate evil on his or her fellow human beings will be judged by the One who judges and pronounces judgment rightly. For the word of God is alive and active. Sharper than any double-edged sword, it penetrates even to dividing soul and spirit, joints and marrow; it judges the thoughts and attitudes of the heart. Nothing in all creation is hidden from God\u2019s sight. Everything is uncovered and laid bare before the eyes of him to whom we must give account Hebrews 4:12\u201313 NIV). ",
