            "answer_text": "if the simcard is removed when the phone is powerd on, then the phone can damage from that, beause when interrupting a metal when there is electricity flowing throug that metal, then there is an induktive current induced into the metal, a spark, that can then damage the phone, the phone then cant read sim cards anymore or the simcard will damage or even both. when the phone is switched off, then its safe(r) to take the sim card out, even safer when prior the battery is out and no electric current in the phone at all but not all phones have batteries that can be simply removed, so at least when the phone is switched off, then it should be safer, alot safer than removing the sim card when the phone is powered on. beside safety, the phone will not be able to connect to the cellular phone net without a simcard, that means applications like phone calls, internet (4G etc.), sms, mms etc. through the cellular phone net will not be possible, that phone can then be used only offline, so far the user doesnt use any other way of connection in the phone like wifi. there are satelite phones that connect to satelites in outter space but usualy the phones dont have that capability, it would be fun tho if samsung would launch a satelite into outter space for their new s11 smartphone with satelite connection capacility, their phones are already called \u201cgalaxy\u201d.

Some answers mentioned that you can still come to WiFi. I just need to add that you can still make emergency calls (at least in gsm-based networks). That's right, regardless of whether you get your carrier's signal (it works on any gsm carrier signal, not necessarily your carrier) and regardless of whether you have an active account or it's suspended or blocked or even without a SIM card, which of our current discussion, since the original design of GSM networks back in the early 1990s, your phone can still make emergency calls. The protocol even assigned a common number anywhere on the world: 999, which is the number the UK initiated it in the 1930s. ",

After that came the smartphones, where you can not take out the battery. And to take out the SIM, you need a pin to pull out the tray , usually on the side of the phone, where the SIM is located. It is always advisable to put off the power before doing this as this would create a glitch on your software or sometimes it does not, depending on your brand of phone but will just pop a message saying, SIM card removed.
