The development of modern computer architecture was an evolution with many parts and steps, with various developments happening not just at the same time, but with various concepts interleaving. binary number systemBoolean logicconcept of machine calculationconcept of machine algorithmsconcept of subroutinesmechanical computationelectromechanical (relay-based) computationvacuum tube based computationhard-wired patch-panel-based algorithmsmemory-stored algorithms (programs)using the same memory for both memory and data (\u201cvon Neuman architecture\u201d)progression of memory architecture from CRT, mercury delay line, etc., to active element (vacuum tube)concept of operating systemconcept of external storagedevelopment of assemblers, compilers and interpretersdevelopment of object-oriented languagesconcepts of time-shared and real-time processingconcepts of virtual memory and protected mode operationconcept of hardware interrupts interacting with softwareconcept of real-time human interaction and command line interfacessolid state vs. vacuum tube hardwareintegrated circuit components and creation of single-chip CPUsdevelopment of inter-computer communicationdevelopment of multi-CPU computersdevelopment of separate interface subsystemsdevelopment of high speed external non-volatile storage, both permanent and removabledevelopment of packet-switching networks and complex network protocolsprogression from separate networks to the Internetdevelopment of local area and collision-based networksconcept of computer-based human communication (email etc.)concept of digitization of analog data like sound, pictures, etc.development of laser printersdevelopment of personal computersdevelopment of graphical user interface (GUI)popularization and acceptance of computers by non-technical users for entertainmentI could go on \u2014 this is just off the top of my head, and I\u2019m sure I\u2019ve missed important things. But you can see that the term \u201cevolution\u201d is quite applicable. I decline to even suggest a point at which \u201cmodern\u201d (how would you define that?) computing started, let alone a date. It may seem more obvious to those with a more recent viewpoint. Here are a couple of good links for more detail: Timeline of computing - Wikipedia Welcome | Timeline of Computer History | Computer History Museum ",
