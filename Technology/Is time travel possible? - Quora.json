            "answer_text": "Is Time Travel Really Possible? Imagine you own a watch that let\u2019s you travel through time. One day, you get the bright idea to travel back to the 1920\u2019s to mess with your grandparents. You press a few buttons, and suddenly you\u2019re standing beside old Pappy who is taking in the scenery at the precipice of the Grand Canyon. Since you\u2019ve never been the biggest fan of your grandfather, you decide to push him over the edge. Gravity does its thing, and a few seconds later, no more Pappy. But wait, if you killed your grandfather before he ever met your grandmother\u2026 you wouldn\u2019t have been born to be able to go back in time and kill him! Here\u2019s the problem. If you didn\u2019t exist and killed your grandfather, you couldn\u2019t have killed him\u2026 Because you didn\u2019t kill him, he\u2019s still alive. but that would mean that you yourself would be alive and now you can go back in time to kill him. And so the endless loop goes on. This is called the Grandfather Paradox. And it\u2019s part of what makes time travel so interesting. The grandfather paradox deals with time travel on a significant scale. But why don\u2019t we start with something a little smaller? Let\u2019s say you and I are wearing identical watches and we synchronize them right before I blast off into space. In the space shuttle, I\u2019m traveling at roughly 28,000 kilometers per hour relative to the Earth. If I make a few orbits around the Earth before I return, when we compare watches, we\u2019ll see that less time has passed for me. A very, very tiny amount of time, but is there nonetheless. This is called time dilation, and it simply means that according to Einstein\u2019s theory of Relativity, Time measured along different trajectories is affected by differences in either gravity or velocity \u2013 each of which affects time in different ways. One example of time dilation is when we compare the passage of time on the ISS versus on Earth. After spending six months on the Space Station, astronauts have aged approximately .005 seconds less than those of us here on Earth. Of course, this is a very insignificant amount of time, but it would be much more apparent if the astronauts were able to travel to closer to the speed of light. Interestingly, the effects of time dilation are fairly minor, even up to around 70% of the speed of light. However, once we reach 75% or so, the effects become dramatic. Now, bear with me here, because this is where things get a bit weird. Possibly the strangest aspect of special relativity is the distances shrink in the direction of motion. When we think of traveling to a point 10 light years away at 90% of light speed, you\u2019d expect it to take 11 years, right? That\u2019s not exactly the case. To a stationary observer, it would indeed seem to take your vessel 11 years. But to the people inside the vessel, not only time, but distance would dilate and you would reach that point in only 4.4 years. Want to play with time dilation yourself?  Okay, that\u2019s all really fascinating, but is it really time travel? Perhaps not in the sense that we usually think of it, but according to the nature of space-time, it is. If you were to return home from your 90% light speed trip, you would be almost 9 years older. But everyone back on Earth would have aged 22 years. So in essence, you\u2019ve traveled 13 years into the future relative to your time in space. let\u2019s look at another example. In the film Interstellar, Cooper and his team land on a large watery planet, on which gravity is 30% stronger than on Earth. This planet is situated very close to a supermassive black hole called Gargantua, which it orbits at 55% of light. Gargantua\u2019s mass is equal to that of 100,000,000 suns and spins at 99.8% the speed of light. The combination of all these factors have the effect of slowing down time relative to the astronaut left aboard the ship, by a staggering 61,000 times. That means that 1 hour on the planet is equal to seven years aboard the ship. When the team makes it back to the vessel after a little over three of their hours, their friend had aged by 23 years. The craziest part is that this isn\u2019t just science fiction. Those calculations all check out. That\u2019s exactly how it would happen in real life. So in essence, the crew had traveled 23 years into the future. Now so far, we\u2019ve only explored traveling into the future. Is it possible to travel backwards in time? According to some theories, specific types of motion in space might allow time travel into the past and future, if these geometries and motions were possible. However, that\u2019s a big if. It would require something called a closed timelike curve, or CTC for short. A CTC is a closed loop in space-time which could theoretically allow an object to return to its own past. The science behind time travel to the past, is incredibly complex and speculative and many scientists suspect that it is not possible at all, because of the issue of causality. That brings us back to the Grandfather Paradox, if in fact these scientists are correct and assuming traveling to the past would cause a paradox then we have our answer, time travel to the past is impossible.  If however, the Novikov Self-Consistency Principle is correct, then there is still a chance. The Novikov Principle states that if an event exists that would cause a paradox or any change to the past whatsoever, then the probability of that event is zero. It would thus be impossible to create time paradoxes. Unfortunately, for any would-be time travelers, the Novikov Principle is not widely accepted. Another possibility would be the existence of wormholes, which are technically permitted by general relativity. \u2013 In order to travel through time using a wormhole, it would have to be what is known as a Transversable Wormhole. Brace yourself for more strange space-time shenanigans here. In order to be able to travel through time using a Transversable Wormhole, its creation would have to be in one of two ways. Option one, one end of the wormhole would have to be accelerated to a significant portion of the speed of light, then brought back to the origin point. time dilation would result in an accelerated wormhole entrance aging less than the stationary one as seen by an external observer Option 2 requires one end of the wormhole to be placed within the gravitational field of an object with higher gravity than the other entrrance and then returned to a position near the other entrance This is a difficult concept to grasp So think of it this way, imagine you and I synchronize our watches to both display the year 2000 I hop in my ship and accelerate one entrance to the wormhole to near light speed and then bring it back My watch now reads 2004 And yours reads 2012 If someone were then to enter the accelerated entrance they would now exit the stationary entrance in the year 2004 the same location,  but 8 years in their past. It\u2019s incredibly complicated stuff. But an easier way to look at it is by picturing a piece of paper. This paper represents space time. A wormhole is an area of warped spacetime with an entrance and an exit which you can imagine as the paper being folded back on itself with a hole poked through it. Essentially you\u2019re simply skipping all the time and distance between the two points. The problem with transversable wormholes is that you can\u2019t possibly travel back further than the initial creation of the wormhole So\u2026 really it\u2019s more a path through time rather than a device that propels itself back and forth through the years at will. It could be useful for the people in the distant future wanting to come to observe our time but if we created such a portal today we couldn\u2019t use it to go visit the dinosaurs. One final method that could potentially allow an individual to more or less travel through time is cryopreservation The branch of science concerned specifically with preserving human is called cryonics and the practice has been around since the late 1960s. Cryonics is on the speculative edge of medicine as its proponents suggest that Death is not a singular event, but a process it would have to be for the practice to be successful because it\u2019s currently illegal for a human to be frozen before they die Once a person has opted to be cryo-preserved, their bodies are prepared minutes after official death. The theory is that by reducing the patient\u2019s body temperature to around -130 degrees celcius enough brain information will be retained in an accessible state for doctors and scientists of the far future to revive the patient.Temperatures that low inevitably cause significant damage to the human body regardless of prior-preservation safeguards. So the doctors of today are relying on the development of future technology that will allow the brain to be repaired at the molecular level and restored to functioning condition if someday technology has advanced far enough to revive cryo-preserved humans.  They will have essentially time traveled to the future it\u2019s not quite as easy as shows like futurama make it seem but it is theoretically possible. And that\u2019s time travel, in a nutshell. You really can move forward through time by traveling at an immense speeds or through cryo-preservation But travel to the past is likely impossible. Of course the science of quantum physics and time travel is incredibly vast and well beyond the grasp of most normal people, so we may be missing just one crucial element to understanding exactly how spacetime works. But who knows? maybe someone from the far future will show up in our time and give us the key to unlocking the mystery or\u2026would that cause a paradox, as always? ",

            "answer_text": "This is a religiously mystical and spiritually dense question. Re-worded \u2014 \u201cIs it possible for a human being to travel anywhere in time and space \u2014 to the past, the future and the now?\u201d Answer: Yes, but we need to develop robust, truer definitions for the question\u2019s words and meld them into a clarity. Put on your thinking caps, kiddies. This will be on the mid-term. You are actually sensing \u201ceverywhere\u201d right now \u2014 in touch with all of space and time \u2014 but, for most folks, local phenomena wash out the fainter data-points of mentality which can be as subtle as a single quark\u2019s arrival \u2014 registered by the eye\u2019s retina. A sufficiently attuned nervous system CAN mindfully attend this level of information. Your body/mind is exquisitely refined, RIGHT NOW, and all of its sensitivities can be consciously lived \u2014 practically and actually \u2014 as all time realities. It\u2019s absolutely common for you to, say, be able to hear a car crashing outside your house and knowing much without even going to a window. You will have been, at least partially, as much \u201cthere\u201d as if you were standing there and seeing it. The mind can suss out the crash sounds to great degree. You would know \u201cabout how much\u201d damage was involved. If you have better hearing than average, you would know even more about the event in that maybe you heard the lesser sounds of various car parts tumbling along the concrete, or cries of alarm of the driver, other cars braking, etc. And if your hearing is as good as God\u2019s, you will have been there at the scene as fully as possible. No other sense inputs would be needed except as secondary affirmations. Thank you, Hollywood, for showing us so many blind Zen sword masters, so that we can be comfortable with this concept. Same deal for all the senses \u2014 they can be notched up into divine instrumentalities. You can be \u201cthere\u201d by this \u201ceavesdropping\u201d and \u201cpeeping Tom-ing\u201d and \u201cbeing down wind\u201d on any event anywhere. This is remote viewing in but one mode. And there\u2019s lots and lots of modes. About modes, I\u2019ll just say it. You are everywhere and everywhen across the universe always and instantly. Yeah, like God watching reality TV with a remote in hand. Everyone is always fully processing all the levels all the time. We may deny that a butterfly\u2019s wings are flap-affecting our minds, but all the flaps everywhere do. We are directly proportional to the entirety \u2014 as is every thing. Objection: \u201cYeah, but, Edg, you\u2019re not saying we can go back and see dinosaurs, are you? Oh yes I am. You do this kind of travel EVERY SINGLE DAY. Let\u2019s get serious about your secretly being a god on a daily basis. And I don\u2019t want to hear any of your guffaws, snarks or knee-jerk denials. I\u2019m talking about YOU and your own private holodeck \u2014 your dreaming brain. What a magnificence. What a vastness. What a phantasmagoria. When you dream while safely cuddling your childhood blanket, you spawn whole universes like a farmer hand casting seeds. And you buy into every speck of them as real. When you wake up in the morning, you will be found knowing details like there having been a missing button on an enemy\u2019s uniform or that a dragon had a loose scale, or that the sound of toast popping up and the smell of coffee brewing meant someone loved you\u2026oh wait, you\u2019re awake now\u2026it was hard to catch the difference. Advaita insists you get it straight that waking up in the morning is MORE DREAMING. This is your job. Everything else can wait. But hey.So, you\u2019re fooling yourself. Ain\u2019t it cool? You get to \u201cplay for real\u201d in dreamland. This is God\u2019s blessing. So visit the dinosaurs and ride them.Grab a handful from the pot at the rainbow\u2019s end.Race by Superman and The Flash.Or pretend you\u2019re a wage slave in 2019.Whatever floats your cosmic canoe.Might as well visit Heaven while you\u2019re at it.
