            "answer_text": "1-iPhone Can Survive Falls Of Over 13,000 Feet  A skydiver Jarrod McKinney lost his iPhone-4 in midair after jumping from 13,500 feet and the phone landed on a building.

Believe it or not but there is actually a big reason behind it. Whenever Apple releases it\u2019s new product, they want the big reveal of the product happens around 40 minutes. When the image of the product appears on screen, they want that the time shown on a Apple\u2019s product to be close to the actual time on the audience\u2019s watches. 4-Apple\u2019s iPhone Wasn\u2019t The First iPhone  Initially, Cisco owned the \u2018iPhone\u2019 trademark. Before Apple, Cisco Systems had originally patented the name. The Cisco iPhone was a VOIP phone that allowed users to call through Skype without having to use a computer. Cisco sued Apple for calling its smartphone an iPhone. After January 2007, Apple and Cisco eventually settled their dispute, promising to collaborate together on products in the future. 5-iPhone Users Are More Loyal  iPhone users are more likely to upgrade to another iPhone than Android users are likely to upgrade to another Android device. About 49% of the people sell their old iPhones before purchasing new ones. That\u2019s something amazing because you don\u2019t see that for any other phone in particular. ",

            "answer_text": "Instant Operating System Updates for AllWhen Apple pulls the trigger on a new iOS update, it reaches every iPhone, iPad and iPod Touch owner almost immediately. That's because Apple has complete control over when its operating system updates roll-out \u2013 there's no intervention from mobile carriers, or smartphone manufacturers. As a result, any security vulnerabilities, software glitches or bugs are fixed with ruthless efficiency within the iOS ecosystem. It also means users can get their hands on the latest features as soon as Apple is ready to push them out. That's not always the case with Android. Google pushed out its latest update to the mobile operating system, 6.0 Marshmallow, back in October 2015. However, it wasn't until February 2016 that Samsung Galaxy smartphone owners were able to start downloading the update and enjoy the latest features. 2. Simple, Easy Device-Wide Search By Default Apple's Spotlight search is a phenomenal tool. From any Home Screen panel on your iPhone or iPad, simply touch your finger to the display and drag down to load the search field. You can then launch a search for almost anything on your device \u2013 apps, contacts, phone numbers, messages, GarageBand projects, draft emails, individual tracks available to stream via Apple Music. Spotlight can also search the web, so you don't have to fire-up a separate app before you kickstart your next Google search. Like on OS X, Spotlight can handle some basic maths too. So you can type your calculation into the search field and get the answer \u2013 without ever leaving the Home Screen. Start using it, and you'll struggle to remember how you lived without it. Many of this is possible from your Home Screen on Android \u2013 but not by default. For all its expertise in search, Google bafflingly makes you turn on searching for apps within the Settings of the Google app. 3. iPhones Are More Secure Apple's iOS is a more secure platform than Android. Granted, it's not impregnable. But it is better. In its 2015 Mobile Threat Report, Pulse Secure estimated that a jaw-dropping 97 per cent of all malware written for mobile targeted Android devices. Meanwhile the United States Department of Homeland Security has previously estimated than a meagre 0.7 per cent of malware threats would affect iOS users. One of the reasons for this disparity is that many Android users do not \u2013 or cannot \u2013 update to the latest version of the operating system. Android also has more users worldwide, which makes it appealing for cyber scammers. ",
