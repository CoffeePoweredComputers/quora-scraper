            "answer_text": "Well if you consider that most of the processes and infrastructure that sustain modern life were designed and implemented decades ago before IT was really powerful then you can deduce that you could leverage IT to radically improve sustainability in almost all areas.  Almost everything needs better IT. It's why farmers are using GPS to plow fields and manufacturers are using IT to automate factories. IT will be the key piece of the nation's electrical grid which will be powered by renewables. IT will distribute power from massive solar arrays in Nevada to suburban areas of Minnesota. Or from wind farms off the coast of North Carolina to residents in Washington DC.  IT is the main tool businesses can use be more efficient and being more efficient equals being more sustainable. ",
