            "answer_text": "Have motorcycles changed in the last 50 years? That is a particularly interesting question for me because I began riding before the period started and I am still on the roads, and racing, today. I have told part of this story in \u201cClassic Superbikes\u201d which is my latest book.  This is the story of how bikes have developed - available from: Books By Frank Melling Where to start? Superficially it is easy to say that this feature or that improvement has been made. However, the progress has not been nearly as great as you might think. To begin with, many of the things we now consider to be state of the art have been around for a long time \u2013 a very long time indeed. For example, Alfred Scott had a 450cc, twin-cylinder, water-cooled, inclined, mass centralised two-stroke motorcycle in 1908. Note that date: 1908 \u2013 112 years ago.  Scott had watercooling and mass centralisation over 100 years ago Both FN and Henderson produced series production, four cylinder motorcycles before the First World War.  And Henderson, amongst others, had cracked the mass production of four cylinder motorcycles before WWII Rudge used linked brakes in the 1930s and unit construction engines, where the gearbox and engine are one unit, were common. As for technological innovation, no modern manufacturer has come within a light year of matching the brilliance of Giulio Cesare Carcano who designed an eight cylinder, 500cc, Grand Prix engine in 1954 \u2013 and without the any computer assistance.  The Moto Guzzi eight cylinder, V8 engine of 1955 has still yet to be surpassed In 1967, Honda had a five cylinder, air-cooled, 125cc engine which ran all the way up to 22,000rpm \u2013 that\u2019s higher revving than the best current MotoGP engines.  In 1967, Honda build engines which ran reliably to 22,000 rpm But let\u2019s go back to 50 years to 1970 and final days of the British motorcycle industry. The greatest thing which the Japanese brought to motorcycling was production quality. Very often, hand-built British bikes were superior to the Japanese. Skilled tuners, with a life-time of experience, could do incredibly clever things with what, by 1970, were obsolete designs. In 1969, Triumph\u2019s test rider Percy Tait, finished second to Giacomo Agostini and Percy was riding a push-rod twin whose antecedents were very, very firmly rooted in Triumph\u2019s 1938 Speedtwin design \u2013 and that\u2019s not exaggerating to make a point.  With gifted tuners, ancient British designs could be made to do remarkable things. Here\u2019s Percy Tait, who finished second Giacomo Agostini riding a Triumph whose antecedents led directly back to 1938 What changed motorcycling forever was Soichiro Honda\u2019s view that motorcycles were not some close relative of fighter aircraft, flown by men with \u201cthe right stuff\u201d, but were consumer products just like TVs and fridges. His advertising strapline was magnificent: \u201cYou meet the nicest people on a Honda.\u201d  This was the game changer. Of course kids like me, who were real motorcyclists who shot from the hip and could start a high compression British sporting single with one earlobe, sneered at the Japanese. What sort of limp wristed big Woossie wants an electric start? We\u2019d have rather had our man bits lopped off and pan fried before we would admit to the way the world was going. I can tell you a 100% true anecdote which illustrates the problem. Fred Barlow, now sadly departed, was a very dear friend of mine. He was an apprentice in the BSA race shop. One day, a Honda Cub arrived and Fred was told to strip it down and measure all the tolerances. He did and wrote a report which Brian Martin, the BSA Competitions Manager, presented to the BSA directors. In essence, he said that the BSA race shop, with unlimited time and some of the world\u2019s best mechanics, would struggle to make a race bike to the same quality that Honda were producing by the hundred thousand with their cheap and basic Cub. And I would stress that this story is absolutely true.  Honda could mass produce their iconic Cub to higher standard than BSA could produce a hand-built race bike So, by 1970 Honda - and the other Japanese factories - were making motorcycles to the same quality as 2020 bikes. The biggest single mechanical advance has been electronics. Without becoming intemperate in my language, it is difficult to express just how appallingly, soul destroyingly bad were ignition systems before the arrival of electronics. British electrics were produced by Joseph Lucas \u2013 and the company was universally known as \u201cJoe Lucas \u2013 the Prince of Darkness.\u201d Those young people who think that life is tough now ought to experience kneeling by the side of an Ariel Arrow, in a freezing blizzard at ten o\u2019clock at night, trying to re-set the points on the coil ignition. Magnetos were somewhat better but still awful. The idea that one could ride all day and the bike start everyone time would have been a better dream for me than any saucy magazines when I first had a bike. It wasn\u2019t only me, down at the peasant end of the motorcycling world, who suffered. GP riders on factory bikes suffered the same plague. So, yes let\u2019s hear it for electronics in all forms. The next giant step for mankind was tyres. I fitted the latest Pirelli touring tyres to our Ducati this Spring and I have been amazed at how good they are. Ten years ago, these would have been considered to be a top quality damp track race tyre. If any modern motorcyclist rode ten miles with a 1970s Avon SM, they\u2019d get off their bike terrified. More than any other single factor, tyres have been a Godsend for motorcycle safety. The greatest single safety feature in the last 50 years has been the engine cut out to stop the bike moving with the side-stand still down. Before this, everyone has ridden off at least a few times with the side-stand still down \u2013 often with fatal results. However, there is a problem \u2013 or problems actually \u2013 and they are philosophical. I was listening to a 30 year old, or thereabouts, rider chatting to his friends in the car park by Bala Lake. He was full of praise for his new Triumph. The bike had multi abs and traction controls modes which I suppose were acceptable. But these rider aids were only the start. Additionally, there was cruise control and an on board computer. If I have got this next bit wrong, please forgive me but I understood the owner to say that he good get his phone to talk to the display on the Triumph via Bluetooth. He could then see texts and e-mails as he rode along, whilst listening to music and chatting with his passenger. For me, this goes to the epi-centre of why we ride. If I was forced to commute daily into a city centre I would want a super-scooter with every rider aid in the catalogue on it because my sole interest would be getting to and from home with the minimum of effort and the maximum safety. My car is a diesel SUV with permanent four wheel drive and a mass of protective features, some active and others passive. I want this vehicle to take me from A to B with me making the minimum input commensurate with driving safely. Rather, I want the car to do as much work as possible for me.  For safety, convenience and entertainment buy a four wheel drive, diesel SUV But motorcycling is something different. For me, it is as much a spiritual and emotional activity as it is physical. Cruising around on a motorcycle in safety is relatively straightforward but I want my riding to be in that wonderful, quiet, intense area where nothing in life intrudes into the experience of being on, and with, the bike. At its best, this form of motorcycling reaches very odd areas. I remember riding my 1965 Matchless G50 Grand Prix racer at Spa and reaching this special place. The penultimate corner at Spa is an immensely long, compound left-hand bend, and on a few laps that day I got it absolutely right. The rear tyre was gently scrabbling for grip and I needed just the merest hint of opposite lock to correct it.  The Matchelss G50 - where rider aids are limited to the throttle and superb handling. Note where the gap between the frame rails and the track! At 120mph, the bike was running on two credit card sized patches of rubber with me maintaining harmony only with throttle control and balance. Everything was happening in ultra slow motion and there was a wonderful sense of emotional silence and peace. I was the bike, the bike was me - and nothing came between us. Yesterday, I rode in the mountains on our 13 year old Ducati Sport Classic and had similar experiences. The bike has no rider aids so I am free to immerse myself in the joy of seeking the perfect point to initiate a turn and the boundless pleasure of easing open the throttle and balancing the bike with the engine\u2019s power.  Ducati Classic - rider aid free! I invariably ride with my wife on the pillion but we have no on-bike communications because riding demands 100% of my attention \u2013 and receives it. For me, the rewards for the effort I make are immense. So my advice from a lifetime of riding is this. Don\u2019t think that more is better. True, total and complete rider satisfaction does not come from engine mapping options or reading e-mails whilst you are riding but only when there is simply you and the bike in the world. If you enjoy reading about the story of how motorcycles have developed have a look at my best selling autobiography - \u201cA Penguin in a Sparrow\u2019s Nest\u201d (The Story of a Freelance Motorcycling Journalist The Penguin Chronicles: Amazon.co.uk: Melling, Frank: Books) because I was there, and got every t-shirt in the box!

            "answer_text": "For starters, an entire class of motorcycles has essentially disappeared. Fifty years ago, you could choose between two-stroke and four-stroke. Two-stroke street bikes were killed by emissions regulations in the mid-1990s.  Two-strokes held out in off-road machines for a while, but even there they are almost gone today. Four-strokes have changed quite a bit. I am going to pick Yamaha, as they are a brand I am very familiar with. They provide a great example of the evolution of motorcycle. This is a pretty typical 1970 four-stroke motorcycle, a Yamaha XS-1.  The design is intended to be fairly generic, good at many different things. There was no real division into sport bikes, cruisers, standards. Purpose-built dirt bikes just started to be their own category. Specialization into types is another major way motorcycles changed in 50 years. The features are pretty typical to bikes of the time.

The most comparable category to the XS-1 standard is Sport Heritage. Outside of Yamaha market-speak, they are still called standards or naked standards. Like the XSR700.

Fairings, frames, steering geometry, upside-down forks. Many bikes now have ABS and electronic stability systems, ride by wire throttles. Touring bikes might have GPS and entertainment systems. What does all of this mean in practice? Modern bikes are lighter, more powerful, better handling. They need less maintenance - no more carb cleaning and setting points. They start in any weather. They are safer, both in the sense of forgiving handling mistakes and in terms of things like not spilling gas out of carb bowls when they fall over. They are more fuel efficient and quieter. Engines adjust to altitude changes and weather conditions automatically, without messing with jets. They are harder to modify. This is a pretty minor downside, though. Given the various types available, there is much less need for modification. The electronic systems have their own failure modes that didn\u2019t exist in the older electronics-free bikes, but given how much less maintenance you need to do, it\u2019s not a bad trade-off. A relatively recent development is all-electric bikes. They do away with the combustion engine completely. They aren\u2019t common enough yet to be considered a change in motorcycles overall, though. Yamaha doesn\u2019t have one yet, but they are working on it. ",
