            "answer_text": "I think Ride By Wire and Cornering ABS are the two most important and the most advanced technologies ever to come out for motorcycles. The quick shifter is a cool thing to have but isn\u2019t game changing as the other two I mentioned earlier. The Cornering ABS is a remarkable thing as it prevents the wheels from locking during cornering if the rider suddenly touches the brake or for some reason the rider has to do it. This technology has prevented a lot of accidents given the insane lean angles and how on edge they go. As for Ride By Wire, It just changes power delivery like no other. With ever increasing power outputs from modern day superbikes managing that power becomes just as difficult. With Ride By Wire systems, the accelerator is no longer connected directly to the throttle body, instead sensors detect throttle angle and send feedback to the ECU which in turn controls the throttle body, this then gives you the power to tweak your performance numbers with greater control, reducing power when conditions are not too good and releasing full power when it\u2019s ideal.

            "answer_text": "Can you find any part in this super-bike different from the common designs.  This is Vyrus 987 C3 4VV naked superbike that runs at 211 bhp supercharged 1198cc 1098R Ducanti engine and weighs just 158kg. But the amazing part in this bike is it\u2019s hub-center steering system that is not adapted in most motorcycles.Let me show you one another superbike. This bike is Bimota Tesi 3D it has similar hub-center steering system like VYRUS 987.If you closely observe you may notice that the steering rod is not directly connected to the wheel as you expect to see in any motorbike. Different from the Telescopic fork steering, HCS(Hub-center steering) has separate steering, braking and suspension functions.  While driving when you apply brakes that are on a telescopic fork, the suspension is compressed because it is on the same fork.If you drive motorcycles you might have experienced while applying brakes when the suspension is on a bump, suspension becomes ineffective because it is already compressed by brakes.Also, size of telescopic fork changes due to the compression of the suspension and then expansion that inversely effects the acceleration due to changing steering geometry.This creates a stiction (the friction which tends to prevent stationary surfaces from being set in motion) in steering due to suppressed vertical moment of the wheel. So it makes extremely difficult for driving on an irregular surfaces and sometimes causes failure of suspension system. But this will not happen in HCS.  As you can see in the image, an arm or arms on bearings are used to allow upward deflection of wheel without stiction, even under braking.There are no vertical forces on the steering, wheel and the braking system. So when the brake is applied on the bike, its force is redirected horizontally along the arms, away from the vertical suspension forces.Finally, the arms typically form some form of parallelogram which maintains steering geometry over the full range of wheel travel, allowing agility and consistency of steering that forks currently cannot get close to attaining. Only problem with HCS is the steering feel. Due to complex linkages in the steering process, it can lead to slack, vague, or inconsistent handlebar movement across its range.Hub-center steering systems have only appeared on a very few production motorcycles, and not with any great success.Evolution, rather than revolution, tends to drive advancements in new models, and dictate sales. After so many years of telescopic forks, people are used to riding a bike that handles in a specific way, and almost expect the limitations, and compensation is part of the experience. Also there is a depth of knowledge known about fork based chassis design that attempts each year to get around the limitations through technological advances on the current system.Thicker and thicker fork tubes are used to reduce flex, special coatings are used to aid stiction, and greater and greater steering angles are used to counteract dive.But still I think Hub Center Steering wheel is an amazing technology.
