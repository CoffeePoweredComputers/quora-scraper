            "answer_text": "One word answer: No SAP UI5 is, as given by the name, a user -interface designing platform designed in JavaScript, HTML, CSS, etc. It doesn't require any knowledge of ABAP. However, as is the case with all UIs, we need to feed data to this interface from back end. This data feeding is generally done through Odata services. Odata is nothing but a protocol named open data protocol which governs the rules for feeding data to UI5 applications. The data, here, is extracted through ABAP code. Thus, if you are aiming for only a UI5 developer designing interfaces, you don't need ABAP. However, for complete application development, you will need some basic knowledge of ABAP. ",

But there is a second part to it which is Gateway, it's all about pulling data from SAP and sending it to UI5 application.So for this you need ABAP knowledge. There are requirements for people who are aware of ABAP and Gateway . OData and Gateway services are same and if you are aware of ABAP then you can easily work on Gateway. ",

With SAP'sSAPUI5 JavaScript toolkit, developers can build SAP web applications using HTML5 web development standards. SAP is also making good progress in providing development tools to speed up implementations. The best tool is Web IDE, which is available in the HANA Cloud and as a local installation.In a nutshell, if you are planning to work as developer in SAP related domain, it\u2019s time to learn and get familiar with SAPUI5. SAPUI5 mainly requires HTML5, jQuery, CSS etc. as prerequisites. It is the front-end technology which is used to implement user interface. While HANA is database and backend technology. For the growth and the technology, they are two different paths, equally worth. Both of them got big prospective and a bright future. Both of them has very good scope in terms of career in India and Abroad as well.Based on your interest and knowledge, you may choose any path.
