            "answer_text": "My immediate response to your question: Is it technology or skill that really sets the difference between professional racers? was to reply \u201cWhat type of racer are you talking about - you haven\u2019t given us sufficient information\u201d. However the more I think about it , it is probably better that I don\u2019t know if you are talking about Formula 1 drivers or camel jockeys. The answer seems clear to me. And that answer is \u201cIt depends\u201d. It depends on the sport you are talking about nd since you didn\u2019t specify a sport I can pick two to demonstrate my point. For some sports like the aforementioned Formula 1, although there are years of training and progression through the levels of racing for drivers to be able to even control the cars that they drive, there is a huge amount of technology behind the cars and those teams that have access to the most resources (i.e. money) are going to be more successful. This will reflect on the drivers for each team. So in this case it is not just skill that sets the drivers apart. Lewis Hamilton would not be looking for a sixth world title this year without having a competitive car. His skill is undeniable but without the Mercedes F1 car he drives he would probably not be champion. To put it into numbers his total points for the 2019 season were 413 whereas his team mate Valterri Bottas scored 326 points driving the same Mercedes car. Without getting into the details of the starring role Hamilton has and the subsidiary role Bottas has, which would tend to skew the points standings in Hamilton\u2019s favour, their seems to be a skill difference; but both are significantly higher in the standings than other F1 drivers and this indicates at least to me that they are driving a superior car. Technology makes the difference. On the other hand let\u2019s look at a sport which has very little to do with technology and everything to do with skill. The sport of ultramarathon trail running. This is the sport of running on mountain trails over distances that are longer than a traditional marathon distance of about 26 miles. To compete in these races you need a pair of running shoes (I don\u2019t think they are actually mandated by the rules!!!) and that\u2019s it. The only other common technology that runners use are watches, pulse monitors and hydration systems (from water bottles to camel back style water bags) and I can tell you from personal observation that most of the top class trail runners don\u2019t use much in the way of fancy technology. So here is a sport where it is almost purely skill, strength, and stamina that decides who wins - technology has almost no role to play. To be fair I am talking about the actual race - the runners may have access to fancy gym equipment and computerized training regimes and diet plans but non of this matters during the actual race. So as I said at the beginning it all depends on the sport. I picked two contrasting sports to show what I think is correct. Others may disagree. Maybe you can think of better examples of individual sports that would place at either end of a representative line stretching from high technology dependence on the left and skill dependence on the right. Note: I feel obliged to add that from what I have seen and read about F1 drivers, they need to be super fit athletes to withstand the rigours of F1 racing. And while we are at it - I recognize the role that F1 driver\u2019s have in providing feedback to engineers and designers of the cars. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes. Both, in those cases where technology is an important part of the sport. But the athlete (driver, rider, etc) has a big impact. At the top level, there\u2019s very little difference between those that take part. At a lower level, the differences are bigger, because the selection isn\u2019t as fierce. As an example, I\u2019ll talk about Mike and Paul. Both were racing motorcycles around Cadwell Park, classic racing, so technology makes a smaller difference than in modern motorsport (you are only allowed \u201cage appropriate\u201d technology in classic racing - they parts can be modern manufacturing, but for example electronic aids available on the latest models of bike isn\u2019t permitted on a 30 year old bike). Mike\u2019s engine blew up in the second meeting of the weekend, there were five races, but riders had to take part in four of them. So Paul lends his bike to Mike so he can use it in the last race of the day. Because Mike isn\u2019t on the original bike, he has to start at the back of the field, in 31st place, with his qualifying position of second left empty. Paul has been lapping around 1m58s, and Mike would have set a new lap record (for that class of classic bike) with 1m43s. That\u2019s a 15s difference between riders. This is not a top level professional class of racing, but it illustrates the point I\u2019m trying to make. The best drivers, riders and ahtletes end up in the better teams at top level professional sport. That\u2019s how it works, you don\u2019t get to race with a highly successful racing team unless you are REALLY good. That team may well have the best technology, but to get to use that technology, you need to be good enough - and give good enough feedback. It is of course not ONLY skill that determines things, but if someone is, say, 1 second slower than the average racer, then they are not going to be in a top team. If you have the right personality, public image, etc, you may be \u201cforgiven\u201d a tiny bit of being slower, but it will only forgive a fraction of a second. A good technical rider, that can explain how to use the technology. Watch about 2m30s into this, how Sylvain Guintoli is explaining how to improve the bike - he is a \u201cdevelopment rider\u201d for Suzuki, so he would know what he\u2019s talking about. Notice how Kyle Ryde is listening intently at what Sylvain says about the bike (Kyle is racing the number 77 bike that Sylvain is comparing to his road-bike)\u2026  ",
