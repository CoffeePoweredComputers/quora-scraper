            "answer_text": "Having programming as your day job means you\u2019d be solving a number of problems over the course of a week - debugging some obscure bug in your project, hacking an open source library to fit your need, performing some heroic refactoring moves, etc. You could tell the world about these things through your blog. How many times have you banged your head on your desk trying to figure something out only to laugh at yourself in the end after it turns out all you had to do was something stupidly simple? Tell your story to everyone! Personally I enjoy writing about production and scaling issues we have as they can make really good stories.
