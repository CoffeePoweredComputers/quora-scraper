            "answer_text": " Linux Mint 18 Cinnamon Edition on a run-of-the-mill Dell Inspiron 1545 made in 2009. This laptop was built to run Windows, but every bit of its hardware is supported in Linux and has been for years. Buy a model from a well-known supplier with common, off-the-shelf type Intel hardware, and you are almost guaranteed to get good Linux compatibility these days. Honestly, Linux can work on basically any laptop these days. But there are some general rules of thumb that will get you maximum compatibility: Choose something based on an Intel CPU and chipset. I don\u2019t say this because I have anything against AMD\u2014my desktop is AMD-based, and I build AMD-based desktops exclusively. But Intel gets the lions\u2019 share of Linux development and support. Any Intel-based laptop that\u2019s more than about a year old will work with any up-to-date Linux distro right out of the box.Going back to what I just said, while any Intel-based model will likely work, if you choose one based on a CPU and chipset that have been on the market for a year or two, everything will be \u201ctried-and-true\u201d by that time. You may not be on the bleeding edge hardware-wise, but with Linux, you don\u2019t need to be. You\u2019d be amazed at just how fast a Core 2 Duo laptop from 2009 can be in Linux.Another warning about AMD. The driver support for AMD GPU\u2019s in Linux can be wonky sometimes, although the situation is improving. Either stick with Intel integrated graphics (which work perfectly every time, just like CPU\u2019s and chipsets) or something with Nvidia graphics\u2014even if you have to hold your nose like I do to use anything Nvidia. (Edit 3/15/2019: The support situation has changed significantly since I wrote this in 2016, and using AMD graphics is no longer an issue.)Choose something that uses standard, off-the-shelf hardware. Some ho-hum Dell or HP is a better choice than the Razer Blade. Fancy gaming laptops with bleeding-edge hardware, SLI graphics and \u201csmart\u201d keyboards, among other things, are best left to Windows. Don\u2019t get me wrong, you can run Linux on something like a Blade\u2014but you probably won\u2019t get the best experience.Linux isn\u2019t hard to do on a laptop, especially not now. Give me a working laptop that\u2019s 10 years old or less, and I can have Ubuntu or Mint installed and running in no time. It\u2019s just as easy on a brand-new one, even if you\u2019ve bought one with preinstalled Windows. The exception at the present time are two Lenovo models that have some strange proprietary RAID disk system on them, which is apparently not supported by Linux yet. This is why I suggest something that\u2019s been on the market for a while. This gives the Linux community time to figure out oddball hardware like that. ",

            "answer_text": "Pretty much any laptop and any desktop will work better with Linux than it did with windows installed. The trick is to find a Linux distro that works well with the laptop or desktop that you intend to install Linux to. Including older pc\u2019s and laptops too. I have used Ubuntu, Mint and many like them. I only use MX Linux on my own computers now but do have some computers around that still have Mint installed along side MX Linux but Mint doesn\u2019t get much use. MX Linux does. It has a blazing fast xfce desktop. It boots faster than almost all Linux\u2019s. MX Linux is the best of them all. It is very advanced, solid and has frequent updates and upgrades as newer versions of things are built. MX Linux has the best installer of ANY Linux. MX Linux will install easily on an older PC that came out with Vista or Xp. MX Linux can be installed on a brand new pc too. I build them. I like to buy a brand new hard drive to spruce up an older computer. I like to use Crucial ( Crucial US | DRAM, Solid State Drive (SSD) & Memory Upgrades ) to scan my rig then buy the most gb of ram that the pc or laptop can use. Then an old pc can blaze using MX Linux. Even a Pentium 3 that came with 512mb of Pc133 ram will blaze with one or two gb of pc133 ram. Add a pci videocard and you can play a lot of games or watch smooth video. For next to nothing. Ten year old computers blaze as is with MX Linux installed. I have used many many different Linux os\u2019s in my life starting in the winter of 2002/2003. I have installed Linux many many times and every experience was different. Easy to do when there was over 500 Linux\u2019s and over 350 active varieties of Linux to choose from. An active variety of Linux will constantly have newer versions of itself available every 3, 6 9 or 12 months. All available for free download. MX Linux can be downloaded in a .iso file form. The iso is burned on a dvd as an image. I use Xfburn now but have used K3b for 15 years. Before that I used Nero. Any of them will burn the iso as an image. After you burn the image to dvd you place the dvd in your dvd tray and reboot. Be sure to tap whichever key opens the boot order so you can put the dvd at the top of the boot order. After that the MX Linux dvd will load. On a newer pc it will be fast in the live dvd environment. On an old pc the installed MX Linux will be faster than on a live dvd. The most important thing to do while using the live dvd is to check that your existing wireless works and will connect to a wireless network. Ethernet will auto-connect but as long as wireless works while in live dvd mode it will work when MX Linux is installed. Here\u2019s how to prepare to install MX Linux. Your first step is to download MX Linux from distrowatch dot com.Click the blue letters to go there.Put the fun back into computing. Use Linux, BSD. Use Nero or similar to burn the .iso file on to a DVD. You will then have what is called a \u2018live DVD' . Place the live DVD in your DVD tray. Now reboot the laptop with the DVD in the tray. You might need to tap whatever key brings up the boot order while the laptop is starting up so you can open Boot options. When boot options opens up choose to boot off the DVD player. You may need to go into bios and change the boot order if on an older computer. Now when the live dvd loads you should get the grub start screen. Hit enter and the live MX Linux system will start up. This way you get to try the system out before you install. Basically make sure the wireless works and that you can connect to your home network. If you can get online when trying the live DVD then wireless will work on a full install. If that all goes well you could use Gparted to delete your old operating system. Gparted is an easy to use partition editor. Or you can just click the installer icon and install MX Linux. You can auto install which takes longer or it can be faster if you use gparted to delete everything on your hard drive. I prefer to use gparted myself. I use gparted to create the 3 partitions that I always create when I am installing. To choose which file system to format to you click the drop down box, the choices will appear. NOTE!! MAKE SURE THAT WIRELESS WORKS USING THE LIVE DVD BEFORE YOU INSTALL. If the wireless does not work on the live DVD it won't work on a full install. Sowhen in gparted right click on each existing partition and choose delete. After deleting all the partitions you click apply. To create your new partitions right click the empty space where your old partitions were and create a 30gb partition, format it to ext4, name it root. Next I create a \u2018Linux Swap' partition. Make the swap partition the same size as the ram you have\u2026if you have 8 GB of ram make an 8gb Linux Swap partition, format it to Linux Swap. Label it swap if you like but you don't really need to label swap. Now use all the remaining space on your hard drive to create home. Format it as ext4. Label it home. Write down how many GB home and root are because you will be choosing these partitions to install root (admin) and home to.After clicking apply all your partitions should be created and visible on gparted.Now you are ready to install MX LInux. On the top left corner of your monitor is the install icon. Left Click once\u2026oh ya no more double clicking anything ok? You double click and two open up instead of one.Choose to custom install to existing partitions. Be sure to choose the 30gb partition to install root to. Next box is for swap. Last box is for Home. Label root as root label home as home. You will see where to label during the install. The install could take 20 minutes.You need to choose a password for root and a different password for home user. If you choose an easy to remember word for a password then place a period after each letter nothing can guess your password. A great password could be p.a.s.s.w.o.r.d. or s.w.o.r.d.f.i.s.h. or D.a.n.n.y. or k.a.r.en. get the picture? Separating any word with periods. The reason I say this is there are vicious programs that use number attack, letter attack, word attack and more to try and hack your password but none can guess passwords when you use periods to break up the word. Good for making wireless router passwords too. Next Install grub to the Mbr when asked. Another option for new Linux users is to dual boot windows and MX Linux. You can read the windows files with Linux but windows can't read Linux file systems. So you can access all your windows files while running MX Linux. You would need to install NTFS 3G. Easy to install using synaptic package manager.If you wanted to dual boot instead of wiping off windows you would use gparted to shrink the windows partition as small as possible. Leave about 5gb free space when shrinking the windows partition. The create the root,swap and home partitions. Sometimes there are too many partitions. You can only have 4 primary partitions. If that happens make all the free space into a logical partition. A logical partition can be divided into as many logical partitions as you may need or want.When installing grub choose to install grub to MBR for windows and MX Linux. You will see when and where to do all these things during the install.Logical partitions can be formatted to whatever file system you prefer. Take my advice and format home and root as ext4.That should be enough to get you on the right track.Use MX tools to install the video codecs you will need in order to watch store bought DVDs.You can go to the place to download MX Linux by clicking the next blue line DistroWatch.com: MX Linux Enjoy the freedom of MX Linux!
