            "answer_text": "Generally No, but there is a easy chance to make it work. I\u2019ll only focus on Physical SIM cards for this questions. Here are the restrictions Size - Mini, Micro or Nano. Now the good news is that basic circuit is the same so it\u2019s just the size difference which is irrelevant on how it performs. So you can either cut it or install an in-expensive SIM jacket to adjust the size accordingly.Phone compatibility - Though your carrier may say that the phone is incompatible there is a chance it\u2019ll still work unless it\u2019s locked. New phones support lot of bands & there may be limitation in usage but for average consumer they won\u2019t even notice the difference.Lock - Generally at time of activation, SIMs are activated on a specific SIM Card, but apart from that, there isn\u2019t any issue. We at Most Secure and Private Cellphone Plan however have implemented an advanced protection that triggers a redflag if the SIM Card is removed from phone it was registered unless notified to us before hand.",

            "answer_text": "No. Some phones takes only nano sim, some take micro sim and the rest take regular ones. Some phones do not support bands used in certain countries and can be used only in the country where they are sold. Some phones do not support bands used by few carriers. GSM phones do not support CDMA sim and vice versa; some phones accept both. Some phones are locked to the carrier from whom you purchased and cannot be used with a sim from another carrier. ",

            "answer_text": "These days - almost certainly. Previously, most handsets were sold \u2018tied\u2019 to a particular network. You could swap the SIM card IF it was on the same network (for example 3 Mobile) - but you could\u2019t put (say) an O2 card in a 3 Mobile phone. You had to take it to a phone shop and pay a (extortionate) \u2018fee\u2019 for having the phone unlocked. These days it\u2019s different. Mobiles (here in the UK at least) are sold \u2018unlocked\u2019 - in that they\u2019ll accept any SIM that physically fits the slot in the handset. ",

            "answer_text": "I\u2019m pretty sure, yes it should work. However there are a few things you need to know: If you were switching from iPhone to iPhone, as Michael Jones said, it should work. The SIM card sizes are the same. It only goes down to whether the phone you\u2019re transferring the SIM card to is locked, on the same carrier as the SIM card, or if it\u2019s unlocked. However, if you\u2019re transferring it to another device apart from iPhone (i.e. Android (Samsung, Google, LG, Moto, etc.), Windows Phone), then you may have a bit of trouble. First you have to make sure the SIM sizes are the same. Then you can worry about whether: The second phone is locked on a specific carrier that is not the same carrier as the SIM card - Will not work The second phone is locked on a specific carrier that IS on the same carrier as the SIM card - will work The second phone is unlocked - generally will work. Again some phones may not follow these exact lines, and have different rules, but this is the general idea ",
