            "answer_text": "I am eligible to answer this question since I used this laptop for one and half year. I brought the HP model hp pavilion 15-au114tx 15.6 inch , i5 , 8 gigs ram and 4 gigs graphic card priced at around \u20b965,000(910$). For the same price I could opt for some cheaper models like Acer or Asus something like that. It was fine for the first six months but then the hinges began to crack due to poor manufacturing and the battery for this price was builtin which again is a cons if you face any battery problem. I study in a college where most people use laptops. Few of my friends who brought the same edition suffered from the same hinge problem as mine. Though it is just slightly compact as compared to dell I feel dell is quite strong in its body and atleast better when compared to this. The screen of this bloody laptop vibrates when I switch on the fan. Just coz this is a flop model hp even stopped manufacturing it and now ever the slightest repair costs us extra charges for getting repair parts from hell. I don't know why such huge companies experiment on people for their shit. The money which I spent is no less and I think if it's life time is less than the one like Asus or pretty cheap companies better go for them. Check apple, atleast they have a very fine and well tested furbished model which is good though pricy. HP coustomer care services are even worse I am telling you trust me better go for something which prioritises customer satisfaction. If you feel I am just bitching about this company , just ask by yourself to the people who use HP wether they would go by HP laptop again?  Just go with the one which is well tested before spending a lot of bucks! ",

            "answer_text": "first of all don\u2019t take me wrong but your question should be phrased as \u201cIs a Hp laptop reliable\u201d not an. Now to the main point, I have been using HP laptop and I have downloaded many files from unsecure servers too and also I have been handling it rough but it has not had any signs of damage and also I downloaded heavy duty games and it still was able to function with the same speed. I am giving you an advice, don\u2019t save any files in the desktop i have not saved any files in the desktop from the moment I bought it and even if the downloaded file gets saved in the desktop move it to local disk d or e but not to c(i will come to that point) and then delete it from desktop. Also saving any files in local disk c would slow the laptop and i have experimented it. My sister had a HP laptop and downloaded a lot of movies and other stuff and saved it in the desktop, now it is ridiculously slow, my relative did the same thing and theirs too is really slow. I have downloaded a lot of games and files as much as my sister but didn\u2019t save them in the desktop and now my laptop is as fast as it as before nothing is slowing down. Final tip is that delete the files as soon as you have finished your work with it, try to do this for most of the files which you think are not important. Then delete it from the recycle bin too as it takes space for keeping the deleted files. ",
