            "answer_text": "According to the opinions of some average, run-of-the mill Estonians: We\u00b4re too small (a nation of 1.3 million people can definitely be considered tiny). Everybody is everybody\u00b4s uncle\u00b4s ex-wife\u00b4s daughter\u00b4s classmate\u00b4s\u2026somebody. This means lots and lots of of semi-hidden nepotism and people having to be really careful about having and expressing their personal opinions and thoughts (lest there would be backlash).We consider ourselves to be a depressed and negative people (but we find we can blame the \u201cdark season of darkness\u201d that lasts basically from October to April. All kaamos, no hygge makes an Estonian a dull Estonian or something.).We do not feel the sense of belonging together, as people, as a nation. Personally, I\u00b4d argue against that - but I\u00b4m surrounded by a wonderful, friendly community - and I\u00b4ve seen plenty of intelligent, good people being aghast at theirs.Instead of equality, we seem to be heading towards more poverty and inequality, especially concerning vulnerable people (single parents, senior citizens et al.).I\u00b4d also like to point out that we\u00b4re apparently ranking 1st in the world concerning deaths from drug use, alcohol and hypertension. Being a tiny nation, we really shouldn\u00b4t be performing or own rendition of Dumb Ways to Die, but there you are. ",

            "answer_text": "There is an interesting Quoresque (read: grotesque) problem in Estonia. I was once told that Chairman Mao had a brief period when he encouraged his colleagues and countrymen to have opinions. Honest criticism was welcome and necessary to make China better. Then the colleagues and countrymen with opinions died. People with opinions aren\u2019t killed in Estonia (I think), but the whole process works like this: Please give us your opinions! We love opinions! People should have more opinions! Let\u2019s participate. Yippiiii!Your opinions are not correct. You have a difficult character. You are a psychopath and a Nazi. You are also weird. Why do you write stuff on Quora? Are you mentally unstable? Go and see someone and take your medication. In a padded cell.So there is no real life Quora in Estonia. I have noticed that most Estonians are quite reluctant to tell other people what they think. They are very smart. They want to avoid unpleasant attacks because their opinions might be wrong. ",
