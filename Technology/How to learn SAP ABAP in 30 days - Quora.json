            "answer_text": "Why 30 days read it in 1 day or less via the below link ABAP - Keyword Documentation - ABAP Keyword Documentation. The purpose of learning a new technology is to unlearn the unnecessary things and load new stuff into your brain. You have to make it a habit for atleast 40 days continuously to be comfortable with the tool and rest is practice. Dont put deadlines of 30 or so to learn a new tool in order to get a job. If you really want to learn it in 30 days , you will have to spend atleast 12 hours to get where you want to go. Attend a mandatory traininig and practice it for atleast 3 months. No deviation no distraction no social media. Once you have done 100 days of learning and practice, now you are free to learn anything like oops,adobeforms,ui5,hana,sd or mm. ABAP is a vast area and had to be given enough time to sink in the subject. This is because ABAP is not just a programming language and you will not have any code marathons in it . SAP is an ERP and it is all about business. You dont actually have to understand business as an entity for starters but you have to understand that you are here to support ON GOING BUSINESS SMOOTHLY . You will understand what I said after your basic training. Hope I have answered some and confused enough to generate more doubts. Cheers and happy job hunt. ",

            "answer_text": "You can learn the concepts in SAP ABAP within 30 days but not language. Any programming language will take some amount of time. If you are fresh to programming, atleast will take 3\u20135 years to be expert ( still depends on your logical skills ). If you have atleast experience in any procedural programming language, will take 1\u20133 years. There is no shortcuts.. ",
