            "answer_text": "My best guess is that there would be some chaos shortly after, and huge amounts of lost data. But since many government stuff is shielded against EMPs (feel free to correct me if I'm wrong in this), efforts to repair the network would soon kick off, and everything would be up and running again sooner or later. Unless it turns out the financial sector didn't have any safe backups of their data, and nobody knows what money belongs to who anymore. That could put an end to public order, resulting in massive riots as people tried to gather food and other supplies. The governments might be able to regain control by deploying their armies, but this scenario would cause enormous world-wide damage, especially in well-developed countries. Just imagine what you would do if you heard all money was gone suddenly... ",
