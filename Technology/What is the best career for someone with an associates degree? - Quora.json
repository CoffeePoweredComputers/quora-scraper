            "answer_text": " You are probably going to need post-secondary education to get a job that will make you financially self-sufficient in America today. Making the right decision about that education is really important. Reaching that conclusion is difficult. There is a powerful clique in the US that incessantly hammers home the credo that there is \u201conly one way to succeed\u2014college.\u201d Not only are these people and organizations wrong, they are destroying our education systems. \u201cThe true ratio of jobs in our economy is 1:2:7. For every occupation that requires a master\u2019s degree or more, two professional jobs require a university degree, and there are over a half a dozen jobs requiring a 1-year certificate or a 2-year degree, and each of these technicians is in very high-skilled areas in high demand.\u201d Dr. Kevin Fleming \u201c(RE)Defining the Goal: The True Path to Career Readiness in the 21st Century\u201d Just like graduating from a four-year college with a bachelor\u2019s degree, earning an associate\u2019s degree can have a widely varying outcome economically. In either event you may end up working at Starbucks for $9/hour. (The good news is that if you went to community college, you don\u2019t have (average) $35,000 in debt.) Community college is an inexpensive gateway to hundreds of great careers. Here\u2019s my favorite MARKETABLE associate\u2019s degree: I live two miles from a community college. They have a certificate called Industrial Maintenance. If you earn that certificate you are in the running to get a full time job making $18.50/hour. If you layer that certificate with robotics, to complete an Associate\u2019s degree, you can make $25/hour while traveling the world installing and maintaining robots.  There are some drawbacks: You will have to go to school four semesters.You might have to pay as much as $10,000. (However some of the classes are free\u2014government grants.)You aren\u2019t going to make many friends. (The classes have 3\u20134 students because everyone else is going to a four-year college to take the History of Rock and Roll.)The school has no football team.The key, whether you are going to a four-year college or a community college, is MARKETABILITY. Forget all the crap you are going to hear about \u201cfind your passion.\u201d You can\u2019t eat passion\u2014unless, of course, it is chocolate. Note: It is common on Quora to hear young people whining about student loan debt and \u201cwhy isn\u2019t college free?\u201d Half of those kids would have been better off going to CC rather than majoring in psychology at South Podunk U.

Not having a degree in that field is OK, but at least you have a degree you can put down. That still shows that you have commitment and that is a must in any job. Besides, not all, but a lot of employers will offer a program where you can get a degree to grow with that company, and they have What no one at all tells us when we are looking at college\u2019s is, Choose what fits you, not what fits the \u201cMold\u201d of \u201cNormal\u201d.
