            "answer_text": "Eh\u2026 Personally, I would say doing either one exclusively was a mistake. The only reason Apple was forced to choose was because they undercut the size of an already below average battery capacity. If they had increased the capacity again, and made a larger then normal jump, they could fairly reasonably be said to have the power budget for both. Of course, that bit isn't ours as consumers to control. As a North American, and more specifically as a Canadian and a gamer, 5G is, as it stands currently, pointless for me. To be frank, I will be replacing whatever phone I replace my current one with before 5G holds relevance in my country ( and even then, were mostly only expecting to get the lower end bands due to range and cost issues). And of course, I am a gamer. To me, any refresh rate boost is a glorious thing. So to me in the market I occupy, it was the wrong call. But I also am not the target demographic of the iPhone, I am not living in a priority sales market for Apple ( which consist of the US, UK, France, China and Japan), or am an active user of iOS devices. So do with that what you will. ",
