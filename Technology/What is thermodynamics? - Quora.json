            "answer_text": "Thermodynamics is a branch of physics concerned with heat and temperature and their relation to energy and work. As Puneet Jain , Owen Zhang  and Ankesh Kumar Singh  have already explained it in a very nice way, I would like to touch different aspects of the subject.  Thermodynamics stands apart from all other disciplines in physics as the only discipline in which we can understand the fundamental laws on an intuitive basis. Thermodynamics can explain more things about the world around us than all of the other physical theories. For instance-  Why heat flows from hot to cold bodies?Why the air becomes thinner and colder at higher altitudes?Why the Sun appears yellow whereas colder stars appear red and hotter stars appear bluish-white?Why it is impossible to measure a temperature below -273*C ?Why there is a maximum theoretical efficiency of a power generation unit which can never be exceeded no matter what the design?Why high mass stars must ultimately collapse to form black-holes?How has human evolution changed over time? ....and much more.Thermodynamics is a discipline with an exceptionally wide range of applicability. It would be pretty hard to define 'perpetual motion machine'(a thermodynamical term) for a biologist. In an attempt to get back the lost pride, He/She might ask for the definition of a 'living being'. Assuming that you are a student of thermodynamics with no prior idea of biology, you would most likely go like this-  '' An arrangement of differentiated sub-systems striving to perform a complex work through a number of independent functions for a finite period of time while maintaining a state of low entropy.'' That's the beauty of thermodynamics!  You never run out of words.

The first time you go through it, you don't understand it at all. The second time you go through it, you think you understand it, except for one or two small points. The third time you go through it, you know you don't understand it, but by then you are so used to it, it doesn't bother you any more.\"                                                                                                   Arnold Sommerfield According to the second law of thermodynamics, you're supposed to share your hotness with me.

            "answer_text": "Thermodynamics is the study of the transformation of energy from one form to another. It is generally based upon macroscopic quantities such as the volume, pressure, and temperature of a given system. Thermodynamics is a beautiful and immensely powerful theoretical approach to understand and quantify transformations of energy and matter. It is a core subject in Physical Chemistry and a solid understanding of thermodynamics is pretty much essential for any branch of physics, physical chemistry, materials science, mechanical engineering, and chemical engineering. It is not a subject that you can simply learn once and immediately master (at least not for me!). I\u2019ve taught graduate and undergraduate thermo for 20 yrs and I\u2019m still surprised by its subtilties. There are three Laws of Thermodynamics. The First Law is simply a statement of accounting, that the total energy of the system + environment is conserved. More precisely, it says that in order to change the total energy of a system you either need to do work, add heat, or change the size of the system: [math]dU = \\delta q + \\delta w = TdS - pdV + \\mu dN[/math] Note that the + before [math]\\delta w[/math] denotes work done ON the system as opposed to work done BY the system. Different texts and authors use + or - and you need to be aware of this\u2026especially since professors like me tend to slip this issue into exam questions. The fall back is to always think about the answer you just computed! The Second Law concerns a quantity called Entropy. This is probably the most confusing concept in thermodynamics. Broadly, it states that the total entropy can never decrease over time for an isolated system. Mathematically, we can see from the 1st law, that for an isolated system at constant volume, we have that [math]\\delta q = TdS[/math], i.e that [math]S = \\delta q/T[/math] . That is to say that the change in entropy (at const. V) for a reversible process is the heat added to the system divided by the temperature at which it is added. This can be generalized to irreversible processes (Clausius inequality) which is to say that for a cyclic process [math]\\oint \\frac{dq}{T} \\le 0[/math] The equality holds for a reversible process since S is a state function and changes in S depend upon only the initial and final state and not the pathway. Note that the Second Law also defines (precisely) the temperature of a system as [math]T = \\left(\\frac{\\partial U}{\\partial S}\\right)_{V,N}[/math] The Third Law is often stated that for a system at equilibrium the entropy of a perfect crystal at absolute zero of temperature is exactly zero. This statement (like the Second Law) has been revised and revisited over the past 150 yrs. ",
