If you saw many at once, you were probably seeing a cluster of Elon Musk\u2019s SpaceX \u201cStarLink\u201d communication satellites. They\u2019re launched in batches of 60 per rocket, and gradually spread out over time to their assigned orbits. refs: Starlink - Wikipedia and Starlink ",

What you saw were UFOs. That is you couldn\u2019t identify them. Possibilities include planes, helicopters, balloons and satellites. ",
