            "answer_text": "It\u2019s vital. Science and technology are everywhere around us in the world \u2014 in my computer science presentations I often point out that it\u2019s hard to buy a combine for a farm that doesn\u2019t come with the tech to drive itself around the field making its own algorithmic choices to maximize yield. And understanding how things work, at least at a basic chemistry and physics level, is key. But as Tony Histbook also points out, those can\u2019t exist in a vacuum. A major aim of school is indeed to prepare students for future careers in the world of work, but another is to make informed, active citizens out of them. You can\u2019t do that without a grounding in the language arts, without a solid appreciation of social studies, etc. One of the most important resources to our education system, one that people tend to overlook, is time. Kansas, where I live and work, actually has one of the longest mandated school years at 1116 hours grades 1\u201311. Yet that\u2019s all you have: 1116 hours. Sounds like a lot, but it\u2019s really not all that much if you insist on teaching literature, writing, history, science, math, computers, tech, cursive, driving a stick shift, home ec, and everything else somebody thinks is important. At lower grades take out home ec and driving but replace with cursive, shoe-tying, and everything else the parents don\u2019t have time to teach. So\u2026science and tech\u2026absolutely, a vital part of the curriculum. Just like all the other vital parts. ",

            "answer_text": "It is impossible to disagree, at this point in time, that there is no use of technology in education. In fact, technology is often used in school, but many people happen to skim over those relatively minor uses. Here are some of those, although there are countless more: 1. A tool for students to use in class - Many students are not able to afford laptops or iPads for themselves. Even if they are, many are not able to bring those devices to school. Because of technological advancements that have allowed those devices to become more prevalent, smaller, and cheaper, schools can utilize the technology. Therefore, schools and teachers can purchase computers or tablets for the use of the students. Devices like these become extremely useful for research, but also for class discussion (both of which I\u2019ll get to in a bit). 2. Services like Google Classroom (School to Home connection) - Technology often helps bridge the productivity gap between home and school. For example, homework no longer has to be exclusively physical since it can be assigned digitally through programs like Google Classroom. In addition, Classroom can administer tests or quizzes to the student while they are at home or at school. 3. Studying - Along with an exponential increase in homework and overall school difficulty recently, there has been an increase of digital programs that are meant to help students study for upcoming assignments. An example is Quizlet. Quizlet helps with creating study sets, or combinations of terms and definitions, for the user to go over. It mainly represents the transfusion of education and technological productivity because the new technology is able to aid the student advance their education. 4. Kahoot.it - Kahoot is a service that allows teachers to create small quizzes for the members of a class to take together. As I said earlier, technology is helping to connect the students to the class and aid in class discussions. Kahoot uses a mobile device to enable the students to take those mini-quizzes and learn more in class. 5. School to Home Communication - There\u2019s one thing that Google Classroom lacks - and that\u2019s a dedicated connection, communication-wise, between school and home. Since it is considered inappropriate for a student to directly communicate with his or her students, Remind was created. Remind acts as a buffer app that allows the teachers to send messages to students and for students to ask for help. Incidentally, Remind can act through the normal messaging app anyway. Either way, technology can help educate students outside of school as well. 6. Databases - Without database software, schools would be a huge hassle to run. For example, the school I attend uses an integrated program to manage grades and attendance together so it is not too hard for them to manage. Physically writing names, grades, and attendance would be extremely difficult for the school to manage, so database software is much more efficient. 7. Researching - For almost every level of education, from primary to college-level, researching is a must. Technology has allowed people to utilize the internet to spread information and find research, which is essential to an unbiased and wholesome education. 8. VR - As I wrote about in a another answer, VR also helps in education. For example, a High School group is using VR to create a virtual lab to help educate people that can\u2019t access or don\u2019t wish to physically access certain chemicals. 9. Test-Taking - Taking tests on quizzes not only saves paper and time but also tends to be more adaptable. Online tests allow the computer to change the difficulty of the test, edit the question order, and more. This helps prevent cheating and is also useful for diagnostic tests like NWEA MAP or practice tests. 10. Google Drive - Cloud services are useful to education, even more so than Google Drive, because they are dedicated platforms for the students to bring digital assignments home or to school. In addition, the \u201cshare\u201d feature also allows students to turn in assignments.  In conclusion, the collision of Education and Technology are essentially benefiting from and promoting each other. ",

Science isn\u2019t just about learning already established facts and laws, it\u2019s about teaching the scientific method. Even if a person chooses to be a plumber or a pastry chef, being able to think like a scientist will make them really good plumbers and chefs. Though you\u2019ve only stated \u201ctechnology\u201d it might be safe to assume you are referring to information technology. Which, just like any technology, including the blackboard, is just the latest set of tools and education aids. The world in which today\u2019s students will eventually graduate into is full of technology. Combined with a good grounding in science, they will use existing technologies to shape the next technologies. ",

Therefore, as a parent, you must ensure that your kids get the right technological exposure in school, starting at the primary level. If you are planning to shift to Malaysia, the top international schools in Kuala Lumpur take science and technology seriously, regardless of the school level. Credible academic institutions follow an LMS or Learning Management System for promoting an age-appropriate educational plan. Therefore, your child gets to learn the basic and even advanced concepts of science and technology as a part of a holistic study module. Finally, the meticulous implementation of science and technology also helps whet the innovative, creative, and decision-making expertise of students. As a parent, if you want to ensure the all-round development of your child, consider enrolling him or her into an academic curriculum, bolstered by the scientific fractions. ",

I\u2019m paraphrasing what she said because I thought it was so insightful. Teaching science and technology in education is very important. HOWEVER teaching kids to think about, become smart consumers, and apply what they learn is even more important! Just having kids read about STEM topics and regurgitate facts isn\u2019t at all adequate. The world desperately needs people who can think through and come up with solutions based on what they know about STEM. Creativity, critical thinking, solutions design, etc must also be taught. ",

The leaping advancement of technology alone is not just amazing or mind boggling but a sure sign of the future to be. Science and math are the foundation of developing the advancement and sustainability of technology so its studies are not only essential but crucial. However, while many admire and apply technology the essential keys to math, science and technology are not found in thses three subjects but in the every day study and use of the basic language, English. Without knowing how to read, write and speak the language well in all of its forms makes for a sorry and often disappointing results in science, math and technology. ",
