            "answer_text": "A2A In terms of a practical answer, I can\u2019t do better than several of the other responses. But since you asked me personally, I\u2019ll give a deep philosophical answer. Pretty much everything is \u201cworth\u201d whatever you can trade it for. A shilling is a historical monetary unit. It\u2019s not actively used as currency today, so there\u2019s no exchange rate chart. It doesn\u2019t translate into dollars or euros according to a common formula. If you\u2019re holding a shilling coin, you can try to sell it. If someone wants to buy it, you can discuss the matter and perhaps reach a mutually agreeable price. You only really learn what the coin was \u201cworth\u201d in that one transaction. There may have been someone else who would have offered to pay you more than you actually received. So if you sell a shilling coin to some guy you meet in a bar for $20, it was worth $20. The fact that the guy at the bar might know a lot about coin collecting, and recognized your specific coin as being more valuable to someone else, doesn\u2019t change what the coin was worth to YOU. You didn\u2019t know. So you got what it was worth. In common speech, when someone asks what something is worth, they usually mean to ask for an estimate of what it could be sold for. Until it\u2019s sold, you just don\u2019t actually know that. ",

            "answer_text": "A shilling or a pound would be worth whatever the market will carry. The British pound in no way can be considered equal to the US dollar; they are two different currencies with two different values. So a shilling (no longer used) or a pound's cost in American money is all dependent on the exchange rate which is in constant flux. You should ask your local (US) numismatist about the price he would charge for a shilling coin, or a pound note or coin. The dates are of vital importance . A shilling was 12 pence, but the shilling coin became 5 new pence or p. Pence refers to amounts, pennies to actual coins. A UK 'dollar' was 5 shillings 5/- (a crown if it was one coin), and half a dollar was half a crown 2/6. I think we do it on purpose... As well as dates being important, condition 1. If you are asking what a shilling represents fractionally: A shilling was originally 5% of a pound. As an analogy I suppose you could say that therefore it would be analogous to a nickle (5 cents). 2. If you are asking \"how much can I sell a shilling for .\u201d The value of a shilling is worth whatever market price someone who deals with foreign coinage or collector\u2019s coins are willing to pay for it. The old UK currency was 12 pence to the shilling, 20 shillings to the pound. Where had a currency of 13 pence to the shilling and in fact issued coins inscribed 1/13 of a shilling. ",
