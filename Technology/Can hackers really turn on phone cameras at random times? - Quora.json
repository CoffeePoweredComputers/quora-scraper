            "answer_text": "There was a real case in a nearby town where a school administrator was watching students when they were at home, in bed, by using their laptops (not smartphones) camera.  I also know that the feds (in the US) can turn on your phone's microphone remotely and eavesdrop.   (Edit: I originally said I didn't actually know about the camera).  A cell phone camera can be easily hacked.  One way is for you to install a malicious app, possibly disguised as a game or something useful.  The app may even ask permission to use your camera, but nobody bothers about those permissions so that is it.  Once installed the app does what it wants to do. There is a simple solution to keeping your camera private (and it works for laptops also):  cover the camera lens with a band aid.  Remove the band aid to take a picture. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, it's called cyber espionage (spying). An intruder can access and turn on anything on your cellphone once the cellphone has been compromised. Fear of being watched, put electrical tape on the camera lens on the selfie side. To prevent eavesdropping put in airplane mode, mute or virbrate. Use a app lock with a pattern for the password. Make sure the settings are to hide the patterns that is used to access apps. Make sure the protection app has limited to no permissions for you to have control over the intstalled app. ",

            "answer_text": "I'd say 'possible, but extremely improbable'.  To get control of the camera, there would need to be a program running on your phone which can control it. If you've only installed apps from either Apple's App Store, or Google Play, then it's extremely unlikely, though not impossible, that you've installed a program like that. If you're installing applications from other sources, then it's somewhat more likely that there could be some malicious software in there, but still very rare. If you're concerned, you could do a factory reset on your phone (and lose all data!), and then re-install your apps, but basically don't install anything from outside an App Store. ",

If you didn't install any apk outside a legitimate store (Play store), it's less probable that a \"malicious\" code will turn on camera. But as I'm always saying - no technology is \"bulletproof\" from 0-days, and therefore if you want to be 100% safe, you should physicaly hide your camera. ",

There is probably other methods but ratting is one of the most popular ways to gain access to other peoples computers.  ",
