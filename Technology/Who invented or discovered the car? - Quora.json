            "answer_text": "Unlike so many other great developments, no one man can claim credit for inventing the automobile. It has reached its present state of perfection as the result of a great many ideas contributed thru the years. For all practical purposes, the first land vehicle that was self-propelled with an engine was built in 1769 by a Frenchman named Nicholas Cugnot. It was a cumbersome three-wheeled cart with a steam engine and an enormous boiler. It could travel 3 miles an hour and had to be refueled every 15 miles!  In 1789, an American called Oliver Evans received the first United States patent for a self-propelled carriage. It was a four-wheeled wagon and had a paddle wheel at the rear so that it could operate either on land or in the water. It weighed 21 tons!  For nearly 80 years afterward, other men continued to experiment with powered carriages for use on roads. Most of them were steam, although a few were electrically driven and had to carry large batteries. Then, in the 1880's came two inventions that were to result in the automobile as we know it today. One was the development of the gasoline engine. The other was the invention of the pneumatic, or air-filled, tire.  The first gasoline-powered car was on the road in 1887 by Gottlieb Daimler, a German. In the United States, two brothers, Frank and Charles Duryea, built the first successful American gasoline automobile in 1892. Their machine was described as \u201ca horseless buggy.\" As a matter of fact, all the early American automobiles that were to follow were really buggies! Nobody attempted to design a completely different kind of vehicle. All they did was add a gasoline engine to the buggies and a connecting belt or chain to drive the rear wheels.  It was only after automobiles began to run successfully that attention was turned to making them stronger and more comfortable. Car-makers soon found that the flimsy construction of buggies was not suitable for use in automobiles. Gradually, the familiar form of the automobile as we know it today began to emerge. Engines were removed from under the seats and placed in front. Stronger wheels replaced the spindly bicycle and carriage wheels. Steering wheels replaced \"tillers.\u201d Finally, steel was used instead of wood to make stronger frames and our modern automobile became a reality. ",

            "answer_text": "This question does not have a straightforward answer. The history of the automobile is very rich and dates back to the 15th century when Leonardo da Vinci was creating designs and models for transport vehicles.   There are many different types of automobiles - steam, electric, and gasoline - as well as countless styles. Exactly who invented the automobile is a matter of opinion. If we had to give credit to one inventor, it would probably be Karl Benz from Germany. Many suggest that he created the first true automobile in 1885/1886. Below is a table of some automobile firsts, compiled from information in Leonard Bruno's book Science and Technology Firsts (Detroit, c1997) and About.com's History of the Automobile.Nicolas-Joseph Cugnot (1725-1804) 1769 STEAM / Built the first self propelled road vehicle (military tractor) for the French army: three wheeled, 2.5 mph. France Robert Anderson 1832-1839 ELECTRIC / Electric carriage. Scotland Karl Friedrich Benz (1844-1929) 1885/86 GASOLINE / First true automobile. Gasoline automobile powered by an internal combustion engine: three wheeled, Four cycle, engine and chassis form a single unit. Gottlieb Wilhelm Daimler (1834-1900) and Wilhelm Maybach (1846-1929) 1886 GASOLINE / First four wheeled, four-stroke engine- known as the \"Cannstatt-Daimler.\" Germany George Baldwin Selden (1846-1922) 1876/95 GASOLINE / Combined internal combustion engine with a carriage: patent no: 549,160 (1895). Never manufactured -- Selden collected royalties. United States Charles Edgar Duryea (1862-1938) and his brother Frank (1870-1967) 1893 GASOLINE / First successful gas powered car: 4hp, two-stroke motor. The Duryea brothers set up first American car manufacturing company. United States   ",
