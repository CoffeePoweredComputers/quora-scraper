            "answer_text": "As obvious as it may sound, a good video conference room is one that works with all the different platforms that the people you will be talking to use. The reason is that there are hundreds of software services out there that make video codecs that only work within their own bubble. There are others that may also work with Skype or others that only work with Cisco but very few that work with all. If you only need to video call people in your own organization, any of those solutions may be fine because you control the infrastructure but to talk to vendors and customers you need to have something that works with multiple platforms. Zoom, Bluejeans, Webex and starleaf are some of the services that usually work well with others including the traditional codecs from Cisco, Polycom and Lifesize. Out of the bunch, Zoom is definitely one to consider. It has better support for other platforms than some of the other ones and it has good video quality, it\u2019s easy to use and it has a good price. You will need more than the software, however, if you are trying to outfit a room to handle video calls. You will need speakers, microphones, a display and a camera at the very least. For small rooms of 4 people or less, logitech has small packages that include the microphone and camera and you can get a display with built in speakers and that may suffice. For larger conference rooms you want to consider more professional equipment. Keep in mind that even in a video call the most important thing is the quality of the audio and if the room doesnt have proper microphones the experience will be poor. You can contact an Audio Video Integrator like us to help with the design and the setup. It is easy to under do or over do a video conference room and it is usually not worth the time and frustration. ",

            "answer_text": "Video conferencing services are an increasingly important communication tool for businesses of all sizes, allowing team members or stake holders in different locations to meet \"face to face\" with high-definition video and audio feeds. It's not only for face-to-face communication; video conferencing software makes easier, but it also makes actual collaboration easier. Team members can work together in real time, using tools to help them brainstorm and hash out ideas together. Features like screen sharing, whiteboarding and presenter swapping all contribute to an environment that breeds new ideas and solutions, rather than just discussion. The best video conferencing solutions make communicating with team members and customers across the world an easy process. Best video conference rooms which you can use are Webex, Polycom, R-HUB HD video conferencing servers, Avaya etc. ",
