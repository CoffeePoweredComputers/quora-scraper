            "answer_text": "Well the 11 Pro Max is bigger, with a bigger screen. That alone makes it better or worse depending on how you feel about big phones (seriously). The 12 Pro is better in basicly every other way, and the 12 not Pro wouldn\u2019t have the telephoto lens, but is otherwise better. Specifically the 11-not Pro had a not-as-good screen as the 11-Pro, the 12-not-Pro does have a screen as good. However while there are a ton of things the 12 is better at, they tend to be small (20% faster CPU is great\u2026but the 11\u2019s CPU is already very fast, will you notice an extra 20%?; the 12 is 4x more drop resistant, or at least the front glass is, do you drop your phone a lot?; 5G is mostly carrier hype, but it is a little faster/lower latency then good LTE, would you notice? \u2026and many more) Oh, the 12 looks different, more like the iPhone 4/5 design. I really really like that look & new color, but that is a personal choice, maybe you don\u2019t. \u2026but really? Given how close those phones are I would say the real way to decide which on is better for any particular person is how much they like the physical size. ",

            "answer_text": "Hey Shashikumar ,thanks for the A2A Brother, you know that Apple launches new devices like iphones , watches , ipads , each year. So iPhone 12 pro is no exception . They launched pro 11 this year next year pro 12 next to next year pro 13 . Like wise wvry year we will have new iphones 12,13,14 15\u2026\u2026\u2026infinity (as numbers are infinity ) with this ideology of impending sale is not beneficial at all . Like wise you might be stuck on iphone generation 1 and waiting each year like \u201coh iphone 10 this year no buy next year the iphone 11 ,then iphone 11 this year ,next year iphone 12 ) till you get old See we need to upgrade yourself with newer technology every one-two years. Maybe the next year the iphone 12 never comes , maybe some catastrophe happens and apple seizes to exist . You just not have that regret if not buying it when it was time . It I just a joke , sorry. But point is if you actually desire to buy the iphone 11 pro go for it dont wait for newer iphones . As a stat say any device is actually as fresh in the market till atleast 2-3years .or more in the case of apple . Moreover the trend of apple shows that there is no major difference or a revolutionary technology brought out by the apple since the launch of apple XS MAX . except some tweaks in the camera and some betterccscreen technology. So this will be the trend in the coming time as well . However if you are talking about from budget point of few then this will actually be a big brain time , as the next year iphone 12 will launch and the proce of iphone 11 will tumble . However , iphone 12 is rumored to be 5g . Brother 5g. In india we are not able to completely use the capable expanses of 4g talking of 5g . But the iPhone 11 will never support 5g. It is only till 4g . So waiting for iphone 12 will only be a waste of time if you ask me . Surely prices will drop the next year . But unless there are no budget constraint I believe in go for to buy the iPhone 11. Dont wait for next year as we are not sure about the iPhone 12 . If you have some suggestion /question comments is always open. Peace Arigato Upvote if you want to ",
