            "answer_text": "Luckily i had a bad experience with whitehat jr. And ended up in a much better way.. So i called whitehat jr and organised a free lesson for my son to see how it goes When the lesson started the instructor was not really teachin my son, rather she was only kind of ordering him what to do without giving him the chance to think or even make mistakes by himself to learn or conclude things, Nevertheless we agreed to go on with the classes and i requested that they call me next day in the afternoon so we can do the registration coz i got busy. They agreed, and we hanged up .. 5 minutes later someone from whitht jr is calling me i told him i was busy and that they should call me next day at 12pm as instructed by me 5 min ago. Nextday they called me at 7am then at 9am then i felt they are forcing it at me, they called at 12 and i didnt answer coz i was not really in the mood after all .. so they called my wife, and she asked them not to do that, they called her again asking why i dont answer .. it was horrible, i never said no to them i wanted to wait and see if they ever respect my time .. they kept stalkin me for 2 weeks they offered huge discounts from $400 to $300 to $200 to $120 and they kept sayin that my son is very smart and he got a scholorship thats why they give me a discount, i felt there is something suspecious about them eventhough they are legit, but the fact that they instructrd my son all the way for 1 hour without giving him a chance to think made me conclude that they ll just continue doing that and my son will follow the instruction brainlessely. He wont be learning anything! \u2026 i dont like to be forced or pushed into somethin so i went to youtube and started researching some other resources and i found here Learn computer science. Change the world. Seriously they have 10 times better excersis and toturial and it starts very simple u can learn it urself while u go through it with ur kid .. its fun game and its free. my advice is to save your money, spend more time with ur children and learn together with them on that site What they are going to learn either in code dot org or in white hatjar is the same, its what is called abstract coding, its not real coding, its coding through playing a game and putting buliding blocks of functions together, kids will learn the basic concepts and the logic behind coding and how to apply loops, create functions and if statments but its building block only, Which brings a very important point i would like to mention for all parents, when u teach ur kids abstract coding it is very hard to convince them to migrate from abstract coding to real coding , which also involve mathmatics most kids would give up, , so parents should be aware of that and introduce simple coding languages such as logo (turtle academy) or html and improve their mathmatical skills along the way ",

            "answer_text": "Update (July 16) At the time of posting the below review on April 16th, I had no clue or expectations on how the review would be considered. After 60k views and 200 upvotes, I think it\u2019s time for an update. Why the Review I wrote it for the same reason anyone would write a review. It is for the reader to make an informed decision. My review was received positively as well as negatively. Those who were positive were kind enough to state that my review has helped them make an informed choice and those who gave negative feedback has stated that I\u2019m doing marketing or WhiteHat Jr is sham or I\u2019m not a real person. About Me I\u2019m a Corporate Employee and this post isn\u2019t sponsored or is neither a marketing sham for WhiteHat. The review is an honest opinion on WhiteHat based on the Trail class my daughter attended two months back. Two Months Later I stand by what I have written below. My daughter continues to enjoy using WhiteHat Jr and the classes. In fact she looks forward to attend these sessions. There have been occasions she has found the course tough and in that cases, we have sought the teachers help. Advice for Parents I often read in the comments about the marketing strategy of WhiteHat. I guess it\u2019s fair to say that every organisation has the right to market their product they want to unless they are misleading. My recommendation is to check if your kid is showing interest in the trail class and whether you liked how the format looks. Don\u2019t expect your kid to make any money or your kid to become a coding vizard. Coding takes time and this is the first step. Keep your expectations real. Original Post I\u2019m literally taken aback by some of the strong negative feedback WHJr has received in this platform so far. I may be too early to comment on the feedback as my 8yr old daughter is in the initial stages of her paid classes. Having said so I have to be mindful of not being drawn into giving overtly praise just because I have paid and have to support the organisation. Before I get into the review of other reviews, let me give you an overview of what WHJr is and how it works. I will then get into some of the criticisms given by disappointed parents. What is White Hat Jr They are an Online learning platform that give 1:1 classes to kids.They have 3 different type of courses that you can sign for. One for 1 class which can ignored, other is for 48 classes and the the last one is for 144 classes.The course fee is based on per class. 48 classes courses are more costly than 144 classes.They conduct these classes on their own Coding platform which, so far ,my kid has absolutely loved. How are the classes conducted?You have to book the class in advance based on your preferred time slot. If you want to change the time slot you can do so 24 hrs prior. It makes sense as you need to give teacher advance notice for them to schedule their day. What happens if it\u2019s last min cancellation? I have no clue.How is their platform? My initial impressions are that they are really good. For the initial classes, which my daughter is still in, its completely image based. This means the child doesn\u2019t have to write the code but drag and drop the code that\u2019s already written.This gives an easy entrance into coding world without having to worry about writing textual bases coding. It can be a disadvantage if your child is already into text based coding.The coding classes are more of game based with point system to encourage the kids to attempt. I haven\u2019t found any fault yet and hope I don\u2019t find any in the near future.What\u2019s their USP? I guess it\u2019s the 1:1 on coaching. An undivided attention the teacher is giving to 1 student. For me, that\u2019s a blessing.The classes can be moulded as per the child\u2019s leaning potential.I have also been provided with a Relationship Manager\u2019s number who, apart from the teacher, is a touch point for any challenges or issues. Since I\u2019m at the initial stages, I haven\u2019t used any of these resources. (Update July 16: I have used the resources and they are have been supportive)Do you need a high speed internet? To be honest I don\u2019t have an idea as my internet plan is of high speed. (Update July 16: A teacher from WhiteHat has mentioned in the comment that the minimum speed required is 15Mbps)I have read parents complaining the need for high speed internet. I recommend that you check during the trial class.Is it mechanical teaching as one parent said? I don\u2019t understand what the parent meant by it. I didn\u2019t find anything mechanical. They follow a pattern during the course and ask the student to follow the steps. It\u2019s the same as any school syllabus.What, as parents, we should understand is that whether your kid liked the session or not. Since my daughter loved the trial session, and I liked their course structure, I decided to go ahead with the paid plan.Do you get a certificate for attending the trail class? Yes, you do and it\u2019s funny. There is nothing of value apart from igniting the passion of the student and of the parent.It\u2019s a neat sales trick, that\u2019s all. I don\u2019t see any harm. They are doing business and the only question you need to ask if they are keen on delivering what they promised. (Update July 16: So far, they are delivering)Does teachers have industry experience? I haven\u2019t enquired as my interest is on whether the teacher can teach or not.I\u2019m a 17yr experience professional Sales Trainer and I can vouch for the fact that top sales people can\u2019t train and top sale trainer\u2019s can\u2019t sell. People are good at their respective jobIf a teacher is able to identify the kid\u2019s talent, that\u2019s all what\u2019s required.I have to wait and see if that happens. If yes, I\u2019m happy. If not, I will stop the session and get the pro rata refund.About other claims of improved focus and stuff While WHJr do claim that kids have improved focus and stuff, I think it\u2019s a by-product of their interest in the class.This can happen even without a coding class. If you put your kid to any activity they love, they will give their undue attention. Have them sit in front of a tab and watch an animation movie, they will pay undue attention. Simple.However, \u2018coding\u2019 develops logical and analytical skills because at the end, they need to know Maths to solve certain issues. Coding is about solving a challenge.Warning - Coding doesn\u2019t make your kid Einstein. They don\u2019t make them Bill Gates or Mark. For that, they need to learn Business.",
