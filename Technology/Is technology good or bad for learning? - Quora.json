            "answer_text": "Yes technology is good for learning. But only for those persons who realy concentrate to learn something. Most of the peoples have nervous habbits while learning something on mobole phones and laptops. Like they think that first i have to check my facebook before studying. And he or she must spend 1to2 hour on facebook. Then after studying a bit we think. I have to listen a song for recreation so that i not tire from study. In this way we waste our most of time in nervous habbits. ",

            "answer_text": "It is definitely helpful, if you know what tools for learning work the best for you. There are a variety of programs that help to maintain the focus, but for those who have serious issues with concentration, it might not be helpful. In short terms, it depends on the person himself/herself as it is a very subjective topic that depends mostly on the personal experience. ",
