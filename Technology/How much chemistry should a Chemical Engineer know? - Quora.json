            "answer_text": "First off, chemical engineering is extremely diverse.  Some chemical engineers work in lab/research environments and rely heavily on chemistry knowledge.  Others work in a plant and deal more in equipment/troubleshooting.  Others work in an office and design plants/technologies.  From a practical standpoint, most non PhD chemical engineers do not need to know advanced chemistry, but there are certain themes in chemistry that will recur over and over again.  These include: vapor pressures (fundamental for distillation), organic chemistry (fundamental in petrochemicals), and reaction mechanics (fundamental for understanding catalyst systems/reactor design).     There is  an 80/20 principle in effect here, and you will probably NEVER need to draw a Lewis Dot diagram.   So the reality is that few engineers will rely exclusively on chemistry.  But that doesn't negate the need to understand it on a deep level - for example, if you are trying to understand why reaction yield is decreasing in a process, you really need to think of fundamental concepts like available reaction sites and endothermic/exothermic temperature requirements.   While your job as an engineer is to provide a solution (often equipment or revamp oriented), you still need to be able to boil down the chemistry problem to it's essence.   Obviously this is something that keeps chemical engineers in high demand.   ",

            "answer_text": "You will be be needing a lot of it.  Your Physical  and organic chemistry knowledge would be tested even from the onset of the program.  Chemical Engineering is basically chemistry with Engineering - pun intended\" This program would require rudimentary chemistry knowledge  to sucessfully navigate the first year -  with a few laboratory works, some mathematics, a bit of electronics, coding  and physics. But, as its progresses the nature of Chemistry work would become technical and advanced,  and will build on your previous knowledge.  Here on, you will deal with  more complex organic structures, terms and  higher degree of stiochiometry with an overdose of organic chemistry : reactions, nature, products and characteristics. Athough at higher levels, Chemistry would become less primal, as there is a shift to a \"mathscentric\" curriculum. It will test your grasp of mathematics as dealing with process,output and rate ofreaction process in courses like  : Mass transfer, Process control, Transport, Fluid Mechnics to Thermodynamics.  But, you will encounter challenges that would  still call on your knowledge of Chemistry : so there is no escaping.  In conclusion, I would say a lot, like about 75% much. Cheers. ",
