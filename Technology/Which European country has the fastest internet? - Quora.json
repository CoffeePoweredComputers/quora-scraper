Lithuania and Latvia would probably be near the top of list of EU countries overall with Vilnius and Riga near the top. Both have extremely good internet. Again without more detail on how precisely you want to define things there are oddly likely some towns/small cities with far better as the data center outside of a city is there etc etc. The Baltics are however quite good.
