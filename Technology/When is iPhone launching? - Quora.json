            "answer_text": "If we talk about the siblings of iPhone 7, Apple followed a set pattern for their release but a few of them were released at completely different time. If apple gonna follow the same cycle as it used for iPhone 5 and 5S, 5C, iPhone 6 and 6 Plus, iPhone 6S we can anticipate that the release date of iPhone 7 will fall sometimes in September 2016. ",
