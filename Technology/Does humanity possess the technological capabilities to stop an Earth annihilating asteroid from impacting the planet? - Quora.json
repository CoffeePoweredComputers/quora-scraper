            "answer_text": "Yes - providing we detect it a LONG time in advance. The problem with something that\u2019s moving SO fast and which weighs SO much - you can\u2019t stop it and you can\u2019t destroy it. So all you can do is to deflect it, so that it misses. Bad Sci Fi movies have the governments of the world launching every nuclear weapon available at it. But this wouldn\u2019t create a reliable force in the right direction to deflect the asteroid\u2026and we know that some asteroids are relatively fragile and might split into multiple smaller asteroids that would be even harder to deflect. So what is needed is a GENTLE force - applied for a long period of time - not just whacking it hard and hoping. What we\u2019ll need to do is to spot the killer asteroid 20 or 30 years before it\u2019s projected impact. Then we can carefully tailor a spacecraft to fly out to the asteroid - and either push gently against it for years - to fly a parallel course alongside it. Doing that would create a very gentle gravitational force between asteroid and spacecraft - which would subtly but VERY precisely adjust it\u2019s course. A change in direction of even a tiny fraction of one degree builds up to an enormous difference in the position of the asteroid decades later - resulting in a safe \u201cMISS\u201d rather than a catastrophic \u201cHIT\u201d. What the world needs is not some pre-built, ready to go, emergency solution to the problem. We need decades of warning. So what is required is a lot of powerful telescopes - and a lot of observers looking through them\u2026and that\u2019s what we actually have! Right now, the experts are fairly certain that they\u2019ve found all of the asteroids that are big enough to cause a global catastrophe anytime within the next 50 years\u2026and none of them are a risk.

            "answer_text": "I doubt it. First, we\u2019d have to detect it \u2014 and if it were dark enough, fast enough, and small or dense enough (kinetic energy is 1/2 the mass times velocity-squared), we wouldn't have the resources to deflect it before it was too late, even if we had the technology. Second, the taxes wouldn't be well enough received in time to do the work, given the \u201cnot gonna happen\u201d attitude many of us have \u2014 and another common one, \u201cget your revenge/top of the heap/fun now, because we\u2019re dead no matter what we do\u201d. Some years ago, I wrote a devilishly skewed \u201cEnd of the World\u201d short-short story that has Earth launching a colony Ark with (hopefully) enough genetics, embryos, seeds, etc. and all the knowledge of humankind and its gods alike, with the hope the space colony would survive to ensure humanity could preserve itself somewhere in orbit. [I can\u2019t find the files now (probably in an 8086\u2019s HDD) ] The flaw in the ointment (I do mean \u201cflaw\u201d) is related as the comet nears Earth, and the astronauts radio back that something terrible has happened \u2014 all of the files are in FRENCH. And in Paris, people are cheering. La France va vivre ! ",
