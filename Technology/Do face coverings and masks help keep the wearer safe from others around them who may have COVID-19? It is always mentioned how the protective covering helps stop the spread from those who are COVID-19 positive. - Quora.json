            "answer_text": "This is a bit of a no brainer. Anyone who is wearing a mask/face covering is adding a level of protection for themselves and for those around them. The mask protects not only the wearer, but those around you too. The science and reasoning behind the recommendation that everyone wear a mask revolves around proven statistics regarding a high percentage of COVID-19 positive patients being asymptomatic carriers. What is an asymptomatic carrier? An asymptomatic carrier is a person who has tested positive for the virus but does not show any evidence of symptoms. This means that said person is capable of unknowingly spreading the virus to others. It also means that there are potentially a large number of people out there who are positive but have not been tested because they are not showing symptoms. Any person who has the virus can spread the virus to others. In cases of those who have the virus but do not have symptoms the risk is especially high because if they conduct themselves as if everything is normal, and do not cover their face in order to keep their germs to themselves, they can, without doubt, spread the virus to others. What does wearing a mask do to stop the spread and how does it benefit me? A mask helps stop the spread of the virus. The virus is most dangerous to the more vulnerable people around us like our parents, grandparents, older friends/family, and in general anyone who\u2019s immune system is not as fit to defend against the virus as ours might be. A mask protects you from people who unknowingly have the virus by placing a filter over your air passages.A mask protects other people from you by placing a filter over their air passages.Wearing a mask is a sign of respect, and of care. Respect for yourself and your health. Respect for others and their health. Care for the situation that we the human race are collectively in. This virus does not care who you are, where you come from, what language you speak, or how much money you make. It doesn\u2019t care about your ethnicity, political affiliations, or status. All the virus wants is a host body within which it can replicate, and be carried to new host bodies. In order to \u201cbeat\u201d the virus we must all, get tested, wear masks to protect ourselves and others regardless of the test result, wash our hands, and practice social distancing. Where you can afford to, please, stay home as much as possible. The fun you can have at a party, park, beach, bar, or restaurant is not worth someone\u2019s life. Stay Safe! ",

            "answer_text": "The wearer benefits! My Grandmother lived and worked through the pandemic 100 years ago. A clean mask with a cut out paper bag helped her survive everyday. People, and many children died. She did not. She was the only one who had a great job. So it was decided that she would live on the enclosed front porch with a coal furnace. She slept out there, ate out there, and bathed out there. She had a porcelain pot to use as a toilet. When she left for work she left the door, and windows open. That is when her mother, after waiting for two hours cleaned the porch, and took the bedsheets and clothes for washing. Cleaned everything to be ready for the next night. My grandmother did the shopping, and worked, and delivered the clothing to those that were paying her family to wash. My granmother had just had a baby a month before this all started. She was unable to hold her baby, but could see her through the window. After the first wave, people in Philadelphia went out, mingled, and the second wave came. My grandmother did not do any of this. She survived because she wore her masks and glasses. She used her sense. When we all grew up she would show us all of her masks. How they were made to hold the paper bag insert, and told us never to listen to anyone about how to stay safe. She said her grandparents made the masks, and knew better. So she listened, and we needed to listen. She showed up how to clean, and properly wash our hands. Each of us was given a mask. We have all kept it. It is well made, and fits nicely under the chin and has a great seal around the face. I am thankful for her sharing of these important times in her life. The hardships they faced during the pandemic, and the Depression. We are all the wiser for it! Wearing a decent mask with a cut paper bag or other insert will help save your life, along with glasses. Heed my grandmother\u2019s advice! Stay safe! ",

            "answer_text": "It is a bit of both yes\u2019s to your question. We have known that face masks reduce the amount of virus you breathe in, and they also reduce the amount that gets out of your respiratory system if you have the virus. Do they stop 100%, no. According to studies done prior to COVID, they are less than 50% effective in reducing breathed in viruses and breathed out viruses. But a less than 50% reduction is still a reduction. We still do not know exactly how many virons (Virus particles) are needed to infect someone. We don\u2019t know if this is different for different people. It appears to be a lower number than other diseases, but may not be as few as say for the Norovirus. The real way to stop the viruse is either vaccination or getting enough infected people so it is hard for the disease to spread. (this is thought to be what stopped the 1918 flu) Without this, total isolation is the only sure way an individual can stay virus free. Masks are not going to stop the virus. They may reduce the number of people who are infected, but as long as there are cases, we have the risk of it starting up again. Masking will prolong how long we are dealing with the disease. Hopefully, we get a vaccine to increase the amount of immune people. ",

            "answer_text": "I will take a novel approach to this, since I am not a bacteriologist, or a virologist, or any other kind of -ologist. For the last 10 years, every winter, I wear not only a mask, but also gloves. So this year, the time is just a bit extended. The reason I do this is because of all the little kids when I go shopping, sneezing, coughing, putting their germy little hands on everything! I figure, at least my mask helps a bit. And, last time I checked, a bit is more than nada. I don\u2019t want the latest strain of the flu, you know, the ones that sneaked by the vaccine against the strain of their compadres. I don\u2019t even want a cold! Now, flash back to 2020. Business as usual. If it came down to it, if an unprotected person gets too close, I would simply point at the mask, cough, and hold up my hand in a stop sign. Never had to try that one. So that would help protect me too. Thanks for reading. ",

Even a NIOSH rated N95 lets 5% of particles 0.3 microns and bigger through and most of those smaller than 0.3 microns. For reference the current virus is 0.12 microns in size. Please know most viral particles are bound up in respiratory mists but not all. Some are monodispersed and may get through. Dont get me wrong a mask is better than nothing just know nothing but a positive pressure supplied air respirator will get you truely close to 100% protection. ",
