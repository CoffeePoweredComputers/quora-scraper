            "answer_text": "There are the normal issues with big OEMs such as proprietary system builds that make it harder to upgrade. They also tend to charge large amounts for upgrades and accessories. Though the one warning that I would mention with Dell is that you definitely get what you pay for. If you buy a cheap dell you get a cheap dell but if you spend the money they make some really good systems. ",
