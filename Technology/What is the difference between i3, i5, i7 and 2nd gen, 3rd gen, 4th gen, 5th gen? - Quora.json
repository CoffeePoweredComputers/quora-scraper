            "answer_text": "Comparing i3,i5 and i7 It often confusing with the Intel\u2019s processor line up especially when it has launched Core i series.Which is more faster and compatible is one of the common question ?So let\u2019s see what is the mystery Intel core processor can be divided into 3 ranges -Core i3Core i5Core i7But differences between them is not same in the case of laptops and desktop.but more interesting and important terms that need to look over is the number of cores,Turbo boost ,Cache memory and Hyper-threading and they are same for desktops and laptops No. Of Cores No. of cores is the most important part that affects the performance .No. of cores increases the speed whenever certain program requires. So core i3 is dual core and i5 and i7 both are quad core processor Turbo Boost It is most interesting fact that comes about the processor and it that Core i3 runs faster than the Core i5 and Core i7 the clock speed of i3 is ranging from 3.4 Ghz to 4.2Ghz While in case of i5 and i7 it is 2.4 Ghz to 3.8Ghz and 2.9Ghz to 4.2Ghz respectively. So basically the role of turbo boost is to just increase the core clock speed dynamically whenever it requires . So in Core i3 turbo boost is not available while in i5 and i7 it is so it balances the clock speed in case of i5 and i7 because whenever certain program need more speed turbo boost quickly respond and gives more speed than it\u2019s usual one. Cache Memory A processor speed not only determine by clock speed and no. of cores .Cache memory has also important part as it is also the part of processor .So bigger is better . Core i3 have 3Mb or 4Mb ,while in i5 have 6Mb and i7 have 8Mb. Hyper Threading It is most clever way to allow even a single core to handle multiple cores. It creates virtual cores to perform a thread or allow multiple thread to work simultaneously .Surprisingly i3 and i7 have but not in i5 . In case of generation of processor it is simply speed the previous generations .Here we understand generations individually. Intel 2nd Gen It is named as Sandy Bridge uses 32 nm processor ,it uses 64Kb L1 cache and 256Kb per core . Intel 3rd Gen It is known as Ivy bridge faster than Sandy and use 22 nm processor consumes 50 percent less energy but one disadvantage is that it emits more heat as compared to Sandy bridge. Intel 4th Gen Haswell the faster than above two uses same 22 nm processor like Ivy. It has lot of features from Ivy .The major advantage is that it can be used in ultra portable devices as its low power consumption Intel 5th Gen The Broadwell the latest and smallest and uses 14nm processor .It has average 90 min longer battery life than it\u2019s predecessor ",

            "answer_text": "Most of the differences in i3, i5, and i7 is hyperthreading and the number of cores. The newer pentiums are basically stripped down versions of the i series. So certain features that let you get more processing power at a given speed might not be there, along with other things that might be nice to have. You can think of processing an instruction a bit like doing your laundry; it can be broken down into different stages that can run at once. For instance, you can be ironing and folding the whites, while the colors are drying, and the blacks are washing. Each load is a different instruction in the computer, and by breaking the instructions down into different stages, we can save time and finish all of the instructions in less time. While my laundry example had 3 stages, computer instructions can have anywhere from 3 to 50 stages. You could think of each stage as a bead on a thread. Each program has it's main thread, so a computer with more cores can run more threads at a time. This means that your computer doesn't need to switch between processes as often, and your programs won't get disrupted as often. An issue with breaking down the instructions into multiple stages is that gaps tend to form on this thread where you CPU does nothing for that stage of the instruction. To fill in the gaps, we can weave two threads into one thread; this is called hyperthreading. This is almost like having twice the number of cores to work with but not quite. It takes a bit of time to weave two threads together and there might not be enough gaps to run the threads at full speed. This is part of the reason why the i7 runs at a higher clock rate than the i5, to stop an individual thread from slowing down due to hyperthreading. Edit (Nov. 8th, 2019): This part of the answer is outdated. The standard number of cores has changed. Also, once you take integrated graphics into account, you\u2019ll see even more differences from CPU to CPU. A standard i5, has 4 cores without hyperthreading. A standard i7 has 4 cores with hyperthreading, so you can run 8 threads at a time. That being said, more cores can only speed things up so much; there is Amdahl's law to consider. ",

Easy on gas (uses the least wattage and generates the least heat), affordable and while it won\u2019t win any races it\u2019ll get you where you\u2019re going. The i5 is a V6. Much more powerful than the 4 cylinder, still not too bad on the gas, and it can actually maybe tow a light trailer (demanding video game analogy) but still isn\u2019t more car than you need. The i7 is a V8. Big, beefy, fast and gas hungry. Not only does it get you where you need to go, but it does it loud and fast, even with a trailer on it. It\u2019s the most expensive option, but also the highest performance. Not too bad on the difference between the core series, right? Now, as for generations, those simply denote improvements made to those same chips over the course of their service. So, an i5 2nd gen may actually have worse performance that an i3 8th gen. Kind of like a V6 from the 1980\u2019s with a carb vs a new i4 engine with a turbocharger. The newer i4 may actually have more power thanks to new design changes and technology. ",

            "answer_text": "Comparison between these processors can't be explained without going technical. So instead I'm using analogy with cars to provide easy to understand the scenarios: i3 processors: are like mini family cars like nano,wagonr,alto. These cars features the weakest engines but they also provide the most mileage for same amount of fuel. These cars are in the cheapest section. These cars are best suited for travelling daily to nearby places only, they're not meant to go on very long drives or to carry huge amount of load. Similarly i3 processors are the weakest, they're the most battery friendly, they're suitable for doing simpler tasks like web surfing, MS-Office,etc. i5 processors: are like mid-range cars like honda city, corolla, fiat linea, skoda rapid.These cars have more powerful engines but heir mileage is less. These cars are almost double to quadruple in price as compared to mini cars. These cars can be used inside the city as well as for long rides easily. Similarly i5 processors are very good processors for most of the things. They're more powerful but less are less battery friendly. They're more than enough for any home or office usage. i7 processors: these processors are like the luxury cars or high performance cars like Lamborghini,bmw,audi,etc thus they're like creamy layer among all the non-server processors. They're costliest. They're most powerful. They can support any rig to its full potential. ",

            "answer_text": "Here\u2019s the updated answer for Intel 7th Gen processors: Intel Core i3, Core i5, and Core i7 CPUs have been around for a few years now, but some buyers still get stumped whenever they attempt to build their own systems and are forced to choose among the three. With the more recent 7th Generation (Kaby Lake) architecture now available in notebooks that are on store shelves, and the rest of the processors expected to launch in January, we expect the latest wave of buyers to ask the same kind of questions. Core i3, Core i5, Core i7 \u2014 the difference in a nutshell Generally speaking, Core i7s are better than Core i5s, which are in turn better than Core i3s. Core i7 does not have seven cores nor does Core i3 have three cores. The numbers are simply indicative of their relative processing powers. Their relative levels of processing power are based on a collection of criteria involving their number of cores, clock speed (in GHz), size of cache, as well as technologies like Turbo Boost 2.0 and Hyper-Threading. Note: Core processors can be grouped in terms of their target devices, i.e., those for laptops and those for desktops. Each has its own specific characteristics/specs. Intel recently launched its 7th generation processors to power fanless 2-in-1 (convertible laptop/tablet) devices and ultrathin notebooks \u2013 known as the Y-series and U-series processors. Theses processors are designed to strike a balance between performance and mobility, including longer battery life. The second phase of 7th generation processors, including those for desktops, gaming notebooks, workstations and more, will launch in January. We\u2019ll update this article to cover these processors when that time comes. Continues at source: www.pcworld.idg.com.au ",

            "answer_text": "On generic computing performance:  Source:  AnandTech The 4770K is the Haswell i7, and the 3770K is the Ivy Bridge i7.  That's about 10% better in overall performance. On graphics:  Source:  Tom's HardwareEvery game is going to have different demands on the CPU and GPU.  The 4770K is Haswell with only 20 (out of 40 possible) shaders active. If you get a higher end i7, say in a laptop, it will have all 40 shaders going, and the highest tier Haswell i7 will have a 128MB dedicated graphics cache to kick up performance, but they're more expensive.  Source:  AnandTechIris Pro is Haswell with all 40 shaders and the 128MB video memory.  For comparison, the Nvidia GT 650M is a mid-range discrete graphics card. On Power consumption:Idle power:  Power with all cylinders firing:  (These figures are for desktop processors.  Comparisons are similar for laptops, but cut the power in half and they're closer to the actual figures). One of the \"secret ingredients\" to get power consumption down is that the voltage regulator has been moved off the motherboard and directly on to the CPU die.  This allows for much finer control of power consumption, but at the cost of getting a fair bit hotter.  Broadwell may take the voltage regulator off the CPU. Prices are very similar.  Haswell processors only cost ~$20 more than their Ivy Bridge counterparts. Recap:10% better CPU performance, 33%-50% better framerates in games if you don't have a discrete graphics card, 25% lower idle power consumption (most of the time you won't have it loaded at 100%). There are differences from a programmer/compiler perspective with interesting new instructions, but chances are you don't care about those, only about the things you can easily measure. If you already have an Ivy Bridge processor, it's not worth upgrading.  If you're buying new, then it's up to you whether it's worth spending an extra $20 for Haswell -- if you're paying your own power bills, then over the lifetime of the processor it is worth the extra money. The decision is up to you.  Haswell is better, but not enough to decide everything. ",

Without question the i5 is better. On top of that Broadwell (5th gen) is just a die shrink of Haswell (4th gen). So unless you're going to use the integrated GPU extensively, there is virtually no performance difference between the two generations. Broadwell just has lower power consumption, which you don't really care about on a desktop. On laptops it's not so clear.The i5 has 2 physical cores, hyperthreading, and turbo boost.The i3 has 2 physical cores, hyperthreading, and no turbo boost. Prior to Haswell, the turbo boost on most of the i5 line was pretty modest - about 5%-15% base clock speed. Not really worth the extra $50-$100 vendors were charging, and the i3 was a better value (the fact that Apple doesn't offer an i3 laptop was a big tip-off where the fat profit margins were). Only the ULV processors got bigger turbo boosts which made the i5 worthwhile. Beginning with Haswell, the main i5 line became ULV processors (end in a U or Y), so most i5 laptops started to get turbo boosts of 30%-65%. So suddenly the i5 became a good buy compared to an i3 with the same base clock speed. OTOH, Broadwell introduces some impressive battery life savings, and you're more likely to end up using the integrated GPU on a laptop. So the answer becomes: If CPU performance is what's most important to you, then get the 4th gen i5. If battery life and integrated graphics performance is most important to you, get the 5th gen i3.

            "answer_text": "First things first. Let me explain you four things about processors in simple words. CPU Architecture: The physical design or layout of the CPU die and lithographical process. CPU Core: The main physical part of a CPU which is capable of processing the workload. CPU Thread: Virtual splitting of the cores of a CPU into two parts in order to gain more performance & efficiency is called threads. Intel calls it hyperthreading and AMD named it Simultaneous Muticore Threding . Turbo Boost: Simply, more the number of CPU cores, more is the power consumption. Intel CPU having several cores are introduced with a technology known as turbo boost to lower the power consumption as well as to increase performance of single threaded workloads at the same time. This is accomplished by increasing clock speeds of one or two cores dynamically in the expense of almost hibernating other cores. Now, coming to your question, Intel core series processors are termed in accordance with the specifications mentioed above. Core i3: 2 cores + hyperthreading Core i5: 4 cores + turbo boost Core i7: 4 or more cores + hyperthreading + turbo boost. And the generation difference among these CPUs refers to the more advanced manufacturing process & lithography. Newer generation CPUs are more efficient, faster and supports newer technologies than that of the older counter parts. Hope you got your answer. Thanks for reading. ",

            "answer_text": "The pentiums usually have two cores with no hyperthreading for a total of 2threads and they are usually non overclockable, with the exception being the pentium G3258 anniversary edition. The core i3's work like laptop processors, 2 cores with hyperthreading for a total of 4threads and they are all non overclockable. The core i5's are usually four cores with no hyperthreading for a total of 4 threads, some of them are overclockable whereas some are not. The core i7's are the best that Intel can build, they come in a variety, such as the 'consumer' variants which have 4 cores with hyperthreading for a total of 8 threads and like the i5, some are overclockable and some are not. There are the extreme editions which usually come with more than 4 cores with the i7 5960X with a whopping 8 cores with hyperthreading for a total of 16 threads. As for the quad cores, it depends, most of laptop quadcores are dual core chips with hyperthreading enabled for a total of 2 virtual cores and 2 physical cores, so \"quad cores\" are just a marketing term and should not be used to compare processors. Octa cores are a rare breed, they only appear in i7 extreme editions and server based processors, which is why u rarely see Octa cores being marketed. ",

There are three variants, Core i3, Core i5, and Core i7, but the names no longer correspond to specific technical features like the number of cores (i7 is physically 4 cores. But thanks to hyperthreading, it can simulate 8 cores worth of threads (processes). Each consecutive model lower than i7 can field less threads and therefore, finish less computational processes in the same amount of time. Really, the i series is all about virtualization. It increases computational power without physically stacking more cores on top and therefore increasing heat and power consumption).  Instead, the brand is now divided from low-level (i3), through mid-range (i5) to high-end performance (i7), which correspond to three to five stars in Intel's Intel Processor Rating as opposed to the entry-level Celeron (one star) and Pentium (two stars) processors. It's a differentiation within a subcategory. Simply put: i7: High End i5: Middlei3: Low ",

            "answer_text": "Seeing as most of these answer the first half of the question (i3/i5/i7), I'll take the chance to answer the second half (difference between generations). In simple terms, the 2nd gen was released to be a better, more refined version of the original Core i series. 3rd gen was more focused on better performance regardless of power consumption (the main reason it's still my preferred and favourite gen of core i series). With 4th gen they tried toning it down a bit on the power consumption side, focusing more on efficiency rather than performance. I have personal experience with this, because my 3rd gen mobile i3 (3110m) was capable of out performing a 4th desktop i3, and kept up with a mobile 4th gen i5. 5th gen came along as a means of trying to squeeze out more performance out of their chips while trying to maintain the power efficiency of 4th gen chips. Needless to say this failed miserably. ",

            "answer_text": "Depends. If you are comparing gaming, I would say there isn\u2019t much difference between i5 and an i7 of the current generation(Excluding extreme edition of the previous gen) . i3s are quite capable and severely underestimated by every other guy on Quora. i3 for budget without sacrificing much and great for gaming.(Though it will be less future proof compared to an i5) 4 cores are good enough for small content creators. i5s for a good balance between budget and performance and great for gaming also they are quite future proof. If you are doing mediocre video editing, this is the one you are looking for. i7 is overkill for gaming in my opinion. Heavy workloads that are mostly CPU dependent are the only reason why you should buy one unless you want to flex on ya frenz. These are heavy overclockers and are usually the highest performers(Excluding extreme editions). ",

            "answer_text": "Every year or two, Intel releases a new bunch of Core processors with revised architecture. And every time, they give it a new generation number. So that\u2019s where 1st gen, 2nd gen, etc. come from. As for i3/i5/i7, well that\u2019s just branding. The higher the number, the better, according to their marketing. That doesn\u2019t always hold up true, especially when comparing desktop and laptop chips (for example, a desktop i3 is generally faster than an \u201cultrabook\u201d i7). Nevertheless, it can serve somewhat as a gauge of performance. But then, you can also compare performance between generations. With each generation, the performance is increased ever so slightly, but it usually takes several (maybe 5) generations for a new i5 to catch up with an old i7, for example. Conclusion: generation = age, number after i = performance. ",

            "answer_text": "While the 4th generation has less GHz, it was designed with laptop in mind. Thus, it consumes less power (more load / cycles, more heat generated by the processor and with temperature-regulated fan, more power will be consumed not just by the processor itself but also by the fan).In addition, the 4th generation has extra feature - turbo boost, which, using an analogy, would be like nitro on a sports car, but the difference is that it is still regulated by the processor's thermal and current limits. It gives you a boost to meet demand requested by OS. Nitro, on the other hand, is regulated by the driver - you could pump as much in the engine until the engine blows out (Ok, there is still nitro regulator, if installed).Either, it is meant to provide a short burst regulated still by the processor's thermal and current limit to meet sudden demand by the operating system dynamically.The 4th generation has an integrated GPU. So, if you wish to have your own dedicated GPU, go for the 3rd generation. If not and if getting a laptop is what you intended I would suggest getting the 4th generation, it will be quieter (personally a plus; imagine sitting in a library and your fan is oozing out heat and making noises) and consumes less power ",

Unfortunately 5th generation processors are not available for desktop PC's and they are designed for only laptops. Also by comparing 4th Gen i5 & 5th Gen i3 processors in terms of performance 4th Gen i5 tops the table. But in terms of power consumption 5th Gen i3 wins.   1. If you consider longer battery life for your laptop go for 5th Gen processors.2. If you consider good performance with low power consumption for your desktop go for 4th Gen processors. Edit: Now the 5th Gen i5 processors are available for desktops which is released in the month of July, 2015. On comparing the desktop CPU's it makes no difference on power consumption. Only the performance varies from i3 to i5 to i7 no matter what the Generation would be. ",

In general, Core i3 chips are found in budget PCs and low-end laptops. For a normal user who does browsing and watching videos, Core i3 works just fine. Core i3s have a low Cache size. The mainstream or mid-range systems usually have i5. Systems with Core i5 are good for a moderate user and light gamer. The Core i7 CPUs are reserved for \u2013 and found usually in \u2013 high-end, expensive laptops and PCs. These are used by users who wish to do video editing( For example using photoshop), Lot of Gaming and other CPU intensive stuff. read more on: Learn More ",

So it really matters on the internal specifications and the clock Speed. For example, i5 3rd gen is better than i7 1st gen in terms of performance. So if you are considering to buy a laptop, make sure that its i5 3rd gen or higher than i7 third gen with clock speed more than 2.3Ghz. Another thing, the presence of an SSd increases the performance of a laptop to great extent. So it really depends on the best combination of processors and other things for a laptop to perform better. ",

Two main things to be considered are Performance:Haswell (4th Gen) is as expected better than Ivy Bridge (3rd Gen) around 7-15%. Its not really significant if want you are going to be doing is basically just web browsing etc.  Batter Life:Haswell is built to improve power consumption, it consistently out lasts Ivy Bridge. You are looking at 20-35% improvement which would translate to 2-3 hrs of battery life. So if you are looking for something to travel Haswell is the way to go.  PricingWhile the new laptops with Haswell should cost about the same as the outgoing models, the older ones should be on discount. So if something is available for a lot less and you don't care about the battery life, then sure go ahead with Ivy Bridge. ",

That is the 4th gen design was manufactured at 22nm transistor sizes. 5th gen is almost exactly the same design but manufactured at 14nm size. They improved the GPU and made some minor hardware tweaks here and there in Broadwell. But otherwise, non-GPU performance should be nearly identical clock for clock to Haswell CPUs. The primary advantage of Broadwell is lower power consumption. So just compare it as if you were comparing a 2.7 GHz 4th gen i5 to a 3.1 GHz 4th gen i7. Except the 5th gen i5 will get better battery life. I'd go for the i5. No way an extra 1MB of L3 cache, 15% faster clock speed, and worse battery life. ",

It is measured in star rating.Celeron got 1 star,  pentium 2, i3 3 stars, i5 4stars and i7 5 stars.It is not related to the number of cores present in them.You might say then why not i4 and i6 and i8 or why a gap of 2?There could be 2 reasons for it.1. Intel didnt want users to get confused that the numbers represent cores as the number of cores are in even numbers.2. It could also be a marketing strategy to keep a gap of 2 as it makes user feel that the difference in performance in different version is more subtle. ",
