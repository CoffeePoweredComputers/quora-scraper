            "answer_text": "Presumably someone can structure this as a goal and IT can converge on solutions. In the past it had tended to obsolete positions going forward like burning the bridges. There is a question of limits as usual. People want to know how to identify niches, or marketing, and how to exploit methods, or innovation, so these are combined.  Though it was stereotyped as a geekdom, it will be interesting to see what new personality types will be like since they are not all psychopaths, and will explore creativity and empathy. There is a notion of motivation, e.g. if they have a strong idea then find a way to make it happen in contrast to those who liked to take orders instead such as civil servants. This may be what startups require. Then there is an issue if academics is necessary and sufficient from a personal or societal standpoint. Another is whether security is achievable.

There are a lot of tech trends, e.g. energy, health, legal, financial, engineering, or environmental.  Noone knows how much automation is going to bite. They are looking for drone pilots in case. ",
