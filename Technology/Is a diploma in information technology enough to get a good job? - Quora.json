            "answer_text": "Oh dear! What is a \u201cdiploma\u201d? The answer depends on where you live and where you intend to work. There are no absolute and strict definitions, so the there\u2019s no answer. I, for example, have something called a \u201cGraduate Diploma in Information Technology\u201d which is a qualification intended for people who did a lot of studying in non computing areas, and then a year in IT in the honours program. It certainly takes some work to convince people in other countries that you have an honours degree in IT, but did a lot of studying in such relevant areas like Renaissance Literature in Translation and early German Cinema!

Today, technology has become an integral part of our everyday life and the demand for IT people is rapidly growing. That\u2019s why the competition becomes tough and people need to work hard and hard to earn well. However, there are some companies where a degree doesn\u2019t matter, but only a person\u2019s knowledge matters most. IT people must keep themselves updated. The higher the degree and knowledge you have, the more successful you will become. ",
