            "answer_text": "Dial-up Internet connections access the Internet through a normal telephone line. The modem in your computer dials a number and sends your ISP your user name and password. Because it uses the Internet through the same frequency as your voice, if someone picks up a phone connected to that line, you lose your connection. Similarly, if you have several phones or other devices such as DSL modems or fax machines on that line, they may be creating noise, interfering with your connection. ",

Once the modems are properly connected, those sounds cease, and the modem tones standard for the negotiated speed of transmission. ",
