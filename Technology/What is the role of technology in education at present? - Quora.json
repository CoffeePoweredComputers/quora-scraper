            "answer_text": "At this very moment, in the summer of 2020, we\u2019re less than a month away from the new school year beginning, and as things stand, the involvement of technology will be immense, to say the least. Many countries around the world are still dealing with the ongoing pandemic, and it\u2019s in all likelihood that the school year for most students will start from home, behind a monitor. It will be an occurrence unlike no other, and the role of technology will have a paramount effect in the way that classes will be taught, the way the homework will be assigned, and how the overall interactions will be conducted on a daily basis. We can actually say that we\u2019re somewhat fortunate that we have technologies that can enable distance learning, which only decades ago would have been completely impossible. Thanks to the availability of these technologies and the internet, as well as programs and tools that are available, students will be able to continue their studies, on different levels of the educational system (K-12, colleges, and other educational institutions). Of course, nothing can compare to an actual classroom, with real-life interactions, but we have to deal with what we\u2019ve got and also be grateful for at least having such an option. If students find themselves studying from their homes, they need to take the most advantage of different digital tools, which can make for an easier transition, into the world of online learning. There are great tools for revisions, taking notes, and general organizers, that can enhance their overall learning experience. There are plenty of other tools to help with education out there which are worth considering, that are great in their own ways, and give that advantage when fully relying on technologies in these uncertain times. I hope that this transition happens smoothly and that things return to the way they were just a few months ago. But at this time, we need to put faith in tech to get those who are studying over this incredibly challenging time. Disclaimer: I am a part of the Kdan team, so my answer might be a little biased. ",

            "answer_text": "Basic education includes teaching by books and teachers delivering the lessons in the class with their knowledge. Basic education is quite good but it is not much appealing or interesting for the students. It makes class\u2019 atmosphere monotonous and students find it a bit boring. Technology ,on the other hand when is used for teaching the students, makes the lessons engaging and thoughtful. Technology opens up various barriers of basic teaching methods. It helps in making the basic topics interesting. A school named Unised International is very famous for its innovative methods of teaching which involves teaching with the help of artificial intelligence, virtual reality, 3D printing, augmented reality and many more such methods which make education interesting, playful and also makes students think differently and step up in life.
