            "answer_text": "The competition between China and the US in AI development is tricky to quantify. The latest comes from technology analysts, which reports that China has overtaken the US in the funding of AI startups. The country accounted for ~48% of the world\u2019s total AI startup funding in 2017, compared to ~38% for the US. However in terms of the volume of individual developments, the country only accounts for 9 percent of the total, while the US leads in both the total number of AI startups and total funding overall. We can assert that China is ahead when it comes to the dollar value of AI startup funding. Although, compared to the US, it has a huge population (1.4 billion), which offers a wealth of data and opportunity for companies to scale quickly. Along with facial recognition, China\u2019s chip sector is also a big recipient of AI startup funding. New companies like Cambricon raised $100 million last August and are building processors designed to handle the demands of Machine Learning. But, context here need not be overlooked, because while more money for AI chips may be going to China\u2019s startups, in the US, it\u2019s established companies like Qualcomm, Nvidia, and Intel that are pouring resources into the same cause.
