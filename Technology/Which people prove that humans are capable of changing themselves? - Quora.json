            "answer_text": "I believe its gotta be Frank William Abagnale Jr.  He is currently one of the most sought after security consultants, in the United States, working with consulting financial institutions, corporations, and law enforcement agencies on fraud and security. To date, he has serviced more than 14,000 companies. But he came into the spotlight because of his past. A former con man, check forger, and impostor between the ages of 15 and 21, he became one of the most notorious impostors, claiming to have assumed as many as eight identities, which includes an airline pilot, a physician, a U.S. Bureau of Prisons agent, and a lawyer. Not just that, Abagnale escaped from police custody twice. Once he escaped from a taxiing airliner and the other time from a U.S. federal prison. And I kid you not, he did this all before hitting 22. Abagnale started this journey through bank fraud, writing personal checks on his own overdrawn account, opening other accounts at different banks, eventually creating new identities to sustain this charade. Later Abagnale caricatured a pilot .He obtained a uniform by calling Pan American World Airways and obtaining a new one with a fake employee ID number. He then forged a Federal Aviation Administration pilot's license. If I had the uniform on, you didn't doubt for a moment I was a pilot. No one ever blinked an eye if I tried to cash a cheque wearing that uniform. ~ Frank Abagnale Jr. Abagnale also worked as a sociology teaching assistant at Brigham Young University for a semester, under the name Frank Adams. For eleven months, Abagnale impersonated a chief resident pediatrician in a Georgia hospital under the alias Frank Williams. While posing as Pan Am First Officer \"Robert Black\", Abagnale forged a Harvard University law transcript, passed the Louisiana bar exam, and got a job at the Louisiana State Attorney General's office at the age of nineteen. Abagnale was eventually arrested in Montpellier, France, in 1969. When the French police arrested him, 12 countries in which he had committed fraud sought his extradition. He first served time in Perpignan's prison He was sentenced to 12 years in a federal prison, US for multiple counts of forgery. While being deported to the US, Abagnale escaped from a British VC-10 airliner as it was turning onto a taxiway at New York's JFK International Airport. Again Abagnale reportedly escaped from the Federal Detention Center in Atlanta, Georgia, while awaiting trial. After he had served less than 5 years of his 12-year sentence at Federal Correctional Institution in Petersburg, Virginia, the US federal government released him on the condition that he help the federal authorities, without pay, to investigate crimes committed by fraud and scam artists, and sign in once a week. This is where his life made a complete turn-around, which is the most remarkable part of his journey. He made errors as a youngster, but I guess errors are portion of all the deserts one pays for living a full life. He later founded Abagnale & Associates, based in Tulsa, Oklahoma, which advises companies on fraud issues. He continues to advise the FBI, with whom he has associated for over 40 years, by teaching at the FBI Academy and lecturing for FBI field offices throughout the country. The police can't protect consumers. People need to be more aware and educated about identity theft. You need to be a little bit wiser, a little bit smarter and there's nothing wrong with being skeptical. We live in a time when if you make it easy for someone to steal from you, someone will. ~ Frank Abagnail Jr. Abagnale testified before the US Senate in 2012 about the vulnerabilities of senior citizens to fraud, particularly stressing the ubiquitous use of Social Security numbers for identification included on Medicare cards. He even spoke in favor of Blockchain Technology in 2018.  Later his story was adapted into a movie titled, \u201cCatch me if you can\u201d, directed by Steven Spielberg, starring Leonardo DiCaprio and Tom Hanks. ",

            "answer_text": "I've read some good answers already given to this question. But what does, or can, \u201cchanging themselves\u201d mean? From what I read its interpretation has been pretty consistent, so I want to address it a little differently like a couple answers leaned toward doing. My short answer is none. That's because I'd like to use a different definition of \u201cchanging themselves\u201d. You see, pretty much everyone in other answers were the same person albeit with some altered characteristics. But what I'm using as a definition is a changed identity (Not the superficial name changes of marriage, etc). I believe that only God can really do that. There was a man named Saul, a Pharisee of Pharisees, steeped in the traditional requirements and practices of Judaism about 2000 years ago. He zealously pursued the annihilation of a new Jewish sect that believed a man named Jesus was The Messiah hoped for by the Jews of the day (and through history). He presided over stonings of Christians, as the members of that new sect were eventually called. He saw no reason to change. Then Jesus confronted him personally and spoke to him. Saul's change was so dramatic that he needed a new name, Paul. Others, by their change have also been renamed by God. Abram's becoming Abraham and Cephas' becoming Peter are just 2 others. Paul became an apostle of Christ, planted churches across the Northeastern Mediterranean, wrote most of the epistles of the Bible, and was eventually killed because of his proclaiming Christ as Lord. Paul wrote to the Corinthians saying, \u201cTherefore, if anyone is in Christ, the new creation has come: The old is gone, the new is here!\u201d II Cor 5:17. That type of change is not possible for man himself, it can only be done by God's action. A believer in Christ is considered a new creation made from what is dead in sin. Jesus said that he did not come to bring peace to the world, but a sword. Mt 10:34. He expounded that belief and life in him would bring conflict between the new believer and family. A believer's new identity is not proof against suffering and pain, but a matter of new spiritual life rooted and growing like a branch fed by the vine which is Jesus. He said, \u201cApart from me you can do nothing\u201d Jn 15:5 And so I say, no one, in the deepest sense of oneself, can change themselves. ",
