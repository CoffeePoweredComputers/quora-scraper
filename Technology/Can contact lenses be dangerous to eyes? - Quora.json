            "answer_text": "Honestly, the answer is , it could. Not will, but could; but certainly not necessarily permanently. Eyesight is important. Even minor eye injuries need to be taken very seriously. But how many cuts have you had that needed a sticking plaster, or pulled muscles, broken bones? I HATE wearing glasses, I loose them & break them, and they are looming frames limiting my vision. I got contacts as soon as I started work and could afford them. I cycle across London twice a day, and the probability of being hurt in an accident is, I\u2019m sure, much higher than the probability of having serious eye problems from wearing daily disposable lenses 16 hours a day 7 days a week . But the overall improvement in my quality of life from cycling 100 miles a week, over 10 hours on crowded busses and tubes, is immeasurable. So is the improvement from wearing properly prescribed, properly cared for, contact lenses. Other replies detail the dangers of long term contact wear, I\u2019m aware of them; and over more than 40 years I have had some of the common problems, and overcome them by changing lenses and habits. With hard lenses & early soft lenses I\u2019ve had blood vessels starting to grow into the cornea. Discovered by REGULAR CHECKUPS and sorted by changing lenses. With hard lenses I had a mis-shapen lens which temporarily distorted a cornea, discovered and sorted after changing practitioner. With long wear soft lenses I have had a couple of eye infections, sorted by changing to daily disposables which minimise most of the possibility of acquiring those infections. A couple of times (over 20 years) I\u2019ve had a tiny bit of grit under a soft lens, which I haven\u2019t noticed until removing the lens, which the first time I ignored for a couple of days (wearing lenses stopped it hurting) and got a tiny ulcer which healed with quick treatment. Second time I left lenses out and used some mild antiseptic ointment for a week. No problem. But I still wear daily disposable lenses at least 16 hours a day, dealing with them takes about 3 minutes a day (making sure my hands are really clean twice a day before putting them in and taking them out accounts for most of that). How many times a day do you need to adjust, clean or otherwise deal with, a pair of glasses? ",

            "answer_text": "Edit: Full question was: \u201cI am 17 years old and I have a prescription of -2.25 in my right eye and 0.00 in my left. I currently wear a contact lens only in my right eye. Is it damaging to keep the lens in while I do work on the computer or read? I see fine up close without the lens.\u201d Really? Zero on the left, zip zilch nada - while the right has -2.25? Curious. Wearing contacts certainly can damage your eyes if they fit poorly, if they are not kept clean, if you wear them excessively, if you expose yourself to infection from casual hand-hygiene whilst handling them. But the worst the power will do would be blur/ache if this is not right (wrong power won\u2019t damage your eyes). Without correcting lenses you have a situation known as monovision - using 1 eye (at a time). This can create issues for some people, whereas other people enjoy it. There is a lens inside our eyes which we use to change focus. If someone has no prescription this is naturally focussed far when the muscle controlling it is at rest, and it then requires muscle effort to pull the focus near. So for your left eye far vision is effortless, while LE near vision takes muscular effort (though you are young so the inner lens is very supple and you may not even notice this effort). But without correcting lenses your short-sighted right eye is focussed near even when that muscle is relaxed - it cannot focus far without a minus lens pushing focus out. So without correction we have RE far blur, LE far clear. But near vision without correction can go 2 ways. Either both eye\u2019s focussing muscles stay relaxed and you use your RE for clear near vision (while the LE is still focussed at far and so not helping near), or you attempt to focus near with the left eye (which takes effort) and in so doing pull the right eye focus TOO close (working the focussing muscle in 1 eye will result in the other eye doing likewise, they normally work as a team). In short the imbalance may create issues as the muscles for each eye normally exert roughly equal effort, but in your case - without correction - this is inappropriate and will always result in one eye out of focus, and there can be conflict between them potentially resulting in headachiness etc. Or not. Because it is also very possible that your eyes are so used to this that you effortlessly switch between them (monovision), and experience no issues at all unless deliberately closing your left eye and experiencing RE far blur. So long as you are safe to drive (and in most countries your private car license only requires 1 eye to be legal) uncorrected monovision is not a medical problem - you do no harm whether you choose to wear correction or not. Some people are so well adapted to monovision that wearing correction can create problems - when 1 eye is obviously blurry their brain is used to effortlessly ignoring it, but with glasses improving that vision the brain now attempts to use both together\u2026 but with only one lens having power the images from glasses will be different sizes (-2.25 will make things look smaller THROUGH GLASSES) and now someone who was having no issues being fully used to uncorrected monovision is having to grapple with different size images from each eye. However this won\u2019t happen in contact lenses - the further away from your eye the lens is, the smaller it will make things appear, but since contacts sit right on the eye neither image will be significantly smaller. Another reason some folk prefer to be uncorrected is because near vision will take more muscle effort when corrected. A minus lens pushed your focus out, enabling the right eye to see far and balancing the focussing state of each eye (whilst creating unequal image sizes in glasses as described above). But now you need to use muscle effort to pull your focus near instead of using your built-in near sight when uncorrected. Contacts take more effort to focus near than equivalent glasses do, and many short-sighted folk experience fatigue symptoms from prolonged near work whilst wearing their far correction - especially in contacts. Specs are not only optically less demanding to focus near (cf contacts), but they are also more convenient to simply remove while reading near! But if one habitually wears contacts (to enhance your far vision without creating uneven image sizes) then one could also just whack on a pair of cheap +1.00 readers (available from any dollar store) to prevent near fatigue while wearing contacts. So it really is up to you - because hygiene/poor-fit issues aside, wearing glasses/contacts is medically neutral with regard to the future of your eyes. Wearing correction can both solve some issues and create others, but because its medically neutral, you decide which you prefer. The bad news: your short-sighted right eye WILL GET MORE SHORT-SIGHTED (sorry, its just a fact), your left eye\u2026 Hmmm, we\u2019ll wait and see, but if its at zero now it could well remain at zero\u2026 or belatedly become short-sighted too. Because for all the conflicting theories, we simply DON\u2019T KNOW what causes short-sight. We know what it is anatomically - the eye is too big, too long, too \u201cdeep\u201d (the retina is too far back). A short-sighted eye is growing too fast. What causes the eye to grow too fast we don\u2019t understand, but it will continue to grow too fast until it is finished growing, for most myopes that rate of growth tapers-off during their 20s, but commonly dribbles-on getting slowly more short-sighted until late/mid 20s, 26, 27years old. For some, even later\u2026 ",

On one occasion I did damage my eyes when I fell asleep with hard contacts and ended up with corneal abrasions and fuzzy vision when I foolishly removed them (with considerable difficulty as they were stuck to my eye). Fortunately the corneas healed and I have no permanent damage. On another occasion, I was doing some close work with tools and not wearing safety glasses and the stiff wire I was tugging on broke loose and knocked my contact lens out; I realized I could have poked my eye out, though there was no damage. I ultimately found contacts to be too much trouble and went back to glasses. There have been two occasions since when an accident could have caused serious eye damage, but didn\u2019t, because my glasses protected me. As long as you observe normal precautions with contacts, they aren\u2019t dangerous to your eyes. But glasses do provide advantages in terms of ease of use and protection (especially when you aren\u2019t even thinking about the need for it.) ",

            "answer_text": "This question falls under the category of does breathing kill you? What I mean is, the answer is obvious until you start to dissect it and realize there is more to it. Contacts, when used properly, are harmless. I have been wearing contacts for over 30yrs. I have been fitting contact lenses for over 20yrs. I can count on one hand the number of patients that had serious issues with contacts. They all have a few things in common: they didn\u2019t follow instructionsthey didn\u2019t get examined regularly (once a year)they ignored warning signsOne ended up with a corneal transplant and amazingly enough was sent back to me to be fitted for contacts (again) because they couldn\u2019t tolerate glasses (the transplanted cornea caused a large disparity between the eyes). 99.99% of my patients have had uneventful experiences with contacts with regard to the health of their eyes. As for their life experiences, they can\u2019t imagine themselves not wearing contacts. Today\u2019s contacts are safer than ever, especially the 1-day use lenses. Just folower these simple rules and you will a happy contact lens wearer: get an eye examget a contact lens fitting (usually not included in a regular eye exam)ask about the 1-day lenses and ask about the most breathable onesget trained in proper insertion and removal techniquespractice proper hygiene (wash hands, avoid water in eyes, etc.)get regular, yearly, eye examsremove lenses if you feel any irritation or you\u2019re eyes get red (go see your doctor).remove lenses an hour before bed time (this avoids sleeping with lenses)only wear the lenses prescribed by your doctor (seems obvious but there are lenses out there being sold that are not FDA approved and they CAN do harm).I hope this helps and as always, good luck!

Your contact lenses will not be harmful to your eyes if you take the right measures for taking care of your contacts. You just need to follow these simple rules to avoid any kind of problems with contact lenses: Regular eye check-up - once a yearWash your hands before wearing contact lensesMake sure you clean your contact lenses on a daily basis but only if they are not daily disposable lenses.Do not use saline solution or rewetting drops to disinfect your lenses. Only clean it with a contact lens solution.Always use fresh, unexpired lens care solutions.Empty your contact lens case of the old solution.Please make sure you remove the contact lenses if there is redness or irritation in eyes.Storing contact lenses correctly is also essential. You need to store contact lenses in a closed lens case to avoid dirt entering into the contacts.Following the above simple steps will make sure your contact lenses never harm your eyes. ",

The three dreaded sins which can make them harmful are: Not cleaning them*; <b>Wearing them too long (for your eyes) in one day</b>; Making them last too long**; The most common cause of harm is the second: Wearing them too long for the health of your eyes (appropriate time varies per individual). Your corneas need oxygen, the lenses reduce the amount of available oxygen and this causes the corneas to be compromised (at a varying rate per individual). Counter-intuitively, the longer you have worn contact lenses the more careful you should be.*one-time wear lenses being the exception, as they are discarded immediately and never re-worn.**all lenses are disposable after a variable number of wearings. Even with meticulous cleaning, build-up causes them to be less oxygen permeable over time. ",

            "answer_text": "I'd just like to kindly pop in on this thread and remind everyone thag the medical field is a business. The fine print on monthly lenses still prompts you to take them out nightly. Most optometrists will say no more than a week of wear and then to keep them out for an entire day afterwards. Patient lens overwear equals more money for optometric offices in terms of Dr's visits for eye infections and corneal ulcers. Optometrists who fail to mention the fine print (trust me, there are plenty) can prescribe these lenses to make more money for the reps who sell then as well as companies like Alcon, Acuvue, Baush and Lumb etc. My advice is to find an honest optometrist who listens to you and your needs and takes the time to fit you with the correct lenses. Not only that, but be 100% honest about your wear schedule so they can put you in the right ones. Treat your optometrist and ophthalmologist the way you'd treat a cardiologist or general practioner and you'll be good. ",
