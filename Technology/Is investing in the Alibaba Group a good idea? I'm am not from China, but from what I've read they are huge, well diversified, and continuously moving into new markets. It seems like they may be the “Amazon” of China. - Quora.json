It\u2019s a powerhouse not just in e-commerce, but in almost everything related to technology in China. My team and I wrote a deep research report why Alibaba Group (and other 5 Chinese tech companies) is definitely an amazing investment for the long term. To give you just a perspective of the dominance of Alibaba in China, I will put some statistics here, taken from the last Q3 2017 Financial Report and from Double 11 Event: Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE: BABA) announced that US$25.3 billion (RMB168.2 billion) of gross merchandise volume (GMV) was settled through Alipay on November 11, 2017, an increase of 39% compared to 2016. Mobile GMV settled through Alipay accounted for 90% of total GMVRevenue generated in Q3 2017 was RMB55,122 million (US$8,285 million), an increase of 61% year-over-yearMobile MAUs on our China retail marketplaces reached 549 million in September 2017, an increase of 20 million over June 2017Net cash provided by operating activities was RMB30,507 million US$4,585 million) and non-GAAP free cash flow was RMB22,505 million (US$3,383 million)Cloud computing revenue grew 99% year-over-year to RMB2,975 million (US$447 million), driven by both robust growth in paying customers and improving revenue mix to higher valued-added services. We are seeing significant traction and diversification of customers and revenue, and will continue to invest to further expand the market through valuable services for our cloud customers.During the quarter, we successfully executed our strategy of acquiring and developing a mixture of licensed and original content that resulted in greater consumer mind share in both the drama and variety show categories. As a result, daily average subscribers of Youku video subscriptions in creased over 180% year-on-year during the quarter ended September 30, 2017. We believe a strong content pipeline, especially with a focus on original content, offering greater flexibility around availability and distribution, will bring us sustainable long-term advantages in video entertainment.This picture could provide a better understanding of the financial health of the company:  Now, let\u00b4s see about the growth of the stock in the last 2 years, compared with Amazon (AMZN) and eBay (EBAY):  And, this is just a quick view of \u201cThe Alibaba Economy\u201d. There are more segments and business units inside it which cover travel, logistics, healthcare, retail, gaming, etc; and its amazing strategy about capital allocation has provided to the company an incredible leverage. So, Is Alibaba Group (BABA) a good investment for the long-term? A BIG YES from our research group. BABA is just one of the companies we analyzed in our report, there are 5 more to include to a savvy investing portfolio. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes definetly. Ali baba is currently at 185 at P/E ratio of 62! This means the Wall Street have already price the company about three to five years ahead of its potential earning growth capability. So invest now for a potential value in 2021. Providing the growth is in command. To do so they have to boost sales and exploit their own homeland to the max. They may have spread around the south east Asia region but they are not present else where yet. Try order aliexpress or alibaba stuff and let\u2019s see the import tax hit! Alibaba is developing Alipay, AI (not sure what) and better retail experience store in China. They are not really venturing anywhere but ecmmerce. For now their growth data looks good. Jack Ma needs to stop dressing up as Michael Jackson and karaoking on stage and instead focus on his company. One area which jack ma\u2019s plans might work is India. Unless jack brings a ground breaking tech there is nothing to sprout growth after the econmerce is done deal Dr Koh MooMooCoo.com Mad about investment and savings. ",
