            "answer_text": "That is normally a question you see on a year where the industrial design doesn\u2019t change (\u201cif it looks the same, it must be the same, right?\u201d). One would also expect it on a year where the screen size doesn\u2019t go up (and when a whole knew one is t introduced). So those make the 12 obviously absolutely not \u201cexactly like the 11 Pro\u201d You could argue none of that is important, but that would be a really different question. If you skip the obvious physical differences most of the other stuff on the phone has also been changed. From the CPU being about 20% faster to video encoding being 5x faster. Maybe you don\u2019t care about that (the 11 was already really fast, maybe 20% speed bumps don\u2019t matter). The advertising makes a big deal out of 5G, but I don\u2019t personally think it is a big deal, but it clearly isn\u2019t exactly like the 11. The cameras have various improvements\u2026and on and on. You can argue that if you have an 11 Pro the 12 (Pro?) isn\u2019t a compelling year over year upgrade. That is a subjective call, and I think for a huge number of people with an 11 it could be totally a correct one. Some people can also correctly assert that any camera improvement is worth buying because they are capturing memories that will never happen again. If that is how they feel it is probably correct for them. Likewise if you think the 11\u2019s pictures are good enough to capture your memories you are probably correct. However the big point of the 12 isn\u2019t to sell to people with an 11, it is to sell to people with 2 and 3 year old iPhones. To people with Android phones that might think about trying an iPhone. To someone with an iPhone 11 who accidentally ran it over with a car and need a new phone. That isn\u2019t to say some people don\u2019t (sometimes) buy a new iPhone year over year\u2026but they are not the target audience. ",
