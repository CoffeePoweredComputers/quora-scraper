Answers that can be easily looked up using a search engine or on a manufacturer\u2019s web site add to the noise level on Quora and make it harder to use for everyone. BTW, there are so many questions on here whose answers are easily found with simple web searches that I\u2019ve prepared this answer ahead of time in a text file (except for the specific link) and copied and pasted the whole thing.
