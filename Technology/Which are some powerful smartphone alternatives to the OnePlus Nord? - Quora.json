            "answer_text": "The OnePlus Nord appears to be a solid mid-range phone with a 90 Hz refresh rate for its OLED screen, has 5G connectivity, plus it is quite cheap too. The OnePlus Nord may not be available in the US, but the good news is that there are other options that will have the same powerful specs as that of the Nord. Here\u2019s what I found out: \u00b7 Realme X50. There are a few features that the X50 has in common with the Nord, such as the Snapdragon 765G chipset, quad-cam set up at the rear, and 30W charging. However, the X50 has a higher refresh rate at 120Hz for its LCD screen, plus it is cheaper too. \u00b7 Google Pixel 3a. This budget phone may not have the same quad-cam set up as the X50 and Nord, but its camera quality can easily match them. Expect regular updates from Google itself and a cleaner version of Android for easy usage. \u00b7 Apple iPhone SE 2020. Apple has also released an iPhone in the mid-range category which really turned heads when the news rolled out. Although it may appear like older iPhone models, the difference lies under the hood where you will find the latest A13 Bionic chipset. This is the same processor that is being used in their latest models which is quite impressive for a budget smartphone. ",

            "answer_text": "In this list, we have included competent phones that cost between Rs. 25,000 and Rs. 35,000. 1. Realme X3 SuperZoom Realme X3 SuperZoom is the closest existing competition to the OnePlus Nord. It\u2019s powered by Snapdragon 855+ that\u2019s assisted by LPDDR4x RAM and faster UFS 3.1 storage. It also has a more engaging camera system that includes a zoom camera. Realme uses an IPS LCD panel that supports a 120Hz refresh rate and there is a reliable and snappy side-mounted fingerprint sensor. The powerful chipset driving the X3 Zoom is duly assisted by ample LPDDR4x RAM and fast UFS 3.0 storage, thus making this a great choice for gaming. The handset has a 4200mAh battery with 30W fast charging. 2. Samsung Galaxy M51 Samsung Galaxy M51 comes with a monstrous 7000mAh battery and is yet surprisingly handly. This is a phone where all Samsung strengths align without being bogged down by a lackluster chipset. Yes, the Snapdragon 730G is one generation behind the Snapdragon 765G that powers the Nord, but it\u2019s still a powerful chipset that can ably drive Samsung\u2019s feature-rich and tasteful OneUI (which, by the way, also supports auto call recording). If you dearly value battery backup, you could choose the Galaxy M51 over 3. OnePlus 7T The last year\u2019s OnePlus 7T is very similar to OnePlus 8 in terms of hardware and hasn\u2019t yet been discontinued. It\u2019s sturdier than Nord, has stereo speakers, and should be a better option for people who prioritize gaming. 4. Vivo X50 Vivo X50 is remarkably handy and looks awesome. It\u2019s powered by Snapdragon 730 octa-core chipset and has a full HD+ AMOLED display. The handset is extremely light and has a decent set of cameras and weighs just 174.5 grams. In India, the Vivo X50 starts at Rs. 34,999 and is available at both online and offline stores with discounted offers. 5. Realme X2 Pro The Realme X2 Pro continues to be a relevant option that includes a 90Hz AMOLED display and a snappy in-display fingerprint reader. It\u2019s powered by Snapdragon 855+, has a 64MP Quad Rear Camera, up to 8GB of LPDDR4 RAM, and UFS 3.0 storage. 6. iQOO 3 iQOO 3 starts at Rs. 34,999 and is the most affordable phone to include Snapdragon 865 octa-core chipset. The flagship chipset is further assisted by up to LPDDR5 RAM and UFS 3.1 storage. The handset also has ROG Phone-like air triggers which should make it very appealing for FPS gamers. Other highlights include an AMOLED display, 4400mAh battery with 55W charging, and decent performing quad-rear cameras. 7. Xiaomi Redmi K20 Pro Xiaomi Redmi K20 Pro from last year continues to be a relevant option and a viable OnePlus Nord alternative. It\u2019s powered by Snapdragon 855 octa-core chipset, has an immersive, notch-free AMOLED display, pop-up selfie camera, 4000mAh battery with fast charging, and triple rear cameras. 8. Samsung Galaxy A71 The Galaxy A71 is a non-Chinese option that leverages several Samsung strengths and branding. It\u2019s powered by octa-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 730 chipset and runs OneUI software. 9. Asus 6Z Asus will bring in its Zenfone 7 series very soon and we are keeping our fingers crossed for a Snapdragon 765G powered OnePlus Nord alternative. Meanwhile, the 6Z from last year remains a decent option. It\u2019s powered by Snapdragon 865 octa-core chipset, has clean Zen UI software, a swanky flip camera, and a massive 5000mAh battery. 10. Lenovo Z6 Pro Lenovo is more active under it\u2019s Motorola branding in India. Nevertheless, the current Lenovo flagship, the Z6 Pro, is now available for Rs. 26,999, and it includes enticements like an HDR10 compliant AMOLED display and Snapdragon 855 octa-core chipset. ",
