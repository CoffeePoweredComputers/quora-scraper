            "answer_text": "Life at ICT Mumbai is actually fun and happening. It's a mixture of both highs and lows but awesome specially when you are a hosteller. The life at ICT hostels is really crazy and you will love it to the core. Late-night groupings, late night studies, rash birthday parties and just dancing and playing around is actually fun and memorable for life. Add to the fact that ICT Mumbai is situated at Matunga - one of the top 5 posh and urban places in Mumbai. There are a lot of food joints (specially South Indian food) at King Circle that is hardly located 5 minute walking distance from the college gate. Most of the professors at ICT are really cool but some of them can be a pain at times. The workload is kind of a bit on the higher side. Also, there are a lot of practicals and biometric attendance can irritate you sometimes. Overall, it's really a great place to be in whether you are serious about studies or extra co-curricular activities or music or painting or whatever, the college will provide you all the ample opportunities and network to make a mark. All you have to do is a bit of hard work and owing to the location advantage at Mumbai, you have everything at your disposal. ",
