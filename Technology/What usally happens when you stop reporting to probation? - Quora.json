            "answer_text": "If you are on probation and have a reporting requirement, a failure to report at the times and places required of you will constitute a violation of your probation. A warrant for your arrest may be issued and upon apprehension/arrest you will be brought back to the court whose probation you violated and face whatever penalties the court held in abeyance for the period of probation. This means that if the court had the authority to sentence you to a five year prison term for the underlying offense it could do so following your absconding probation and as fellow Quoran, Chuck Lee (no relation) has already noted absconding tolls the calendar on your probation. At your probation hearing constitutional guarantees of due process will afford you an opportunity to argue any defenses or mitigation for your actions and you likely would be entitled to an attorney in most jurisdictions in the US but the burden of proof is not beyond a reasonable doubt as it was in your trial or time of initial charging. Your probation hearing is more likely going to be an opportunity for you to argue the equities that may have arisen during the period of your absconding probation. If a considerable amount of time has passed and you\u2019ve managed to stay out of trouble and led a \u201clegally blameless\u201d life since, you may walk out with freedom restored and without the shackles of probation but if you\u2019ve picked up additional criminal charges or have violated other and more serious probation conditions you will face the full wrath of the court. whereupon you could be punished for the older probationary violation AND the new offense that you may have committed in the interim. As a general rule of thumb if you\u2019re on a reporting requirement for probation it\u2019s also likely you\u2019re on probation for a felony offense. felony warrants are always given higher priority by law enforcement so if you\u2019ve lapsed in your reporting requirements you should seek legal counsel immediately to mitigate its impact on whatever life you\u2019ve managed to establish following your failure to report. If the failure is for a brief period of time and unaccompanied by any other cause for concern to your probation officer, he/she may let it slide but don\u2019t push your luck. Deal with it and soon.

            "answer_text": "Well, if you keep it up long enough, eventually at PTR (Petition To Revoke; it\u2019s called different names in different jurisdictions) will be filed by the Probation officer or prosecutor. How long a period of nonreporting is long enough for a PTR varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, and may be very short if you are on augmented probation, such as daily reporting, Intensive Probation, or if you are on a specialized caseload, such as for sex offenders. Strictly speaking, one missed appointment is a violation, but very few departments are that rigid as a matter of policy. The officer will take steps to renew contact \u2014 not because it is her or his responsibility to maintain contact with you (it\u2019s exactly the other way around!) \u2014 but because it is the officer\u2019s duty to perform \u201cdue diligence,\u201d ensuring that when, not if, you are held accountable for your failure to maintain contact, it will be clear that the responsibility for the loss of contact is yours and yours alone. Those steps may range from a phone call or two or sending a letter or two, scheduling new opportunities for you to get back on track; perhaps a home or employer visit or two. When the PTR is filed, a warrant may be issued for your arrest, or a summons may be issued for a later court date. When you do appear in court, bond may be set and you may or may not be taken into custody. A hearing will be held regarding your failure to maintain contact. At that time, you will have opportunity to answer the charge of violating your probation, in much the same way that a defendant has opportunity to answer charges of lawbreaking in the first place: offering testimony, calling witnesses, plea negotiation, and so on. As with anything else, it is always in one\u2019s interest to stay on track when possible, and to get back on track as early and quickly as possible, and not to wait to be brought back, or dragged back.

            "answer_text": "I actually get this question a lot. It depends whether you're talking about misdemeanor probation or felony probation. Each state has a different standard when it comes to the rules of violating a probationer. A lot of states are now using Private Probation forms for misdemeanor probation. Once an individual is found to have basically absconded from probation meaning has not attended they were stopping their time which is known as Tolling. Also as in the state of Georgia a probation officer before asking for an arrest warrant must make good faith attempts in locating the individual prior to requesting the order. This includes checking all area hospitals and jails, at least two phone attempts at the phone number listed, A letter to last known address at least 10 days prior warning that an order of arrest will be made if no contact is made with probation officer. Not anyone who has ever been a misdemeanor probation knows that no PO is going to go through all that. And if it is pushed in court the judge would have no choice but to side with the defendant. Felony probation is a different story. Tolling is allowed and the burden of contact is less. The reason for this is that felony probation carries prison time if not completed. So if you have not seen your felony probation officer then you can expect a warrant to be issued and also you can expect a visit to your last known address. ",

            "answer_text": "Your PO will attempt to make contact with you by calling, sending an appointment card, and ultimately going to your house and job. If all those attempts, or some configuration of them, fails one is declared an absconder, fugitive, and reports are filed with the court; warrants are usually issued at this time if not already. Your time stops, tolls, your probation is suspended. This means your case does not expire, your probation will not run out. The same thing happens when people abscond from parole. Everything stops until they are apprehended. At that time a revocation hearing will probably be held, your probation revoked, and likely be incarcerated. Many things can be explained away, but absconding from supervision is not one of them. I have seen many people walk into a revocation hearing for several things and through attorneys and what not they walk back out still on probation. In my over 10 years of direct experience I have never seen anyone maintain probation after walking away. I am sure it has happened, but I've never seen it. ",

Instead, you agree to follow certain rules, such as reporting periodically, abstaining from drugs or even alcohol, getting a job, etc. In exchange, you get to finish your sentence outside of jail or prison by means of probation or parole. It's essentially a contract between you and the state or county. Any time left on your sentence doesn't go away until you successfully complete probation/parole. If you violate the terms of your release, you have violated the terms of your contract. This could result in the entire contract being revoked. Those five years you had left when you were released? Well, becauseause you didn't hold up your end if the agreement, you might wind up serving those five years behind bars. ",
