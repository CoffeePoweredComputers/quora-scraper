            "answer_text": "What Are Wide Area Networks WANs are large communication networks that connect locations over a wide geographical area, including cities, states, countries, and continents. Enterprise WANs are often built for one organization and are usually private. Often, they\u2019re created using leased lines involving a direct point-to-point connection between two private sites. A leased line is a direct connection between two points set up by a telecommunications carrier, like a T-1 channel. And while they resemble Local Area Networks (LANS) a great deal, WANs are structured and operate quite differently. WANS aren\u2019t new, they\u2019ve been around for a while with some people tracing their roots to the 1970s, 1980s and even the 1990s. That\u2019s when Frame Relay Service appeared as an alternative to the point-to-point service options then being offered. This new service offered numerous advantages including lower monthly costs, fewer physical connections to oversee, and less expensive router hardware to manage. In any case, WANs represented a viable communication option for businesses and remain so today. WANs Grow and Expand WAN technology has grown and expanded over the years. New technologies, services, and applications developed during that time, dramatically boosting their impact on business. Why are they so useful to businesses? Two Reasons: WANs let businesses use common resources to operate. They also let businesses share internal functions, like sales, R&D, accounting, and marketing throughout authorized locations through the network. Those two things boost productivity and communications. The latest development in this area is software defined WAN technology (SD-WAN) \u2014 a specific application of software defined networking applied to wide area network connections. The virtualized server and storage structure of the modern data center is an example of software defined networking. It makes the network more dynamic, manageable, and adaptable For example, a WAN often connects branch offices to a central corporate network or to connect data centers located great distances away. With SD-WAN, more of the network\u2019s controls are moved to the \u201ccloud\u201d using software. That lowers costs, reduces complexity, and increases flexibility. Plus, SD-WANs provide better security. Advantages of WANS If your company has branches in several locations, a wide area network is a viable option to boost productivity and increase internal communications. Below are some of the more critical business advantages to establishing a WAN: Centralizes IT infrastructure \u2014 Many consider this WAN\u2019s top advantage. A WAN eliminates the need to buy email or file servers for each office. Instead, you only have to set up one at your head office\u2019s data center. Setting up a WAN also simplifies server management, since you won\u2019t have to support, back-up, host, or physically protect several units. Also, setting up a WAN provides significant economies of scale by providing a central pool of IT resources the whole company can tap into.Boosts your privacy \u2014 Setting up a WAN allows you to share sensitive data with all your sites without having to send the information over the Internet. Having your WAN encrypt your data before you send it adds an extra layer of protection for any confidential material you may be transferring. With so many hackers out there just dying to steal sensitive corporate data, a business needs all the protection it can get from network intrusions.Increases bandwidth \u2014 Corporate WANS often use leased lines instead of broadband connections to form the backbone of their networks. Using leased lines offers several pluses for a company, including higher upload speeds than your typical broadband connections. Corporate WANS also generally offer unlimited monthly data transfer limits, so you can use these links as much as you like without boosting costs. Improved communications not only increase efficiency but also boost productivity.Eliminates Need for ISDN \u2014 WANs can cut costs by eliminating the need to rent expensive ISDN circuits for phone calls. Instead, you can have your WAN carry them. If your WAN provider \u201cprioritizes voice traffic,\u201d you probably won\u2019t see any drop off in voice quality, either. You may also benefit from much cheaper call rates when compared to calls made using ISDN circuits. Some companies use a hybrid approach. They have inbound calls come over ISDN and outbound calls go over the WAN. This approach won\u2019t save you as much money, but it will still lower your bill.Guaranteed uptime \u2014 Many WAN providers offer business-class support. That means you get a specific amount of uptime monthly, quarterly, or yearly as part of your SLA. They may also offer you round the clock support. Guaranteed uptime is a big plus no matter what your industry. Let\u2019s face it. No company can afford to be down for any length of time in today\u2019s business environment given the stringent demands of modern customers.Cuts costs, increase profits \u2014 In addition to eliminating the need for ISDN, WANs can help you cut costs and increase profits in a wide variety of other ways. For example, WANS eliminate or significantly reduce the costs of gathering teams from different offices in one location. Your marketing team in the United States can work closely with your manufacturing team in Germany using video conferencing and email. Saving on the travel costs alone could make investing in a WAN a viable option for you.WANS also provide some key technical advantages as well. In addition to providing support for a wide variety of applications and a large number of terminals, WANs allow companies to expand their networks through plug-in connections over locations and boost interconnectivity by using gateways, bridges, and routers. Plus, by centralizing network management and monitoring of use and performance, WANS ensure maximum availability and reliability. ",

            "answer_text": "A WAN (wide area network) allows a group of computers that are widely and/or geographically dispersed to communicate on their own exclusive network. Let's say you have a computer POS (point of sale) terminal in a JC Penneys/Autozone in Houston and your pos computer needs to make a billing inquiry from a billing server in El paso. This is done via a WAN that's typically composed of 100's if not 1000\u2019s of computer terminals or POS's. A WAN is simply a exclusive Network that connects you to a common server somewhere for purposes of billing, inventory, item tracking etc. It is not limited to retail though. A WAN reaches across all enterprises! Every seen the AT&T logo with the globe with blue bands going around it? Well that symbolizes a big WAN or network! ",
