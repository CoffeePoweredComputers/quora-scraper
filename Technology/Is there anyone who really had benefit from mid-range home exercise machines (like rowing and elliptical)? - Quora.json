The truth is that just about any machine will do you as much good as the effort you put in. If the effort is put in, these machines can help you get amazingly fit. That said, there are some big differences you should know about. The elliptical is definitely the easiest to start using because there is little technical ability required. Besides keeping a neutral back position (which should be done for just about everything) the elliptical guides your limbs to where they need to go. You can just get on and what you are supposed to do is obvious. The ergometer (rowing machine) is a very different beast. To get the most benefit out of a rowing machine, you have to invest some time to learn proper technique. This is best done by taking a class from a local rowing club (crossfit gyms are picking up the rowers, but the majority of them do NOT teach safe rowing form). Once you have the machine figured out, and can properly \u201cconnect\u201d for a whole stoke, the sky really is the limit. The machine trains the entire body and, if a good workout program is followed, will produce a very fit individual. For a workout plan that is easy to pick up, Concept 2 (most widely known maker of rowing machine) has a daily email that you can sign up for that gives you a workout every day with easy, moderate, and challenging options. The first thing to stress however, is that ANYTHING can be used to exercise and these two machines, like anything else, are only as productive as the person using them. Goodluck! ",
