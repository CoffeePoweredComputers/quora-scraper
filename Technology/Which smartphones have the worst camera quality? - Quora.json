            "answer_text": "Shock answer. My P20 Pro has terrible image quality from the selfie camera. It's soft rubbish and it's most likely the software. For what I paid (second hand) it's a good smartphone but really, its a poor copy of an iPhone. Although this has better battery life and performance I, in some ways, prefer my P9 Plus. The 3 times zoom is an attractive feature of the Pro. ",
