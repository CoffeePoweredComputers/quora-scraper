            "answer_text": "There are many websites offering free ebooks. Some of them are illegal, and authors don't get any payment for all the trouble they took to make the book. However, there are also several websites where authors voluntarily put up their books for free, perhaps offering better formats if you pay, or just voluntarily making their work more available to read. And there are some books whose copyrights have expired and can legally be put up for free. I'm going to list only the legal websites: Project Gutenberg is one place where people collect old books, whose copyrights have already expired. It's good for classics and other old books, but if you want more recent ones, you won't find many here.Leanpub is a website which allows people to put their books up with a minimum price. A lot of people decide to make the minimum price free, but the books also have a suggested price, which you can pay if you want to help fund the author as well as enjoying the book. It has mostly technical/computer-related books.Google Books has a huge collection of digitized ebooks. Some of them are available in whole; others have only an extract or a few chapters available as sampling. The website also lists other books for which it does not have digital editions, but just author/publisher/ISBN/... metadata.The Free eBooks section on the Kobo website has more modern ebooks such as contemporary novels and novellas, which it makes available for free (I'm not sure if you need to have an account, though).Feedbooks has a Public Domain section with books that have been put in the public domain (again, a lot of them are classics).bibliotastic.com allows indie authors to put their books up for free for readers to read and review. I just discovered it a few seconds ago, so haven't had a chance to check it out yet...There are many other websites like this which let you get free ebooks, legally. getfreeebooks.com, which, again, I've only just discovered, seems to regularly post links to places where new ebooks are released for free.  I know I'm emphasizing a lot on the \"legal\" bit. It's because I think authors should get compensated for the hard work they did creating the book, unless the voluntarily decide to give it up free. It's as much a reminder for myself as for others: I often get tempted to pirate books, too :P ",
