No matter what you do in programming, people will need your skills. Of course, more people get into programming, the lower the salaries will be, but the skill as such is needed a lot. Some companies do pay big bucks just to get the top talent, others scrape the bottom of the barrel for the cheapest ones. Choose where you want to be. You can get employed pretty easily if you have the skills.You can search for clients yourself and deliver.You can create websitesYou can create appsYou can create small applicationsYou can teach others how to code if you really know how to codeYou can consultYou can create something yourself and sell it to othersand more\u2026Of course, the more programming matures, the harder it gets to keep up with it.

            "answer_text": "Yes and no. If you only know one or a few, you have more experience in that and it makes you better. If you know several, you don\u2019t know any very well. If you only know one, you have less options of work. You you know many, you can keep changing jobs for better pay. Recruiters look at your cv and they see: 10 years of experience, only works with language1. Seems like a real expert. Team leaders think \u201cis someone limited and may be of little use\u201d so the chances of getting a great job and great payment may be little. Recruiters look at your cv and they see: 10 years of experience, works with language1, language2, language3, language4, language5. They read 10 years of experience in each, instead of 2 years of experience in each. Team leaders know that is someone valuable, that may need some more time to get to the best level, but can in a little time by of great value in something different. Freelancers should focus in 2 or 3. A lot of value to do something specific and limited in time. Someone looking for a permanent position in the company, should be more flexible. ",
