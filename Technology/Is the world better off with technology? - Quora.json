A child born today will have a completely different life than those who came before her or him. As older adults, we might get caught in the sticky trap of nostalgia and think of all that has been \u201clost\u201d in society as a result of technology. The child born today will have no comprehension of what has been lost. They will only know what they experience now. We can educate them about the \u201cpast\u201d, but the youth are our teachers for the future if we will listen and learn from them. ",
