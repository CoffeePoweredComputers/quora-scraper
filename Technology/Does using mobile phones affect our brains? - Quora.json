            "answer_text": "An interesting anecdote. While I have a science education in my background, I am not a medical doctor or medical researcher so you have to treat the following as anecdotal, not authoritative. I heard an interview on NPR back in the late \u201990s when the news was full of stories about a recent study that declared mobile phone usage was safe for human use. I am not certain but I believe the interview was with George L. Carlo, a fellow who was renown as an industry \u201cgo to\u201d guy whenever research was needed to counter law suits regarding the harmful effects to humans of some product of the industrial economy. The person interviewed (Mr. Carlo?) was involved in heading research to establish the safety of Agent Orange (a defoliant used in Viet Nam during the American involvement in that conflict & since associated with numerous health problems in veterans) as well as a separate study to establish the safety of silicone breast implants. The interviewee was discussing the reporting of the story regarding the study purportedly demonstrating the lack of danger from using mobile phones. In the interview he said that the reporting mischaracterized the conclusions of the study. He pointed out that cancer studies require a 20 year baseline to produce anything like conclusive results & mobile phones had only been in significant use for about 10 years. He went on to say that he believed there was enough anecdotal evidence of the dangers of radiation from mobile phone use that he recommended only using a mobile phone with a head set (earbuds?) & placing the phone as far away from your body as possible. Interestingly enough, starting about 10 years ago I noticed that the user manuals which accompanied your new mobile phone started to include verbiage in the small print (that nobody but the lawyers who wrote it ever reads) where it disavowed any legal responsibility on the part of the manufacturer for any health impacts that were the result of using their product. P.S. The science behind the health concerns discussed by Mr Carlo(?) were caused by the radiation produced due to the impact of the cell tower radiation on the mobile phone antenna (the antenna used to be external to the phone, these days, the antenna is internal). The cell tower radiation will produces a radiation \u201cplume\u201d when it impacts the mobile phone antenna. That plume apparently has the potential to cause damage to DNA strands in our cells that may eventually result in cancers. The potential for damage is proportional to the strength of the plume. The strength of the plume is related to the square of the distance from the source of the radiation (in this case, the cell phone tower(s)). Therefore, the further you are from the closest cell phone tower, the less the impact of the radiation. P.P.S. I was reviewing the following article: http://www.padrak.com/vesperman/Medical%20Hazards%20of%20Cell%20Phones%20Wi-Fi%20Wireless%20Devices%20and%20%20Smart%20Meters%20-%20Book%20Two%208.10.16.pdf Which includes materials from Mr. Carlo discussing the hazards of mobile phone radiation. It must be noted that after his involvement with mobile phones also included questionable hawking of products to supposedly protect you from the radiation. A rather curious fact since it was Mr. Carlo\u2019s research which purportedly demonstrated the safety of mobile phones. ",

            "answer_text": "Can a phone ruin your brain (memory, intelligence etc.)? Are you asking about physical damage from holding a phone to your ear? The idea that this can damage your brain has been around as long as cellphones have. I\u2019ve seen a number of studies of this question over the years and I haven\u2019t run across a single bit of hard evidence of any danger. This is just one of those zombie fears that refuses to die. But feel free to kill it off within your own brain. There are other hazards associated with cell phones that are truly serious, however. The biggest one is wandering around with your eyes glued to your phone and totally missing what\u2019s going on around you. I do a lot of people watching and I often wonder how people survive stepping off curbs without looking to check all the large objects hurtling in their direction. I suspect that more than a few Darwin Awards have been awarded for such behavior. There are also social hazards of using cell phones too much. Without eye contact and the full attention your friends deserve, you will just seem remote and disinterested in them even if you assure them that they have your \u201cfull attention.\u201d There is also a loss of intimacy with texting rather than speaking; just hearing the emotion in someone else\u2019s voice is an important part of social contact. I won\u2019t go all old-fogy on you and argue that you ought to stop using your cell phone when you are with other people. I doubt that\u2019s ever going to happen. But you might try moderating that habit a little. Your friendships will be closer and more rewarding if you do. ",
