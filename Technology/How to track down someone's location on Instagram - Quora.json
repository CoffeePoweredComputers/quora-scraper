            "answer_text": "In some cases you can track down the location of an Instagram user even if they use a pseudonym and do not provide any biographical data. Until a few years ago there was a location map for Instagram users showing where each photo was taken. With this feature it was easy to identify people\u2019s homes, workplaces and other locations. This feature was removed because of the obvious security problems and because few people used it for good reasons. There is another way to locate Instagram users based on their friends. Even if you use a pseudonym and never talk about real world locations, one of your Instagram friends might be using their real name and can help people to track you down. Someone intent on locating a user can start by looking for interactions with other users, perhaps comments made by those users on your photos. If that user has a real name ID and location someone can then look to see who that person interacts with on other sites. One of those other persons might be you. This is much more complicated but it is feasible. If you are trying to avoid being found then you should make sure that your location upload is disabled and avoid interacting with anyone else who has a real name account. But if you really don\u2019t want to be found the best policy is to avoid using Instagram altogether. A determined sleuth can probably find you if they want to. ",

That\u2019s a pin on a map for a location, it doesn\u2019t geo-tag with the exact GPS coordinates like your phone might store on a photo. What the other answers don\u2019t mention is the human (or computational) ability to use things like angles and backgrounds to give a more precise picture. If you had the skill, and quite frankly the time, you could determine where a person was when they were either taking or the subject of an image. It\u2019s the same sort of calculations they might make if they\u2019re trying to locate where a shooter may have been, for example. Now why you would want to do that, I don\u2019t know, I think it has been used in one of the CSI shows once or twice, but on a day to day basis, you wouldn\u2019t do it. If you were looking for someone, they\u2019d probably be gone by the time you did this, unless the area is fairly simple. ",

You can track location on instagram only if such user allows location on the post. This location can be seen on the top head of every post. There are also some apps and tricks which helps you get the location of a user. An app called Ready or Not?\u2014developed by a team at University of California, Berkeley\u2014allows people to plug in a Twitter or Instagram username and see where that person\u2019s been. If a phone\u2019s location settings were enabled, the app can create a heatmap of where it took photos using hidden GPS data. ",

At one point Instagram did have the photo map option, which enable you to see people photo locations on a map. However, Instagram did retire that feature sometime ago. With most social networking sites they do track most if not all of our activity. I do remember FB messenger did give you the ability to see people locations when your messaging. And there was a chrome extension you could use called Marauder Map to do so. This enabled you to see where people where messengering from at the time of sending messages. But at the current moment there is not much ability to track down people locations on Instagram, maybe if you\u2019re a good programmer/hacker then there is a slight chance. ",

For example if they were at Disney land and they post a picture in which they have the location enabled you are able to click the tab and see what place they are at. If you are a cop, there is probably PLENTY of ways to locate someone's EXACT location by using IP addresses and what not but I have no clue in how to do that so this is the best I can give you. :) ",
