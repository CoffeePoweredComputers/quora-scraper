            "answer_text": "Here how Government of India can use Artificial Intelligence : How artificial intelligence throws light on povertyThe method would assist governments and charities that are trying to fight poverty but that lack precise and reliable information on where poor people are living and what they need, the researchers based at Stanford University in California say.How artificial intelligence is changing economic theoryThe idea of rationality is a shared construct between AI and economics. When we frame questions in AI, we say: what are the objectives, what should be optimized and what do we know about the world we're in? The AI/economics interface has become quite fertile because there is a shared language of utility, probability, and reasoning about others.Should India Embrace Artificial Intelligence In Governance?Artificial Intelligence (AI) in governance is an idea whose time has come. The necessity is there \u2013 our people are growing ever more exasperated and demanding efficiency in public services delivery while the traditional systems seem to be unable to cater to these changing times.Rewiring India's Bureaucracy and Governance With Artificial IntelligenceThe need and applicability for AI is more urgent in the remotest areas of the country than in the heart of the capital. Because it is in these remotest areas that traditional governance systems are totally broken.P.s : Last but not the least, endless opportunities are there . We Need Think Tanks who can apply their knowledge for maximum automated productivity . ",

            "answer_text": "Some obvious use cases I can think of: Public Health: I will talk about one particular use case as its related to a project we have been working on ParallelDots . Heard of Tuberculosis (TB) ? Its a disease that used to be treatable until the 1940s, but then drug resistant versions of it emerged and it is becoming a challenge to Indian healthcare. India\u2019s rate of Drug Resistant TB is way higher than the world average. Between 2006 and 2014, TB caused a damage of $340 Billion to Indian economy. Around half a million people die in India every year due to TB. The reason is that detection and diagnosis of TB needs to be more prompt and treatment should be enforced to avoid drug resistant TB to spread. The government of India has come up with a new TB policy in 2017 which aims to have a 4 pillar DTBP of which the first pillar D (or diagnose) aims to have a high sensitivity diagnosis. How can AI help you ask ? By acting as a diagnosis agent as we try to show in our latest work: [1801.07080v1] Towards Automated Tuberculosis detection using Deep Learning . Its not just that, rural health can become much better with other AI technologies like Chest XRay reader (link to our work here: [1711.08760v1] Boosted Cascaded Convnets for Multilabel Classification of Thoracic Diseases in Chest Radiographs ). TB bacteria looks like this and can be spotted using Convnets:  Chest XRay diagnosis has become a popular topic of research with the recent release of dataset by Wang et al.  Farmer Benefit: Crops and Domestic Animal symptoms can be diagnosed just by taking a snap and using AI to come up with possible diagnosis in a similar way as human diseases above.    Security and Surveillance: Different people might have different opinions about this usecase, but the truth is that the technology is being used by multiple governments already to prevent terrorist attacks, respond quickly to emergencies like accidents, robberies and fire.   Feedback: The government needs to listen to people, listen to how they think about various issues and work accordingly. While, there are now methods to collect data of people\u2019s opinion, analyzing opinion of 1 billion+ people (and millions of super active bots) is not humanly possible. Enter AI. AI can help you take opinions, filter out bots and then come up with a conclusion about what people think.  Smart City and their Planning: Planning to build roads for a smart city or building a system which automatically controls traffic in a way to reduce jams? AI is your friend.  ",

Data is the center to all these technologies to produce good output. The data available can be processed and applications can be written to govern in other areas such as smart energy infrastructures that would channelize optimum use of energy at anytime of the day, smart agriculture that will help in increased productivity of agricultural output with reduced cost and eliminating wastage, reducing corruption and overhead costs in the government departments and hence delivering government services to consumers in a very optimum way.
