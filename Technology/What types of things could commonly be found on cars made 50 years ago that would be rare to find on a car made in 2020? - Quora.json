            "answer_text": "What types of things could commonly be found on cars made 50 years ago that would be rare to find on a car made in 2020? Let\u2019s see\u202650 years ago\u2026.that would be 1970. Now, this is from the American perspective and will discuss mostly American made cars since \u2018imports\u2019 had not achieved the saturation in the U.S. market that they have today. If you went to a new car dealership in October of 1970, you might have done so just to see what the offerings by the \u2018Big Three\u2019 were for the 1971 model year since the \u201971 models were usually introduced around the end of September in most cases. There would be some exterior styling changes and some interior trim changes from the 1970 models and there might be some changes in the \u2018available options\u2019 for the new model. Now, \u2018standard\u2019 and \u2018optional\u2019 equipment varied depending the line offered by the manufacturer. American auto manufacturers at that time usually had three \u2018platforms\u2019. a \u2018compact\u2019, \u2018intermediate\u2019 and \u2018full size\u2019 platform. three different sizes of cars and even in the same platform they offered different levels of equipment. But, for the \u2018average\u2019 new American car for 1971 most of them had much in common. Unless you bought a higher end offering that had many standard features that are optional on the lower models of the same car one of the first things you would notice is\u2026window cranks. A crank to raise and lower the windows. Power windows were an option on most cars and not even offered on some cars. Want to lock the doors? you reached up and pushed a knob on the window sill down. On all the doors. A few cars had central locking and power locks might be available on some models. What\u2019s this, no power seats? and just one wide seat in the front and not two individual seats? That\u2019s an option (extra cost) on many cars at the time. Now there might be a gear shift on the column since the \u2018automatic\u2019 transmission was becoming more common though at optional cost. But on a lower level \u2018economy\u2019 car the shift lever might control a three speed manual transmission. Stick shifts in a console on the floor were available on many cars but again, an extra cost option. The car you are looking at on the showroom floor may have an AM radio in the dash or the optional AM/FM or AM/FM tape player (8 track). Now let\u2019s open the hood. Unless it\u2019s a \u2018compact\u2019 economy car from that particular manufacturer, you will probably find a cast iron V-8 under the hood. There were still plenty of in-line six cylinders around but those would be found on the cheaper compacts and intermediates. And you could find a carburetor under the air cleaner. If it\u2019s an intermediate or full size car it might have the optional power brakes and/or power steering. Maybe even air conditioning. But these were extra-cost options on most cars. Other things you might not notice unless you crawled around under the car \u2026 drum brakes all around. And only a couple of weird American cars were front wheel drive. Rear wheel drive was the norm. I could go on and on but you get the idea. New cars sold in American in 1970 were considerably different than the cars of today. ",
