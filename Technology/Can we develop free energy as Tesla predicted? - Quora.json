This is my latest work: download here: Free energy in 8 steps fin Free Energy in 8 & The REAL Philosopher\u2019s Stone By Thor Fabian Pettersen Trysil, 04.09.2017 [14991 words; 31 pages + front page] I believe that: The dual snakes = the dual torus The wings = free energy That is, the dual torus makes free energy Free Energy in 8 & The REAL Philosopher\u2019s Stone (ebok) \u2013 ISBN 978-82-690445-9-1 To my son. Before reading: This is not physics. This is amateur philosophy (i.e., philosophy that has not come out of the great halls of Academia.) Look at it in that light. And, please review my older versions in that light also, that is, I might have flung around some terms like \u201cforce,\u201d which means something completely different in my paper according to some guys I found on the web. I am not trained in physics, so please do not judge this work from that point. The philosophy in this work took over 10 years to accomplish. My idea: We came from nothing. Nothing, or nothingness, is always hot and ordered. This nothingness is the beginning of time. This nothingness equals fast spin that generates a zero-dimensional world. This world is all there really is and therefore the world will spin forever because there exists no external agent that can change the Eternal Picture, and therefore, the picture of the forever spinning zero-dimensional world will always obtain. This zero-dimensional world generates a space-time net that will expand outwards. The outward expansion of the net we see as the Big Bang. The zero-dimensional world is always there, even as the net expands. Therefore, in the universe, that is, in the expanded net, there will be these pockets or holes that lead directly to the zero-dimensional world. \u201cDead\u201d matter that falls into these pockets will be ordered again because the zero-dimensional world is always hot and ordered, and thus free energy is accomplished. A clean and very simple idea. We shall in this paper try to argue for why my idea must obtain. Hot = fast spin Ordered = if you have a box with \u201cordered gas,\u201d and then you open the box, then the gas will spread out into the environment and become disordered. However, if the environment shrunk to the size of the box, then the disordered gas would have no choice but to go back into the box. However, the disordered gas would still be disordered in the box because the box has dimensions, and therefore the probability that the atoms in the gas would rearrange themselves just the way they were in the beginning before we opened the box is close to zero. However, if the box had zero extension, then the disordered gas would become totally ordered again because all the atoms would have no choice but to go back into the same slot, which is the zero-dimensional point/world. We can accomplish this 0D point/world with fast spin. You can object and say that 0D is impossible and thus reject my idea based on that. However, I believe that 0D is the actual nothingness that birthed us. Proposition 1: If Motion is inherent in Nature, and the cuboctahedron is the system we call Motion (according to Richard Buckminster Fuller), then nothing, nor anyone, can change the Eternal Picture where Motion is ever operating. This is perpetual motion. However, do not equate this perpetual motion with a perpetual motion machine. If this proposition is reasonable, then we move on to the next. Defending proposition 1: A major red flag, some guys on the web said, was that I had never opened a book on physics in my life. I tried to tell them that I do philosophy, so the major red flag is just a silly attack. I mean, I could become the great Michio Kaku, and my ultimate answer to life, the universe and everything would be something like, \u201c[...] For example, you have to add energy to the earth in order to tear it away from the sun. One separated far from the solar system, the earth then has zero gravitational energy. But this means that the original solar system had negative energy. If you do the math, you find out that the sum total of matter in the universe can cancel against the sum total of negative gravitational energy, yielding a universe with zero (or close to zero) net matter/energy. So, in some sense, universes are for free. It does not take net matter and energy to create entire universes. In this way, in the bubble bath, bubbles can collide, create baby bubbles, or simply pop into existence from nothing.\u201d \u2014Michio Kaku Any philosopher would be appalled by this reasoning. Why? Because, nonexistence cannot give birth to existence, period. Let us hear what a great philosopher has to say about it, \u201cWe are asked by science to believe that the entire universe sprang from nothingness [nonexistence], and at a single point and for no discernible reason. This notion is the limit case for credulity. In other words, if you can believe this, you can believe anything.\u201d\u2014Terence McKenna Note that I assume that Michio Kaku means nonexistence when he says \u201cnothing.\u201d I think my judgment here is fair as Michio Kaku states, \u201cExistence from nothing.\u201d That is, if Michio Kaku meant \u201cexistence\u201d when he said \u201cnothing,\u201d then all he did was to give us a tautology, namely, \u201cExistence from existence.\u201d I also believe that Terence means \u201cnonexistence\u201d in this context for the same tautology-reason. Terence is, of course, absolutely right! There is no thing in the universe that can make sense of an existence arising from nonexistence. Therefore, proposition 1 obtains. Existence, which is ultimately motion (we shall argue for this later), will therefore \u201calways be on the move.\u201d That is, Motion never began to move. Motion, or moving things, has always been on the move. However, if we assume that moving things have always been on the move, then we are faced with a paradox called \u201cinfinite regress.\u201d That is, imagine an atom traveling in space. Where did it come from? Follow the atom\u2019s orbit back in time and space and ask yourself: \u201cDid it begin \u201cover here?\u201d Or, did it start its life \u201cover there?\u201d\u201d Wherever in the room the atom is located, you will quickly learn that the atom cannot have begun its journey, neither \u201chere\u201d nor \u201cthere,\u201d because you can always put \u201cthe start button\u201d somewhere else. The atom\u2014or the smallest unit you can imagine\u2014must have started its journey \u201cbeyond\u201d or \u201coutside\u201d the walls of space-time. For the same reason, so it must be for all atoms. That means that we can simply throw all the atoms in the dustbin, that is, apart from a single atom. If we manage to explain how a single atom came to be, then we can explain the origin of all atoms and solve the problem of infinite regress. In other words, we have reduced the complex universe down to a single atom! The atom must have started its journey \u201cbeyond\u201d space-time. But, this is metaphysics. We will have none of that. We live in a physical world. So, whence came the atom? Where did it come from? If we manage to solve the riddle, then we will have answered the question of all questions, \u201cHow did it all begin?\u201d My answer is the following: The atom cannot have started its journey in space-time, neither right nor left, up, down; here or there, or \u201cbeyond.\u201d Q: But, then there are no more places to choose from! A: Yes, there is. There is one state we have not tried. Welcome to Albert Einstein\u2019s Imaginarium: The Train to Nowhere: Let us imagine two trains; and, let\u2019s call them Train A and Train B. Let Train A locomote as fast as you can imagine. Let Train B locomote at half the velocity. Now, imagine Train A again, but this time, double its speed, and keep doubling until, Train A, from its perspective, looks back at Train B and ... what does Train A see? Train A sees Train B as frozen in time. That is, Train A sees Train B as not moving at all. But, Train B is moving. Or is it? If Train A covers the distance twice as fast as before, then Train A must see Train B as moving twice as slow as before, therefore, now, Train B has covered half the ground as before. If you keep doubling, then Train A will eventually move so fast relative to Train B that Train B is unable to cover any ground by the time Train A has covered its ground and continually so. You can represent this as a scale that grows and grows in which the distance traversed by Train B gets smaller and smaller until the only meaningful distance traversed by Train B is marked as a dot; or not at all. Here comes the Key to Understanding: Let Train A always move that fast. Let Train A have moved that fast since eternity. In this new picture, Train A does not see everything as frozen, rather, and this is the most crucial point of all time: Train A sees nothing at all. How come? Because, from Train A\u2019s point of view, if everything were eternally frozen, then that means that nothing has ever moved, and, if nothing has ever moved, then we cannot have \u201cspace-time\u201d or \u201ceternally frozen\u201d either. Without space and time, we have no history or trajectory. Without history, we cannot have frozen things. Thus, from Train A\u2019s point of view, there is only nothingness. That is, from Train A\u2019s point of view, there is no visible space-time. From Train A\u2019s point of view, we can say that we have absolute space-time, that is, space-time that does not follow the ordinances of relativity. That is, if you are small, then someone else has to be big. This is relativity. However, if you move so fast that you are completely alone, then you are neither fast nor slow because you have no one to compare yourself with. You are something else. You may be both. In other words, we take, say, the atom, and then we give it to the Thor with the Hammer, and then the thunder god hurls the atom with all the might in the universe. Imagine the atom as it travels faster and faster in space-time, eventually, by the power of Thor, the atom will travel so fast that it ... disappears. Everything arose from nothingness, is my answer. Nothingness is an eternal force that is so fierce, fast and strong that it bends space-time into a knot that has, literally, no extension or propagation\u2014the zeroth-dimension. But, you must note that the zeroth-dimension is always there; the zeroth-dimension can never go away. To solve the paradox of Motion, Nature has found the ultimate solution: speed\u2014which is why she employs the cuboctahedron as it is built for ultimate speed. To solve the paradox of Motion, Nature has found the ultimate solution of spinning so fast that we have no movement or nothingness at the beginning of space-time. This intense form of Motion must always be there. It has not been created and, it cannot perish. My hypothesis is: Nature employs the cuboctahedron as it is built for ultimate speed. Google Richard Buckminster Fuller if you want to know why or how the cuboctahedron is built for speed. Note: My nothingness here is not the same as nonexistence. My nothingness is existence itself. To sum up thus far: We solve the infinite regress paradox with \u201cspeed.\u201d If we solve the infinite regress paradox with \u201cspeed,\u201d then it follows that existence itself is \u201cspeed\u201d therefore \u201cspeed,\u201d as we saw above, is the Prime Mover that resolved the infinite regress paradox. Q: But, why will, say, the cuboctahedron always spin? Why will it never stop? A: Liken the cuboctahedron to an object that is traversing through space. If there exists no thing that can influence the object, then it will continue to move at a constant velocity forever; the object will never slow down. Why? It is simple: 1. Take a paper and a pencil. 2. Do not write on the paper. 3. The paper remains unaffected by the pencil. That is, common sense will tell you this. Likewise, if the cuboctahedron is all there is and, if the cuboctahedron has always spun, then it will continue to spin forever because there is no one influencing it; there is no one to stop it. \u201cYou are applying Newton\u2019s First Law wrong,\u201d they will say. I disagree because Nature is undivided (we shall argue for this later), which means that I can take all motion everywhere and put a big M on it, so the motion becomes Motion. And, the Motion, which is everything, knows nothing external to it and therefore, by the law of common sense, the Motion will continue to move at a constant velocity for all time. This velocity is a speed that is so fast that the Motion becomes Motionless. However, this frozen Motionlessness is not the opposite of Motion; this frozen Motionlessness is not the same as \u201cMotion has stopped\u201d (if Motion stopped (i.e., the opposite of speed), surely existence would break apart). This frozen Motionlessness is Motion that is really fast, so fast that we solve the infinite regress problem. The infinite regress only occurs in a dimension with external properties such that the objects in it have trajectories through it. If, on the other hand, the objects lived in a zero-dimensional world, then the objects would have no trajectory and thus we solve the infinite regress paradox. Note that objects will not fit in a zero-dimensional world. On the other hand, fast speed\u2014the speed of light, in fact\u2014can make this zero-dimensional world. The reason why you can\u2019t move faster than the speed of light is simple: You cannot make a dimension that is less than the zeroth-dimension. That is, if you have accomplished zero extension, then adding more speed will not make a difference. Why Proposition 1 obtains: If Motion is not inherent in Nature, then we have to assume that existence, that is, motion, can come from nonexistence. If Motion were to stop, then Motion would not be inherent in Nature because we have no Unmoved Mover or Prime Mover like nonexistence that can set it going again. However, existence (undivided Motion) knows no external agent that can slow it down or stop it completely, therefore, existence will always move at a constant velocity for all time. The reason why existence knows no external to it is because of the nature of the undivided. If all is undivided or one, then you cannot fragment Nature in order to make sense of some magic external agent that could interfere with existence and kill it. So, again, existence will always move at a constant velocity. But, this is the infinite regress paradox, \u201cIf Motion does not have a starting point, then it goes back indefinitely.\u201d So, either it goes back indefinitely, in which case the Motion has no ground and therefore, it cannot exist. Or, the infinite regress terminates and we have a First Mover. William Lane Craig points out that this must be God. Moreover, Craig is absolutely right, that is, I read his work and he puts Michio Kaku\u2019s reasoning to shame; but, that is because Craig is a really talented philosopher while Michio seems to have no reflections whatsoever (viz., existence popping from nonexistence because my math says so) when it comes to the Primum Movens of the universe. No. Craig is right, the logic is flawless, that is, God is the only thing that makes sense here. Michio Kaku and his \u201cpop into existence from nothing,\u201d does not make sense. However, there is one problem: I am an atheist. I do not believe in a skyhook-God. Therefore, I had to come up with a Prime Mover that had the power of God, yet, at the same time, our Prime Mover had to be more atheist-friendly. So, I came up with a really ingenious First Mover: speed. Note: Prime Mover = First Mover = Unmoved Mover (they are the same) (As an atheist, I am open-minded to the possibility of a crane-God. Even Richard Dawkins is open for that possibility.) With my First Mover, we do not need God; here is why: My Nothingness (viz., ultimate speed) is the ultimate Unmoved Mover/First Mover; that is, that which does not move, but causes something else to move. \u201cBut something like that does not exist! Does it?\u201d A picture of a naked lady is a good example of an Unmoved Mover, eh? All jokes aside: Imagine that you have a home stereo. You listen to it and turn up the volume. Imagine that you could just continue to turn up the sound without busting the speakers or your ears. Let the sound = Motion/movement. Let no sound = Motionlessness/no movement. The dictionary says that the opposite of movement is no movement. But, what if motion = no motion? Again, we must let Nature decide what is what. Okay. Turn up the home stereo and continue to crank up the volume. Finally, the sound will be so high that you can no longer hear it. The movement has passed on to no movement. But that does not mean that no movement = you cannot get things going. That\u2019s wrong. No movement or Motionlessness (i.e., nothingness) is such an intense form of Motion that everything around you starts spinning while you yourself (i.e., the nothingness) are or remain motionless. In other words, nothingness did not set the universe directly going, but indirectly via always \u201cspinning.\u201d I believe that our \u201cindirectly\u201d here is the \u201cknowhow\u201d which Neil deGrasse Tyson asked Lawrence Krauss about. Let us imagine nothing: Imagine sitting on a beam of light looking back at the universe. What would you see? You would see everything as frozen in time. However, if things were eternally frozen, then there was no time in which things could freeze. Consequently, then, since we have no time in which anything can ever be, we have no thing. Nothingness. But, there is more: since we have no time in which anything can ever be, we also have no time in which anything can ever decay. That is, from the light\u2019s point of view, there was always nothingness and ORDER. In addition, we have free energy! That is what free energy is, that is, an eternally existing ORDER. This order will always reset the clocks, so to speak, and make unavailable energy become available again. To sum up proposition 1: If the other propositions hold (below), then we have made a solid case for why the torus (dual) should continue to expand and contract forever without the aid of energy. That is, the torus (dual) is the nothingness. That is, I do not care what your physics book says. In a hundred years, it will say something completely different. Philosophy\u2019s strong points will last forever. That is, the pinnacle of physics was greatly summarized by Kaku, \u201cExistence from nothing.\u201d Tell me where I am \u201cnot in touch with reality,\u201d and where you physicists are. And, if it is not \u201cExistence from nothing,\u201d then it is \u201c... two branes colliding causing the Big Bang.\u201d Yes, that solves the infinite regress problem by adding more infinite regress! And, where did the branes come from? Where did the strings come from? One cop-out solution physicists tend to make is that, \u201cTime itself started at the Big Bang, so there was no before.\u201d Well, this is that incongruous thing the so-called experts do over and over again. You could say that, in the beginning was the great Ice Cube, and then it melted. The melted part is time such that time really did start at the Big Bang. But, there is a difference, before the Big Bang, you have an Ice Cube, that is to say, you have a time that is not melted, so to speak. But, you always had the thing we call \u201ctime.\u201d If you say, \u201cTime itself started at the Big Bang, so there was no before.\u201d And, we translate that as: \u201cIn the beginning ... was not the great Ice Cube, in fact, there was nothing at all, and then it melted.\u201d This is that quote again, \u201cWe are asked by science to believe that the entire universe sprang from nothingness [nonexistence], and at a single point and for no discernible reason. This notion is the limit case for credulity. In other words, if you can believe this, you can believe anything.\u201d\u2014Terence McKenna That is, you have to have the Prime-Ice-Cube-Mover. In addition, only God can melt the Ice Cube, according to William Lane Craig. However, I too have an Ice Cube, and it can melt stuff and still stay cold! That is ingenious! That is, I do not care what your physics book says. In a hundred years, it will say something completely different. In other words, you can take your major red flag and your physics book and go to a place where you [physicists] can believe anything. I hear it is full of jeweled self-dribbling basketballs! Proposition 2: As the cuboctahedron spins, it generates the torus (in actuality the dual torus therefore Nature likes symmetry). I believe that the outward expansion of the torus is the Big Bang. Defending proposition 2: It is a simple defense: Build the cuboctahedron and then fold or spin it, and see if you get the torus. Proposition 3: The torus is ever expanding and contracting due to proposition 1. That is, the torus shrinks the space-time into a zero-dimensional point without using energy. Defending proposition 3: The torus shrinks the space-time into a zero-dimensional point without using energy because the torus is a zero-dimensional point; therefore, it does not need to shrink per se. See \u201cDefending proposition 1:\u201d Proposition 4: Available energy, or what will later become available energy, starts its journey at the beginning of time. The toroidal core or the zero-dimensional point is the beginning of time. The toroidal core has always been hot and ordered due to proposition 1. Defending proposition 4: See \u201cDefending proposition 1:\u201d Proposition 5: Available energy turns to unavailable energy as the universe expands and cools. Defending proposition 5: If you have a box with gas, and then you open the box, then the gas will spread out into the environment. What are the chances that the gas will fly back into the box? I believe, close to zero. Likewise, energy will spread. However, if you would gather the said energy back into the box, then you could reuse the energy. And, if you could gather the said energy back into the box ad infinitum without using energy yourself, then you have, on your hands, free energy. That is, if you eat a cake, and then it respawns after you eat it, then you have free cake. This is my whole free energy idea: Proposition 1 makes the torus expand and contract forever, so the whole environment gets squashed back into the \u201cbox.\u201d The energy that was spread out into the environment, had no choice but to go back into the \u201cbox.\u201d Hence, we can reuse the old energy ad infinitum because proposition 1 makes the torus expand and contract forever, and thus the torus eternally recycles matter. The \u201cenvironment\u201d might contain local zero-dimensional pockets that, when dead matter or tori fall into them, they are revived. That is, the torus does not need to shrink the entire universe for the production of free energy. Proposition 6: If the unavailable energy entered the toroidal core where the unavailable energy began its life, then the unavailable energy would become hot and ordered again, that is to say, the unavailable energy would become available again. However, it is not the energy per se that enters the toroidal core in order to be reanimated; it is the tori themselves that, having once been close together, now find themselves spread apart as the universe expands and the mechanical work is done. If these tori can once more cluster, then they can once more produce energy that is ready to do mechanical work. Defending proposition 6: If you need four men to lift a car and one man is in China while the other one is in Peru, the third one is, nobody knows where he is, then the fourth one is unable to lift the car. However, if you have a cosmic vacuum cleaner that ever runs on inherent motion instead of energy, then your cosmic vacuum cleaner could suck in these men and spew them out where they needed to be, and then all four men could lift the car. That is, energy is synergy. But, as the universe expands and cools, the men find themselves separated. Free energy, then, is to \u201cemploy\u201d the inherent motion, which is the very beginning of time. I do not reckon that someone have tried this one! They say that the past \u201cis\u201d in the past, but what if the past \u201cwas\u201d with us here in the present? And, so, we can use it! That is, the beginning of time is not something long ago in a galaxy far away. The beginning of time is a point on a geometric creature. I believe that the beginning of time is the center point in the cuboctahedron. Therefore the nothingness has ever spun, the question, \u201cWhen did the Big Bang take place?\u201d should be replaced by, \u201cWhere did the Big Bang take place?\u201d If the nothingness is a zero-dimensional point, then the eternal spin of the nothingness is not a mystery when, from the point of view of the nothingness, there is no motion or spin. Just imagine sitting on a beam of light, if you disagree. That is, real motionlessness = fast motion. \u201cWhen did the first Big Bang take place?\u201d only makes sense if time is real. However, time is not real. Time is a survival tool of the animal brain. I believe that our brain makes the space-time, just like your PlayStation makes the game world as you move in it. Another reason to believe that our brain makes space-time: The man in the mirror fancies you equally backwards as you fancy him. And, can you really tell which side you are living on? The Mirror World is not strange; what is strange is \u201cthe normal world,\u201d or, what we call \u201cnormal.\u201d This is another reason to believe the universe is an illusion; for why should nature be \u201cwired\u201d according to our point of view or side of the mirror? Why is our world the right world and the Mirror World the wrong world? They are both right, which means we live inside an illusion. \u201cWhen did the first Big Bang take place?\u201d will ever generate infinity paradoxes. I.e., what happened before the Big Bang ... what happened before the before and so on. \u201cWhere did the Big Bang take place?\u201d solves the problem because now, [the before] is simply the timeless, spinning nothingness and, [when] is actually [where] the outward expansion of the timeless, spinning nothingness or the torus starts (see below). The timeless, spinning nothingness = the dual torus. Proposition 7: The inherent motion in proposition 1 ever animates the torus, and the torus, in turn, ever contracts, which means that it is ever sucking in smaller tori in the environment that then become ordered in the toroidal core; then the bigger torus expands and the smaller tori are released fully ordered. Defending proposition 7: I believe we can test this in our garage. But, I need time, money, experts... Proposition 8: Put this dual torus device in your car and then your device or other tori in the universe can suck in the dead tori from the environment and revive them again. Then your device can use the revived tori to propel your car. The revived tori are used as fuel, and then the fuel is spread out into the environment (again). Then your device can suck in more dead tori from the environment and revive them (ad infinitum). This is real free energy therefore the inherent motion in proposition 1 ever brings you fuel. Note: I believe therefore that matter can be made after the initial Big Bang. That is, our earth could be growing! Defending proposition 8: Q: Why does not the sun utilize free energy and burn forever if free energy is the primal principle of the cosmos? A: The torus is expanding and contracting simultaneously, this creates stability, in other words, the torus is an immortality-machine. That is, the immortality-machine is the torus\u2019 stability plus the fact that the torus can spin forever due to proposition 1. The sun, on the other hand, uses these immortality-machines as fuel, but the sun itself is not such a machine. When the fuel is used up, the sun dies. That is, free energy happens in the world of the very small, thus I believe that we must amplify the process if we shall make use of it. Q: If free energy really is the primal principle of the cosmos, then why don\u2019t animals live on free energy? I mean, why eat other animals in order to survive if free energy is true? A: If it is energy you want, then you could just eat dirt! Free energy is not free energy from some magical land. Free energy is normal energy that was recycled at the beginning of time. That is, when you eat normal food, you are eating free energy! A new thought: The immortality-machine is the torus\u2019 stability plus the fact that the torus can spin forever due to proposition 1 = an eternal universe that is non-static (i.e., ever flowing from the nothingness). That is, what we perceive as the Big Bang is just our current jet of space-time that gushed out of the fountain of nothingness some 14 billion years ago; however, the fountain did not close; it is ever flowing, producing an eternal universe. However, this is just speculation. Add on: The zeroth-dimension is accomplished with the full speed of the spinning cuboctahedron. I call this dimension \u201cthe nothingness.\u201d Out of the nothingness, space-time is generated. Space-time may be the spin-off, and literally so, of the nothingness-generation. Nature is ever spinning due to proposition 1 and, therefore, there is ever a constant struggle to reach the center of the whirlpool; the ones that do not make it expand outward; we see this as the Big Bang. The toroidal core spins so fast that, from the toroidal core\u2019s point of view, everything is frozen; but, if that is an eternal fact, then we do not get frozen things but a great nothingness as there never was a time in which time or objects could freeze. This state is the true Unmoved Mover. There are good philosophical reasons to believe that: that which is not dependent on an infinite series (i.e., infinite regress), can be self-generated, that is, exist by the virtue of your own nature. This is because you do not require a prior cause for your existence ... you can thus find the cause for your existence within yourself. In the case of the zero-dimensional point, then its cause is its essence, that is, its existence is a brute fact. What do I mean by that? I mean, if you strip away all the objects in the room, then you are still left with the room; so, now, you strip away the room. But, no matter what you do, you always end up with a zero-dimensional point. You cannot strip away the zero-dimensional point because the zero-dimensional point has no extension in space and time. That is, the zero-dimensional point is the only thing that is truly absolute. And, the zero-dimensional point can generate space-time because the zero-dimensional point is motion. That is, it is not that the zero-dimensional point contains motion, and, it is not that motion is the zero-dimensional point, as it were! No. It is something a lot stranger: the zero-dimensional point is what motion is. Let me explain: We perceive motion as \u201cthings that move,\u201d but that may just be our animal brain translating real motion into something that aids survival. The animal doesn\u2019t need the whole timeless film. The animal may just need to perceive some scenes from the film. Again: That which is not dependent on an infinite series (i.e., infinite regress), can be self-generated, that is, exist by the virtue of your own nature. The zeroth-dimension/nothingness/maximum velocity state is such a creature because it is unmoved and therefore does not require causes like objects that have moved do. That is, if you moved \u201cover here,\u201d then there is a cause that explains the trajectory of you moving \u201cover there;\u201d on the other hand, if you have remained unmoved for eternity, then you do not require a cause in order to explain your non-existent trajectory through space and time. That is, if this is reasonable, then our self-generation here also answers the biggest question of all time, namely, \u201cWhy is there existence rather than nonexistence?\u201d Note that the nothingness and the space-time are two sides of the same coin, and that the coin is a product of existence. I muse that nonexistence would be something smaller than a zero-dimensional point and more bizarre than all the paradoxes of Zeno! That indirectly explains why there is existence rather than nonexistence. I have thus tried to explain the question directly and indirectly. If the zero-dimensional point is Motion in the flesh, then we can make a case for the validity of proposition 1. That is, I am not saying that the zero-dimensional point contains motion; no, I am saying something stronger. I am saying that the zero-dimensional point is motion. If this is true and, the zero-dimensional point is self-generated and, the zero-dimensional point is all there is and ever will be, then proposition 1 obtains, which means that the torus will spin for all eternity. That is, self-generated motion that is all, will continue to move at a constant velocity. I mull that if a fly were to touch or come in contact with the nothingness or self-generated motion that is all, then the nothingness or all-motion would stop spinning and existence would come crashing down. However, the fly is one with the nothingness or all-motion, so the fly (and all things space-time related) cannot perturb the nothingness nor the expansion and contraction phases of the torus\u2014which means that Nature orders stuff for free, hence, we get \u201cfree energy.\u201d That is, the torus will continue to spin at a constant velocity (i.e., the speed of nothingness/light) because the nothingness knows no external force. In other words, the zero-dimensional point will remain a zero-dimensional point for all time, which means that parts of the space-time fabric are always shrunk and remain in a state of zero-dimensionality. That is, we do not need to use \u201cinfinite quantities of energy\u201d in order to shrink the space-time when it is already shrunk. This is THE KEY to free energy because now, \u201cdead tori\u201d in the environment can fall into these zero-dimensional pockets and thus be revived. This zero-dimensional point spins so fast that everything is frozen/nothingness, but, because the zero-dimensional point does spin in actuality, the zero-dimensional point will create a wider net which cannot keep up with the zero-dimensional point\u2019s ferocious spin. This net will expand outwards, which we see as the Big Bang. Dark energy may be the fact that the torus makes copies of itself, and then the copies make copies and so on; we get the exponential factor. Personal note: I get that some physicists equate free energy with some kind of perpetual motion machine\u2014and, yes, believing in the notion of a perpetual motion machine is silly\u2014but, if you look away from that, you will see a deep and perturbing problem: Why are we here after an infinite number of aeons (i.e., Eternity) if Nature can die? Maybe she can resurrect herself, which means that unavailable energy can become available again through Nature\u2019s resurrection process. Roger Penrose (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YYWUIxGdl4) suggested this for the universe as a whole, therefore, the universe as a whole is free; but, if we live in the fractal universe, which the cuboctahedron suggests, then one can imagine the whole holistic reanimation process working with individual atoms; which means, we do not break any symmetry laws; and then we are dealing with real free energy that is waiting for some intelligent species to come along and exploit it. Roger Penrose made free energy (resurrection) a reality for the universe as a whole. Finally, we get a physicist who is also a philosopher. However, since we are a part of the whole, Penrose\u2019s free energy is of no practical value. What we need is to install the resurrection-machine that is the universe in our cars. But, we cannot fit the whole universe! in our car, can we? Yes, we can, if the whole universe is a torus. That is, if the universe itself is a bbb (basic building block), then the resurrection-machine is a bbb, and then we just use a smaller bbb that will fit in our car. Just imagine the technology of free energy! Imagine having Nature\u2019s resurrection process inside your spacecraft. Nature will perpetually supply your spacecraft with fuel. That is just the start ... With free energy, the warp drive becomes a real possibility therefore the torus bends or have always bent the space-time into a zero-dimensional pretzel\u2014so, you can go anywhere. My question is: Why do physicists scoff at the notion of free energy when it is so awesome? Poverty and money would be gone in a day or two! 20 000 children would not die every day. Oops, I think I answered my own question! To put the question in a clear light: Why do physicists scoff at the notion of free energy when free energy does not violate the laws of physics nor the reason of man? This physicist, Dr. Robert Koontz, believes in the reality of free energy and he states that free energy does not break any laws: https://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/ciencia/ciencia_energy08.htm Read this: Steven Mark's Free Energy Devices And this: Bob Koontz On Energy Production To sum up: Free energy is Nature\u2019s ability to collect the dead and revive them. The Recycling Universe. Or: The eternal, non-static, recycling fractal-torus universe. 1. Why do physicists scoff at the notion of free energy when free energy does not violate the laws of physics nor the reason of man? 2. What do you think of my new free energy proposal? Can it work? In other words, do the propositions hold up? Final words: If your theory of the universe has little in common with, say, childbirth, then your theory is probably not in touch with reality because Nature is undivided, that is, Nature is herself on every scale, which means only a \u201cwoman\u201d can birth the universe. My \u201ctheory\u201d is the theory of the first childbirth ever. And, if you find whirlpools in Nature, then you cannot have black holes that are not whirlpools in some sense. You must reflect Nature, which means, you have to go outside and look! You will see, Nature is simple and, she is herself on every scale, like the octaves on your piano. Aftermath: Important notes + what lies beyond the borders of space-time + the Philosopher\u2019s Stone With our new free energy thinking, we break no known laws of physics. This is not the creation of energy. This is not existence from nonexistence. This is not magic. This is not a perpetual motion machine. The energy is conserved: that is, we do not get overunity in that sense. Energy is neither created nor destroyed. No laws of symmetry have been broken. No reason of man has been violated. We do not reverse the arrow of time, thus the second law of thermodynamics has not been violated. And, this is not, and this is important, this is not: \u201cI can go forever without fuel.\u201d That is, if free energy is real, then it does not violate reason! You cannot argue with reality. Free energy is resurrection. Free energy has nothing to do with a perpetual motion machine. Most physicists, including Michio Kaku, are committing many logical errors. First, they believe that free energy relates to a perpetual motion machine. Free energy is not even the distant cousin of a perpetual motion machine. A perpetual motion machine should be properly called: The Magic Machine of Bullshit. This is because a perpetual motion machine has nothing to do with perpetual motion per se; a perpetual motion machine produces work without adding fuel, which is impossible because it is just nonsense. Free energy has NOTHING to do with a perpetual motion machine. Free energy has NOTHING to do with the creation of energy. When free energy inventors like \u201cDr. Thomas Henry Moray was able to generate 50,000 watts of power with a tabletop device that did not burn any kind of fuel,\u201d then the theory put forth by Dr. Robert Koontz says, \u201cIt is possible to obtain an unlimited amount of energy from devices which essentially only require that they be charged up with negative mass electrons and negative mass positrons.\u201d That is, you may not add fuel externally, but the fuel must be produced internally in the system. But, I am not an expert on negative mass electrons and negative mass positrons. Hell, I do not even know what it means. But, whatever it means, it cannot be magic because Dr. Robert Koontz is not a crackpot. Dr. Robert Koontz could be the best thing that ever happened to physics. So, you see, the whole time you conserve energy. You do not create energy. That is, there is no such thing as \u201coverunity.\u201d Overunity is a term used by people that do not know what they are talking about. However, in your lab or garage or whatever, you do actually get overunity in the sense that you get more energy out than what you put in; but, this is not real overunity because when you gain energy the universe loses energy; and, the energy you gain the universe eventually gets back, so the whole time, energy was conserved. It only looks like it is overunity. Here is the link: http://www.doctorkoontz.com/Scalar_Physics/Energy/index.htm In addition, this is not \u201cinfinite energy.\u201d Infinity is not real; at best, infinity is a mirage. That is, Nature is undivided. If you take a drop out of the ocean and name the drop \u201cparticle\u2014\u201d because the drop looks so like a \u201csomebody\u2014\u201d then you put the drop back into the ocean, and then you state: \u201cQuantum mechanics is so weird, the particle is a particle and a wave at the same time!\u201d Or, maybe, there is no such thing as the particle because Nature is clearly undivided. It does not make sense to fragment Nature, which means we are all one. If you take a lit candle in order to light a second candle, will it become the same flame or a different flame? And, are we humans so different? That is, there is no \u201cyou.\u201d We are faceless. And, so is the universe. That the universe is faceless and has no form is what the cuboctahedron means. If you are the cuboctahedron, it means, you are formless. Our consciousness = the cuboctahedron, which means, our egos are illusions. That is, we are not really human. Q: But, if infinity is not real, then what lies beyond the borders of space-time? What is beyond the wall? A: To understand what lies beyond, we need to address the basic building block of matter. The basic building block is the stuff that the universe is made of. But, what exactly is the bbb? The bbb must be a torus therefore Nature is undivided and she flows in the most economical way. Why? Nature flows in the most economical way because Nature is lazy; which makes evolutionary sense. Therefore, my whole argument is an argument of sense. It makes evolutionary sense that Nature would flow in the most economical way, and, therefore, Nature flows in the most economical way. That is the whole of the argument. What is the most economical way? We reason: To flow from A to A (you can prove me wrong by coming up with a smarter way). That is, you flow out and then back in. If you must move from A to A ad infinitum, and, you travel in the most economical and efficient way, then you don\u2019t stop somewhere \u201cout there,\u201d turn around, and then head back, rather, you circle back; this creates a torus. Why do you circle back? Because, the bbb is not intelligent, for one thing. If you circle back, you preserve momentum. The torus is the only candidate for the bbb as far as logical space is concerned. Nature had no choice. Q: But, why must you head back in? Why not continue in a straight path? A: You need a shape that can fold in upon itself, or else you would create a paradox of a Big Bang that is expanding ever outwards into a nonsensical \u201cnothingness\u201d located up a happy clown\u2019s underpants! No. Reality must expand into itself. There is simply nothing else to expand into\u2014and that is the whole of the argument. Basically, you need a shape/bbb that answers all the fundamental questions. You simply cannot have these \u201catoms\u201d just put \u201cin there\u201d like our brave physicists do. The shape we are looking for needs to contain and encompass all of reality, like a big blanket that covers you, all of you. No part can be left uncovered lest we are ok with paradoxes like, \u201cWhere does the inside end and the outside begin?\u201d The torus is the only shape that I can see that covers all and really encompasses all (employing the power of \u201creally\u201d here to illustrate my point). A bubble would encompass all, but we are still left with the problem of origin. The origin is a singularity, which would transform our bubble into a torus because of the point of origin of the singularity. The strings in String Theory could make a torus, for example. Again: Why can\u2019t the bbb be a ring, by your reasoning? Why must it be a torus? A: The bbb must be a torus because Nature must expand into herself, which means that you must return to your birthplace, which is a singularity (i.e., the toroidal core), in order to expand anew. Just like breathing: In order to expand, you breathe in, and then you must expel the air, in order to be able to expand anew. Nature must be a set of lungs; there is no other way, if you mull on it like a great philosopher. Thus, we enter the Empyrean Heavens for true contemplation. Because Nature must contract/shrink, that is, return to her birthplace, you will see that all tori share the same center/core therefore all tori must shrink the same way/in the same manner. This is oneness. If the feedback system that the torus is is consciousness, then all consciousness is one therefore all tori share the same core, meaning that there is only 1 zero-dimensional point; which means, we are immortal without the aid of technology. It also means that consciousness actually resides at the heart of nothingness! If we weren\u2019t always immortal, then we never will be because technology can, at best, give you a vampire\u2019s curse. What are the chances of being born? Almost zero. The chance of rebirth must be zero! However, with oneness, the chances of birth and rebirth = 100%. If the torus-model of the universe is false, then oneness may still be possible; for example, David Bohm\u2019s Holomovement. That is, I am not betting my soul on one horse here! Moreover, there is no up and down in the universe, which means that there is no meaning nor any meaninglessness of life. That is, if immortality obtains, then you can go on forever. Ok. Maybe we need to exit the Empyrean Heavens for a short while. Ok, it is not atoms that we are seeing. If you were to look closer, then you would see that our atoms are toruses. Bbb = a torus. But, if the basic building block\u2014the most fundamental building block of all matter\u2014is the torus, then, you will see that the geomagnetic field (which is a torus) is the bbb. In other words, the bbb is about form. The bbb is not about size. This is a totally new picture of the cosmos. The bbb can be as big as the universe (and, it is, that is, the universe itself is a bbb) and as small as the tiniest atom (or particle or whatever). A quote from Bucky will illustrate my point: \u201cBecause of the fundamental nonsimultaneity of universal structuring, a single, simultaneous, static model of Universe is inherently both nonexistent and conceptually impossible as well as unnecessary. Ergo, Universe does not have a shape. Do not waste your time, as man has been doing for ages, trying to think of a unit shape \u201coutside of which there must be something,\u201d or \u201cwithin which, at center, there must be a smaller something.\u201d\u201d \u2014Richard Buckminster Fuller We say that the bbb is the torus-form, but you must realize that the torus is formless (undivided) in the sense that breathing is formless as breathing is a system. If breathing suddenly became static (i.e., a structure), then you would die a horrible death! Can you poetically see why Nature must be a system and thus see why there is existence rather than nonexistence? There is no way that Nature is not a torus (dual). Like the snake biting its own tail, the snake has to fold in order to do so; likewise, if Nature wants to birth a universe, then she has to expand into herself in order to do so. That is, the baby (i.e., the universe) has to grow inside a womb as babies on earth must. Maybe Nature is telling us something there? In other words, black holes (i.e., the toroidal core/nothingness/the beginning of time) may be outside our universe just like a mother is \u201coutside\u201d her baby in the womb. And, we finally get the answer to the question: \u201cWhat is outside our universe?\u201d Q: But, black holes are not outside our universe, they are inside! A: This reminds me of Wittgenstein, \u201cTell me,\u201d Wittgenstein asked a friend, \u201cwhy do people always say, it was natural for man to assume that the sun went round the earth rather than that the earth was rotating?\u201d His friend replied, \u201cWell, obviously because it just looks as though the Sun is going round the Earth.\u201d Wittgenstein replied, \u201cWell, what would it have looked like if it had looked as though the Earth was rotating?\u201d Similarly, what would it look like if our black holes were outside our universe? That is, where does the inside end and the outside begin? Answer: Nowhere. That is, the backside of your glass window is located outside your house. Look outside your window and tell me what you see? That is, there is no difference between \u201coutside\u201d and \u201cinside\u201d in the universe. There is no up and down. The black hole (i.e., the toroidal core/nothingness/the beginning of time) is at the center of reality also, thus the black hole is at both ends. That is, the black hole is beyond the wall of the universe, so to speak, and inside the heart of matter. In other words, we live inside the black hole, like the baby in the womb lives inside its mother. Nature breathes in, aka \u201cblack hole.\u201d Nature breathes out, aka \u201cwhite hole.\u201d Nature breathes in and out forever due to proposition 1. This process is all there is. The Big Bang, the black hole, and all atoms, are of course whirlpools. A whirlpool is a torus. Everything is a whirlpool/torus due to the eternal spin of the nothingness. That is, spin is primal. The spin is the cuboctahedron and the cuboctahedron is all of Nature. That is, I consider humankind blind until they have placed Bucky\u2019s superior intellect and the cuboctahedron at the heart of things and equations. Our heart, lungs and brain = the dual torus. The magnetic field. What is not a torus? The reason why our brain is a dual torus is that we ultimately stem from the great nothingness/dual torus. The secret of free energy lies in the heart of the dual torus. The Red Flag: A red flag was that I had not so much as opened a physics book. Physics today stand on the shoulders of previous giants + Lawrence Krauss and Michio Kaku have PhDs and years of experience and, they are the best of the best = matter minus gravity equals zero energy, which is a universe from, quote \u201cnothing.\u201d This is very beautiful. It has some poetic flavor to it. My free energy idea is also a universe of zero energy because when the smaller tori enter the bigger torus\u2019s core, then the smaller tori become one with the core like water drops can become one with the sea. Now, the drops are at the core, which means that the core can once more release the drops. Once released, the drops or tori are back together as opposed to being \u201cspread across the space-time fabric in all directions,\u201d which means that, from the \u201cspread across the space-time fabric in all directions,\u201d we now have, once again, energy that is not \u201cspread across\u201d and thus ready to do mechanical work. In this sense, energy is \u201ccreated,\u201d because energy is synergy. [...] the best of the best = matter minus gravity equals zero energy, which is a universe from, quote \u201cnothing.\u201d But, the \u201cnothing\u201d is not, however, an explanation. That is, you need to explain how zero energy can birth matter and gravity. \u201cThe knowhow\u201d is missing, Neil deGrasse Tyson pointed out. Matter and gravity are like a father and a mother. The father and the mother can easily make the baby. But, how can the baby make the father and the mother? In other words, physicists are great at what they do, but they are not philosophers. If they were, then they would see that we need a Prime Mover. In other words, how can physicists tell us that free energy is impossible when they simply observe phenomena in nature and then apply math to it. I see an apple fall. Here is my advanced math. It says that free energy is impossible because, \u201cI saw an apple fall.\u201d My solution is that the first principle, the Prime Mover, is speed, and, fast speed! Thus, free energy is accomplished. But, let me open a page anyway: W = Fd Work is the input/output of a system. By putting in energy, a force is produced. I move my computer mouse and the force is the movement of the mouse by my hand, and energy is the thing that is lost to the environment when I am doing the work of moving my mouse. But, this is a one-way street therefore my computer mouse will not start to move by itself. Thus, there is no way to produce energy. Okay. I am not trained in physics. But, common sense tells me that this is fairly obvious. However, free energy is not the production of energy! Free energy is this: the \u201cenergy\u201d lost to the environment the perpetual motion of the nothingness sucks into itself and then it spews out the revived \u201cenergy\u201d where your free energy device is located (this can happen because the nothingness and your device is tuned to the zeroth-dimension/maximum velocity state, therefore, when the zeroth dimension releases the old, now \u201crevived,\u201d \u201cenergy,\u201d your free energy device picks it up). You thus get the old \u201cenergy\u201d back for free, hence, free energy. That is, we have a new player in town that is not listed in any physics book, namely, the beginning of time itself (viz., the nothingness). However, if you think that you can get free energy out of W = Fd, then you are mistaken. This new player is the fast spin of the cuboctahedron aka the beginning of time. We argued that the bbb must be a torus. If this is so, then the system we call Motion is a cuboctahedron therefore the cuboctahedron is like the formless skeleton of the torus. Further, we ascertained that the cuboctahedron spins so fast that it is a zero-dimensional point. This is how we resolved the infinite regress paradox. We also explained the self-generation of the zero-dimensional point/nothingness. We saw that all is undivided because all is ultimately the zeroth-dimension and the zeroth-dimension is undivided because it has no extension and, if you do not have an extension, then you cannot be fragmented or chopped into pieces. You can cleave a piece of wood in two because the piece of wood is extended in space and time, but you cannot cleave a zero-dimensional state in two because the zero-dimensional state knows no extension in space and time. Further, we saw that the zero-dimensional point has always been spinning, that is, the zero-dimensional point never started to spin; and, this is not a paradox therefore from the zero-dimensional point\u2019s point of view, the zero-dimensional point is not spinning but frozen. The zero-dimensional point is therefore absolute as opposed to an object in space that falls under the jurisdiction of relativity. Further, we saw that the zero-dimensional point has always been spinning, which means that the zero-dimensional point has always been a zero-dimensional point, which means that space-time is already shrunk down to zero (i.e., the zero propagation of space-time) in some places in the universe. So, we do not need to use energy in order to shrink space-time in order to get at the beginning of time that is supposed to revive the tori. If you have the free energy device in your car, then it will act as a transmission line that directs the tori at the beginning of time to your car; you thus get a supply of old, revived tori that you can use as fuel. It does not cost to use the transmission line no more than it costs to send a river through a tube. Your car releases the tori and your car is propelled forwards because of the displacement that occurs in the release. However, at this stage in the hypothesis, this is guesswork. Then the tori are released out into the environment where they, eventually, fall in these pockets of zero-dimensionality. Here, the spin of the zeroth-dimension collects the tori, and the tori can thus be used anew. In summa: We have established good reasons to assume that the nothingness exists and that it can play a vital role in the resurrection-process of the universe. The fact that nothingness plays a vital role within the borders of the universe is a new element in our thinking that you will not find in any physics book, and therefore the Red Flag pointed at me was indeed a silly attack. Our element opens up for the possibility of free energy. Why are we here? If energy cannot be created nor destroyed, if energy is finite and always dying, then resurrection is the only solution to our problem: \u201cWhy are we here after all these aeons of time?\u201d 1. Nothing as nothing: To state that time simply popped from nonexistence solves the problem of the dying universe because in this picture time started at some finite point and then died from there. However, it makes no sense to believe in nonexistence. 2. Nothing as something: To state that time has always existed does not solve the problem of the dying universe per se because in this picture time never started; time has always been on the move and is constantly dying. This picture is correct. Time (motion) per se never started. This is the spinning nothingness. Note that this nothingness is something, that is, it is zero-dimensional space. In order to solve the problem of death, we need a resurrection-machine. The nothingness itself is the resurrection-machine. I have tried to argue for such a machine in this paper. To sum up: Time is not constantly dying in the core of nothingness. At the core, time is always alive. And, that solves it. Time is always alive/ordered at the core = the possibility of free energy. 3. Something as time loop. This is an interesting idea where quantum mechanics allows the universe to create itself through inflation. However, this explanation is paradoxical. I do not believe that Nature likes paradoxes. Number 2 above, is simpler and more elegant. 4. Other. There might be other solutions to the problem, \u201cWhy are we here after all these aeons of time?\u201d 5. Picture (below). The Self-Generated Universe? Or, \u201cIf God did not create the universe, then we get this:\u201d Well, this is ABSURD!!! (I think we need him!) I personally believe in the notion of a crane-God because I woke up like the Buddha of old. I saw that this universe is a dream and that it started when we all fell asleep in \u201cNirvana.\u201d I have been to Nirvana. Nirvana is not a place per se. Nirvana is your true consciousness beyond the universe and your monkey-suit (i.e., human ego). Read about my experience in my previous work. However, the fact that we are all asleep in a timeless dimension dreaming the universe into being actually does solve the origins problem (i.e., \u201cWhen did it all start?\u201d) and the, \u201cWho melted the Ice Cube?\u201d problem (above) that William Lane Craig put forth. I agree with Craig! We may need him! Though, it is not the kind of God Craig has in mind. This God is your true consciousness. Suddenly, the fact that we can influence the quantum world makes sense because we are the ones who dream the universe. By \u201cwe,\u201d I mean the One. There is only one of us here, which you will realize when you wake up. We dream because we must sleep. It is physics. Our goal is to satisfy our human egos, for why else would you take residence in it? You are not your human awareness, but you have a responsibility to your human awareness, like a father has a responsibility towards his son. In addition, your human awareness has a responsibility to its physical body, which means you also have a responsibility towards Nature therefore your body is dependent on Nature in order to survive. We can never leave our bedroom Nirvana, but we can fall asleep and \u201cpretend\u201d to leave. If Nirvana is real, then: In quantum mechanics you need an observer, which means, you also need an observer at the beginning of time. And, now we have got one at the beginning of time. Measurement-problem solved. Other: To me, the question of why there is existence rather than nonexistence is simple: We are here. That means we\u2019ve got something. That something cannot arise from nonexistence because that would be absurd. That is, the question of why there is existence is answered in there being existence in the first place. That is, existence tells us something, and that is that nonexistence cannot be. Nonexistence is probably this weird paradox-fueled, impotent duck. But, then you say, \u201cNonexistence would be cheaper.\u201d The answer is, no. To have a weird paradox-fueled, impotent duck would probably cost you more than having a universe arise from zero energy. The zero energy is my fast spinning nothingness that is something. Ok. But, then you say, \u201cHow can your nothing exists?\u201d My answer was that, it created itself. Created itself means \u201calways existed.\u201d This works if you have beaten the regress paradox. If you have not beaten the regress paradox, then you get this weird universe that has created itself, aka the time loop. That is a paradox, because then B [the future] created A [the past] and then A created B. If you beat the infinite regress, then you have A created B where A is a nothingness that has spun forever because \u201cforever\u201d is frozen in this picture\u2014so, it is an easy task to do. The way that the nothingness creates itself, is the fact that it is a zero-dimensional point, which means that the zero-dimensional point spins so fast that time has stopped. From our point of view, the zero-dimensional point of timelessness is fast motion. If we did not have motion, I believe we would have something fragmented, like a paradox of Zeno. Motion is undivided. This property explains why there is existence rather than nonexistence. That is, you cannot have a nonexistence that is divided into many parts. You want a nonexistence that is nothing at all. So, you strip away everything, but then you are left with an undivided zero-dimensional point. You cannot get rid of it. If you get rid of it, then you have something fragmented because you wanted to get rid of the undivided. If the fragmented existence or the fragmented nonexistence cannot be, then existence must be because you cannot trade existence for something that is impossible. Why is there existence rather than nonexistence? Answer: Because, nonexistence is impossible. But, how about an undivided nonexistence? This too is impossible because the undivided is the zero-dimensional point, and the zero-dimensional point exists. That nonexistence is impossible does answer the question: Why is there existence rather than nonexistence. This is not a cop-out. You cannot get rid of the zeroth-dimension; meaning, if you remove everything, you are still left with a zero-dimensional point. At first glance, this zero-dimensional point should equal nonexistence itself, and we should not be here. However, if it can be shown that this zero-dimensional state = fast motion, then you have solved the \u201cWhy is there existence rather than nonexistence?\u201d problem. How did the zeroth-dimension get here? How did it come to be? Where did it come from? It always was. And, the zeroth-dimension is the center and the beginning of all things, thus it does not need to come from some place when the zeroth-dimension is \u201cthe place.\u201d Other: The zero energy is my fast spinning nothingness: If energy can neither be created nor destroyed, then, if you lived in a zero-dimensional room, then you would never get tired; you could lift weights all day and never get tired because the energy could never leave your body therefore the energy has nothing to spread into. If energy can neither be created nor destroyed, it would simply stay in your body. However, my definition of energy is a bit different. My definition of energy is synergy, which means that you need the extension of space-time in order to work and in order to have energy. That is, you need four men to lift a car. The four men could not fit in the zero-dimensional room, therefore, the zero-dimensional room has zero energy. But, then the zero-dimensional room births space-time and the four men. At the birth, the four men are together, so they can lift the car. But, then the space-time gets larger and the men are spread apart; they can no longer lift the car. But, the zero-dimensional room is still there, manifested throughout the large space-time. Eventually, the four men fall into the zero-dimensional room; however, they cannot fit, so they are jammed together into one, and now they fit. Then the zero-dimensional room spews this one man out again, and now the man can divide into four, and then the four men can lift the car (again). This is free energy made possible by the zero-dimensional eternally existing room. How do the many arise from the One? If the zeroth-dimension is all there is and, if the zeroth-dimension is fast speed, then the \u201cmany\u201d are simply manifestations of a continuum of speed. That is, Nature is finite. How fast Nature is, determines all the manifestations there are. Luckily, Nature is fast. And, she must be fast in order to generate the state of nothingness. Last word on nothing: You cannot get existence from nonexistence, but you can get something from nothing, and that is because nothing is curled-up space-time. In this picture of the curled-up space-time we have no black, no white, no object; no space, no time, no nothing; we literally have, in our picture, NO-THING. This is real nothingness! That is, I believe that this is what real nothingness actually is. That is, a nothingness that does not contain curled-up space-time is an impossibility therefore our zero-dimensional point or knot is that of fast motion or curled-up space-time. There are two kinds of speed: the speed of the torus, which is absolute + the relative speed among the tori themselves. The Police are diligent consumers of the truth! The Philosopher\u2019s Stone: Let me finally give you the Stone: The Philosopher\u2019s Stone is the cuboctahedron. I figured that one out when I decoded the secrets of the alchemists. This is what Sir Isaac Newton spent his free time pursuing. He could never find it. Imagine that! The greatest genius of our time could not crack the code. Or, if he cracked it, he didn\u2019t tell the world. To be fair, I had infinite more power in my hands (viz., the internet). My solution: Heaven (fire) = the triangle. Earth = the square Father and Mother = opposite-sitting tetrahedron-arrays like in the flag of the Mother, the Father and the Child; Is(is) + ra + el. Israel. Earth (+ fire) = the cuboctahedron Water = the icosahedron Air = the octahedron Fire = the tetrahedron (e.g., the throne of God) Leaf 11 (left, bottom): \u201cThrough Him who created the Heavens and the Earth I am The Philosopher\u2019s stone, and in my body I carry something the wise seek. If such a charm be extracted from me, it will be a sweet refreshment for you. I am an animal having father and mother, and father and mother were created; and in my body are contained the four elements, and I am before father and mother and I am a poisonous animal.\u201d \u2014The Secret Teachings of All Ages The Father and the Mother: The Isotropic Vector Matrix - Nassim Haramein ( Abstract from Cognos 2010 conference): The Isotropic Vector Matrix - Nassim Haramein ( Abstract from Cognos 2010 conference) The Philosopher\u2019s Stone = heaven + earth + four elements. In addition, the Stone has a father and a mother, that is, you will find the cuboctahedron within a stack of tetrahedron-arrays (e.g., the 64 tetrahedron array, aka Father and Mother; see the I Ching). The cuboctahedron is composed of triangles (heaven) and squares (earth) and, when you fold the cuboctahedron, you get the four elements. Note that it is impossible to find another solution for the simple reason that you will not find anything in the universe that consists of squares and triangles while simultaneously carries the four elements. Alternatively, I dare you to come up with another solid! I believe that: The cuboctahedron sits on a throne/triangle (I am before father and mother) and it is a poisonous animal when you fold it down; poison meaning fire. You get the throne of God when you fold the cuboctahedron completely. How I solved it: I already knew about the Platonic solids, and I knew that heaven is a triangle because it is always depicted as a triangle. The earth, therefore, could be a square because it is simply a step up from the triangle. You have the four corners of the earth, the four rivers of Eden, and so on. The poisonous animal could be the snake in the Garden of Eden, for example. \u201cFire\u201d may also denote the Phoenix (i.e., resurrection) or the Great Dragon. The Dragon also consists of the four elements: Feet: earth. Scales: water. Wings: wind. Breath: fire. Then, I saw a video of Buckminster Fuller and I just knew what the Philosopher\u2019s Stone was: Buckminster Fuller Explains Vector Equilibrium - with captions: Buckminster Fuller Explains Vector Equilibrium - with captions More: I believe that: I am before father and mother = I am a poisonous animal = the equilateral triangle I also believe that the equilateral triangle = 666 (i.e., 60 + 60 + 60 [60 = 6 + 0 = 6]) You get the equilateral triangle when you fold the cuboctahedron completely. The original number of the Beast may have been 616, but that does not mean that some secret school has adopted it in order to hide their secret. The Book of Revelation is all about the cuboctahedron. You can tell from the hidden symbology. I will try to solve it, at least partially, one day. However, I do not actually know what these mean: \u201c[...] I am before father and mother,\u201d and \u201c[...] I am a poisonous animal,\u201d but you do not need to solve these puzzles in order to solve the big puzzle. \u201c[...] Heavens and the Earth,\u201d + \u201c[...] my body are contained the four elements,\u201d are more than enough to solve the riddle. I believe that Jesus Christ is the Philosopher\u2019s Stone. Jesus Christ is the center point in the cuboctahedron where the 12 converging lines (that make up the cuboctahedron) meet. The 12 are of course the 12 disciples. The flag of Israel also contains the secret. When you know the secret, you will spot it in Greek Mythology, Norse Mythology, you will spot it in the Kabbalah; the I Ching, the flag of South Korea, in the symbology of the Masons; that is, this secret is everywhere. My personal guess is that this secret is so big and so important that it has been replicated ad infinitum in order to preserve it for the future. What does the Philosopher\u2019s Stone even mean? It means that we have been visited by aliens therefore the Philosopher\u2019s Stone (i.e., free energy) is the ultimate technology in the universe. Our forebears were smart, but they didn\u2019t have the ultimate technology in the universe, hence, E.T. is the safest bet. The classic UFO may have the shape that it does because it is being squashed between two tori, aka the dual torus. The UFO has the disc-shape in order to accommodate the torus-reality; like the fish in the ocean has the form that they have in order to accommodate their water-reality. More: When you fold the cuboctahedron, you get spin. So, now you know the origin of spin. Free energy has to do with the dual torus. Eternity/nothingness = the dual torus. \u201cMuspelheim and Niflheim.\u201d And, the Philosopher\u2019s Stone does look like a stone, eh? Fitting name. And, the Philosopher\u2019s Stone has something to do with geometry because, if you were ignorant in the ways of geometry, then no Mystery School would have you. The door to Plato\u2019s Academy: \u201cLet no one ignorant of geometry enter.\u201d (Plato, I think you spilled the secret/sacred beans without knowing it.) And, yes, the Philosopher\u2019s Stone provides you with immortality; and, the Philosopher\u2019s Stone can literally produce gold therefore the Philosopher\u2019s Stone is the system that created and creates all things. The Philosopher\u2019s Stone is the great nothingness. The cuboctahedron is the Philosopher\u2019s Stone, and the secret societies know this. Plato knew it, but he couldn\u2019t tell the world. He left clues, however. Sir Isaac Newton probably knew it, but he couldn\u2019t tell the world. Leonardo da Vinci probably knew it (you can tell by his Flower of Life paintings). However, I am not a member of a secret society, so I can tell the world. Note: Nassim Haramein has already told the world through his solution to the Kabbalah ... so, why should I fear for my life when the Secret of Secrets has already been revealed? Oops: Do not equate this work with Nassim Haramein\u2019s work. This work is completely my own. 72 = Nassim Haramein solves the Kabbalah, and the answer is the 64 tetrahedron grid, that is, the cuboctahedron within the cuboctahedron. 8 trees of Life x 9 Sephiroth (1 of the Sephiroth does not count as it is the root or crown) = 72. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1R8AihKoWrw The cuboctahedron is Jesus and his 12 disciples. The 12 Olympians. Odin\u2019s 12 sons. The coven of the witches. And, so on. The coven of the witches, for example, is 13. Actually, cuboctahedron = 12 + 1. 12 beams and 1 center. Thus, the number 12 and/or the number 13 are the esoteric mystery. 12 Knights of the Round Table + King Arthur (1). 12 labors of Hercules (1). Odin (1), the chief god, had 12 sons. The Olympians, which comprised the whole pantheon (which is also a temple), were 12. In Judaism and Christianity the number 12 has a special place. There is a reason why these myths and tales are so popular. Jesus (1) and his 12 disciples. The list goes on... The 13 attributes of God. The Zodiac. But, you are so selective! What about the movie Ocean\u2019s Twelve or the 12 Monkeys; or, the 12 characters in Street Fighter? Really? Am I being selective? Am I? Selective would be Thor\u2019s 12 sons, King Barthur and his 150 + Knights. What about Judas and his 12 disciples or, perhaps, all the lesser gods not included in the pantheon? Forget Hercules, what about Steve\u2019s 12 labors; or 11 months in a year? What about the... Am I really being selective? Really? I take only the cream! I\u2019m not selecting anything! The body parts of Osiris! Nice try! There were 14 body parts. No. Actually, a fish ate one of the parts, the phallus! I would believe that this is just me connecting dots that are not meant to be connected if, Jesus could make do with eleven disciples. Even the Knights of the Round were originally over 150 knights! Why this obsession with making it 12 + 1? Just read the entire The Secret Teachings of All Ages before you make up your mind. Then you will see that: The cuboctahedron is the real Holy Grail because the Holy Grail is the cup that never empties, aka free energy. And, the Round Table shrinks and expands like a torus. The whole The Secret Teachings of All Ages must make you realize that aliens have visited us because, where else does this stuff come from? Manly P. Hall himself urges us to look away. There are no aliens here! Powerful men must have gotten to him because, it\u2019s like the comedian Bill Hicks stopped smoking one day and said, \u201cI was wrong. Smoking is bad for you.\u201d No one in hell will believe that, of course. That is, it just does not add up. The author of the Secret Teachings urges us to look away at the greatest secret in history! It does not make sense; well, until you realize who Hall was. Hall was a Freemason. But, before he was a Freemason, he wrote the Secret Teachings (1928). My personal guess is that Hall was so close to the secrets of the Masons that the Masons recruited him in order to keep their secrets safe. Basically, what happened was that aliens landed here and imparted their knowledge. The elite kept this knowledge safe. And, they still do. However, the elite cannot control the internet. Jesus resurrects people, heals people, etc. So does the cuboctahedron: Free Energy Finally Discovered | Rodin Coil Vortex Based Math | TEDxCharlotte 2010 Randy Powell: Free Energy Finally Discovered | Rodin Coil Vortex Based Math | TEDxCharlotte 2010 Randy Powell Marko Rodin on the Word of God: Marko Rodin on the Word of God The knowledge E.T. imparted: Nature is immortal: But, there is a question there: How? How is Nature immortal? Free energy seems to be the only viable option. Thus, free energy answers a big philosophical question: Why are we still here after all these aeons of time when energy is dying? My answer: The Philosopher\u2019s Stone answers the question. \u00b7 Who are we? (A: The cuboctahedron) \u00b7 Why are we here? (A: We are self-generated) \u00b7 Where did we come from? (A: We have always existed) \u00b7 Where are we going? (A: Around and around in a feedback loop) \u00b7 What is this? (A: Consciousness) \u00b7 And, are we immortal? (A: Yes) \u00a7 The Philosopher\u2019s Stone answers all these questions (above) and more. \u00a7 The Philosopher\u2019s Stone is the ultimate technology in the universe (i.e., a free energy warp drive; see below) \u00a7 The Philosopher\u2019s Stone is the Heart of Nature. \u00a7 The Philosopher\u2019s Stone is the nothingness. \u00a7 The Philosopher\u2019s Stone is your consciousness. \u00a7 The Philosopher\u2019s Stone is everything, all atoms, etc. \u00a7 The Philosopher\u2019s Stone is the most sacred relic in all mystery religions. We/Motion have always existed. In addition, we/Motion have always been on the move. Nevertheless, this is not a paradox when, from the primal view, there is nothing that moves; everything stands still because that is how fast it moves. Note that this \u201cstands still\u201d is not the opposite of motion. 1. Motion stopped. This is the opposite of motion. 2. Motion stopped. This is not the opposite of motion but fast motion. 3. See the difference? In case 1, existence would break apart. In case 2, existence works. Yet, they look exactly the same. The difference is that, in case 2, you accomplish motionlessness with motion. In case 1, you stop the car, so to speak. Imagine if existence was a car and then you stopped it. Then the car would never ever be able to move again because this car has no driver. That is, because Nature has no driver, proposition 1 must obtain, that is, the car that is existence cannot have started driving and it cannot stop driving. The car ever was on the move and it will ever be on the move. The car is the torus shrinking and expanding forever. Matter can thus be revived in the toroidal core and we accomplish free energy. [...] from the primal view, there is nothing that moves; everything stands still because that is how fast it moves. That is, you can have Motion and Motionlessness at the beginning of time because they are the same thing. That is, you can have an Unmoved Mover that sets things going because the Unmoved Mover itself is moving, but the Unmoved Mover is moving so fast that it does not actually move anywhere. The Unmoved Mover is moving so fast that it has become zero-dimensional and is therefore not moving anywhere, but it is manifested everywhere because the root of any torus is the root of the zeroth-dimension. This is because all toruses have at their center a zeroth-dimension. If you take all the toruses/atoms in the universe and multiply their zeroth-dimensions together, then you will get \u201c1\u201d zeroth-dimension. This is because 0 multiplied by any number, is 0. Just kidding! We do not need math here. Common sense will tell you that you cannot have more than 1 zeroth-dimension because a zeroth-dimension is a space that has no extension, and, if you have no extension, it means you have only one center because all the walls of the universe are closing in on you! Thus, if you only have one center, then all atoms must share this center. That is, if you only have the one cake, then all the children must share that cake. That is, when a smaller torus falls in the center of a bigger torus, then the smaller torus can travel anywhere in the universe in the blink of an eye. That is, if you are in the Milky Way Galaxy and then you want to travel to another galaxy, then you enter the toroidal core, and then you can exit through any atom in the universe. This might explain some quantum phenomena. That is, all is connected, but not really. It is something more fundamental: All is one. There is nothing or no one outside the One, and, therefore, the One will continue to move at a constant velocity forever. Free energy is when you use toruses to propel your car, and then these toruses are spread out into the environment; here, the toruses eventually enter the core of other bigger toruses; once at the core, the smaller toruses that you used to propel your car, end up in your free energy device anew. Of course, you don\u2019t need to use the exact same tori. Free energy is so simple: The beginning of time is always hot/ordered. That is, energy cannot be created nor destroyed. Thus, in a zero-dimensional environment, energy will not die. Thus, the dead energy in the universe that falls into the zero-dimensional environment is revived. In a 3-dimensional environment, energy can die because the law of probability spreads the energy across the universe. A real warp drive is actually possible because the torus, or the bbb, comes in all sizes because the bbb/torus can be scaled like the octaves on your piano. You can therefore set up a toroidal-field around your spacecraft, and then you can enter a bigger torus\u2019 core and fly out where you want in the universe. Q: But, will not the toroidal core crush your spacecraft? That is, you must enter the zeroth-dimension! How can you survive such a trip? How will you fit? This is impossible! A: This is just speculation, but I believe that you actually need two toruses/whirlpools around your spacecraft with your spacecraft located at the center of the two whirlpools\u2019 eyes. The eye of the storm is calm. You can hide here. And, here is the ingenious part: If you shall travel to the center of a bigger torus, how can you go through this bigger torus\u2019 zero-dimensional neck without being crushed? The answer is: You don\u2019t! You set up a dual torus field around your spacecraft and then you let the field travel through the zeroth-dimension while you yourself rest comfortably in the eye of the storm or, more accurately, the eyes of the storms. Note that you need a dual torus because you need to sit inside two eyes simultaneously with one torus going head through the zeroth-dimension, while the other closes the gap behind you. If you only employed the one torus, then you would get halfway through the Underworld and then, the waters of nothingness would crush you from behind! You really need two eyes. Note that a torus has two eyes. Two toruses have four eyes. You need to create a protective bubble using two eyes. Also, note that your spacecraft would look like the classic UFO because you need to fit inside the two eyes that are sitting opposite each other. You can also have a cigar shape. The classic UFO disc-shape and the cigar work. A whirlpool is a torus. Nevertheless, when you look at the whirlpool, you only see a part of the whole torus. More: The Philosopher\u2019s Stone is the cuboctahedron. The cuboctahedron is immortal because it is the heart of Nature; that is, Eternity has not ended Nature yet, which means that Nature can resurrect itself. Consciousness is the cuboctahedron. The Philosopher\u2019s Stone = you are immortal. You are immortal because it makes sense that consciousness should be the primal process in Nature because of the measurement problem. That is, if consciousness itself is the stuff that the universe is made of, which the cuboctahedron suggests, then consciousness plays a vital role in the evolution of the stuff. It is not that mind can affect matter, rather, matter is mind. Thus, mind is affecting mind in these quantum experiments. The light hits our eye, and then the information in the light is sent to our brain, and then our brain generates the 3D world that we see. We see with our brain\u2014if we didn\u2019t, we wouldn\u2019t be able to dream, for example. The universe that you perceive is in your mind. Is there something outside the mind when the brain that is generating the universe itself is included in the 3D world? Talk about bootstrapping! The brain that is generating the world is a product of the world that the brain is generating. This is like the worst chicken and egg thing ever. Which came first, the chicken or the egg? It turns out the chicken hatched from the egg and then later, the now adult chicken laid the egg it hatched from. This is how bizarre our modern picture of the universe is. One solution is that, we must have a real brain beyond \u201cthe brain that is sitting in our skulls.\u201d This real brain, I believe, is consciousness. That is, consciousness is primal. Consciousness is the heart of Nature itself. Note: Obviously, I am not saying that human awareness is primal. The evolutionary context of a primal consciousness is the consciousness\u2019 own feedback loop. This feedback loop I believe to be the torus. If all atoms, etc., are toruses, then consciousness exists in all things, even in rocks. But, this is a very different kind of consciousness than, say, the consciousness of an animal that has billions of years of evolutionary context or history. In summa: Consciousness can exist without the brain, and consciousness is not a product of the brain; in fact, consciousness is not even located in the brain per se. Consciousness is tucked away inside the fabric of space-time, that is, consciousness resides in the black heart of nothingness/the toroidal core. However, consciousness is in the brain, as it were, because the brain contains, say, 150 trillion trillion toruses\u2014the tori work together to produce the illusion of \u201cyou.\u201d I believe the brain is more like the carrier for the evolutionary context. \u201cPut it on,\u201d and suddenly you are a human or a fish or whatever the evolutionary history says you are. That consciousness is primal solves the measurement problem. ",

            "answer_text": "\u201cFree Energy\u201d does not exist. Everything has a cost, and every energy source is slave to the laws of thermodynamics. Even if we invented a means for harvesting some incredibly powerful form of energy hitherto undiscovered tomorrow, creating the devices in sufficient number to power the world would still take time and money. Tesla thought that electromagnetic waves would be that power source, and in a way, he was right. Solar power takes advantage of the EM radiation the Sun puts out in the visible light spectrum to produce power, but it is hardly cheap and free. Most other waves do not carry sufficient power to be useful to humanity. Look at the size of the dishes of the Large Array Observatory for evidence of how diffuse other EM waves can be. Overunity devices, or any other \u201cfree\u201d energy source, do not exist. No arrangement of magnets will put out more energy than it takes to create them, or even to really make passive rotational energy, because of the Maxwell\u2019s equations. You cannot use the power of falling water to run a pump that pumps the water back up, at least without losing a significant amount of the power it took in the first place. All mechanical systems have inefficiency and are subject to the advancement of entropy. The closest thing we have to \u201cfree\u201d energy is fusion, and we have not figured that out yet. Free here means so cheap and easily used relative to individual unit cost (read $/Watt) as to be basically inconsequential in cost. Nuclear, maybe, can also be considered in this category, though the dangers of using nuclear have their own cost. ",
