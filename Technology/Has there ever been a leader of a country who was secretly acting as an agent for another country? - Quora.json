            "answer_text": "No. Not that we know about. The US has \u201cappointed\u201d puppets in other countries like the current leaders of Iran and Saddam Hussein in Iraq. They always turn on the US without exception that I know of. Other countries may have done this more covertly but why would the leader of a country share power? They only reluctantly share power with whoever they need in their own country. Why would they share it with someone else. Some countries gets money to be allies to for example the US. But that relationship only goes as far as the money flow. That is two large corporations making business. The only exception to this is when one country occupy another and appoint a local leader. But in this case it is usually not secret and backed up with a large amount of tanks and soldiers. Is it possible that some non government organization like the \u201cIlluminati\u201d manage to get leaders into their own or foreign countries. Well in Europe we have a history of Catholics and Protestants working hard on that which is why we separated church and state. But yes cults can infiltrate governments and religious leaders can influence leaders. This is however different from being a \u201csecret agent\u201d. The difference is that a spy usually has limited loyalty to his or her employer while a remember of a religious group has a supernatural reason to stay loyal. Running a country of course are only material and temporal possessions and a deeply religious person may not see those as very important. ",
