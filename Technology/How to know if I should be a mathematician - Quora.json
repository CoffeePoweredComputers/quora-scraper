            "answer_text": "I think there are basically two types of people that study mathematics. The scientist (especially the physicist) and the engineer, who use mathematics all the time, but really don\u2019t \u201ccreate\u201d anything new in mathematics. And the mathematician, who either started out as a scientist or engineer, until he found he had an ability to create something new - perhaps even if nothing more than a \u201cnew way to teach mathematics\u201d - in mathematics. Or who started out as someone who clearly has to compensate for his greater innate ability and innate interest in mathematics with some sort of \u201cmental disability\u201d. This makes an answer very easy for you. Study the mathematics you need for science or engineering, and if you find that you are interested just as much or even more in the mathematics than the other subjects, increase the number of mathematics courses you take, and decrease the number of other courses. Until you reach the point that you find the other courses to be significantly easier, or more interesting in a \u201cpractical sense\u201d, than the mathematics courses. Then you should start asking yourself the practical question of what job you want to do, once you have your degree. There is a point in the academic progress of the \u201cnormal mathematician\u201d where he will NOT like the way his brain HURTS when he thinks too much about \u201csolving a problem\u201d, unless he can get paid for it. Although there are some very well paid jobs for good mathematicians - like the ones that calculate financial \u201ctrends\u201d and \u201cstrategies\u201d. Or if you find that you are interested in mathematics, and enjoy mathematics, but not that interested in science and engineering, first ask yourself if you enjoy the \u201cartistic\u201d aspect of mathematics. As for example, music or graphic design. If so, keep on studying the mathematics, but also encourage that artistic aspect in yourself, For when your brain starts hurting by thinking too much. I myself can appreciate the mathematics in physics much better after exploring the chromatic scale mathematics found in a piano. Although the impression I get from many mathematicians is that they still prefer (to paraphrase Albert Einstein) \u201canalyze a symphony\u201d instead of just appreciating it for what it is. I find that very often the act of creating \u201cpatterns\u201d in music can soothe a brain that hurts from concentrating too much on an \u201cobjective\u201d. But if you really positively enjoy the CHALLENGE of pushing yourself to \u201csolve the problem\u201d, to the exclusion of everything else that you could otherwise enjoy the chances are that you will be a very good mathematician that us \u201cnormal people\u201d will appreciate even if we console ourselves with the idea that we gave up on the higher mathematics because it was so boring, that only a \u201cmental defective\u201d would enjoy it and not just because it was really getting too difficult to do without having some sort of financial reward for it and not just the \u201cthrill of discovery and invention\u201d that us mere mortals get from the science, engineering, and art. Something else I should tell you, that could possibly help. In your studies so far, have you ever learned anything, that at first you didn\u2019t understand, but then you understood much BETTER than you were taught? I think that defined the type of \u201cmathematician\u201d I would be. As I learned more in other subjects, I realised that the subjects I liked best were the ones where I \u201clearned how to learn\u201d. In other words, despite the fact that I have a very high IQ, I am not that \u201cintelligent\u201d. At least not as \u201cintelligent\u201d as the \u201cpure mathematician\u201d - because \u201cintelligence\u201d is really about the ability to \u201clearn how to learn\u201d. And I found that in mathematics, unlike other subjects, it really didn\u2019t get any easier to learn, the more I learned. All I really gained, at the end of my last mathematics course, was a \u201cadditional collection of mathematical tools\u201d. Perfectly suitable for use, but no help at all in obtaining new tools, or from seeing how I could construct my own tools. So if you find that the more you learn about mathematics, the easier you find mathematics to learn, then you should be a mathematician. ",

            "answer_text": "I have a secret pact with myself, not to answer any question that has \u201cshould\u201d in it. \u201cShould\u201d in what sense? As in, would you be the happiest this way? Would it make your friends and family happy? Would you be living as comfortably as you could? Should that be a concern? Should it not? Should people pursue their passion, or a practical career? What are the governing meta-rules that tell us what we \u201cshould\u201d do? I don\u2019t know that any of those questions has a reasonable answer. My personal life experience taught me that people eventually do what they love doing, and choosing otherwise leads to either a good life with a mildly nagging yearning for a different one, or to tragic outcomes, or to anywhere between those extremes. For the OP specifically: why are you an engineering student? Because it thrills you, or because it\u2019s the most reasonable track for high employability with good benefits? If you\u2019re asking the question, I get the sense that you don\u2019t feel the same need to learn engineering as you do math. In that case, my personal vote would be to study more math, get a Ph.D. and see how you feel then. Perhaps you\u2019ll love research, perhaps you won\u2019t. Perhaps you\u2019ll find it easy to build a totally different career out of a math Ph.D. Who knows. But you clearly have a passion for math, and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a great idea to ignore that drive. The good news is that, again in my personal experience, it\u2019s not too hard to channel a math Ph.D. into many different careers, not necessarily just being a research mathematician. So for now, if you can afford it (which may not be the case), I would suggest you try signing up for a graduate math program and enjoy yourself for a few years. You\u2019ll learn a lot about yourself as you do this, and it\u2019s a reasonably good bet given what little I know about you. ",
