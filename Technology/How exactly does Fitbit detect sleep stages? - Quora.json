The thing is I really don't think most people understand how inaccurate these things can really be. My point in saying this is that basically if you are someone with insomnia\u2026 And you lay there exhausted every night not moving just trying to sleep and your heart rate is fairly low\u2026 It will register as if you are sleeping. That is all I'm trying to say. If you were someone that sleeps pretty well on a normal basis\u2026 You will probably not notice the inaccuracies because you will be sleeping for the most part. If you were someone that sleeps pretty well on a normal basis\u2026 You will probably not notice the inaccuracies because you will be sleeping for the most part. where I think it is accurate is simply with movement\u2026 If you move around a lot\u2026 The fit bit could probably most likely indicate that on the results , which may help some people. I think it all depends on why someone is using it for sleep specifically. For me\u2026 I have extreme sleep deprivation\u2026 And a fit bit by no means is giving me any information that I would find useful ",

            "answer_text": "They use of combination of motion tracking (actigraphy) and heart rate data to estimate your sleep stage at any given time. Different sleep stages are known to have different heart rate and activity patterns - on average, in deep sleep people have lower heart rates and less movement; light sleep, higher heart rate and more movement. It\u2019s important to remember these are estimates of sleep stages, not direct measurements. While significant progress has been made in recent years, there\u2019s been very little clinical research published on the accuracy of sleep tracking from wearables, particularly beyond simple motion/actigraphy, so take your results with that in mind.
