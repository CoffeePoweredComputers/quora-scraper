            "answer_text": "Do cell phones emit unique, intercept-able signals (when they communicate with anything: wifi, cell towers, bluetooth)? Can you tell one phone's signals apart from another's? Let's discuss cellular communications, since Wi-Fi and Bluetooth work exactly according to their respective protocols, regardless of whether it's a phone, a laptop, or a tablet. For cellular radio communications, yes they do, but the equipment needed to intercept it is prohibitively costly for the casual listener. Remember when \u201cpolice scanners\u201d used to be a thing? You could listen on many different channels at the same time.  But police technology improved. They went to digital trunked radio systems and mobile data terminals. Listening in on those transmissions today would sound like old telephone modems. You still could (assuming they're not frequency hopping or using spread spectrum), but you need a special DAC (digital to analog converter) to do it, and they are not cheap. Cell phones today are the same. They communicate using all digital signals between the tower and the handset. You would need a very specialized DAC setup to even get close to being able to hear anything. But cell phone radios use specialized broadcast techniques to save battery and improve bandwidth, and these techniques do not lend themselves to easy interception. ",

Also yes. Devices called IMSI Catchers, casually known as Stingrays, can do what you\u2019re asking about. They\u2019re not usually sold to the general public. Law enforcement and intelligence agencies are rumored to use them rather often. ",
