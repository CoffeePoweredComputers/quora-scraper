            "answer_text": "Quantum computer follows the principles of quantum mechanics to process information. The fundamental unit of today\u2019s computer is known as bits(0,1) where as the fundamental unit of quantum computer is qubit which contains both 0 and 1 and some extra values (superposition form) in between these causing the computability of these computers high which is in conventional computer is 2^n. Quantum computer is 3600 times faster than today\u2019s computers. If making of quantum computers will be possible it will take very few time to solve np-hard problems. Factorisation would not be a big deal. Encrypted codes can be decoded in seconds. It would take years to break the security of quantum computers. Since it will take very few time to complete a task and operates on the basis of quantum mechanics (charging of atoms) thousand million dollars electricity charges can be saved. Though much not known about the principles of quantum mechanics on making quantum computer making a real quantum computer is a myth or reality no one knows. But if making of quantum computer will be possible one day it will change the idea of computers in future. ",
