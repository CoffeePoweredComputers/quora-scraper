            "answer_text": "A SSD uses flash memory similar to RAM, but does not clear when powered off, like RAM. SSDs use a grid of electrical cells to quickly send and recieve data, which have 2 positions, 1 or 0, or On and Off respectively, which is how a disc harddrive also works. When data is stored, these cells are either on or off. When the harddrive is being read, the computer\u2019s compiler knows how each combination of switches signifies a command, like how \u2018a\u2019 is stored as \u2018 01100001\u2019 where each number is called a bit, and 8 bits make 1 byte. So it takes 1 string of 8 numbers for the computer to store the letter \u2018a,\u2019 or any letter for that matter. ",
