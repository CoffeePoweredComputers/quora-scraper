            "answer_text": "DO NOT engage him. Your description sounds dead-on for a narcissist. You will only give him power if you respond. Unplug him. Let him go on to his next supply. (I only wish we could warn the world about them to save the next person. I wish someone could have warned me). I\u2019m sure he already has someone. They need a supply. Mine had a couple simultaneously. I was exposed to a now-diagnosed bi-polar, sociopathic narcissist for over 4 years. Unfortunately, I hit a mental disorder trifecta with him. While he initially lavished me with attention and couldn\u2019t be with me enough, it was all a HUGE lie. Narcissists don\u2019t care about anyone but themselves. He\u2019s incapable. His ego is bruised because you won\u2019t respond. It will heal. Not your responsibility. Despite his horrible treatment of me, the hardest part of letting go of my husband was hearing my therapist (who had seen him in some of my sessions) tell me that he wouldn\u2019t care if I told him how much he had hurt me. He has no empathy. Again, incapable. She told me he saw me as a possession. A possession!?! How could that be? I was completely devoted to him. I stayed after the first affair, his accompanying suicide threats and his resulting stay in the psyche ward. Turns out I was just something he could use, pretend to love and then toss aside when he started a relationship, with my friend, for whom he was fixing up my house (of 10 years from before we married), for her to move into with her kids, once she left her husband for my husband of only one year! He even insisted she and her husband join us for one day of our one-year anniversary trip to the beach. Yes. Noooooooo conscience whatsoever. The man who never fought with me, told me he loved me several times a day and spent all his time with me holding my hand had suddenly, become verbally and borderline physically abusive. (He had started throwing things at me, so the abuse was escalating). Now I know it was because he had already replaced me and now I was an annoyance to him. He would wait until we were in the car and for no reason scream, not yell, scream at me - once for an hour and a half! I was trapped in a moving vehicle and when I allowed him to keep going uninterrupted because I knew if I said what I really wanted to say and how I wanted to say it he would have probably hit me. During his verbal beatdown he stopped to mock me saying he couldn\u2019t understand how I didn\u2019t have anything to say. Are you kidding me?! I calmly told him I had a lot to say, but this wasn\u2019t the time. He couldn\u2019t have been rationalized with at that time, or any really. I left him after discovering the second affair and seeing his texts to people he was literally hooking up with on Craigslist. After a few initial attempts to get me back and me not responding, he stopped, but not after his efforts to cause carnage in my personal and professional lives by lying to people about me. He tried to get me fired. He tried to destroy me. I cannot begin to tell you my level of anger. This man never loved me nor anyone for that matter. After I ignored his multiple texts, he left me alone. Note: I had the ability to see his texts to everyone. He was still texting the second affair and had started another affair with another girl, both at his workplace (the man is truly mentally ill) and less than 30 days after we were separated he was already calling Jessica his \u201cfuture wife\u201d and telling her how he couldn\u2019t wait to marry her! I just wish I could have talked to her and warned her. But she wouldn\u2019t have believed me and he would have come after me for doing it. When he stopped contacting me it was one of the best days of my life. It has been 2 1/2 years since we separated. I am still not over it. I was devastated. The scars are deep, but I have learned. I have triumphed. You will too. Just cut him out of your life. His presence in your life is cancerous, and if you let him back in he will cause more destruction. You do not deserve it. Hugs to you. Welcome to the other side. The bright side. ",

            "answer_text": "This is a game that YOU are going to win, because you can see the manipulation already. My HUSBAND dumped me by voice message after 7 years of marriage. Said it wasn\u2019t much of a marriage, that I don\u2019t add anything to his life, I just subtract from his life. He sat in his office with an Excel spread sheet and decided that I was a negative. Why? I was no longer useful. I helped him through addiction recovery, rebuilding relationships with business associates and family, helping with his 2 young boys, caring for him when he was hospitalized, providing necessary income during the recession when he lost everything, holding his hand while he curled up in the fetal position from the stress of his first chance to rebound, etc. And as soon as he started making BANK again, I ceased to exist and I could be standing there NAKED and he would look right THROUGH me. Long story short, we did the push/pull game until I was suicidal and he NEVER BACKED DOWN. Just became meaner than I ever imagined a human being could be. And this was my HUSBAND. Please listen to what I\u2019m saying. GO DARK. Never speak to him again. Every story ends the same way. With your total destruction. He gets off on your pain. Read that again. He ENJOYS your pain because he thinks you are a piece of shit that is beneath him. There are NO EXCEPTIONS. You may think you are an exception, because the truth is too painful to contemplate. So don\u2019t contemplate. Accept it and move on. They are all TEXTBOOK CASES. It\u2019s the road to hell. Read what you have written above. It\u2019s what an INSANE person would do, right? Bingo. So ghost him. Get free counseling at your local women\u2019s abuse shelter. Come here and discuss with the lovely Quora crew. Buy a stack of books on the topic. Whatever you need to do to accept the truth. If you go back, it\u2019s a death spiral. Keep seeking advice and stories from survivors like myself. Sometimes you need to hear the same thing 100 times before you accept having your heart ripped out without anesthesia. And that\u2019s ok too. I almost died. Please don\u2019t die! Love you ",
