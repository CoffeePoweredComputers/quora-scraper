            "answer_text": "This sounds like a homework question, that is loaded with lecture specific context. There are different architectures available to design a CPU and a lot of design choices within those architectures. So to get exactly 7 componets you have to know which architecture and which design choices. Most CPUs in desktop computers and cellphones are a Von Neuman architecture. So a CPU that is adding A to B has to fetch the add instruction, fetch A then fetch B. All program and data is stored in the same memory. But some jobs have to be done quickly in real time so there is separate memory for programs and data. That means you can fetch the instructions and data at the same time. But that also requires an extra address bus and data bus for talking to program memory or data memory. TI and Analog Devices have both made some pretty slick DSP CPUs that have been used to process radar at Mach speeds. You aren\u2019t going to build a cpu with 7 componets that supports 100MIPS of multiply accumulates from the instruction level parallelism of a VLIW. (Very Long Instruction Word) And it takes a lot of multiply accumulates to do FFTs and inverse FFTs for a single step in radar process or target image recognition. Some CPUs are designed with instruction pipelining to improve performance. That will add more boxes in your cpu block diagram. Some CPUs offer memory segmentation and paging methods with code privilege level controls. Again more boxes in the cpu block diagram. If you have heard of Spectre and meltdown; this is the cpu box we are talking about here. But if you learn enough about digital logic, and then a hardware description language like Verilog or VHDL, you might be able to write your own CPU. And then you might cynically observe that there are only 5 componets to a CPU: 1 Master Clock and derived timing 2 Multiplexors and demultiplexors 3 Combinatorial gating 4 Microcode Control Store 5 Nested state machines optionally 6 JTAG; Because you have to be a masochist to design a CPU without some kind of debugging tool. And that is pretty well true regardless of which architecture and design decisions are made. So I can legitimately claim there is 5 or 6 componets to a CPU. ",

            "answer_text": "Those are some of the basic functional units you\u2019ll find inside a modern microprocessor/system-on-chip (SoC): CPU cores with their Level 1 instruction + data caches along with their Level 2 cache. Note that the L1 cache is located inside the cpu pipeline but the L2 is outside but still part of the the core silicon.Inside each CPU Core you have the pipeline, most cpu microarchitectures will do the following:- Fetch the instructions from the Level 1 i-cache and pre-decodes them.- Store pre-decoded instruction in a queue.- Decode instructions into smaller units called micro-operations. This process is aided by the micro-code ROM.- Store decoded micro-operations into an allocation queue.- Execute micro-ops. This is done by the execution engine (often out-of-order) which includes a scheduler and a reservation station (RS). The RS has several execution ports which are linked to execution units (EUs). Those EUs (or ALUs) can perform many tasks involving integer, vector, floating point and load/store operations.- Write data in a store or forward buffer which will itself move it in the Level 1 d-cache. The data will eventually move back to the L2, L3 and RAM after several cycles.A large shared Level 3 cache which is split in small slices for each of the cores. For example, an Intel Core i7-7700 has 8MiB of L3 which is split in four 2MiB slices for each of the four cores.An interconnect or common processor data fabric which links each of the core L3 slices together (or core group to L3). Examples are: Ring Interconnect for Intel, Infinity Fabric for AMD and Dynamic IQ Shared Unit (DSU) for ARM SoCs.A graphics processing unit (GPU) which is also linked to the interconnect/fabric.Memory controller for interfacing with DRAM and a PCI Express (or I/O) controller which provides a number of PCI Express lanes (often 20\u201324). A number of lanes (~4) are reserved for the point-to-point interconnect which links the processor SoC to the chipset/platform controller hub. If a microprocessor has 24 lanes, 16 may be reserved for external graphics, 4 for the CPU<->Chipset link and another 4 for PCIe storage (NVME SSD).A display engine which contain display pipes for digital output (HDMI, DP, DVI-D).A multimedia engine which consists of digital signal processors (DSP), image signal processors (ISP), hardware codecs (for encoding and decoding audio and video streams), Note that some SoCs may have an LTE modem and wireless comms (WiFi and BT) integrated.Here is what the whole thing looks like for AMD Ryzen:  ",

This may among other things modify the program counter, thus causing a jump in the program.a unit to read or write data. Reading can be from any accessible location, but writing can only be to locations which allow it.This is drastically simplified, and real processors have many other features - internal registers, effectively local specialised memory, cache memory, pipelines, floating point units, interrupt handling and so on.

            "answer_text": "This is not by any means a complete answer, but it may be a good starting point. The key component of the CPU (or other integrated circuits) is the Transistor. The basic idea of the transistor is an electronic device composed of three layers of semiconductors where the middle layer has different characteristic than the ones on the side. Various types of transistors were derived from the original idea, but one key type is metal\u2013oxide\u2013semiconductor field-effect transistor (MOSFET) or metal\u2013oxide\u2013silicon transistor. As the name suggests - silicon and some metal oxide are involved. According to this page Semiconductor device: \u201cthere have been an estimated 13 sextillion MOSFETs manufactured between 1960 and 2018.\u201d Some of those for sure must have gone to the CPUs.
