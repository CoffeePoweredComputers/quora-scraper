            "answer_text": "In MCU Vibranium is not heavy  When Cap saw Vibranium for the first time (Captain America:The First Avenger) . He said: Wow it is very lite!!!  Then Howard Stark replied: It is Vibranium , stronger than steel weighted third of it. A very rare metal. By later researches Vibranium comes with a caption : The strongest metal on earth(Avengers:Age of Ultron) But adamantium is heavy. Despite Wolverine always got the potential strength for easily managing it. Because Adamantium is a part of his body. So Vibranium is not heavy and Wakanda has no problem with it. ",
