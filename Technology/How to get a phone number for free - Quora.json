            "answer_text": "You can get a free phone number by downloading \u201cTelos\u201d in App Store. Telos Free Phone Number & Unlimited Call and Texts on the App Store Telos provides free phone numbers for countries like the US, the UK, Canada, Belgium and so on. By entering an area code or city name, you can select a favorite number. A number easy to remember is a plus to socializing and business. You can also get a phone number which contains personal special meanings. Choosing your lucky number is possible. Calls among Telos users are totally free, even internationally. To call someone who is not on Telos, you can pay by Telos credits, which are easily earned by daily check-in, watching videos, completing a survey, inviting a friend to use Telos and the like. International calls are much cheaper compared with services by local carriers, which is a benefit when traveling abroad. It saves roaming charges for calling local taxi drivers, hotels and restaurants and there are no monthly fees and hidden charges. A phone number from Telos will keep your personal digits private and save you from the inconvenience of carrying two cell phones. What\u2019s more, a toll free vanity number provided by the app with area codes boosts your business. ",

            "answer_text": "Well about as close to FREE as you can get. Freedom Pop has sales 1 Penny SIM Card. Then you activate it FREE then you use the Regular Plan part of that month. At some point b4 they start charging for the next month you go into your Account & downgrade to Free Service. You still will get a certain amount of SMS/Voice/ & then also AT &T 4 G LTE data. No huge amounts but if you use WiFi for the larger amount of your usage your good to go. Be Careful to not go over your caps cause they do come in & stop service if your close. Then you have to add $10 to ensure your not gonna use more than your allowed or get into some owing type thing. It is a very very neat Service that I have on 2 phones. You can actually gain Data from others sending it to you. I do like Freedom Pop & also Magic Jack App. It reminds me of OTA Free Broadcast TV for the phone. ",
