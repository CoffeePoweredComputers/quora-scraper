            "answer_text": "Educational technology professionals continuously evaluate existing curricula and educational programs. Where needed, these educators refresh curricula and programs using new texts and materials, new technologies, and other resources. They also train teachers in the use of new technologies and material, as well as in new teaching methods. Educational technology professionals also monitor newly implemented programs to ensure expectations are satisfied and that state education requirements are met. These professionals commonly work for public school districts, where they serve many schools within the district. They work closely with teachers and administrators in developing and implementing their improvement plans.  ",
