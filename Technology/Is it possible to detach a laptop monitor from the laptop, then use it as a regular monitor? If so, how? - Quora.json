            "answer_text": "A laptop \u201cmonitor\u201d is not a monitor at all, but a raw LCD panel driven by the laptop mainboard. A typical LCD monitor has a VGA/DVI/HDMI cable input, and has electronics to convert that video stream into something that the panel can understand, namely LVDS (low voltage differential signalling). An LVDS cable can only run limited length and has many wires. In the case of a laptop, the motherboard produces an LVDS signal directly, and feeds the panel. This saves money and is economical due to the short distances involved. When you pull an LCD panel out of a laptop, you need to add the electronics that will make it a monitor, including a LVDS board (which is matched to the panel you are using), a power supply, and an appropriate driver for the backlight of that panel. You also will also need to add on the \u201cbuttons\u201d that make up the front of the monitor for power, brightness, contracts, and other parameters. It\u2019s almost never worth it to do so, but you can find kits to do that job for just about any panel on eBay and AliExpress. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, you can do that 100%. But its going to be hard, expensive, and probably not worth it. When you take apart your laptop screen you'll find a lot of ribbon cables (be careful!). A couple of the cables will plug into the back of the LCD, unplug those. Now look all over the back of the LCD panel (be careful!) And find any numbers on the back and Google until you find a match. From their you can find a monitor controller board designed for your LCD panel, it'll come from China and might not work (be careful!). If it does work, you now have to build a monitor housing to protect your LCD panel (be careful!). Or you could go to Best buy or Walmart and pick up a cheap monitor for like 80 bucks. ",
