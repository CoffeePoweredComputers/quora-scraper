            "answer_text": "Most ham radios are pretty user-friendly, at least for the basic functions. They aren\u2019t mass-market products aimed at the average consumer. Ham radio gear tends to emphasize performance and versatility, not a whiz-bang display, the latest apps, and stylish looks. It is intended for use by people who are at least moderately technical in nature. They need to be able to pull out weak signals from noise, not just handshake with the closest tower. Your cellphone automatically adjusts it\u2019s own RF gain, power output, modulation level, etc., without any user intervention. Think of it\u2019s internal radio kind of like a point-and-shoot camera. A ham radio is closer to using an SLR camera in \u201cmanual\u201d mode, where you need to decide on focus, aperture, shutter speed, ISO, etc. Capable of much higher performance, in the right hands.

            "answer_text": "The term \u2018user friendly\u2019 is subjective and depends on the feelings of the user. Ham radios are extremely versatile instruments, requiring lots of skill and knowledge by the operator in extreme conditions, such as very noisy and crowded bands, fading of signals, long distance communication and nearby powerful transmitters creating large unwanted signals in your receiver. Ham radios have been built for over 100 years and every cycle brought more useful features or user-friendly features. Today\u2019s flagship transceivers of the different manufacturers are almost 100 % identical in features and capabilities. That means they have reached a relative maximum of functionality and usefulness or call it user-friendliness. Comparing user friendliness between modern ham radios with cell phones does not make sense. It is like comparing a nuclear submarine with a chain saw. Both serve their purpose well and both are user friendly for their well trained and educated users. ",
