            "answer_text": "You can call the phone company and tell them you\u2019re over 18 and they can block him from being able to track you. Once you\u2019re an adult, that\u2019s an invasion of privacy. Your mother could do the same and he\u2019d probably never know why he lost the ability to track you. You need to find out why he\u2019s tracking you, though. If it\u2019s just out of love and concern, that\u2019s all fine and well and he should understand that you\u2019re an adult now and that isn\u2019t okay to do without your permission. If it\u2019s anything more than that (desire to control you, some sort of abusive intentions), then it\u2019s time to start apartment hunting and looking into getting your own phone plan. It could easily just be a very unintentional and loving overstep. My mom tracked my phone obsessively my first semester of college. She was just so used to waking up at 3 am and checking on her babies (I\u2019m the oldest and only female), she wanted a way to confirm that I was home and safe in the middle of the night without calling me every night at 3 am. I made her stop and sometimes she would call me at 3 am but that\u2019s just because our parents love us. They can\u2019t help it. Fast forward a decade and I\u2019m 28 and share my location information with my dad willingly just in case something happens- like when I was 5 months pregnant and passed out at the wheel, I called my dad and said \u201cdaddy I crashed my car\u201d and that was it and he was there right away. Sometimes it can be helpful. He shares his location with me as well so I can find him if he falls out of a tree stand or something. It\u2019s all love here. On the flip side of that, I knew a girl who\u2019s father was very controlling of her. She confronted him about it in her mid 20s and her father lost it and basically vowed to kill his whole family or something absolutely insane like that. The entire family has restraining orders against him. This isn\u2019t even the first time I\u2019ve heard of something like this happening either. This is why having an idea of your father\u2019s intentions is important. If his intentions are good, you can totally talk to him about it and if you do it in a mature and respectful manner, he should understand. (Expect some blowback but keep your cool- prove to him that you are an adult and he doesn\u2019t need to keep tabs on you.) If his intentions are bad, seek help. Call your local counseling center (most will take your insurance if you have it and if not, they can help you with that too). They are trained to help people remove themselves from abusive situations (any level of abuse) and they can provide you with the necessary resources. However, if you\u2019d like to avoid all of that and think it\u2019d work, just call the phone company, as I said, and tell them you\u2019re grown and don\u2019t wanna be tracked anymore. Hope this helps. ",

            "answer_text": "Hi mate, thanks for your question Is your Dad aware that he is breaking the law? With regard to your question, NO IT IS DEFINITELY NOT NORMAL You are 19, legally an adult, your Dad has no right whatsoever to track your phone, EVER, He has obviously put a tracking programme on your phone, these are VERY hard to find if you don't know what you are looking for. You need to download and install Malwarebytes Antimalware from the store. When it's up and running click on the full scan button, I promise you it will find this tracking program within minutes, It will give you 3 options, Uninstall, Ignore and Quarantine. Click on the Quarantine button this will render the program useless immediately and it will also recognise and prevent the program from being installed, if he tries to do it again. Make a note of the name of the tracker program, then confront your Dad and ask him, who the hell does he think he is putting (program name) on your phone without your express permission. It's best to confront him when all the families present, as this will be a nightmare for him, which he deserves. I'd leave Malwarebytes on your phone as it is also a brilliant anti-virus program, plus it's free. Best wishes. Vangellis. ",
