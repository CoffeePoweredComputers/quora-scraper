            "answer_text": "Below are a few mind-bending future applications of Elon Musk's Neuralink project:  1. Visual Prosthesis The project can provide a visual prosthesis for people with retinal injury or blindness due to eye injury. The concept is to plug a camera right into the visual cortex and incite a considerable array of about tens of thousands of electrodes to create a visual image. Elon Musk even stated that with this tech, they could give somebody supervision. 2. Telepathy As per the lead chip designers at Neuralink, there is a possibility of telepathy potential as the next frontier for Neuralink. The lead chip designers explain that it is an incredible effort to put thoughts into words and helps share the actual thoughts and interact appropriately. So the words are a compressed form of our extensive thinking capabilities. 3. Eliminate Pain In-house neurosurgeons present at the event told that pain is the basis of human sufferings. Today there are several diseases causing pain, and the treatments are also painful. In case, the pain can be reduced then the perception of ailments will alter considerably. Neuralink devices will play a significant role in it. 4. Solve Mental Illnesses The device can ascend to more channels and regions. It goes deeper to resolve problems concerning fear, anxiety, and depression. If you have a fear of heights, and still want to enjoy rock climbing. Musk suggests that fear might be helpful.
