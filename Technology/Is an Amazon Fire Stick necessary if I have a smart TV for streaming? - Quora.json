            "answer_text": "A Smart TV is one that can connect directly to the Internet to access various features like channel guides, websites and, most commonly, streaming content. So you could say that a streaming media player actually turns a regular TV into a Smart TV because it pulls content from the Internet to display on the TV. So no, you don\u2019t need a Smart TV to use a streaming player. However, if you have a Smart TV, you still may want to use a separate player because, generally speaking, the TVs often don\u2019t support as many apps as the players do. One major exception is that some Smart TVs have a web browser built into them but the major streaming players don\u2019t. I expect both of these previous sentences to change before too long as more and more people move away from traditional cable and satellite services to Internet-based content. One other thing to note is that all of the Big Four streaming players (Roku, Amazon Fire TV, Apple TV, Google Chromecast) do require a TV with at least one HDMI port to plug into except for the Roku 1 model, which can connect to a TV using composite A/V cables (red/white/yellow connectors). So the Roku 1 is a good choice if you have an older TV that doesn\u2019t have HDMI ports. ",

            "answer_text": "No, its not neccessary since smart tv can stream the same content provided the TV manufacturer has a deal with them. However, you still need to connect them with streaming devices and buy them due to following two reasons Hardware: Apart from few Smart TV, mostly lack power in terms of processor, which means they are slow and buggy. This is area where amazon fire, chomecast packs a punch and speedy in nature.Content: Smart TVs often tout their ability to tap into Netflix, Hulu, HBO, etc. However, they lack the depth in the content offerings. The reason: It takes a lot of work to make the deals needed to go way down that long tail, and TV manufacturers are often too busy assembling their sets to meet with niche content providers. Further, developing content for different TV platforms is pain and content providers generally customized their content for big four streaming service providers like amazon fire stick, chomecast, etc.Thus, if you wish to have a seamless experience and access to desired content you need to buy these streaming devices. Also, with current low pricing of few thousand bucks its good value for money. To know in detail about the Amazon fire stick read below Amazon Fire Stick launched in India: Detailed review 2017 ",
