            "answer_text": "I have joined HCL in Bangalore. We were provided a training for 3 months at Coalesce Technologies, BTM Layout in technologies Oracle SQL, PL/SQL and Unix. We have had couple of best trainers in the industry for our training. We were also made to do several of mini projects using Oracle APEX and Oracle PL/SQL. The training quality was really good, trainers also gave us tips and motivation to go ahead and do certifications in the technologies we learnt. Our training period was an awesome time, we have really enjoyed a lot. It was not just learning technical things, it included multiple other activities to showcase our extra curricular talents, to improve our interpersonal skills. Our seniors had visited our training batches and have shared their inputs about how to use our training in the real project environments, this had served as motivational sessions for us as we were starting our career. Overall, it was really fruitful period in technical learning. However, end of the training we were put into different projects, wherein most of us never had chance to see or do code in our initial projects. ;-) ",
