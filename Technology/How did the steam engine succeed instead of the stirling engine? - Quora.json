            "answer_text": "The Steam engine was already developed and massively successful before Robert Stirling invented his \u201cAir Engine\u201d The main reason for the invention was to eliminate the boiler - a boiler explosion is a very impressive and dangerous thing! But Stirling engines suffer from some problems - in the real world they are LESS efficient than steam engines (despite all of the web pages saying the opposite) but that was not their fatal flaw! The biggest issue with Stirling engines is the amount of power that you can produce - the amount of power is directly related to the amount of the working gas - so for a lot of power you need either a big machine or you need to have the whole thing in a pressure vessel The result is that steam engines were Already common, more efficient, more powerful So despite the odd boiler explosion the Stirling engine never really caught on ",
