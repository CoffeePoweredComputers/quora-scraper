            "answer_text": "Broadband filters last for a very long time but occasionally can become clogged with oversized packets of data leading to a reduced flow rate. If this happens in your house try immersing the filter in warm water then allow up to three days for the filter to dry thoroughly. Then plug it back in to enjoy lightning fast speeds again. If the performance continues to disappoint, try adding a combination of baked beans, wholemeal bread and bran to the bucket. With fibre you can expect speeds of around half a gigabit per second. ",
