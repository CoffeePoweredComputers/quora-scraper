            "answer_text": "Forget copper wires and handsets. Today you can make phone calls anytime, anywhere using an Internet-connected computer, a headset, and voice over IP (VoIP) . VoIP is the technology that converts your voice into a digital signal, allowing you to make a call directly from a computer, a VoIP phone, or other data-driven devices. Simply put, it\u2019s phone service delivered over the internet. You may also hear it referred to as IP telephony, internet telephony, broadband telephony, or broadband phone service. The way it works VoIP technology enables traditional telephony services to operate over computer networks using packet-switched protocols. Packet-switched VoIP puts voice signals into packets, similar to an electronic envelope. VoIP packets can be transmitted over any VoIP-compatible network, such as a local area network (LAN). Not your ordinary telephone service Because VoIP uses packets, much more information can be carried over the network to support and enhance your communication needs. In addition to traditional voice services, VoIP gives you access to advanced applications that can potentially help your staff be more agile and productive. VoIP solutions aimed at businesses have evolved into unified communications services that treat all communications\u2014phone calls, faxes, voice mail, email, web conferences, and more\u2014as discrete units that can all be delivered via any means and to any handset, including cell phones. The bottom line Switching to VoIP might also help you save money on communications services. Long-distance and international calls are generally free with VoIP service. The only charge is for your internet access. Implementing VoIP doesn\u2019t mean that all your employees have to use IP-enabled phones. The best VoIP providers implement IP telephony in a manner that protects your investment in existing telephone equipment, even if you have analog telephone stations. ",

            "answer_text": "VOIP, very basically put, is a method used to allow telephone calls to be placed at times over the public internet in an effort to save money and become more versatile than traditional telephone systems. Think of it as having 2 large highways side by side. One is private, from the telephone company, and they charge you dearly to use it. The other is the public highway. which allows you to use it for free, and get on/off at will as needed. Your call initially gets placed over the public network, the internet, and then travels as far as possible to the end caller and is then connected back to the telephone companies private network for the final endloop. So thats where you pay the least possible to the telco to use their system. By using such a diversified system, long distance calls hop on off both the private telco system and the public internet to save you money. In many cases the savings are up to 99% of what the telephone company would like to charge you. But since you\u2019re only paying for the final end-loop, or local-loop as they call it, you\u2019re only payng a really small fee to use it. If you\u2019re a Rogers home phone service customer, a Vonager customer, MagicJack customer, a NetTalk customer, and so forth, you\u2019re using a VOIP service. They can vary greatly from company to company, and even when placing some calls to some destinations, but the savings to the average consumer is huge. ",
