            "answer_text": "Every time I watch a DVD or streaming movie with dark scenes, and you can see the patterns of digitization artifacts in the shadow areas, I lament the loss of the superb contrast ratio of old-school CRT TV\u2019s. Really\u2014 people who watch digital copies of \u2018dark\u2019 (in terms of lighting, not content) movies don\u2019t know how good that was, or how much it added to the experience. Now, when you see a movie of a dark sky, you see these grainy digital bands of gray that are ugly, distracting and of course, not actually dark.. Presumably, the contrast issue will go away once OLED\u2019s are widely available, but that\u2019s not to say they will re-enode the movies to take advantage of it, good quality dark/light representations in moving images are probably forever a thing of the past\u2026 ",

            "answer_text": "I\u2019d say typing on a phone. 10 years ago, a Blackberry was the business standard and it had an actual keyboard with keys to press. Over time, the need for a larger screen size made this impractical. if you didn\u2019t have a smartphone, the numerical keypad had several letters for each button. So if \u201c1\u201d was also \u201cabc\u201d you pressed it 3 times to get a \u201cc\u201d. in both cases you could type without looking too much at the keyboard. With on screen virtual keyboards, even (especially?) with autocorrect, that\u2019s a quick route to gobbledegook. ",

These are products that they keep redesigning, since everything must be redesigned every year to make it seem like something new that we need. And we have lost the ground in terms of both aesthetics and ergonomics. The only advancement of keyboards since I started using them in 1984 has been reliable wireless. Otherwise it\u2019s either the same or worse. ",
