            "answer_text": "In education adoption of new methods, however beneficial, take a very long time. For example, with the development of writing it became possible for knowledge to be recorded and passed on more accurately to people for future generations. You would have thought that with this invention, it would be adopted quickly in education. Not really! Oral tradition remained predominant for much of the population for centuries, millennia and even today in many parts of the world. We see the same latency in adoption of technology and new methods of learning. Education needs serious reform because we are following century old traditions. So serious adoption and revision is long overdue. Many entrepreneurs are applying these methods to make an impact. The good news is that we do not have to \u201cinvent\u201d these new methods. Keep your antenna up and adopt new and emerging practices from around the globe. ",

            "answer_text": "Thanks for A2A. Affirmatively. However, one needs to move up the value chain as it is already over crowded at the bottom. Upskilling/reskilling, coaching & test preparation segments are the most promising ones provided the revenue model is right. The overall success/ future prospects depends on a wide range of factors including the right blend of content, collaboration from the academia, ecosytem of knowledge seekers and providers, validation from the consumers and the industry, delivery mechanism, integration of on-line & off-line channels and value for money etc. ",
