None of which is technology that was created by Apple. The iPhone is well blended design of other technologies. It is not unique. Since it is not unique it can not be the most significant anything in the last 20 years. ",

But having access to the sum of all human knowledge in one\u2019s pocket is almost immeasurably powerful. And it\u2019s really just getting going. That little handheld device will synergize with 5G and Starlink\u2122 which will enable people almost anywhere on the planet to connect to the Internet using a small solar cell and an antenna.
