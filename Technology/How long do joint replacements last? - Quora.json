            "answer_text": "That depends on a lot of different factors including the particular joint being replaced, the quality of the hardware, the quality of the physical therapy afterwards, and even how well the new joint commingles with other body tissues. Basically, there are many different factors that can affect the outcome and how long the joints will last. Unfortunately, in the past many companies especially those who make hip replacements, have manufactured defective products that had to be removed and replaced. I'm fairly certain they have figured out why so many hip replacements failed, because it was specifically due to the wrong materials being used to construct the ball versus the socket. I have known people to do very well with dual knee replacements. My next door neighbor 20 years ago had an extremely positive result from Dual knee replacements. Without knowing the specific joint you are referring to, this is the best I can do at this point. ",

            "answer_text": "Hi Barbara. Go with Charlyne\u2019s answer. She works with post-ops. 15\u201320 years is about right. And it does depend on a number of factors. Barbara, you\u2019re an intelligent person. You have a post-grad degree in Education,. You claim to be a critical thinker. You should know by bow in Healthcare most everything \u201cdepends\u201d. It depends on the joint being replaced \u2014 is it weight-bearing? The weight and/or lifestyle of the individual. \u2014 Is this person\u2019s body going to put significant stress on the hardware? Or is this person going to run mountain trails? This will shorten the life of the joint. Implant infections can occur years after the procedure. a late infection or one that has been present for a significant amount of time usually requires a staged surgery with stage 1 being removal of the implant. A partial knee is generally replaced after 10 years. It may also depend on the device itself although I doubt it. I think Zimmer, DePuy, Smith & Nephew, Stryker and Wright are all about the same. ",
