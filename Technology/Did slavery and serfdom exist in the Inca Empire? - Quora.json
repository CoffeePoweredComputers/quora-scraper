            "answer_text": "There was mandatory public service for all citizens called the Mit\u2019a. So in that sense, no, there wasn\u2019t slavery and serfdom, as that would mean a certain group of people had to do all the work while another group did nothing and enjoyed all the benefits. In this case with the Inca Empire, and with other groups such as the Mapuche and Quechua, the whole community divided the work among each other to perform community driven projects such as building roads. This was one of the reasons why the Mapuche people fought the Spanish colonials with such zeal for almost 4 centuries. The Spaniards\u2019 way of enslaving the natives was abhorrent to them, who were used to the egalitarian Mit\u2019a system. ",
