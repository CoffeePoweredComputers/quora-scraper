            "answer_text": "At a purely theoretical level, the cryptocurrencies are based on a system which is robust even when at most less than half its actors are malicious. This would in theory be interesting because it allows anonymous transactions and absence of central authority. However, this depends on actually having completely anonymous entry and exit points to the network. This was relatively easy in the beginning but is more and more likely to be regulated at some point. So, to be clear, just because the bitcoin network can function without knowing anything about its members doesn\u2019t mean the members have to remain anonymous. The bitcoin network would work very well even if all wallets and transactions could be traced back to individuals. Which is what will happen at some point if the value of transactions becomes significant and regulation is enacted by law. Now some things that cryptocurrencies do not solve: Faster transactions: it can be argued that an international money order takes a few days and a bitcoin transaction can be done in 60min, but most everyday transactions (VISA, for example) are near instantaneous. Bitcoin takes at best 10min, if a single confirmation is required (not recommended). In practices, this depends on fees that you are willing to pay.Cheaper transactions: theoretically, when blocks were almost empty and transactions were few, miners would even mine for free. Right now the blocks are full and if you want a transaction to be verified quickly you need to spend on average $30+. This is not a trivial overhead. Sure, if you are a drug lord sending $1M to the other end of the planet this is not important. But it sure means that it doesn\u2019t make sense to pay your latte with bitcoin.And a few problems: No government control: centralized banking supervision is a feature, not a problem. Of course the central banks can and do make mistakes. But interest rates fluctuate by fractions of one percent a few times per year and are meant to do so in a way that helps the economy. Bitcoin, which is the most mature currency, fluctuates by >10% in a day. You can go visit a house to buy and the price will have changed between the time you enter and the time you leave. This is not acceptable for currency! It always sounds nice to blame the government for inflation and all monetary crises, but bitcoin is not free from outside influence. Just because you don\u2019t know who manipulates bitcoin prices doesn\u2019t mean it doesn\u2019t happen.Excessive use of energy: by design the use of energy/hashrate (the two are interchangeable within a given technological framework) is competitive. You make money when you are faster and more efficient than your peers, because then you make a bigger part of the bitcoin pie, which is the block reward. The use of energy is already completely unsustainable and is not only bad for the environment, without producing any other useful work, but will simply not scale to the demands of a real economy. Currently, any reasonable bank spends less money/energy to process a transaction than the bitcoin network.Pyramid structure: by design the bitcoin protocol gave many more bitcoins to the first miners than today. The differences are huge: those who mined with a CPU in 2010 made a lot more than those who mine with ultra specialized equipment and cheap power today. This has only been sustained by the rise in bitcoin prices which maintained the profitability of mining as the absolute return (in bitcoins) diminished drastically.Difficulty running a local node: the central assumption is that bitcoin is decentralized because anyone can run a bitcoin node. This is a bit like file sharing. You keep on your PC a copy of transactions and exchange information with other nodes to confirm these transactions. Note, I\u2019m not talking about the miners, but about the nodes who verify miner\u2019s work. This used to be relatively easy but the demands have scaled a lot. Full nodes need to exchange a lot of data, need to store approx 180GB and do use some CPU power. Still perfectly doable if you network is fast, but what happens when/if all people start using bitcoin? Remember, transactions are only secure if many people have copies, so instead of one big bank you know need many individuals keeping copies of the blockchain. But who is willing to run a 200GB node now? How many of your friends who actually own bitcoin do run their own nodes? And how many would run a node if that meant 10GB traffic per day and 1TB storage? 10TB storage? So, when you get to the point where running a full node requires significant amounts of compute resources, it no longer is completely decentralized. And you will have to trust these entities (the bitcoin nodes) which are no longer as numerous as before, with your money. So, as time progresses, the network becomes more centralized and less robust.Now, we can argue that some new cryptocurrency X will solve some or all of these shortcomings. For example, some require less energy, others have faster confirmation times, bigger blocks (allowing more transactions per time) and other only run on GPUs, not specialized hardware (meaning that the network is more likely to include casual miners, not just very big mining operations). Yet the proliferation of cryptocurrencies is a problem in itself. The launch of every new coin is a small pyramid scheme in itself, with the owner/maker and a bunch of friends making $$$ in the process while mining the first blocks. It also threatens the stability of the system, since currency is supposed to be robust and your newly bought bitcoin is expected to maintain some of its value instead of being constantly threatened by new altcoins. Finally, by design all these algorithms are resistant to attack when the hash rate is sufficiently big. So, one would need a couple of billions to destabilize the bitcoin network. This is a lot of money but still is short change for the biggest economies. So, yes, the US government could afford to brute force take over bitcoin relatively easily. No hacking required. Just poison the blockchain with false transaction that have been forced on the network. The situation is of course much much more easier for the minor coins. The hashrate of some of these can be matched possibly even by individuals. For example, if coin X is based on a network of 10000 GPUs, I could take it over with 10000 GPUs (a $5M purchase). In conclusion, the only thing that cryptocurrencies allow are trustless transactions in a sufficiently big and varied network. This does not mean that transactions have to be anonymous. Almost anything else that people attribute to cryptocurrencies is based on assumptions that are not necessarily true and will not necessarily remain true. ",

            "answer_text": "Cryptocurrencies bypass banks and serve as alternatives to nation-based currencies or precious metals/gems/collectibles. They exist independently of any external authority; their valuation is based on the rarity of their \u201ccoin\u201d. They have no inherent value; their current exchange rate relative to other currencies or to physical goods is defined by the popular convention of their owners from moment-to-moment. Thus their valuation can be volatile. Cryptocurrencies seem to be most popular among three camps: 1) people living in countries with badly managed currencies, often suffering from hyperinflation, 2) criminals who want to hide transactions and monies from oversight by police and governmental regulators, and 3) philosophical anarchists or extremist libertarians who oppose taxation and being \u201ctold what to do\u201d by others.
