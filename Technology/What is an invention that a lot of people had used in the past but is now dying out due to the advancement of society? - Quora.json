            "answer_text": "There is a LOT of low hanging fruit that could answer this question. Think horse collars, buggy whips, coal home heaters, and just about any implement over 50 years old. However, I will respond with something more recent. Personal computers. I am talking about those bulky desktops we all lusted after in the 80s and 90s. Sure, they are still around, but not in the kind of numbers they were when I was a younger man. They have been pretty much supplanted by smartphones and tablets. And, instead of having heavily bloated programs that did multi-functions, we have readily available \u201capps\u201d for just about everything. And instead of having to buy each program, usually a budget-buster, most very useful apps are free or at least give you the choice of in-app purchases. I just wish they came about before my eyesight began to fail, and my fingers became too fat to press buttons\u2026LOL\u2026..Cheers!!! ",

            "answer_text": "All portable music playing devices like ipods and cd players. Even stuff like DVDs are slowly dying out. How often do you use the DVD player on your laptop. Physical currency is another thing that will most likely slowly die out. Fax machines probably have already died out. Capturing photos on film rolls has almost died out. There are so many things you observe watching slightly old movies and think nobody uses those anymore. ",
