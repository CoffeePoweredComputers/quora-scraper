            "answer_text": "What is the point of SIM cards if you can't just pull them out and move them to new phones? That is exactly the point of them. It's the sim card or at least the stored association of details (imsi) on that sim card with your identity on the network that is important. When someone dials your number, that is translated to your imsi and its the imsi that is looked up on the network. It's generally a bit more flexible. If your phone breaks you just need to swap the sim to another phone. No need to involve your network operator. If it was linked directly to the phone identity (imei) then you'd have a delay as you would have to notify the operator, then you tell them the imei so they could associate it with your account and a percentage would suffer the errors associated with that procedure. The sim is also provided cheaply and easily by the network so they have control of the security aspects of the data stored on it required to securely encode your traffic to the network. To retain that control with the phone directly you would need to buy all your phones from that network and every time you switched networks you would need a new phone. All in all a bit less flexible and less consumer choice. Right now to port your number all you need is a new sim and a code to port the dialed number between networks. I'm sure it's not beyond the wit of the engineers to design something that wouldn't need a sim but the current systems since 2g at least have been designed this way. ",

            "answer_text": "Since when? You're wrong, SIM cards can be taken in and out whenever,mysim has been in 4 different phones during its life, might go in moreid my phone breaks or stops working, but whoever told you that you cant removes SIM and put t in a new phone is full of shit. Obvioysly the new phone needs to support the same network otherwise it's not gonna work but that doesn't stop it being taken out or put in another device or have the unsupported device unlocked\u2026 phone get smarter every single year, people not so much ",
