            "answer_text": "Because they reached the maximum practical speed already in the 1960s. There is a nasty phenomenon lurking at the speeds of 540 knots (1000 km/h) and higher, and it is called the Sound barrier. In a nutshell, the sound barrier is a state where air is so dense that the drag it causes leaps up exponentially, and exceeding it requires an awful lot of energy and special aerodynamics.  1) aeroplane moving at subsonic speed. Sound waves (denser and less denser phases of air) get to escape. No problems. 2) aeroplane moving at the speed of sound. The sound waves no longer get to escape, but form a dense \u2018wall\u2019 of air. Energy consumption increases dramatically. 3) aeroplane moving at supersonic speed. The drag is immense, and so is energy consumption. And noise. Certainly it is possible to exceed the sound barrier - it was done already in 1947. But doing so requires special aerodynamics, awful amounts of energy and a very uneconomical aircraft shape. Supersonic transport had its time, it was, it went and it is over. And it is not coming back. Airlines are commercial ventures. Airlines are not driven by technology. They are driven by revenue. Technology does not bring revenue. Volumes bring revenue. And profit is which keeps the airlines in business. And profit can be easily calculated. It is the income minus costs. The lower your costs to operate, the greater your profit. To fly supersonic, you need a horribly uneconomic aeroplane - one with delta wings (requiring long runways), powerful engines (read: thirsty engines) and narrow fuselage (read: low passenger capacity). Which means the upkeep and operation costs per passenger are horrible. As is the fuel bill. Which means the ticket prices are going to be skyhigh - literally. If you are willing to pay 12,000 \u20ac for Atlantic crossing, your choice. I am not. Only militaries can afford such uneconomical flight. They do not have to produce revenue. The reason is simple, and it is physics. It is called drag. To fly faster, you have to overcome drag. The bad thing is that drag increases quadratically with speed. To fly two times faster, you need four times more power. (Either drag increases doubly with speed, or to fly two times faster, you need sixteen times more power) With drag, the need of power increases in cube relation - eightfold. And to exceed the sound barrier, the power needed can easily be tenfold. The good old square-cube law. The airliners fly at the so-called \u201csweet spot\u201d speed. They fly at the speed which is fast enough to be fast, but where the drag (and hence the fuel consumption) does not impair the revenue. The speed on which they fly is the optimum between performance and revenue. This speed was attained already in the 1960s. Of course aircraft could be made to fly faster. Then they would operate at a loss. The fastest conventional airliner was the Convair 990 Coronado, which could attain 540 knots (1000 km/h) speed. The bad thing was it had four engines, it was a fuel hog, and it had a narrow fuselage - to attain that speed. It was awfully expensive to operate, had bad passenger capacity, and provided no other assets than 20\u201330 knots faster speed than its rivals. Not enough to make difference, but too much to be profitable. Airliners today emphasize capacity, not speed. To get as many passengers to the destination with as little fuel consumption as possible and on as short runways as possible. Take-off may consume some 15% of all fuel consumed during the flight, and supersonic aircraft with their delta wings are extremely bad take-offers and landers. As grand a technological marvel as the Concorde was - a true beauty! - it was doomed to be an evolutionary dead end. It was uneconomical to operate, had too small a passenger capacity and was extremely maintenance intensive. Economy - not technology - spelled its doom. ",

            "answer_text": "Most commercial aircraft are within touching distance of the speed of sound. But to cross that barrier is expensive. It takes an airplane significantly different than any airliner flying today. Think Concorde; a delta wing , powered by four very powerful afterburning Rolls Royce Olympus engines, capable of slightly more than twice the speed of sound. The first commercial flight of the Concorde was in 1976 and the last in 2003 (this included being grounded for a period after a post take-off accident in Paris in 2000). The development of a commercial transport/airliner able to fly faster than the speed of sound isn\u2019t an undertaking for the faint of heart or those without deep pockets (investments) and most major aircraft manufacturers have at least considered it. But just faster than the speed of sound isn\u2019t enough. Flying at 1.2 mach (speed of sound) wouldn\u2019t cut the trans-Atlantic travel time by much. Like the Concorde, something more on the order of Mach 1.6 or 2.0 would. Which brings us to a second threshold. Supersonic flight will likely be very expensive to operate and thus expensive for the passengers as well. Flight on the Concorde, for example, was very expensive. Designed to carry between 92 and 128 passengers, the round trip LHR/NYC/LHR ticket price I just found was a bit over \u00a38,000 in 2003. Not many people can afford that. Which brings us to the third threshold. Unless rules/laws are changed, the intensity of the sonic boom that follows all supersonic aircraft can be detrimental to the earth\u2019s ecology. As a result, supersonic flight is prohibited or highly regulated over land. The Concorde was required to fly subsonic over continental Europe and the US. That means most supersonic flights would have to be over the ocean. Supersonic business aircraft are being developed today that are trying to minimize the boom\u2019s intensity and footprint. Only time will tell how successful they will be. A fourth threshold is range. The Concorde was pretty much limited to the distance between Paris and New York (or the east coast of the US) without much reserve. The longer distances across the Pacific pretty much ensures that a Supersonic transpacific aircraft will have to have a much longer range than Concorde. An easy off-the-cuff answer to a limited range concern might be to simply say, \u201cAdd more fuel.\u201d And there starts your engineering conundrum. Hold on tight\u2026 Given that the airframe is designed to handle it, more fuel means more weight, which for a given aircraft configuration means slower airspeed or less passengers/luggage. OK, then simply add more power too. Yeah, except the square/cube law (simply stated: to double the speed you need four times the power) means another engineering challenge; even much more powerful engines must be designed. Now we come to yet another engineering challenge, more power typically means more fuel consumption, which means a need for more fuel (weight), which means more power needed\u2026 Want to keep the same number of passengers and add fuel? A larger airframe will be needed, which means more weight and more drag, which means more power, which means more fuel for a given range, and so forth. See where this isn\u2019t an easy problem to resolve? If it was there\u2019d be supersonic airliners in service today I was lucky enough to fly Concorde Paris to New York. The cabin is long and narrow, passengers sitting two by two across a narrow aisle. From the way the passengers were dressed you\u2019d have no doubt that you\u2019re among the upper class (except me, of course). Taxi onto the runway, full power, reheat (afterburner) lighted, and the noise was impressive even inside the aircraft (outside it was deafening ). After a reasonable long take-off roll (the aircraft was at gross weight, after all), climb was initiated, then reheat extinguished as we climbed toward France\u2019s west coast. Crossing the coastline in a climb, reheat was reestablished and we accelerated toward Mach 1, the speed of sound. On the right front cabin bulkhead was the large Mach Meter displaying the aircraft speed relative to the speed of sound. For anyone that wonders what the transition to supersonic flight is like, let me put it this way. If you\u2019re prepared for some sort of physical manifestation indicating the transition to supersonic, you\u2019d be disappointed. The ONLY indication that I had that we were supersonic was the Mach Meter indication changing from .9 to 1.0. That\u2019s it, that\u2019s all there was! Soon we settled in at cruise at about 60,000 feet at slightly over Mach 2 and the reheat was again extinguished. There we are, two times the speed of sound at over 1,534 mph! Oh, and I was just American enough to ask to have my picture taken beside the Mach Meter! I asked if it were possible to go onto the flight deck and pretty soon was allowed to spend about 30 minutes talking to the pilot and copilot. The flight engineer sits in front of his very complicated engineering panel facing the starboard side of the aircraft and, while the pilots relax, he was continually calculating and moving fuel to keep the aircraft\u2019s center of gravity, really center of lift within required limits. Remember earlier I mentioned that we were cruising at over 1,500 mph? Well, the atmospheric density at that altitude has decreased such that the airspeed indicator was actually showing something like 350 knots or about 400 mph. Toward the end of the flight one of the flight attendants handed me a certificate signed by the entire crew indicating that I had flown in Concorde faster than the speed of sound. An older woman sitting across the aisle from me turned and asked what the certificate was for. When I explained, she said, \u201cI fly this every week and I didn\u2019t know that!\u201d Wow! ",
