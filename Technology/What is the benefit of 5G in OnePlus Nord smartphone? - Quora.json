The only benefit is that when you go out to sell it (or trade in) 2\u20133 years later, it will retain more value. A 4G phone may not retain the same value. ",

It doesn't make any sense to buy any 5G compatible phone right now because we don't know the exact time when we get the complete 5G coverage.
