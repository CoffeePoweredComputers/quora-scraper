            "answer_text": "Generally laser printers provide the most cost effective print toner. Ink is usually used only in inkjet printers and is usually more costly per page than laser prints. Some inkjet printers are capable of using generic ink cartridges, however as time goes on, such printers are either programmed to reject third party ink. There is a new trend which printers use an external ink reservoirs or tank. Dye/sub printing is the most resistant to fading, however is the most expensive. ",

            "answer_text": "You can buy inkjet ink at many places on the net. I have bought pint bottles in the past. It works out to just a few cents per cartridge refill. You can get hypodermic syringes and needles legally at farm and ranch stores and veterinary supply places, or just ask your doctor for a spare at your next appointment. They last forever. Just research on Youtube where on your cartridge to drill a tiny hole for the needle. You can refill your own cartridges for a TINY fraction of what new cartridge costs, even at Walmart. Just refill the cartridge and gently wipe clean the print head with warm water and a soft sponge. Easy peazy. ",
