            "answer_text": " I once took a girl to Chuck E Cheese for a date. I was suggested this option by a successful, rich entrepreneur named Tucker Max on a podcast. The idea was that this date would be a breathe of fresh air from the standard, boring dinner dates and movie dates people go on. It would be like you\u2019re kids again and the girl would appreciate it because you\u2019re having fun and poking fun at the idea that you\u2019re adults but you can still have fun as a child. It made a lot of sense. I saw famous celebrities like Holly Hohn (the MMA fighter) going on an excursion with her buddies to a Dave and Buster\u2019s. Same type of deal. It looked pretty bad ass for these super successful people to just have fun like normal people in there. But the result wasn\u2019t as clean as expected. She was an immigrant and she didn\u2019t have a green card yet. Her upbringing and culture was not American. I forgot to take this into account as I should have. And this mattered because she grew up in a completely different culture and poorer subtext. Although the date went decently, she kept mentioning how \u201cthis was for kids.\u201d She didn\u2019t understand it. She was, if anything, embarrassed and confused as to why we were there with a bunch of other kids. Humans happen to have different cultures and different ways of living due to many factors including the financial and geographic location they were brought up in. Because of that, they interpret and see the world differently. I haven\u2019t given up on the idea of a fun Chuck E Cheese date but I realized it\u2019s more socially intelligent to taken into account cultural context first. Tucker Max is a rich, white, upper class individual and he runs in circles with equally successful people with similar demographics. Because of the American upbringing of the girls he meets, their success, and the cultural context, it works really well. It also selects for girls who can take life seriously and don\u2019t have to have serious, posh dates all the time. ",

            "answer_text": "Culture as an influence of behaviour takes the \u201cnurture\" side of the argument about influences of behaviour. culture looks at the totality of any given society's belief system, laws, mores, practices, language and attitudinal variables which makes a people unique from others. As you know, it is transmitted from one generation to the other. What happened when you are groomed in the ways of a particular culture? You start acting and behaving in ways that are seen as appropriate to such a culture. Your dress sense, grooming, language, belief system and attitude become molded to fit into that society which makes you become accepted by them. Hence, culture plays a big role in determining how an individual behaves in any given environment. Take for example, in some places, baring the breasts is seen as normal, while in some places it is forbidden. Some places allow males and females to mingle freely in public places: others do not. This has a tremendous impact on behaviour, and is evident when these persons go to a place that has a different culture comparsd to theirs. They encounter what is known as \u201cculture shock\", and it is most evident from their reactions and behaviours to certain unique stimuli which they come in contact with in a new place. So yes, culture plays a big role in influencing behavior. ",
