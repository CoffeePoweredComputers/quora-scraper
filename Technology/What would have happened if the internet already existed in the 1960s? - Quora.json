            "answer_text": "I was fortunate to have become involved with Internet services early in the advent of its current form. I worked for a company in Zimbabwe that was the first Internet company in Africa; Data Control & Systems - Wikipedia. Because of this I learned a great deal about it and it's history from Clint Simm who, with his wife, unfortunately is no longer with us due to a drunk driver's carelessness. Clint taught me an immense amount about the Internet and it's design and history. Much of the early history of the Internet is not available online and authoritative sources have largely fallen into disuse due to Wikipedia. The Internet began in 1947 under DARPAnet which was an American defence forces network. By 1960 it had evolved into something almost entirely used by military use only but the concept had already leaked into civil use by 1957. Although the I was on its infancy it had proven a better communications network than any other system in humanity's history. DARPA - Wikipedia was the founder of arpanet. So, you see that the Internet was indeed already around in the 60\u2019s. The entire concept of a global network of communication was to circumvent catastrophic communication failure in the theatre of war and thus lead to the foundation of the Internet. The world wide Web (www) was a system developed for storing easily accessible documents for educational institutions that was transmitted by the Internet. The heterogeneous networks had different protocols that required translation to each other in order for separated networks be able to communicate with each other. Thus lead to the development of IPX/SPX, NETBios and TCP/IP protocols, all of which are documented under RFC (request for comment) whitepapers. Whilst NETBios was brilliant and proprietary, worked well with Microsoft Windows; it was a connection orientated protocol which kept the active line live 100% if the time. This would lead to data bandwidth saturation and because of this issue, a connectionless protocol is better suited by sending switched data packets at about 86 bytes per transmission. Data transmission rates are measured in baud. So a 9600 baud rate was pretty good in 1994 and US Robotics made fantastic modems that eventually culminated in their 56kbps baud modems prior to ISDN introduction then followed by leased line and then broadband spectrum transmission. X25 pad was also pretty good but has mostly fallen out of use. Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol or TCP/IP for short, was the ultimate result of network communication development but it has limitations. This is the connectionless protocol that is used between computers today. As bandwidth increases a new protocol may need to be developed for larger packet sizes and asynchronous data transfer but this is in development phases now. ",

It just allows to do it in a different way. The Gutenberg press was first used to print a bible, but have no doubt tha somebody made money with it printing pornography, conspiracy theories, text books or crazy ideas. Same thing with the telephone, television, fax machines, etc. After a while, the new technology is accepted and incorporated into our daily life. So, the real question is what would have happened if it had been invented 50 years earlier. Well nothing dramatic really. Different stories, different approaches maybe, but the same old good human nature. ",

I\u2019d only just spoken to a guy at the library today who was talking about a program (I can\u2019t remember what, now) for the internet that Microsoft paid a billion dollars for, and then it was found not to work. This guy had written an upgrade of that program, and was looking for info on how to get a copyright. He said it had taken him 15 months. He looked like William Hartnell from Doctor Who, so he probably did it. ",
