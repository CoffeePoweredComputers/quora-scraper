            "answer_text": "Firstly, a lot can happen in 10 years. If we look at what has happened in the last 10 years with respect to drones, we can already see the leaps and bounds that the technology has made in such a short period. For example, 10 years ago is when DJI was founded, now the biggest commercial drone company in the world. Fixed wing and multi-rotor vehicles have come along way with the advancements in batteries, flight computers, autonomous control and computer vision. These vehicles are already capable of doing a lot of the work themselves with minimal pilot instruction. So, where will the drone industry be in 2026. Enthusiasts will still be tinkering away in their garages making their own crazy and innovative designs for fun. A lot of the hobby drones will probably be 3D printed and the parts purchased and installed by the pilot. The price point for all the vehicles would have dropped so they will become more common toys for teenagers and adults alike.  One of the biggest factors holding back drones' true potential (not including rules and regulations) is power consumption. Multiple teams around the globe are working on how to increase power density in batteries to improve flight time, reduce power consumption of the motors and flight computer. These research teams will drive the variety of applications that drones can be used for in the next decade. Commercially drones will be deployed for work from inspection, 3D mapping, surveying (for example Drone Maps Gallery.), package delivery (Amazon Prime Air), they will most likely by considered a social norm at that point.   ^^ 3D map by DroneDeploy Beyond line of sight of operation will be permitted provide the vehicles have the necessary technology to support operations in this manner. Most likely a continuous communications like will be maintained with the vehicle through either the LTE or 5G networks (eta 2020) so that flight corrections and diversions can be performed mid-flight, ensuring real-time responses are achieved.   ^^ Amazon's delivery drone Also, with the use of faster networks video/VR live streaming will become standard enabling users to share their experiences of beautiful views or extreme sports in high definition through the Facebook or Youtube (to name a few) for all of their friends and family to experience with them.  With the extended flight capabilities, package delivery will be a viable option for warehouse-to-home deliveries and well as shipping of emergency supplies to disaster regions. There has been some ideas thrown around about doing intercontinental freight flights with autonomous vehicles to reduce full consumption and increase productivity.  Drones will most likely be tools for the emergency services such as coast guard, police, search and rescue and fire departments for first response and situational assessment.   ^^ Drones can be used to find lost/injured hikers NASA and Airmap is currently working on an air traffic management system that will prevent collisions and ensure the necessary safety margins are maintained around airports. NASA is focusing on a beacon system that enables each vehicle to broadcast their own flight data, similar to standard air traffic control, for monitoring purposes NASA puts nationwide traffic control system for drones to the test. Airmap is employing a software based approach where the GPS location of the drone is assessed against their maps in real-time (via your phone) to prevent you from taking-off or flying in controlled airspace. They have currently joined forces with numerous drone manufacturers to have the technology integrated prior to distribution to the users. AirMap Is A Sky Atlas For Drone Users  ^^ San Francsico flight map from Airmap Computer vision is also going to be employed as standard on all commercial vehicles. DJI  has launched their Phantom 4 which comes with computer vision to identify the user and to avoid collision with obstacles in front of the vehicle. Skydio are specializing in collision avoidance using spherical cameras so that they can see any hazards that are approaching the vehicle from any side. The employment of computer vision will revolutionize drones, especially when they are capable of operations in low light and at night. Skydio Makes Drones Smart So Pilots Can Be Dumb With $3M From Andreessen For the advancements in computer vision, processors and cameras will need to be upgraded to respond faster and more efficiently when in a variety of environments. Spherical cameras will become popular amongst drone users for collision avoidance systems and VR capture, something that Queen B Robotics is currently specializing in.  The future will contain drones in multiple aspects of our lives, you may not see them walking dogs (Back to the Future II), but they will change our lives for the better! ",

            "answer_text": "Hi there! Although drone technology is still at its infancy stage, it is considered the future reality. With AI algorithms improving in shocking leaps and bounds, so will drone technology. A few years back, aside from top military use, drones were seen as recreational equipment. Now, it is considered the future of almost every business, especially those that deal with delivery and shipping. Businesses and countries are investing heavily in drone technology to further push its development. In the years to come, people will also have more use for drones with the constant test flights with the goals of continuously discovering what other aspects will a drone be useful to aside from delivery and surveillance. Drone technology is also being geared for agricultural use such as monitoring crops and livestock. Another is for emergency response. International humanitarian and rescue groups are now using unmanned aerial vehicles equipped with thermal devices to track injured individuals that are in need of rescuing during situations where it would be difficult for the human eyes to search alone. Drone technology has also provided huge help when it comes to wildlife preservation. Several national park organizations throughout Africa were able to save money in manpower and cover larger territories when patroling and warding off poachers. You can see some examples of how they're being used especially in delivery businesses), along with the kind of work that goes into maintaining them, in this article from Attention Trust. I linked it earlier but I only came across it recently, so it's worth a second link! ",
