            "answer_text": "I can imagine that it will happen. Smartphones have been already replaced smaller point and shoot cameras because the phones are: cheaper, smaller and better. I am a photographer but I love to use my phone because I can get the same result and for personal purpose I don't really need a DSLR. You can even print that images, they are good enough. You can post immediately and you don't have to transfer the pictures between camera and pc to be able to do so. What I miss: flash \u2014 I use diffusers and flashes very often. If I want to use them, I have to switch to my Fuji. Lenses \u2014 for a photographer the most important parts of the equipment are the lenses. Even if you are on vacation and you want to shoot your family. Your possibilities are limited with a smartphone again. Manual dials \u2014 it can be frustrating to take photos without dials. I love dials, smart placed dials are just so important on a camera. Etc. There are a lot of aspects why is it important to have a good camera. For personal use: a smartphone can be more than enough. I don't carry with me my camera if I am on holiday. But if I want to make some special or serious images, I switch immediately. For payed shooting: I have heard that some photographers made weddings with iPhone. I would not do that and I don't really believe that it is really possible. If you are payed to take pictures photography isn't just a nice hobby and so funny anymore. You have to be able to make perfect pictures in any time and under any circumstances, you have to be ensured that you have backup not only from your camera but from your lenses and batteries and sd cards, etc. (I know some photographers who have even a back up car!!!) A smartphone is a Swiss army knife. It is nice to have such a thing but you never see a butcher cutting 200 kg of meat with a Swiss army knife just because it is small and as sharp as a pro knife. Because he has to work for years with one knife and a swisss army knife remains to be a toy and a smartphone remains to be only a smartphone. So: if you mean point and shoot cameras, yes, nobody want to have a point and shoot if you can have a smartphone. If you mean a pro level camera to work with, no, never. Only if phase one decides to add phone calling functionality into his medium format cameras. :) ",

            "answer_text": "Turn your phone over and look carefully at the lens. There is a bit of non-optical plastic (or very touchable - and therefore dirty - optical glass) over the lens of almost all current mobile phone cameras that degrades image quality and makes them useful only for web/social media. That is not the biggest concern but it puts into perspective what phone manufacturer's intent is; make a camera phone with big headline numbers (usually resolution) but hobble it in all sorts of ways so the phone unit remains thin, robust and cheap, all to the detriment of image quality. Other issues include lack of dynamic range, poor focusing, over processing in-camera, poor noise control, no ability for creative optical effects, poor colour fidelity and awful white balance control, lack of manual control, lack of ergonomics ... I could go on, but there's only so far a 20 dollar camera phone element (thats about how much the camera unit costs in most current phones!) can do against even an entry level $400 DSLR. ",
