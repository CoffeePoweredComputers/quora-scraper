            "answer_text": "You should study business. We return to a common theme here on Quora. What exactly is an entrepreneur? Arguably, the only answer is a person that successfully comes up with an idea, brings it to the real world, causes enough financial success with it that it actually provides a lifestyle for one or more people. The person faces challenges along the way. Deals with them. In order that the idea is more than a short term anomaly. I\u2019d say the idea has to survive more than two economic cycles, crashes or recession events. It is not a real economic machine if it can\u2019t do that. What then is the originator of the idea? For a while, an entrepreneur. Once, the risk is minimized, a business owner. Entrepreneur is not a job description. Entrepreneur is often thrown around for ego rather than reality. I know, That is a pretty harsh statement. Well, like in physics, two objects cannot occupy the same location, not everyone in business can be described as above. If the stat is true, and I believe it is, less than 5% of startups survive. Then few are entrepreneurs. That title is reserved for a rare few. The unicorns. (No I don\u2019t agree you don\u2019t have to sell it for $1billion to be a Unicorn.) A truly rare breed are serial entrepreneurs. So called, they found, grow, handle risks, then sell to an Angel Buyer/investor, multiple times. Angel Buyers, like Angel Investors, pay a lump sum, or close to it, for a large stake or the entire enterprise. There is enough money that you can actually retire or choose to start another business while enjoying a full lifestyle. Coming full circle to your question. What do you think the answer is? I\u2019ll argue that the entrepreneur is not successful unless they become a business owner. During the entrepreneur phase, which is not the end goal, only a condition one experiences for a short time, you do a LOT yourself. That is because your early stage businesses resources are not unlimited. You, and sometimes a small team, are probably the only one who cares about the ultimate outcome. You do whatever it takes to successfully move to the real deal: a business owner who ultimately sells it for a decent ROI. Remembering that all cash sales of businesses are also anomaly\u2019s. ",

            "answer_text": "For success, an entrepreneur must have a solid sense of reality to sift out technologically possible and economically viable ideas from fantasies. It\u2019s natural science (STEM) that study the reality given us thru our senses. STEM teaches critical thinking (it\u2019s a tautology: if you think v. dreaming or following B.S. by a salesrep, you doubt the info you get till reconciliation with your knowledge or thru advancing it). But it\u2019s hard to study science as a tool or a reference book, without curiosity as the main motive. ",
