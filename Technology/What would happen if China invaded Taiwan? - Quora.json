            "answer_text": "Carnage, economic recession and a high price ot be paid. If the PRC would ever decide to take Taiwan by force the PLA will never have the benefit of surprise. By the time it attacks Taiwan will be well prepared. Why? Logistics. In order to invade Taiwan China has first to \u201csoften it up\u201d by missile and bombing operations. Despite several missile batteries being already deployed, these are nowhere near enough for the job. This would require the PLA\u00b4s Missile Force to mobilize hundred of mobile launchers and thousands of rockets from their peacetime storage. Similarly, artillery divisions would have to mobilize around Kinmen.  However to invade Taiwan proper China must put troops on the ground: many of them. The ROC can count on about 300K regular troops, 1,5 rapid recall reserves and (fighting and support reserves) for a total force of over 3 million. For any invading force to be able to make a dent the PLA must \u201cship\u201d over at the very least a million troops. However, even if we half that number, the logistics to ship 500K soldiers, their equipment and supplies over the Taiwan strait requires boats. Lots of them. This would require all Chinese shipyards to work 24/7 for a couple of months in order to convert enough civilian boats for troop transport. Moreover, moving a million soldiers and equipment across China would hardly go unnoticed. At the very, very least the ROC would have one month time to prepare for invasion.  This is enough to transform every Taiwanese possible approach beech (there are only 14, by the way) a booby-trapped hell strait out of a Bosh painting. The second thing to consider is that simply comparing the size and capabilities of the two armies is misleading and ultimately meaningless: the ROC does not have to defeat the PLA, it only has to defend a position. Comparing the two armies only makes sense if the ROC would attempt to take mainland China. Taiwan\u00b4s geography makes it very difficult terrain for an amphibious assault, which is the most difficult type of warfare and specifically one in which the PLA has no experience at all. When The US planned the invasion of Japanese occupied Taiwan it calculated it needed a numerical superiority of at least 5 to 1 in order to be successful, given it already had air superiority. When in the 50s China tried to take Kinmen it failed and lost about 10.000 troops trying. This despite Kinmen being in the PLAs land artillery range and being hopelessly out-numbered and under-equipped. Indeed todays PLA is a completely different beast as in the 50s, yet so is the ROCs military. Taiwan must thus follow the porcupine strategy. No porcupine can defeat a dog, but it takes a very stupid dog to maul a porcupine. Start of hostilities.  As anticipated, the PLA would start by missile bombing operations on Taiwan proper and Penghu. Once it gained air superiority (which is likely but not to be achieved without heavy losses, since Taiwan had one of the best anti-aircraft defenses in the world) also aircraft bombing operations would start. Kinmen, Matsu would be heavily shelled by artillery: Kinmen cannot be left alone if the Xiamen port has to be used for the offensive). The PLA has identified over 1000 high value targets inside Taiwan: too many to target effectively, it will thus have to pick and choose among the currently known targets, and the thousands of decoys Taiwan can set up in a month of preparations. I have seen claims that the PLA can neutralize ROC air defenses, artillery and radar stations in hors or a couple of days; this is the reals oh fantasy. The US needed 48 Days of bombing operations to effectively destroy only a fraction of Iraq\u00b4s positions. Taiwan is in a much better position than Iraq ever was, with far more mobile units protected by an island covered by mountains and thick vegetation, nuclear proof bunkers inside mountains and a underground military tunnel network. There is no way its defenses can be wiped out in days.  Even before the missiles come raining down sleeper cells inside Taiwan are likely to attempt assassination of ROC leaders, sabotage refineries, chemical plants and the electric grid and start. A number of these might succeed but decapitation of the government is unlikely. Even if an attempt is successful the chain of command has war time redundancy. ROC leadership would be immediately be moved to underground bunkers in dispersed locations. ROC sleeper cells will attempt similar operations in China, yet probably to much less effect. As bombing operations starts full-scale war will affect the air-space, cyberspace and electromagnetic waves domains. As stated the ROCAF will be unlikely to predominate, despite causing heavy losses on the PLA air force. However the other domains are a completely different beast. Taiwan has (thanks to US and Japanese cooperation) the most advanced defensive anti jamming RADAR system in the world. At the same time it has world class jamming capabilities. Cyberwarfare against China is likely to be supported by the US, Japan, Australia and South Korea even if these countries have no intention to enter the physical conflict. Stuxnet already gave a preview of the level of sophistication the west can have in cyber warfare. In an all-out cyberwar you can expect black-outs and infrastructure lock-downs all across China, in both civil and military installations. War in the electromagnetic spectrum will be fierce, with both sides attempting to render the other side blind. However Taiwan can benefit from intelligence assistance from several countries. As part of Economic warfare all 20 Million mainland Chinese employed in China by Taiwanese businesses would be immediately declared unemployed and all active and pending payments cancelled. Combined to the blackouts this will immediately make it very clear to PRC citizens that it is not going to be the walk in a park they expected. This phase can take anywhere from three days to a couple of weeks. Once bombing operations are done and Kinmen neutralized the real, amphibious assault can begin.  Invasion. Taiwan is a natural fortress. There are very few approachable beaches. The ones that exists (14) have shallow depth and have been extensively prepared for defense. According to ROC document coastal waters can be prepared with anti-ship mines in about 14 hours, rapid costal defences in about 2 days and complete costal defenses in about two weeks. Recall that Taiwan would have about a month time to prepare. Approach zones would be defended with mines, land based torpedoes and anti-ship missiles, precision artillery, bunkers, anti-tank and anti-amphibious vehicle traps, barbed wire, booby traps, heavy machine gun turrets, tanks, assault helicopters (Apache) and the infamous \u201cwall of fire\u201d. The latter is a network of pipelines, which can cover beaches with flammable liquid in minutes and keep the flames alive for days. Not exactly a nice day on the beach. Several exercises (both computer and military exercises) have simulated an attack force 100K men strong (about the maximum logistically possible size for a first wave) with perfect knowledge about Taiwan\u00b4s defenses (worse case scenario for the ROC). None has been successful at taking any of the beaches in the first wave. The most optimistic timeframe in which the PLA can take and hold one of these beaches (according to PLA writings) is 3 days. Losses are expected to be heavy.   This assuming that the ROC navy and submarines have been magically obliterated on day one. Once the PLA has secured a beach and harbor, it must also secure an airstrip: this is paramount in order to get enough people and equipment across the straight to keep up momentum. Waves of counter attack will face the invading forces. Taiwan\u00b4s peace landscape has been prepared for war. Dams can be used to flood approaching forces, coastal areas have been filled with fish farms, rice pads and other difficult terrain, the natural landscape prepared to channel forces into difficult \u201ckill boxes\u201d. For the PLA moving towards Taipei would be a very difficult journey indeed. Once there, urban warfare would begin. Even here, Taiwanese cities are already prepared for urban warfare: the PLA would have to conquer Taipei building by building. As hope for a military defeat of the PLA in Taiwan vanes Taiwan could decide to retaliate on the PRC with ballistic missile strikes on politically sensitive targets the Mainland. While the PRC military installation have medium to good anti-missile defenses, most political and civilian targets are poorly if at all protected. This without considering that the nuclear power status of Taiwan is, as for Japan and Israel \u201cuncertain\u201d. On the most optimistic time scale for the PLA to take Taipei the PLA and ROC (most pessimistic for them) agree: two weeks form first amphibious landing IF: - The PLA immediately secures air and naval superiority - The PLA ensures the naval blockade of Taiwan - The PLA ensures control over the airwaves - No foreign intervention - Harbor and Airport are secured within 3 days - ROC forces surrender after first defeat and do not switch to asymmetric warfare for resistance. If any of the above is not secured the most optimistic time-scale is rolled back to about a month. Casualties for the PLA are expected in the However the PLA taking Taiwan in about a month is a possible but not the most likely outcome. The most likely outcome, according to both US, Japanese and ROC military simulations, is a lengthy war of attrition lasting several months. Also PLA writings warn about the possibility. Foreign intervention In case the PRC decides to take the ROC territories by force, the world is unlikely to stay there and watch: the stakes are too high. If the PRC takes control of Taiwan, it would effectively control the most important shipping routes and some of the most important airspace in the world. It could at any time starve the economies of Japan and South Korea and become the undisputed regional hegemon. US influence in the area would cease to matter. The firs island Chain would be under undisputed Chinese control. The worst-case scenario is that all the interested parties would not enter hot conflict (aka chicken out). Yet even in this scenario US, Japan, Australia, S.Korea are nearly guaranteed to offer assistance to the ROC in the form of intelligence, cyber warfare, electronic warfare, satellite assistance. The West at large is likely to impose hard economic sanctions and the ensuing naval blockade of the strait would effectively shut down Chinese exports for the duration of the conflict. The combined effect of sanctions, cyber warfare and blockades, plus the war effort itself would throw China in the worse economic recession since the Great Leap. Such domestic repercussion for a conflict which has been sold to the population as a walk in a park would, at the very least, cause social tensions within China. Medium intervention: indirect military assistance. A coalition of states might decide to support Taiwan by preventing the naval blockade of the East Coast of Taiwan, ensuring a continuous stream of supplies and armaments to the island. The US could also use its aircraft carriers to ensure a no-fly zone and/or radar jamming operations above the island without directly entering into a hot conflict with China. Even such a seemingly limited support would make the war much more costly to China and might even prevent the successful conquering of the island. Full intervention. Let us assume that for whatever reason the US alone, of a coalition of countries enters the conflict. It might just take a stupid mistake as the PLA sinking the wrong ship or shooting the wrong satellite. Things look unwell for the PLA. Indeed no country would ever attempt to invade China. Yet again: no one would need to. The combined power of the US Navy and Japan defense Forces would be enough to prevent China taking the island. Stealth bombing, submarine warfare and cruise missile operations on Chinese installations would easily cripple them. The US could use the occasion to obliterate Chinese positions in the South China Sea. Indeed the PLA\u00b4s Missile Force could inflict severe losses to the US Navy and might even able to prevent the effective use of aircraft carriers. However, as of now the PLA has no recipe against US submarine warfare. India might take advantage of the situation to settle once and for all its border disputes. The concentrated effort of several countries would be too much to bite for the PLA.  No one would put a foot on Chinese territory, yet the ensuing military containment would be a severe political humiliation for Beijing, which, combined with the inevitable economic crisis, might be enough to put its legitimacy into question. Conclusion. Taiwan is well prepared for warfare: it has been preparing for decades. Even left to its own devices the ROC can be able to resist for at least two weeks, with the most likely outcome of a war of attrition lasting months. Even so the losses, economic and military, to the PRC would be severe. Any level of foreign intervention could be enough to prevent the military campaign to succeed. Deciding to annex Taiwan by force is a very risky political gamble for Beijing: severe losses, an economic crisis and potentially a military failure could all cause destabilizing effects in the mainland, while stakes to other regional actors are too high for them to remain idle. Ultimately, China might very well be able to take Taiwan, yet it is questionable if it is ready, or able, to pay the price for it. ",

            "answer_text": "There are something in the question need to be clarified first. First, the entities in the question shall be mainland China and Taiwan province, or PRC and ROC. Both sides of the strait recognize that there are only one China. The only argument is what the concrete name shall be for China, \u201cPeople\u2019s Republic of China\u201d or \u201cRepublic of China\u201d. Second, the action mainland China unify Taiwan province by force shall not be called \u201cinvade\u201d. No invasion can happen within one country. Among the answers, there are some argue that USA will join the fight if there is war between mainland China and Taiwan province. I won\u2019t agree with that. USA has several laws and bills related to mainland China and Taiwan province. USA declares it will support Taiwan province if there is war. But USA never clarify what kind of support it will offer in war. Considering the history, especially US Navy\u2019s actions during the Second Taiwan Strait Crisis, there is a common knowledge: USA will not really sacrifice its soldiers and war ships for Taiwan province. And for the result of the war that might happen, there are many researches and articles. And I think annex 1 of Annual Report to Congress: Military and Security Developments Involving the People\u2019s Republic of China 2019 (https://media.defense.gov/2019/May/02/2002127082/-1/-1/1/2019_CHINA_MILITARY_POWER_REPORT.pdf) might give you the answer.

Examples could be Taiwan declare independence. etc. This has always been China\u2019s position and has been stated for countless times. But whether westerners believe it is another story and China could not control what they believe. What would happen? Well, I think China would quash the cause of the event causing China to military intervene. This is likely to complete quickly. There could be some casualties but everybody do not want any damage to the economy - the people, the company, etc. May be similar to when PLA liberate Shanghai with modification, of course. I think Taiwan people do welcome unification. They are sick of the deadlock - what happen to Taiwan under Tsai\u2019s presidency already tells what the people think. Of course, the DPP needs to be addressed - but I think China has a lot of experience in dealing with that. Surely China, Japan, US has thought about this scenario for countless times. ",

Ironically, the DPPs folks want such to be accompanied by absolutely massive civilian casualties to give PRC a pyrrhic victory, whereas the PRC wants to minimize civilian casualties. Makes one wonder about the mindset of the DPPs, whether they even care about the welfare of the common people. Maybe the PRC can send special forces to capture Tsai, Feng et al, and put an end to it without firing more than a few shots. Tsai has been practicing escape by helicopter. Perhaps the PRC can make as if they are going to invade, and then capture Tsai when she tries to escape. Of course she may use a decoy, but PRC's agents on the ground should be able to assist in the ID. Such would be akin to what the US did to Saddam Hussein, Osama Bin Laden and Muammar Gaddafi. ",

            "answer_text": "A fair number of Chinese soldiers would drown in the Taiwan Strait, and not one of them would reach Taiwan except perhaps as a prisoner plucked from the waters by a ROC or USN vessel. China lacks the naval power to secure a crossing route for amphibious craft, and they lack sufficient amphibious assets to make the crossing with a useful number of troops in any case. Even if the ROC government chose to let PRC forces cross unopposed with everything they could cram into every amphibious craft they possess, that would not amount to enough troops and equipment to secure a beachhead for more than a few hours before ROC forces crushed them and forced them to surrender. There is a huge difference between having a huge army and having the ability to get that army to whatever battlefield you choose. ",

It will disable its military platforms first by missile barrage, then take out the current government via precision strike via drones or air strike.

It can air drop small contingent of troops to take physical possession of certain government organs, but no large scale invasion is required nor warranted. It will be kept to a limited scale and size to reduce civilian death also avoid Taiwan\u2019s allies getting involved thus prolong the conflict. ",
