            "answer_text": "Although it is conceivable that live video without recording or post-production would have as many viewers for the same length of time, videotape (which I translate as video recording generally) caused people to watch about 5 or 6 hours of media a day, replacing about 20% of human experience (33% of awake time) with other people\u2019s lives and concerns.
