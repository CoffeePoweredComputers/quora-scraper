            "answer_text": "Interesting question. Let me reproduce something that I read recently. A very very compelling, exciting and plausible forecast. I was aghast at these unlimited, inconceivable possibilities that future holds. Happy reading!  In a recent interview the MD of Mercedes Benz said their competitors are no longer other car companies but Tesla (obvious), Google, Apple, Amazon 'et al' \u2026\u2026 There have always been the 3 constants ... Death, Taxes and CHANGE! Software will disrupt most traditional industries in the next 5-10 years. Uber is just a software tool, they don't own any cars, and are now the biggest taxi company in the world. Airbnb is now the biggest hotel company in the world, although they don't own any properties. Artificial Intelligence: Computers become exponentially better in understanding the world. This year, a computer beat the best Go player in the world, 10 years earlier than expected. In the US, young lawyers already don't get jobs. Because of IBM Watson, you can get legal advice (so far for more or less basic stuff) within seconds, with 90% accuracy compared with 70% accuracy when done by humans. So if you study law, stop immediately. There will be 90% less lawyers in the future, only specialists will remain. Watson already helps nurses diagnosing cancer, 4 times more accurate than human nurses. Facebook now has a pattern recognition software that can recognize faces better than humans. In 2030, computers will become more intelligent than humans. Autonomous cars: In 2018 the first self driving cars will appear for the public. Around 2020, the complete industry will start to be disrupted. You don't want to own a car anymore. You will call a car with your phone, it will show up at your location and drive you to your destination. You will not need to park it, you only pay for the driven distance and can be productive while driving. Our kids will never get a driver's licence and will never own a car. It will change the cities, because we will need 90-95% less cars for that. We can transform former parking spaces into parks. 1.2 million people die each year in car accidents worldwide. We now have one accident every 60,000 miles (100,000 km), with autonomous driving that will drop to one accident in 6 million miles (10 million km). That will save a million lives each year. Most car companies will probably become bankrupt. Traditional car companies try the evolutionary approach and just build a better car, while tech companies (Tesla, Apple, Google) will do the revolutionary approach and build a computer on wheels. Many engineers from Volkswagen and Audi; are completely terrified of Tesla. Insurance companies will have massive trouble because without accidents, the insurance will become 100x cheaper. Their car insurance business model will disappear. Real estate will change. Because if you can work while you commute, people will move further away to live in a more beautiful neighbourhood. Electric cars will become mainstream about 2020. Cities will be less noisy because all new cars will run on electricity. Electricity will become incredibly cheap and clean: Solar production has been on an exponential curve for 30 years, but you can now see the burgeoning impact. Last year, more solar energy was installed worldwide than fossil. Energy companies are desperately trying to limit access to the grid to prevent competition from home solar installations, but that can't last. Technology will take care of that strategy. With cheap electricity comes cheap and abundant water. Desalination of salt water now only needs 2kWh per cubic meter (@ 0.25 cents). We don't have scarce water in most places, we only have scarce drinking water. Imagine what will be possible if anyone can have as much clean water as he wants, for nearly no cost. Health: The Tricorder X price will be announced this year. There are companies who will build a medical device (called the \"Tricorder\" from Star Trek) that works with your phone, which takes your retina scan, your blood sample and you breath into it. It then analyses 54 bio-markers that will identify nearly any disease. It will be cheap, so in a few years everyone on this planet will have access to world class medical analysis, nearly for free. Goodbye, medical establishment. 3D printing: The price of the cheapest 3D printer came down from $18,000 to $400 within 10 years. In the same time, it became 100 times faster. All major shoe companies have already started 3D printing shoes. Some spare airplane parts are already 3D printed in remote airports. The space station now has a printer that eliminates the need for the large amount of spare parts they used to have in the past. At the end of this year, new smart phones will have 3D scanning possibilities. You can then 3D scan your feet and print your perfect shoe at home. In China, they already 3D printed and built a complete 6-storey office building. By 2027, 10% of everything that's being produced will be 3D printed. Business opportunities: If you think of a niche you want to go in, ask yourself: \"in the future, do you think we will have that?\" and if the answer is yes, how can you make that happen sooner? If it doesn't work with your phone, forget the idea. And any idea designed for success in the 20th century is doomed to failure in the 21st century. Work: 70-80% of jobs will disappear in the next 20 years. There will be a lot of new jobs, but it is not clear if there will be enough new jobs in such a small time. Agriculture: There will be a $100 agricultural robot in the future. Farmers in 3rd world countries can then become managers of their field instead of working all day on their fields. Aeroponics will need much less water. The first Petri dish produced veal, is now available and will be cheaper than cow produced veal in 2018. Right now, 30% of all agricultural surfaces is used for cows. Imagine if we don't need that space anymore. There are several startups who will bring insect protein to the market shortly. It contains more protein than meat. It will be labelled as \"alternative protein source\" (because most people still reject the idea of eating insects). There is an app called \"moodies\" which can already tell in which mood you're in. By 2020 there will be apps that can tell by your facial expressions, if you are lying. Imagine a political debate where it's being displayed when they're telling the truth and when they're not. Bitcoin may even become the default reserve currency ... Of the world! Longevity: Right now, the average life span increases by 3 months per year. Four years ago, the life span used to be 79 years, now it's 80 years. The increase itself is increasing and by 2036, there will be more than one year increase per year. So we all might live for a long long time, probably way more than 100. Education: The cheapest smart phones are already at $10 in Africa and Asia. By 2020, 70% of all humans will own a smart phone. That means, everyone has the same access to world class education. Every child can use Khan academy for everything a child needs to learn at school in First World countries. There have already been releases of software in Indonesia and soon there will be releases in Arabic, Suaheli and Chinese this summer. I can see enormous potential if we give the English app for free, so that children in Africa and everywhere else can become fluent in English and that could happen within half a year. ",

            "answer_text": "15 Ways Machine Learning Will Impact Your Everyday Life Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning is now considered to be one of the biggest innovations since the microchip. AI used to be a fanciful concept from science fiction, but now it\u2019s becoming a daily reality. Neural networks (imitating the process of real neurons in the brain) are paving the way toward breakthroughs in machine learning, called \u201cdeep learning.\u201d Machine learning can help us live happier, healthier, and more productive lives\u2026 if we know how to harness its power. Some say that AI is ushering in another \u201cindustrial revolution.\u201d Whereas the previous Industrial Revolution harnessed physical and mechanical strength, this new revolution will harness mental and cognitive ability. One day, computers will not only replace manual labor, but also mental labor. But how exactly will this happen? And is it already happening? Free: Data Science Career Guide Learn how to land a high-paying job in data science and future-proof your career with the most efficient roadmap to learning DS & ML for busy professionals. First Name Email Send My Download Here are 15 ways artificial intelligence and machine learning will impact your everyday life. EDS ML Intelligent Gaming 1. Intelligent Gaming Some of you may remember 1997 when IBM\u2019s Deep Blue defeated Gary Kasparov in chess. But if you weren\u2019t old enough then, you might remember when another computer program, Google DeepMind\u2019s AlphaGo, defeated Lee Sedol, the Go world champion, in 2016. AlphaGo vs Lee Sedol Go is an ancient Chinese game, much more difficult for computers to master than chess. But AlphaGo was specifically trained to play Go, not by simply analyzing the moves of the very best players, but by learning how to play the game better from practicing against itself millions of times. 2. Self-Driving Cars and Automated Transportation Have you flown on an airplane lately? If so, then you\u2019ve already experienced transportation automation at work. These modern commercial aircraft use FMS (Flight Management System), a combination of GPS, motion sensors, and computer systems to track its position during flight. So an average Boeing 777 pilot spends just seven minutes actually flying the plane manually, and many of those minutes are spent during takeoff and landing. The leap into self-driving cars is more complicated. There are more cars on the road, obstacles to avoid, and limitations to account for in terms of traffic patterns and rules. Even so, self-driving cars are already a reality. These AI-powered cars have even surpassed human-driven cars in safety, according to a study with 55 Google vehicles that have driven over 1.3 million miles altogether. Google Driverless Car - Machine Learning The navigation question has already been solved long ago. Google Maps already sources location data from your smartphone. By comparing the location of a device from one point in time to another, it can determine how fast the device is traveling. Put simply, it can determine how slow traffic is in real time. It can combine that data with incidents reported by users to build a picture of the traffic at any given moment. Maps can recommend the fastest route for you based on traffic jams, construction work or accidents between you and your destination. But what about the skill of actually driving a car? Well, machine learning allows self-driving cars to instantaneously adapt to changing road conditions, while at the same time learning from new road situations. By continuously parsing through a stream of visual and sensor data, onboard computers can make split-second decisions even faster than well-trained drivers. It\u2019s not magic. It\u2019s based on the exact same fundamentals of machine learning used in other industries. You have input features (i.e. the real-time visual and sensor data) and an output (i.e. a decision among the universe of possible next \u201cactions\u201d for a car). EDS ML Self-Driving Cars So, sure these self-driving cars already exist, but are they ready for prime-time? Perhaps not yet, since the vehicles are currently required to have a driver present for safety. So despite exciting developments in this new field of automated transportation, the technology isn\u2019t perfect yet. But give it a few months or years, and you\u2019ll probably want to have one of these cars yourself. 3. Cyborg Technology Obviously, our bodies and our brains have built in limitations and weaknesses. According to Oxford C.S. professor Shimon Whiteson, technology will improve to to such an extent that we will be able to augment some of our weaknesses and limitations with computers, thereby enhancing many of our natural abilities. But wait - before you start picturing dystopian worlds of steel and flesh, consider for a moment that most people walking around are already \u201ccyborgs\u201d in a sense. How many people do you know who could survive the day without their trusty smartphone? We already rely on these handheld computers for communication, navigation, acquiring knowledge, receiving important news, and a host of other activities. Contemporary Smartphone Cyborgs Without your smartphone, how in the world would you post on Instagram? Yoky Matsuoka of Nest also believes that AI will become useful for people with amputated limbs. One day, the brain will be able to communicate with a robotic limb. This technology will give amputees more control and reduce the daily limitations they deal with. 4. Taking Over Dangerous Jobs One of the most dangerous jobs is bomb disposal. Today, robots (or more more technically, drones) are taking over these risky jobs, among others. Right now, most of these drones require a human to control them. But as machine learning technology improves in the future, these tasks would be done completely by robots with AI. This technology alone has already saved thousands of lives. Another job being outsourced to robots is welding. This kind of work produces noise, intense heat, and toxic substances found in the fumes. Without machine learning, these robot welders would need to be pre-programmed to weld in a certain location. However, advancements in computer vision and deep learning have enabled more flexibility and greater accuracy. 5. Environmental Protection Machines can store and access more data than any one person could\u2014including mind-boggling statistics. Using big data, AI could one day identify trends and use that information to arrive at h solutions to previously untenable problems. For example, IBM\u2019s Green Horizon Project analyzes environmental data from thousands of sensors and sources to product accurate, evolving weather and pollution forecasts. It allows city planners to run \u201cwhat-if\u201d scenarios and model ways to mitigate environmental impact. And that\u2019s just beginning. Exciting environment-oriented innovations are entering the market every day, from self-adjusting smart thermostats to distributed energy grids. 6. Digital Empathy and Robots as Friends Most robots are still emotionless. But a company in Japan has made the first big steps toward a robot companion\u2014one that can understand and feel emotions. Introduced in 2014, Pepper the companion robot went on sale in 2015, with all 1,000 initial units selling out within a minute. The robot was programmed to read human emotions, develop its own, and help its human friends stay happy. \"I believe practical advancements in artificial intelligence will start to enable a more contextual form of computing with some of our devices, particularly smartphones and smart speakers... part of the way this development will likely occur is by learning more about people and how they think\u2014essentially building a form of digital empathy.\" \u2014Bob O'Donnell, President of TECHnalysis Research As funny as it sounds, the day that one can literally \u201cbuy a friend\u201d is not too far away. 7. Improved Elder Care For many seniors, everyday tasks can be a struggle. Many have to hire outside help or rely on family members. Elder care is a growing concern for many families. AI is at a stage where replacing this need isn\u2019t too far off, says Matthew Taylor, computer scientist at Washington State University. Elderly relatives who don\u2019t want to leave their homes could be assisted by in-home robots. That solution offers family members more flexibility in managing a loved one\u2019s care. These robots could help seniors with everyday tasks and allow them to stay independent and living in their homes for as long as possible, improving their overall well-being. EDS ML Improved Elder Care Medical and AI researchers have even piloted systems based on infrared cameras that can detect when an elderly person falls. Researchers and medical specialists can also monitor alcohol and food consumption, fevers, restlessness, urinary frequency, chair and bed comfort, fluid intake, eating, sleeping, declining mobility, and more. 8. Enhanced Health Care Hospitals may soon put your wellbeing in the hands of an AI, and that\u2019s good news. Hospitals that utilize machine learning to aid in treating patients see fewer accidents and fewer cases of hospital-related illnesses, like sepsis. AI is also tackling some of medicine\u2019s most intractable problems, such as allowing researchers to better understand genetic diseases through the use of predictive models. \"2018 will be the year AI becomes real for medicine. ... In 2018, we'll begin the adoption of a technology that may truly transform the way providers work, and the way patients experience healthcare, on a global scale.\" \u2014 Mark Michalski, executive director, Massachusetts General Hospital Previously, health professionals must review reams of data manually before they diagnose or treat a patient. Today, high-performance computing GPUs have become key tools for deep learning and AI platforms. Deep learning models quickly provide real-time insights and, combined with the explosion of computing power, are helping healthcare professionals diagnose patients faster and more accurately, develop innovative new drugs and treatments, reduce medical and diagnostic errors, predict adverse reactions, and lower the costs of healthcare for providers and patients. 9. Innovations in Banking Consider how many people have a bank account. Now, on top of that, consider the number of credit cards that are in circulation. How many man hours would it take for employees to sift through the thousands of transactions that take place every day? By the time they noticed an anomaly, your bank account could be empty or your credit card maxed out. Using location data and purchase patterns, AI can also help banks and credit issuers identify fraudulent behavior while it is happening. These machine learning based anomaly detection models monitor transaction requests. They can spot patterns in your transactions and alert users to suspicious activity. They can even confirm with you that the purchase was indeed yours before they process the payment. It may seem inconvenient if it was just you eating at a restaurant while traveling on holiday, but it could end up saving you thousands of dollars someday. EDS ML Keeping You Safe 10. Personalized Digital Media Machine learning has massive potential in the entertainment industry, and the technology has already found a home in streaming services such as Netflix, Amazon Prime, Spotify, and Google Play. Some algorithms are already being used to eliminate buffering and low-quality playback, getting you the best quality from your internet service provider. ML algorithms are also making use of the almost endless stream of data about consumers\u2019 viewing habits, helping streaming services offer more useful recommendations. \"Given the rapid pace of research, I expect AI to be able to create new personalized media, such as music according to your taste. Imagine a future music service that doesn't just play existing songs you might like, but continually generates new songs just for you.\" \u2014 Jan Kautz, Senior Director of Visual Computing and Machine Learning Research, NVIDIA They will help more and more with the production of media too. NLP (Natural Language Processing) algorithms help write trending news stories to decrease production time, and a new MIT-developed AI named Shelley is helps users write horror stories through deep learning algorithms and a bank of user-generated fiction. At this rate, the next great content creators may not be human at all. 11. Home Security and Smart Homes For the best tech in home security, many homeowners look toward AI-integrated cameras and alarm systems. These cutting-edge systems use facial recognition software and machine learning to build a catalog of your home\u2019s frequent visitors, allowing these systems to detect uninvited guests in an instant. AI-powered smart homes also provide many other useful features, like tracking when you last walked the dog or notifying you when your kids come home from school. The newest systems can even call for emergency services autonomously, making it an attractive alternative to subscription-based services that provide similar benefits. Smart Home Diagram Consumer AI will enable wave after wave of convenient automations in the home. When combined with appliances, AI could make housework and household management seamless. AI-powered apps which allow the oven to communicate with the refrigerator and the pantry robot would act like home chefs. Instant replenishment of food and supplies would mean never running out of anything again. Cleaning could be schedule through sensor-to-appliance connections, after which robotic cleaners would work almost completely independently of humans. Jetsons Smart Home Another advantage of smart homes would be a reduction of household waste and automated recycling, putting the household in better balance with the ecosystem. Releasing humans from housework could deliver major benefits in terms of improving sustainability, saving time, and reducing stress. 12. Streamlined Logistics and Distribution Imagine getting a package in just a few hours and at a very low shipping cost. That\u2019s the promise of AI in logistics and distribution, with its promise to tame the massive amounts of data and decisions in the trillion-dollar shipping and logistics industry. Amazon has already started experimenting with autonomous drones that blow their already-quite-fast two-day shipping out of the water. Currently, shipping costs are still quite expensive. Improving efficiency through AI integration and automation will mean big reductions in shipping costs and increases in delivery speed. Optimization opportunities in supply chain management, vehicle maintenance, and inventory will also make shipping faster, easier, and more environmentally friendly. EDS ML Streamlined Logistics 13. Digital Personal Assistants Imagine never needing to worry about preparing dinner, because your personal assistant knows what you like, what you have in your pantry, and which days of the week you like to cook at home. Imagine that when you get back from work, all your groceries are waiting at your doorstep, ready for you to prepare that delicious meal you\u2019ve been craving. You even have a bonus recipe for a new dessert you\u2019ve been meaning to try. Digital assistants are getting smarter by the year. Companies such as Amazon and Google are pouring billions of dollars into making digital assistants even better at speech recognition and learning about our daily routines, opening the door to more and more complex tasks. 14. Brick and Mortar and AI Georges Nahon, CEO of Orange Silicon Valley, foresees a time when people will no longer need to wait in line at a store. Observing how tech and retail are merging, like Amazon and Whole Foods, he says: \u201cThanks to AI, the face will be the new credit card, the new driver's license and the new barcode. Facial recognition is already completely transforming security with biometric capabilities being adopted\u2026\u201d While some people claim that e-commerce and the Internet will completely eat away the traditional retail market, the more likely scenario is that they will arrive at some sort of equilibrium. However, it\u2019s undeniable that even the biggest traditional retail giants are starting to adopt AI-powered technologies to gain a competitive edge. 15. Customized News and Market Reports According to Reg Chua, COO of Reuters News, technologies are close to providing customized news and market reports, and newsrooms are starting to embrace the possibilities. Can you imagine getting market reports that were written on demand for you and not just when the market closed? Instead of a generic recap of market performance, your customized report compares how your portfolio performed against the broader market, citing key reasons why. For example: \u201cIt's 3:14 pm. The market is currently up 2%, but your portfolio is down 3%. This is attributed in part to the purchase of XYZ stock last week, which has fallen sharply since \u2026\u201d EDS ML Customized News and Reports While the most obvious application of this technology would be in the finance and investing space, there are plenty of other domains that would benefit as well, including ad tech, agriculture, sports, and more. The Bottom Line As many people have wisely observed, the dream of artificial intelligence is not new. It has been around since the very earliest days of computing. Pioneers have always imagined ways to build intelligent learning machines. Currently, most promising approach of AI is the use of applied machine learning. Rather than trying to encode machines with everything they need to know up front (which is impossible), we want to enable them to learn, and then to learn how to learn. Machine learning\u2019s time has come, and it is in the process of revolutionizing all of our lives.
