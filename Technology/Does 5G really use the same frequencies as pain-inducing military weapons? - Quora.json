            "answer_text": "ITS THE EXACT SAME THING. The term \u201c5g\u201d is just a the name given this 40+ year old technology. Damage WILL occur with power at .001 watts/ sq. cm. The other answer in this post is laughable, he\u2019s talking about wifi? who asked about wifi? Directed energy weapons, or 5g, is the cause for \u201cmystery illness\u201d in kids, and covid19. If you did happen to see the sick kids in new york, they seemed lost, unresponsive, ZOMBIE-LIKE. And that\u2019s because D.E.W. (or 5g) destroy your immune system and central nervous system. w/o a healthy immune, even a common cold (coronavirus) will have serious consequences, even deadly. Here\u2019s real research done by REAL scientists on Biological Effect of Millimetre Radio Waves animals were irradiated with radiowaves in the 5 to 8 mm range. (37ghz to 60 ghz.) They were irradiated for only 15 min/day for 60 days. A total of 900 min. (imagine 24/7) one week = 1440 min \u201cAs is known, the energy of millimeter waves, because of its weak penetrating ability, is absorbed primarily and. mainly by the skin. Our investigations have shown that in the skin of irradiated animals deformation of the receptor apparatus and well-expressed changes of a reactive character were observed. In the skin layer properly speaking appeared bunches of nerve fibers with hypertrophy of a portion of the fiber and sections with demyelinization. In the dermis, among the collagen fibers were small trunks of various thickness, the neural conductors of which were fragmented in separate cases, and phenomena of demyelinization were observed in the surface layers.\u201d All this damage with a density of the flow of power of l milliwatt/ square cm 1 milliwatt = .001 watt And yet, there\u2019s still moredamage to be done after the skin and nerve cells \u201cAs the results of histomorphological analysis showed, in the functionally active structures of tissue of the myocardium, liver, kidneys. and spleen disorders of the hemodynamics were established, with disruption of the permeabillity of the vesicular membranes, the appearance of micronecroses and subsequent tissue dystrophy. Moreover, qualitative and quantitative-shifts were revealed in the erythrocytic and leukocystic composition of the blood of irradiated animals, indicating suppression of the hemopoietic function of the bone marrow and lymphatic system. Noted in the composition of the red blood was eosinophilia, neutrophilia and lymphopenia, and lowering of the hemoglobin level and reduction of the number of erythrocytes were observed, which was determined to a considerable degree by the retention of erythrocytes in the bone marrow. In the latter occurred an increase of the nunmber or erythroblast:tc cells and decrease of cells of 'the leukoblastic series.\u201d HEART, LIVER, KIDNEYS, BONE MARROW ALL GET SERIOUSLY DAMAGED AND ALSO YOU\u2019LL HAVE DEAD CELLS SPREAD ALL OVER YOUR BODY! And there\u2019s still more, just read for yourself https://cdn2.collective-evolution.com/assets/uploads/2020/05/Declassified-Russian-mmWave-Study-1977.pdf BTW, you have no idea how many writers and medical journalists(most likely PAID FOR BY BIG PHARMA) ive encountered stating that its safe. Too bad for them I\u2019m an electronics expert. I hold 2 degrees and they always use the terms \u201cvisible light\u201d, \u201cnon-ionizing\u201d and \u201cnon-thermal\u201d. All of which DO NOT MATTER. Theyll say visible light is higher up on the emf spectrum and thats not a problem. or non ionizing doesn\u2019t give radiation. Or non-thermal isn\u2019t dangerous. I DISMISS VISIBLE LIGHT, AND the other 2 statements are FALSE. They want to turn us against each other. 1st they separated us by faking the virus\u2019 level of danger and promoting fear and panic so you wont trust any one and feel uneasy when u go out in public. then quarantine (unconstitutional), RIGHT NOW THIS VERY MOMENT FREEDOM OF SPEECH IS GOING OUT THE DOOR AND THESE PLANNED MASS SHOOTINGS ARE BEING ORCHESTRATED SO GOVT TAKES OUR GUNS AWAY Canadian Mass Shooting That Led to Instant Gun Control Was Probably a False Flag ",

            "answer_text": "No, the ADS works on 95Ghz, WIFI works on 5Ghz. Plus the ADS works with megawatt power. So your 5G phone uses a tiny minute fraction of that power. You should be way more scared of the neutrino\u2019s that puncture your skin every single day. And there is nowhere to hide from them. Pure unadulterated radiation bathing the inside and outside of your body. Turn up the heat and you\u2019re a sizzle stick. It\u2019s called the sun and no one cares about that. A tiny fraction of power and everybody is running for cover\u2026 ",
