            "answer_text": "IMPACT OF THE CLEAN AIR ACT The U.S. can largely thank the Clean Air Act, which was originally passed in 1973 and amended in 1990, for its clean air record compared with that of China. Without these regulations, the air in U.S. cities could be as bad, if not worse, than that of Chinese cities. The Clean Air Act was passed to reduce the impacts of air pollution on both environmental and human health. It requires the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to regulate and monitor atmospheric emissions and toxic pollutants that pose a risk to public health. According to the Union of Concerned Scientists, since the Clean Air Act was passed over 40 years ago, pollution levels have been cut dramatically, preventing the premature deaths of over 400,000 people as well as preventing hundreds of millions of people from contracting diseases related to air pollution. Some of the key air quality improvements since the Clean Air Act was implemented include the following: Surface ozone levels have dropped by over 25% since 1980.Mercury emissions have been reduced by 45% since 1990.The two key pollutants responsible for acid rain \u2013 nitrogen dioxide and sulfur dioxide \u2013 have been reduced by 46% and 71% respectively, since 1980.Chemicals that are responsible for the hole in the ozone layer, such as CFCs, have been phased out and are no longer produced or used extensively.Lead in gasoline has been substantially reduced, resulting in lead air pollutants being cut by 92% since 1980.Thank you and keep Upvoting\ud83d\udce4 ",
