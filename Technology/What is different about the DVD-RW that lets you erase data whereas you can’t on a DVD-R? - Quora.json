            "answer_text": "The chemicals used in a DVD-RW are different. Specifically, when CD-Rs were created, they were made with a chemical that could be turned darker by heating it up a bit with a laser (hence, the use of the term \u201cburn\u201d with recordable CDs, DVDs, etc.). Later, a chemical was invented that a laser could heat up and change it between two states, so you could both darken it, and then later, lighten it again. However, the specifics of the laser needed were different, and the newer chemical is more expensive. So, -R media and drives continued to be made, which use the older chemical, and, for the drives, only have the lasers needed to write to -R media and to read media. -RW drives need a third laser, and the media have to be made with the newer and more expensive chemical.

The pattern of burning is what stores the data on the disc. Dvd-r have a dye that can only be burned once. DVD-RW have have dye on which burned data can be erased by the same laser, and be burned again with other data. ",
