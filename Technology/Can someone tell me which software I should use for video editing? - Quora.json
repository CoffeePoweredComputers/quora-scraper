            "answer_text": "All major editing apps are reliable. It is the hardware configuration that can make for a unstable situation and therewith cause unreliable behaviour. You have to have a system that is robust enough for editing. There are many different configurations and parameters to take into account. But video editing has a lot in common with gaming. So a good gaming computer will probably also preform well as an editing computer. Make sure you at least have the minimum required amount of RAM , a fast processor and a GPU that is recommended by the software application. Another important factor is the footage. Which codec is used, some codecs are better for editing then others. Codecs used by the camera for storage are optimised for storage, so as much as possible video can be stored on the camera\u2019s cards. This makes it also \u2018heavy\u2019 on your system to play and edit. So often you want to transcode your footage to a editing friendly codec. If you don\u2019t do this it can result in unstable behaviour of your editing application. Then there is the learning curve of the app. Apple\u2019s Final Cut Pro and Adobe Premiere are easier to learn than Avid Media Composer and Davinci Resolve. If you want to edit smaller video\u2019s which are completely finalised on one working station, I\u2019d suggest Final Cut or Premiere. If you work on a production that is a collaboration with many specialists you can use those as well but in my experience production is smoother when you use Avid or Davinci Resolve. But if you are doing such a production you probably wouldn\u2019t be asking this question. I also want to stay out of the whole \u2018religious\u2019 debate of which app is best. There are a lot of factors involved when choosing an editing application and if you are starting on a major production I\u2019d suggest consulting a post production specialist to help you make the right decisions. If you are starting out small and want do some editing, ask yourself this: Who can I go to when I need help, are there a lot of PC people in your network, you probably don\u2019t want to buy a Mac and start using Final Cut. Good luck with your project. ",

            "answer_text": "I did not pay Apple Tax in the past. I do now, but not in terms of PC. So I have nothing to say about Final Cut other than I have worked with a guy and he was fast at it. The edits were okay. I do like Abobe Premiere Pro except when it doesn't work. I work off External Hard Drives for larger projects. I try to edit projects on my SSD on my laptop and then sync the outputs to the external Hard Drive. I don\u2019t like it when it is hokey which is a lot. They made a big change a few years back and titles/sequences are no longer in bins, and I really liked that feature. I lost a ton of projects upon that change. Most older projects simply do not open. When it is right, I love it. Here is why and an image of my life behind the scenes.  I like the title editing. And if I want a new font, I just say Add and it takes me to the Adobe Marketplace and I pick up the new font I want (highlighted in orange outline)I like the timeline. I like how the synced selection works. I like the groups you can make. That is really handy when you have a lot of sequences that might be on another video layer you can\u2019t see or don\u2019t want to focus o.I really like the transitions and presets. I do a lot of masks and various color camera presets for my team members and I don\u2019t like making the same adjustment twice.I like the Auto-Save feature except when I am screaming through footage and I lose a project. For me, 15 minutes can seem like an eternity to recreate. But I have an idea what I just did. And it is easy to find your Auto Save and pick up right where the last save took place.I like the ability to save Workspaces. The above is my 32\u2033 TV/monitor Workspace. My Laptop Workspace is similar but the Panels are shrunk just a bit.I like how the software handles 2.7K and 4K. I must admit, I love panning in footage and do so regularly. I love that it has color profiles for all my cameras. And it is really easy to create a new Preset if you W/B is way off in your camera.I like the kudos I receive from my fans. I ask them what they want to see and I don\u2019t have any doubts about how to do that in Adobe Premiere.I am like the 50th guy/gal to cover my sport. I am at the top or near the top in my field. I love telling the other guys what I do and how I do it. It may cost $50/month. But it opens up the doors to so many thousands more per month. It is not perfect and I never said it was. But when it is dialed, I don\u2019t want to get up for anything. My only doubt is how it works on Mac. I would love to live on the other side, but I have younger YouTubers in the house and they want to sit next to dad and crank on videos as well. The PC nature of our shop is easy to teach, share projects, and work together with. One day down the road, I will explore a switch to Mac. But for now, we are PC based. I have dabbled in Blackmagic Design Resolve. It is not bad. It makes me realize how awesome Premiere is but I just don\u2019t have the time to be good at that App. Premiere was not working the other day so I spent time recreating a project. It wasn\u2019t all that bad. I could see learning it when I have several weeks to spare. I also started in Windows Movie Maker. I did that for several months before I switched. It was bad. When I switched to Premiere, everybody was telling, \u201cWhat is going on with you?\u201d, \u201cWhat am I watching?\u201d, \u201cMy mind is blown!\u201d We take the most Rednecky thing in the world and simply tell a story with it. As a result, my phone will not stop ringing for booking gigs, promoting gigs, you name it. ",

            "answer_text": "You should think of this choice as being the same as the choice of pencil to do a drawing with\u2026 A pencil is a very simple instrument and so is editing software. It\u2019s easy enough to learn to use a pencil (you just pick up the pencil and make marks on paper), but extremely difficult to master (be able to do a work of art). This is the same with video editing software.. the process of assembling an edit is deceptively simple and provided you have basic motor skills you can manage the task. However if you expect the software to be able to improve your editing you\u2019re in for disapointment, the choice of app used is about as consequential to the end result as the choice of pencil is to how good you are at drawing.Provided that it can make a mark on a piece of paper, you would say that a pencil is effective at drawing. It\u2019s the same for video editing software; provided it can put video and audio in a sequence then it is effective at video editing, and that includes the really basic ones like iMovie and Windows Movie Maker (if you googled \u2018best video editing apps\u2019 and picked one from the list at random, you wouldn\u2019t go far wrong).The best video-editing apps The choice of pencil type or brand of pencil is entirely down to personal preference and the specific task at hand\u2026 there is no overall \u2018best\u2019 option, there are only different options. Nobody can make this choice for you, you\u2019ve gotta do what everyone else in the history of ever has done and try them all and see. Personally I use 3\u20135 video editing apps regularly, depending on the project, there is no best one.The other main factor is price\u2026 which can you afford? This might dictate what you\u2019re able to use.And platform.. some only work on certain operating systems and so you might be restricted in that sense as well.The options available are covered in the linked to article, and it also does a good job of summarising the plus points of each one. You will be left with a confusing choice between about 5 to 6 options which are equally powerful and all are very good editing apps. You will probably eventually realise (as I've done) that you can\u2019t just get away with using one pencil for all drawings, you need a range for different purposes and use cases. ",

I\u2019ve successfully cut live action features and animated TV series, as well as corporate documentaries and varied personal projects on it. It\u2019s familiar to me. Premiere is based on the same source/record monitor, multitrack timeline metaphors that the original Final Cut Pro, and Avid before it, were based on. There are aspects of other systems that I wish Adobe could bring to Premiere. The new FCP\u2019s \u2018Audition\u2019 feature sounds amazing; I\u2019ve often wished for such a thing when editing dialogue. Avid\u2019s Trim function is the best in the industry.

To each his own. For the time being, I prefer Premiere. ",

There are also very widely used commercial products. They are so commonly used that one can assume that they scratch the itch for a large number of people. The two principle ones would be Adobe Premiere Pro (macOS/Windows) and Apple Final Cut Pro X (macOS). If you are editing as part of a large production team, then the most popular is Avid Media Composer (and the suite of programs that go with it), since it goes beyond editing and presents an entire multi-person workflow for video production as one might find in film studio or TV station. Beyond that, there are many other editing tools out there, some specialized, all with various strengths and weaknesses that make them the best for a particular individual\u2019s purposes. ",

            "answer_text": "Bottomline up front my opinion. Premiere Pro. Long story. Well that is kinda a loaded question because some NLE's are better at certain things than others. It also depends on your budget etc. If you are entry level looking to edit some home movies you can look at iMovie on Mac. Its free and comes with your Mac. You can get Final Cut Pro X which is a professional NLE but some people really want to pull their teeth out with it. It's $299 and a one time fee.  The other route is Adobe Premiere Pro CC which is becoming the industry standard in my opinion. You can pick it up for $50 a month subscription which also includes all of the other Adobe software like Photoshop, Illustrator, After Effects and SpeedGrade. All of which can be used to make you picture \"pretty\" I have to acknowledge Sony Vegas and Avid Media composer. Sony, meh, it was great when I started out but now I exclusively use Premiere Pro. Avid Media Composer, seems to used a lot in Hollywood on some features and in Broadcast but honestly when I had to use it in film school I considered slitting my wrist with film negatives trying to edit on it. Everything is ass backwards. ",

            "answer_text": "Sorry, but there is no such thing as \u201cthe best video editing software\u201d. There is, however, something that is \u201cthe best video editing software for you right now\u201d. I teach Premiere Pro and I think it\u2019s pretty great but I can tell you it\u2019s not the best video editing software for everyone. Let me break down the main considerations that you can factor into what will make the best video editing platform for you right now, keeping in mind that the technology is always changing and you can always move to a different platform later. Cost: there are several free options out there (iMovie, Movie Maker, etc.) but most of them have a very limited feature set so if you\u2019re looking for pro-quality features, you\u2019re probably going to want to look elsewhere.* There are low-cost options but most of the ones I\u2019ve seen are also severely limited in many ways when compared to their more expensive counterparts. Then there are the big dogs: Avid, Final Cut Pro, and Premiere Pro. These are relatively expensive but they are the pro\u2019s choice.Ease-of-use: perhaps you are less concerned by cost but when you open up an unfamiliar application and it\u2019s not clear where to start you just want to run away and hide. I get students like that all the time. Some video editing software is super user friendly but in many of those cases the feature set is again compromised. So, it\u2019s easy to make generic run-of-the-mill videos. Click, drag, trim, done. No muss, no fuss. In most cases, if you want to get pro features you\u2019re better off taking a course, either in person or online, so you can learn a more feature-rich (and, yes, more intimidating) piece of software.Compatibility: if you\u2019re just making videos on your own for fun and not collaborating with other editors or motion graphics designers the software you use doesn\u2019t matter as much. However, as someone who uses Adobe Creative Cloud applications on a daily basis I can tell you that it makes me so happy to be able to move seamlessly from Premiere Pro into After Effects for animation and effects or into Audition for sound design and sound effects. I can also pull layered Photoshop documents directly into Premiere and animate them or add effects. It\u2019s a huge time saver that all these apps talk to one another. Apple has similar interoperability between Final Cut Pro and Motion and Logic but I have not tried that workflow so I don\u2019t have a basis for comparing ease of use there.Your Commitment to Your Goals: What kind of videos do you want to make? Whatever platform you choose to start on you can expect to spend many many many hours honing your craft. I have been editing for over 10 years - first in Sony Vegas, then in Avid Media Composer, then in Final Cut Pro, and now in Premiere Pro - and the learning never stops. I\u2019m constantly learning new shortcuts, tricks, and workflows and the software is always being updated with new tools that I have to learn how to use (or how not to use) and I love it! I\u2019m committed to my craft and work on it every day. I picked an expensive, difficult-to-learn software that is compatible with other software (even non-Adobe software) because I get more features with the platform than I\u2019ll probably ever fully understand how to use and that means I\u2019ll continue learning until I can\u2019t physically edit any more because I am committed to telling great stories with video and helping others do the same.So, get out there and grab a free software and push it to its limits. Once you know the limits you\u2019ll know what to look for in a next software so you can research the options that fit your budget, learn that app and push it to its limits and keep getting better day by day. Happy editing! ",

            "answer_text": "There are lots and lots of video editing softwares available in the market satisfying their own costumers. If you are a novice and about to learn about video editing, start with Movie maker first. I suggest this first, because it is available free of cost and your idea of editing videos may change anytime. So better understand what are all there in the editing softwares and then decide whether to proceed with learning editing or not. I used to advise my friends, as they\u2019ve invested some bucks in purchasing standard editing software in the start. So plan before start. After you\u2019ve gained the interest and thrust in learning editing, you can try Adobe Premiere Pro. It is the simple standard video editing software and it is easy to learn and quite easy to master too. When you get well trained in the same, you probably may think about color grading or some cool effects as of in some Hip Hop Albums. Then you must switch over Adobe After Effects, which is a video compositing software. You can even add 3-D objects into an original footage in this software. For 3-D modelling finally you have to opt AutoDesk Maya. There are equivalent software in open source also quite powerful as that of the paid version. Openshot - equivalent to Adobe Premiere ProNatron - equivalent to Adobe After EffectsBlender - the real and most powerful competitor of AutoDesk Maya.To the best part, the open source softwares are free but they works very well in Linux rather than PC.

            "answer_text": "Hi Titiana, I\u2019d say there is no \u201cbest\u201d. It truly depends on why you\u2019re editing video and where you want to go with it. Is it casual? Is it for social and/or you want to do it easily on your phone? Do you already use Adobe products? Go with Adobe Premiere Rush. It\u2019s kind of the casual consumer level version of Premiere Pro, so it\u2019s much easier to learn, is cheaper and was built with mobile users in mind. Are you interested in developing skills to edit videos on a professional level? If you have a mind to head to television, learn AVID. It is very much still the TV industry standard. Interested in color grading to create different filmic \u201clooks\u201d? Learn Davinci Resolve. Industry color graders are big fans of it, and many films are cut on it. If film is your heart, go with AVID or Resolve. If you have design chops as well as an interest in video, and/or you already use Photoshop, Illustrator, InDesign or After Effects, go with Premiere Pro. It\u2019s already included in Creative Cloud so it isn\u2019t an added cost, and it integrates with After Effects. Increasingly, a lot of design & media production companies use it for this reason. That said, and this is important: At the end of the day, it doesn\u2019t truly matter. Why? A. Industry standards are changing all the time. If you shell out lots of cash for an app and learn it ONLY because it\u2019s the heat right now, you could be unpleasantly surprised to find that by the time you get to your goal job years from now, a totally different app could be the new heat. B. Once you can cut in one, it isn\u2019t hard to learn others. (It can be frustrating if you stick with one for a long time and then have to unlearn ingrained habits, but frustrating isn\u2019t the same thing as hard.) So, you aren\u2019t locked in for life. C. What matters is that you edit video, and do it so much that it isn\u2019t about knowing a particular tool\u2019s work flow, it\u2019s about the craft. Good luck! ",

Final Cut Pro X - This is only for Mac and what I use and prefer.Adobe Premiere (and AfterEffects) - This is for both Mac and PC and is just as good as Final Cut, but I prefer FCPX over Premiere.Sony Vegas - A much cheaper option and I would consider this as a prosumer product.

It has an easy learning curve and expertly handles basic editing functions. It installs on both PC and Mac, and is expandable as your needs dictate. Davinci Resolve is also a great application, but it requires a good amount of RAM and a pretty robust processor. For example, my 2009 iMac with an i5 processor would not handle Davinci. Bottom line\u2026 find an editing program that suits your needs and your computer\u2019s capabilities. Yes, it will take some time and effort, but you will be happy for the investment. Now if you get frustrated with the process? Go to Adobe and purchase their CC subscription and then get on the net to find some tutorials. ",

I used the term Classic to keep things clear, but I don\u2019t think the term \u201cClassic\u201d is officially used in the version 6.0 - even though the better version 6.0 is actually the original, and the lesser version 2.6 is actually newer! So it can get confusing. But Long Story Short - try to get and use version \u201cWindows Movie maker v. 6.0\u2033, and avoid \u201cWindows Live Movie Maker v. 2.6\u2033. If you\u2019re OK spending a little money - then I like MOVAVI Video Editor. to be continued\u2026.. ",

The important thing you need to know about kinemaster is an app to use a little hard but I you can really able to edit easily then you will be able to edit video in laptop by any software. It is so helpfull,so I refer to use kinemaster frist. Next you need to know, all the all will show watermark of its own after exporting video that you mix or edit on those app but AV mixer app also easy to use and doesn't shows any watermark after export to gallery. Hence : kinemaster is best for quality for me, but shows water mark after exporting to avoid all the watermark you have to buy pro version of all apps but AV mixer is also great and it doesn't shows watermark.

            "answer_text": "I\u2019ve been a pro TV/Film editor for over 20 years. Without any doubt, FCPX has proven to be the best. As an added bonus, I believe it\u2019s the easiest to learn as well. Why? Apple reimagined how video editing should be done when they set out to write FCPX. Unlike all other editing software, FCPX does not rely on video and audio tracks. Instead, video and sound are \u201clayered\u201d and their connections to each other are the basis of timings. With tracks, every element timing is determined by it\u2019s relationship to the timeline\u2019s timecode. Apple turned a way from this way of imagining editing because it\u2019s simply not relevant any longer. The old way- timecode based- is a function of software companies making what were more-or-less Video Editing Deck emulators. All track (timecode) based software is really just emulating the functionality of how Video Tape Recorders worked. That parody in functionality use to be necessary, because it used to be required to both acquire your video footage from a tape, and to master your finished project back to tape. Apple decided to abandon that way of working, and has been able to make the first stream-of-consciouness capable editing software. In my facility, we consider FCPX a secret weapon. We\u2019re ~ 5x more efficient than a shop that is using Premiere Pro or Avid. This affords us the benefit of making our videos look better, too. Thats because we have more time to really pay attention to the fine details. (Color grading, mixing, etc.) ",

These are the two fully fledged professional options right now. Avid has been around for ever. Premier Pro has become the challenger in the past few years. Final Cut Pro used to be very common in professional edit suites but when they switched to Final Cut X it became more like a high end iMovie and professionals switched to Premier. I have heard good things about Final Cut but it sounds like it is aimed more for singer users, working on their own. If you aren\u2019t looking at professional level stuff then there are loads of options; iMovie on the Mac, or Windows Movie maker, GoPro Studio etc. Depends what you want. ",

            "answer_text": "My favorite editing tool has been the original Lightworks with the dedicated motion controller and software. The newer version remains the thing I prefer to use when I have the choice. The main thing I am doing when editing is selecting and watching stuff. The dedicated analog control gives me a tactile sense so I can slow down and speed up by feel. Feel is what I am doing when I am watching. Also the sound scrub in Lightworks is analog, so I hear waveforms instead of having to look at them. I can split words and music better I feel, using my ears and fingers instead of my eyes. The original Lightworks was infinitely customizable and the current version is still pretty flexible in this regard. I hate the rigid source/record window in most software, which is an artifact of linear video editing. You can only watch one thing at a time, really. So there should really only be the thing you are playing, and whatever edit you are working on. All the tools do the basic things pretty similar, but having analog scrub in audio, and a tactile control panel instead of a keyboard make Lightworks (with the controller- pricey but worth in if this is what you do everyday) a better experience.

            "answer_text": "(A2A) I started with Premiere 4.1 in 1996, but dropped it when Final Cut Pro came out, because AP was very unstable, if I recall. I became quite used to FCP, up to version 6. But it\u2019s gone.Media 100 was great. But it\u2019s (pretty much) gone.I worked with Avid editors, but it was too proprietary, back in the day. Do I want to try it? (sigh) I don\u2019t know if the benefits would outweigh the learning curve and workflow changes. I tried FCP X, but it didn\u2019t work for my workflow, which is highly motion graphics-dependent and thus, track-based. For video editing, I wanted something with less functionality than After Effects (which is my bread-and-butter for motion graphics), the speed of a video editing app, and the ability to add layers. Because I\u2019m still on Mac (for now), I might go back and try FCP X for straight video projects (not many layers, no tracks), but I don\u2019t have a lot of time to deal with the learning curve. I might have to do some serious meditation before tackling it, since I have so many attachments to track-based editing. So, right now, I use Premiere CC, partly because I subscribe to CC, and get it anyway. And I am familiar with the workflow. It\u2019s the devil I know. Once I get up to speed in Resolve for color grading, I might use it as an editor. ",

There are many consumer level editors, however I\u2019m a professional editor so don\u2019t know them. The main differences among the big ones are how things are organized, most of the functions are the same on all. However Adobe integrates its other programs like Photoshop, After Effects, Audition, Illustrator) so you can send clips out for special editing not done as well in Premiere and back again. With Avid, etc you have to export a file, work on it in another program then import the new file. ",

Just a bit of a disagreement with some of the other answers, I wouldn't consider Adobe After Effects an editing software.

Any of the leading NLEs are perfectly competent. Avid, Premiere, Final Cut, DaVinci Resolve, Lightworks etc. Much of the sausage factory post industry is Avid and Premiere based. The cost of replacement in terms of rebuilding established workflows and retraining preclude a switch to other packages. But all are used for all sorts of projects. You\u2019ll find Final Cut is increasingly used for TV and feature post projects and massively in journalism. Defining yourself by the brand of paintbrush you use makes no sense, far more useful to be defined by what you can do with one. Who cares what brand Monet used? Within a short period, any competent editor will be able to use any editing software. ",

IF you are looking for NLE equally complex without the hassle of plugins then go for Sony Vegas Movie Studio.  If you are looking for a slightly lower end NLE software then go for the iMovie on iOS, my suggestion is the Cyberlink PowerDirector 12.   If you are looking for an all round NLE with the ability to handle visual effects as well go for HitFilm by FxHome.  ",
