            "answer_text": "The OnePlus Nord is a good phone overall but it is stands only in the second position for most of the specs Here I list some pros and cons and my personal opinion for those who are planning to purchase the phone Pros; The phone is equipped with 5G processor, but out of the box we get only 4G and 5G will arrive through an OTA update in a future dateThe processor Snapdragon 765G is a powerful one so it can be a good daily driverOxygenOS- most attractive pros of oneplus nordDecent battery life and fast chargingBetter ultrawide camera in the front and back sideFits correctly in hand, good for one hand operation for an average sized handRAM works very efficiently, you can continue your work with 15+ apps running at the same time(may change for other RAM variants)Gorilla glass 5 protection in the back and front side90hz refresh rate and fluid amoled displayHighly customisable UICons; The phone does not have a 3.5 mm audio jackThe phone does not support Expendable storage, so people in India, it is better to purchase 8GB RAM & 128GB internal storage.The phone is built with UFS 2.0 it is better to have UFS 3.0 but you can't find any speed differenceThe camera and the sensor are same as oneplus 8 but the processors are different, so there is a visible quality difference between photos capturedTwo cameras in the rear side(2MP & 5MP) are uselessSide frame is made of plastic and it is polished to look like anodized metalAMOLED screen inside was very brittleBack side is a fingerprint magnet, so use the phone with atleast its provided TPU caseFront camera cutout takes a good amount of screenNot efficient for a high end game like its competitors.My personal opinion for those who are planning to purchase the phone: if you want a good daily driver with highly efficient RAM, then go for NordIf you want to experience oxygenOS and it's highly customisable UI, then go for NordIf you want a mid range gaming experience and better video viewing quality, then go for NordIf you want a phone that lasts a day and charges quickly for your daily purpose, then go for NordIf you are a high end gamer and need high gaming performance, then don't go for NordIf you want a durable & tough phone, then don't go for Nord, the back and front is made of glass and glass breaksThank you ",

            "answer_text": "Hello There, OnePlus Nord is kind of an all-rounder, woth every specs at par. Design is brilliant.Display is one of the best in the range.Software wise, OxygenOS is again one of the best.Hardware wise, it's at par, Snapdragon 765G is a good Processor, you will not experience any lag even in heavy Gaming, but, still, you will not experience that much power as well, considering the competition offering Snapdragon 855+ amd Kirin 980, which are better than Snapdragon 765G in terms of performance.Camera wise, it's very good, still, misses out a Telephoto zoom camera, which is a basic in this price range, otherwise the cameras are good. But still a zoom camera is a must, which OnePlus has ignored in both OnePlus Nord as well as in OnePlus 8.Battery life is good. 30W fast charging is good as well.Pricing is a bit high, if it would be priced at 22k, it will be of more worth, and also, the variant at 25k offers only 6GB/64GB, which is very less storage considering the price of 25K, you can get 126GB and more with other brand phones.Thanks Edit \u2014 1. Speakers are barely audible. 2. The two of the four cameras, the macro lens and the depth sensor are of no use, the primary camera gives better depth effect than the dedicated depth sensor and it also shots better Macros than the dedicated Macro lens. 3. Built quality is not at all good. Thanks again. ",
