            "answer_text": "Is there an electronic technology like a computer but only for writing? Yes, although that\u2019s like buying a swimming pool and having a water tap installed so that you can have a drink, and not using it for anything else. Ok, forget about the chlorine, the analogy breaks down :) They were called \u201cWord Processors\u201d although there were also devices that looked like a typewriter, but could remember what you typed and replay it. Those were called \u201cMag card typewriters\u201d that recorded what you typed onto a magnetic card, and then you could insert that, and hit a button and retype a page. With a little two line by twenty line window, you could try to retype what was on the page to fix a typo. They are horrible. I purchased half a million dollars or so\u2019s worth of word processors for the Marine Corps, east coast (Second Marine Division) back when all of this stuff was still being figured out for the first time. Those memory typewriters were being shoved down my throat; the computer people in the Marine Corps did an elaborate study and concluded that 90% of the functions that were needed with a real word processor, could be done by a Mag card typewriter; pretty much everything but \u201csearch and replace\u201d which isn\u2019t used that often. It always makes me laugh when people use the \u201cHow often\u201d argument. It\u2019s not about \u201chow often\u201d you need something, it\u2019s \u201cIf ever\u201d. This is what you get if you believe the \u201chow often\u201d argument:  This is just not going to work, any more than trying to use a mag card typewriter to correctly format official correspondence would work. Now, more reasonably, there used to be devices that had small screens, that almost looked like laptops. They had functions to open documents and edit them. They were nearly as expensive as a cheap laptop, but could ONLY do word processing. And, they\u2019re back \u2026 being marketed as \u201cDistraction free writing\u201d.  Freewrite Traveler Here\u2019s the thing - you can buy a cheap laptop for the same amount, get a bigger screen, and just KEEP YOUR MOUSE OFF the other programs - or uninstall them. If you\u2019re relying on technology to keep you distraction free, you\u2019re always going to lose. You\u2019ll turn the TV on, listen to the radio \u201cto get you in the mood\u201d etc. The other problem with word processors aside from the problem of occasionally having to haul something and not be able to (a feature you need), is that they are VERY limited with respect to hardware. That laser printer you have? You may or may not be able to print to it. Email? Nope. The document is stuck on your device. Etc. (there\u2019s always going to be exceptions, but you get my drift). Buy a personal computer - whether it\u2019s Linux, Mac, or Windows, and then you can do anything possible. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, it was called a standalone word processor. The first ones were electromechanical, such as the IBM MT/ST (Magnetic Tape/Selectric Typewriter), released in 1964. This was a model of the IBM Selectric typewriter but built into its own desk, and integrated with magnetic tape recording and playback facilities (25 KB/cassette), with controls and a bank of electrical relays.  The MT/ST automated word wrap, but it had no screen. This device allowed rewriting text that had been written on another tape and you could collaborate (send the tape to another person for them to edit or make a copy). In 1969 the tapes were replaced by magnetic cards. In the early 1970s, word processing became computer-based (although only with single-purpose hardware). Some of these were simply called electronic typewriters, and had a single display line above the keyboard and had limited editing ability:  Others incorporated the newly invented floppy disk. Also in the early 1970s word-processing systems with a CRT screen display editing were designed. An example being the Toshiba JW-10 (1978):  A CRT-based system by Wang Laboratories became one of the most popular systems of the 1970s and early 1980s. The Wang displayed text on a CRT screen, and incorporated virtually every fundamental characteristic of word processors as we know them today. Digital Equipment Corp. even came out with one called the WPS-8, based on their PDP-8 minicomputer family. So these latter systems were actually computers, but users couldn\u2019t run general-purpose software on them. They were relatively expensive, around $10,000. Meanwhile personal computers like the Apple ][ and IBM PC were introduced in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Word processing software became available for these, at a much lower cost than the dedicated machines (I wrote one myself). As a result, the dedicated word-processing industry faded away. ",
