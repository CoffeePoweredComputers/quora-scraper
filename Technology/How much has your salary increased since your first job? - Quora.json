            "answer_text": "Well I also read these questions mostly on quora. I think the intension behind this question is the curiosity about the earning of people in india with considering their age and education and also the position on which they are working currently so that the fresher readers can easily think to choose their path and also it inspires others to grow up more. I don't know whether my story is inspiration or not but I look it as like a healthy and constructive struggle for me.\ud83d\udcb0  So I am going tell about my earnings now. I am working as Senior Product Support Engineer in IT with technical expertise like Oracle , MSSQL, Derby & Mysql DB , Unix & windows OS , Eclipse IDE with basic java knowledge , ETL for translating file's , Server installation like Tomcat , Jboss ,weblogic and other tools like Git , Maven.  Well I am 29 years old and working on all these tools and technologies with basic knowledge of that domain which I mostly earn from Google and colleagues. I am having 4+ years of experience and earning 58K per month excluding other deductions. I am enough happy with my earning but I am looking more than this. At the end of the month I am left with 0 \u20b9 .  My expenses 38k home loan emi + home expenses 10k + savings ( 3k SIP + 5k LIC ) + 2k in others small stuff. We are 4 members ( me, wife , mother & father ) in family so and now I have purchased a new flat so I am happy for that. Having debt of 30 Lakh of home loan.  At this point looking back to 29 years of my life , I have started from paper selling in 2003 to 2005 school days with 500\u20b9 monthly wage then worked with ITI stream people for Airconditioner fitting and repairing in 2005 to 2006 for 1500\u20b9 monthly salary , you can imagine how risky , hard and difficult this work is. Most of the times my team and I used put our life in danger to fit the AC in the taller buildings from out side with carrying 20 Kg AC and heavy drill machines with other stuff . In 2007 I got job in Big Bazaar where I used to weight the vegetables and stick the barcode label on the packing with its price. My salary in big bazar was 3k with 500\u20b9 monthly incentives.  I quit that job due to my 12th study because in big bazar I have to stay there for long hours around 10 to 12 hours which was impacting my study. In 2008 I took admission to bsc computer science and again I started to search job but this time I was searching for a part time job to focus on study also and I got job in a domestic call center for 5 hours a day with 4.5 k in 2009 which I did till Feb 2012. It was telecom call center and I learnt so many things there related to Telecom domain.  I failed in last year of Bcs in 2011 due to 2 subjects ( Advanced Java and Software Engineering ) which I cleared later and I decided to do Post graduation MCA so I took admission for the same in 2012 and started to search job again for full time basis and I got a Job as a sales advisor in Tata Docomo with 10k salary and it was enough good to pay my college fees 55k per year.  MCA syllabus is very much similar to my Bcs study so I submitted the letter in college about I am working with Tata DoCoMo so I will attend lab practicals only. I did job in Tata Docomo outlet for next 2 years till to Aug 2014. Now it was the time for me to do internship somewhere in IT related work. I have searched a lot but not found anywhere. Everywhere there was paid internship so in one small scale company I paid 20k where I get the opportunity to work on live project for next 8 months with 0 salary. I learnt lot many things there about 11g oracle database ( SQL , PLSQL & Admin ) + Unix Shell scripting and many other things. In 2015 I became Post Graduate and received my masters degree of MCA.  In 2015 Aug I got my first IT Job which is with Trigent Software payroll in Cognizant and salary was 10k but we were like on bench employee so I kept searching and got opportunity again like thrid party pay roll in IBM it was very tough job in shifts and salary was 8k and 6 months after I again started for searching and I left IBM with overall 8 months of experience and joined Clover Infotech with salary 15k where I worked for 11 months and left that again and got job in new company HeapTrace at 25k and there I worked for 2 years where my salary raised up to 35k. I had married till then so I decided to switch again and got opportunity with HCL with 53k but I didn't joined as I was having another offer where I am working currently With 58k.  So this how my journey is and still more to achieve.  \ud83c\udfc6 ",
