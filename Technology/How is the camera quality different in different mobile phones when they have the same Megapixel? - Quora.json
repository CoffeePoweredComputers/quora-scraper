            "answer_text": "Several things can affect the quality of the camera besides the megapixel count. The recipe for better photos comes down to the sum of the pieces of the camera. Two of the most important pieces are the lens and the sensor. The Lens. Most photographers I know would agree that you can have an okay camera and take a great photo with the right lens more easily than with an amazing camera and a terrible piece of glass. This comes down to the fact that with the right combination of quality glass (or sapphire), aperture and focal length, you can take a much sharper, well focused image. The lens is what determines how much light can be let in at a time, the material the light travels through before hitting the sensor and how much can be fit into the image based on the zoom of it. To better understand the aperture specifically, because it is the hardest for most people to understand, take a look at this image. It shows how a lower aperture (f1.8) allows more light in at a time than a larger aperture (f8).The Sensor. This is what captures the light of the photo. Think of it as the \u201cdigital film\u201d of the camera. Without film, you have no picture. Light travels through the lens and hits the sensor, which captures the image seen. Larger sensors means larger pixels, larger pixels means more light can be captured, more light captured means a better photo. To better understand this, think of pixels as cups, a table as the sensor and a bucket of water as light. Imagine you have cups (pixels) placed on top of a table (sensor). You want to capture as much water (light) in the cups as you can. The larger the table (sensor), the larger the pixels (cups) you can put onto it, and the more light (water) you can collect.Besides these, each company has their own image processing algorithm. It takes all the information in and applies color balance, exposure adjustments and a myriad of other small tweaks to get what they have determined to be the \u201cbest\u201d image from what the hardware captures.

            "answer_text": "Read till the End. The concept of a camera in its simplistic form consists of a lens, sensor and shutter speed. The lens is used to converge light.sensor is used to capture this converged light.shutter speed is the exposer time of sensor to light.light is a photons. Light reflected from objects of different shapes and colors pass through the lenses and fall on the \u201cSensor\u201d, they are captured, converted into electrical pulses and formed into an image. When you click the shutter button, the shutter opens for a short time, allows photons to fall on the sensor and immediately shuts back again. So when someone says photo was shot with a 1/200 shutter speed, Means, the sensor was exposed to the incoming photons for 1/200th of a second.  There are millions of small units in the sensor, which are mapped to the pixels of the image. The role of each small unit is to capture the photon and convert it into an electrical signal that creates 1 pixel. If there are 1 million of such small units producing each pixel, then we make it a 1 megapixel camera produces 1 megapixel image and so on. The size of an image depends on how many pixels we have (how many small units). But most importantly, the quality and strength of the image depends on how many photons can be captured by each of this small unit.  Here is an interesting illustration to help us understand better. Let's consider an island inhabited by 100 people. Suppose the government releases food from helicopters at constant rates and at constant density for 1 hour which reaches 100 kg of food per day. This way, every person on the island gets 1 kg food which is enough to stay healthy and strong and the island remains prosperous.  Now assume that the same island has been inhabited by 500 people and everything else remains the same. That is, the government releases food from helicopters at constant rates and at constant density for 1 hour which reaches 100 kg of food per day. This way, every person on the island gets only 200 grams of food which is insufficient and thus the people of the island are weak and unhealthy.  The island in the above example can be correlated to a sensor, each person on the island to a pixel on the sensor and the food packets to light photons. Irrespective of the size of the sensor or the number of pixels it has, the rate at which photons fall on the sensor is constant. Just like the above island example, if a sensor is densely packed with pixels, it leads to starvation.  Now assume a 1 sq inch sensor has 1 megapixel (1 million pixels) and it receives 10 million light photons, Means each pixel receives 10 photons i.e 10 signal units. In digital systems, there is always noise introduced at every level which is independent of the incoming signal and depends on factors like interference, power supply, quality of components etc. Assuming that every pixel of the sensor introduces 2 noise units. Thus, we have 10 signal units & 2 noise units and the Signal to Noise ratio is 10/2 = 5. Lets assume the same 1 sq inch sensor is now densely packed with 5 megapixels (5 million pixels). Since the incoming light photons is always constant (10 million photons), each pixel receiving 2 photons. As discussed above, assuming every pixel of the sensor introduces 2 noise units, we have Signal to Noise ratio of 2/2 = 1, which is much lesser than the previous example, causing a distorted, noisy & blur image. In fact, when we pack more pixels in the same sensor, the increase in pixel density actually creates more interference, leading to more noise.  So the thumb-rule is that an increase in megapixel must be accompanied with an increase in sensor size, failing which the sensor pixel size decreases and image quality suffers. But an increase in sensor size is highly challenging because it increases the size of the camera unit (difficult to fit it into a phone) and drastically increases the cost. pixel size, sensor size & aperture are better indicators (and quantifiable factors) of camera quality, they still do not describe the camera\u2019s capabilities perfectly because factors like sensor quality, type of sensor, sensor illumination, noise filters, lens (aperture) quality, number of intermediate lenses, image stabilization cannot be quantified and one has to personally check the end results (or rely on professional reviews or just trust the brand) to come up with any conclusions.
