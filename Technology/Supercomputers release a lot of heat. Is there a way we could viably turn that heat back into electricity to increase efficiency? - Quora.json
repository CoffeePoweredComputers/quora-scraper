            "answer_text": "to a limtied degree yes but because the computer has to be cooled to well\u2026 generally below 100\u00b0C that means the waste heat carrier, be it air or water will be siniicnatly below 100\u00b0C be it 25\u00b0C or 60\u00b0C or whatever but realtive to absoltue temperature that is very ltitel which strictly limits the maximum efficiency you can reach because the tempearture difference btween it and outside temperature is smal lcompred to the difference to absoltue 0 so you could get something like 1/10 of the energy back at best if you build your supercomputer in a cold area (which makes coolign easier anyways) and use the waste for heating houses you might economically save some energy and money ",

            "answer_text": "No. Now legally and logistically probably 100 issues with this, but it would be possible. Now this only works well in the winter and in cold climates. Pipe the heat to all the neighbors houses and heat them for free. Obviously the super computers owners could heat all there other building free. This would at least repurposed some of the waste heat for good reason. ",
