            "answer_text": "How to connect to wifi Wifi is a wireless broadband connection that allows you to connect to the internet without using any cables. It\u2019s particularly popular for use with laptops because they can then be used in any room of the house. Wifi is also available in lots of public places, such as pubs, caf\u00e9s, hotels and even some buses! This guide will help you to understand how to connect your computer to wifi. It\u2019s based on Windows 7, but the procedure is very similar in other versions of Windows and in Mac OS X.   What you\u2019ll need:  a wireless routera computer with a built-in wireless adaptor or a separate adaptor.Follow these step-by-step instructions to connect to wifi Step 1: Set up your wireless router - an example of which is on the right - (see How to connect to the internet for instructions). Most internet providers now supply wireless routers as standard. When setting up one, it\u2019s important to provide appropriate security so that your computer can\u2019t be entered by anyone but you. Instructions for this should be supplied with the router, but if in doubt, consult an expert. Step 2: Check that your computer has a built-in wireless adaptor (see left). Up-to-date laptops generally have one, but most desktop computers don\u2019t. To check whether there\u2019s a built-in adaptor, follow these steps:  Click the Start button.Right-click Computer.Click Properties.Click Device Manager.Click the arrow next to \u2018Network Adaptors\u2019 to see if there\u2019s a wifi adaptor listed.If there is a wifi adaptor, a wifi icon should also appear in the system tray in the bottom right-hand corner of the screen. In Windows 7, it looks like the one on the right.   \u200bIf you don\u2019t have a wireless adaptor, you\u2019ll need to buy one to plug into one of your computer\u2019s USB ports. The adaptor should be supplied complete with instructions on how to use it to connect to a wireless network.  \u200bStep 3: To connect to a wireless network, click the wifi icon. You should now see a list of available networks \u2013 an example is on the left. Step 4: To connect to a network, just click on its name. If it\u2019s a secure network and it\u2019s the first time you\u2019ve used it, you\u2019ll need a password. If it\u2019s your home network, your internet provider will have given you a password \u2013 sometimes it\u2019s printed on a sticker attached to the router.If you\u2019ll be using the same connection regularly, you can tick the box to connect automatically. Step 5: The first time you connect to a network, you\u2019ll be asked to choose whether it\u2019s a home, work or public network. Warning: Be very careful if you connect to unsecured wireless networks such as wifi \u2018hotspots\u2019 in public places. While on them, it\u2019s important not to use websites that require you to enter personal or financial details as other users of the network could gain access to these details. ",

            "answer_text": "Thnx for A2A.First of all check if your wifi network is hidden or not. If it is hidden then you have to follow these steps: Go to \"Network & Sharing Center\" in the Control Panel. Click on \"Set up a new connection or network.\"Select \"Manually connect to a wireless network\" and click or tap \"Next.\" Enter the security information for your network in the spaces provided, as follows:Enter the SSID in the network name field. In the security type field choose the type of security used by the wireless network you want to connect to. Some routers may name this authentication method. Depending on the security type you choose, Windows may or may not ask you to select the encryption type. In the security key field, enter the password used by the wireless network. If you don't want others to see the password you type, check the box that says \"Hide characters\". In order to connect to this network automatically, you should check the box that says \"Start this connection automatically\". You should also check the box that says \"Connect even if the network is not broadcasting\".Once you have entered all the information that was requested from you, press Next. You are notified whether Windows has successfully added the wireless network. Press Close and you are done. If the network is in the area, Windows automatically connects to it. Check your network icon in the system tray.  I hope these steps will help you. ",
