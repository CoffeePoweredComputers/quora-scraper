            "answer_text": "Your question is a little difficult to answer, since answering it only leads to a lot more questions: How far in which direction? On land, or at the sky? When you say modern cameras are you talking about consumer devices or any camera at all? And by what criterion would you want to measure 'far', distance or magnification? If you mean purely in terms of distance, then the Hubble Space Telescope's Wide Field Camera has imaged objects that are at a distance of between 10-15 billion light-years away. There are other imaging devices that have imaged objects even farther away. If you're talking about handheld devices (DSLRs etc.), it  primarily depends on a combination of the resolving power of the lens and the resolution of the recording medium (whether that's an image sensor or film).To put things in perspective though, no modern camera can resolve what the various missions to the moon have left behind on it.  However, Canon did make a 5200mm lens that was capable of taking photographs of objects between 18-32 miles away. You can read about it here:Meet The Canon 5200mm f/14 Tele-Monster - CanonWatch There are other lenses that are capable of reaching a fraction of those distances, such as these: Community Post: The Biggest Lenses The World Has Ever Seen Even so, there are other limitations with technology, optics and inherent problems with recording information. But that would be a whole other topic in itself. ",

            "answer_text": "It's entirely dependent on the lens. True macro lenses will record 1:1 on the camera sensor and some will go 5:1 (5x life size). Add extension tubes or specialty lenses and the actual is much larger. ",
