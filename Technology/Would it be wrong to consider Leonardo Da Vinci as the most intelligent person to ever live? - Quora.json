            "answer_text": "Between Da Vinci, Galileo, Isaac Newton, Nikola Tesla, and Einstein, the difference in IQ may have been only a few negligible points. There is an old legend that Einstein was once asked \u201cHow does it feel to be the smartest man alive?\u201d He responded, \u201cI don\u2019t know, you\u2019ll have to ask Nikola Tesla.\u201d In answer, no, it would not be wrong to consider Leonardo Da Vinci as the most intelligent person who ever lived, but he died in 1519, and had he lived to see the work of his successors, he might be the first person to deny that. With great wisdom also comes great humility! ",

            "answer_text": "It\u2019s hard to measure intelligence in an exact way, especially on people that have been dead for 500 years. It\u2019s also hard to compare peoples achievements when they lived in different eras and parts of the world. So we\u2019re basically left with guessing. With that said, my answer would be no - you wouldn\u2019t be wrong to consider him the most intelligent person to ever live. No one could prove you wrong, and you would have a strong case. Not only is he considered one of the greatest ever in his main area (painting), he was a polymath, eminent in a wide range of subjects (unlike Newton, Einstein, Mozart, Picasso etc). But maybe the best sign of genious is being far ahead of your own time, and it\u2019s in that area Leonardo exceeds the most. ",
