            "answer_text": "Q: What are the advantages of traditional technologies in the modern one? Well, trivially, traditional technologies work and service a need and fulfil the need, otherwise they wouldn\u2019t be traditional. New technologies for the most part aren\u2019t in that they mostly and simply imitate existing technologies and methodologies but do it faster and occasionally better. A completely new paradigm rarely appears. Possibly PayPal might qualify. When I lived in just outside Thaxted in the 90s, and if I did today, I would be interested to see an advanced technology rethatch my roof, though I might use an advanced technology to find someone with the skills to do it.

            "answer_text": "In general modern \u2018digital\u2019 technologies are less fool proof than older ones. I buy paper books, not ebooks, and books don\u2019t need electricity and cannot be easily destroyed by dropping the tool you are using for reading them. If you have older data on paper, it is easy to store and easy to retrieve though it may not be easy to retrieve a lot of data at once. Older computerized data is often unreadable. One can still print from 100 year old negatives. It may take work since contrast can be different but I\u2019ve rigged up a light to print from negatives. The advantage of modern technology is that it is cheap to use. Even when a lot of people used film setting up a darkroom was expensive and making photographs was hard. ",
