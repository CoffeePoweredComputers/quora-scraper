            "answer_text": "Incredibly simple answer.. The format it is recorded in becomes obsolete. For example, prior to the 1950s, sound recorders used magnetic wire to record sound.   Steel wire was used on these reel to reel recorders. And these were in common use at that time. In buisness and for personal use. Key words= That Time. After the fifties magnetic tape was developed and eventually replaced magnetic wire. So, reels of recorded magnetic wire only exist in museums or buried in a dump somewhere, and the few wire players that still work are likewise in museums. And any information recorded on them are impossible to access now. Magnetic tape was used for decades, first reel to reel then 8 track then cassette tape. The invention of the first Walkman player popularised cassette tapes for personal use while 8 track players became standard in cars.    For decades these were in widespread use. The computers shown in 1950s-60s era movies/tv shows used these,  While 8 tracks went into cars\u2026  And cassettes went into a pocket sized player.  But again time and technology made these obsolete\u2026 So while there are still countless numbers of all three magnetic tapes still in existence, the players they were used in have become museum pieces if they still work. And junked when they no longer worked. Now today, it's digital. Mp3 players can record and play and store hundreds of songs. Mp4 players can store and likewise play hundreds of hours of video. But now, obsolescence happens much faster. The keychain digital picture  was the norm a decade ago. Now it is obsolete. Years back I bought my very first mp4 player, which was made by the \u201cEmerson\" company.  It was similar in size to this. Nowadays that player is unusable because the format they used to convert video to player use, is no longer used. Other formats are in common use today. So anything recorded in these older outmoded formats are inaccessible today. The mainstay of the home computer, windows 10, was used for decades. Now it is obsolete and no longer in use. And the information discs that were marketed for use in windows computers decade ago are unusable in today's computers. Their info is unreadable today. All of these have been supplanted by the cellphone in your hand. And tablet PC's and home computers with external drives for information. And cellphones become obsolete in two years or less\u2026 Tablet PC's likewise. And when THAT happens, information is lost. And only a specialist with working museum pieces have a chance of recovering the lost data. ",
