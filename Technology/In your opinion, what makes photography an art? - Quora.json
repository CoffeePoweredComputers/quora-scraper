            "answer_text": "Photography is one of the most complex amalgamation of creativity, emotion, abstraction, analytical skills, motor skills, knowledge of physics and guts as well.  Creativity: It is widely accepted that photography requires creativity and I need not go much into detail over it. Here is an example of creativity:  Emotions: If you want to photograph candid moments & weddings, you must have a good knack of anticipating the micro moments of emotions and capture them immediately. For example, during a wedding, the bride's father usually resists all emotions and tries to remain strong but for a moment he might enter a state of breakdown. This does not last for more than a few seconds and if you are an experienced photographer, you can anticipate or predict it and capture immediately to freeze it forever. Here is an example of one such frozen moment.   Abstraction:  Requires an eye on details and looking at things from unique perspectives to search for patterns and geometric shapes. For example, here is a photograph of a staircase when shot from a certain perspective.   Motor skills: This is very much necessary to shoot action, sports, wildlife etc. For example, here is a panning shot which requires perfect coordination of hand movement & synchronization with the event.   Analytical skills: Photography has technical aspect as well. f-number, aperture, shutter speed and several quantifiable characteristics have to be determined for every shot. Which lens to be used for what kind of shot, whether filters need to be used, whether this requires shallow Depth-of-Field and if yes, what should be the approx aperture. All these must be calculated and determined quickly within a second or two. Otherwise, imagine a wildlife photographer who comes across a Tiger, pulling out a calculator to calculate all these for a minute :)   Knowledge of physics: Involves understanding of how camera works, knowledge of optics, lighting etc. For example, lighting is such an important factor of photography that even if you have the worst camera, you can still manage to get the great shots by using the right lighting. Here is one such \"Challenge\" taken up by a professional photographer to prove it. He shoots an entire fashion show using an iPhone with 3 megapixel camera.     Guts: Yes, if you are doing street photography or journalism, you need guts!! Showing off a shiny new big camera and shooting random people on the street seems fun but you never know how some people might react.   I have just tried to give a brief overview but I think you got the idea. Photography is much more than art. Depending on what you want to photograph, you need one or some or all of the above mentioned qualities and maybe even more if the situation demands. ",

            "answer_text": "Simply put... and I hope this is brief. This is similar to asking why drawing or painting is a form of art. If you were to look at something that a drawing a kindergartener did of their family would you consider it art? If so, then there's you're answer. If not, then there must be some quality and/or value that you find in a piece created by someone that has taken the time to study, refine, and hone their skill to the point that it is worthy of your praise. As a professional photographer, I must admit that in this day and age photography has become so culturally saturated and easy to do that it is easy to discount it as an artistic medium. That being said, just because your phone has a lens attached to it and social media apps give you the ability to MIMIC effects or styles that an actual photographer may utilize does not make these \"snapshots\" art. They are just that, snapshots. Just like a painter composes an image on a canvas or a sculptor chooses a certain material as their medium, the photoagrapher makes many of the same decisions in order to create his or her art. Without getting too technical there are such a vast number of variables that go into getting the perfect shot that it is tantamount to the decisions made when staring at a blank canvas. Just like choosing a brush, the photographer must choose a lens; the focal point must be chosen just as if one were to choose what emphasize in a painting; the way a photograph is lit evokes a certain mood just as the color and line quality of a drawing or painting does. In summation, I feel that most people believe that other forms of art are \"art\" because the artist uses a certain set of tools to produce their work that seem foreign to the average person, whereas taking photograph is a process  that is now so readily accesible to the average joe that most people do not think twice about what actually goes into making a great photograph. Painters use brushes and paints, illustrator use graphite/inks/markers/etc. in order to express the mood, emotion, and feelings that they find within a certain subject matter. The only difference is the tools used to express that vision. Just because a photographer uses a camera instead of a brush or pencil as a means to express their vision doesn't make it any less a form of art than any other means by which an artist chooses to express his or herself.
