            "answer_text": "There's a particular combination of factors. China has a huge population which is poor enough to work for low wages, but educated enough that a huge manufacturing economy can be built. There's excellent infrastructure to provide power and other utilities, as well as to transport goods. A strong government keeps crime rates under control and makes civil unrest uncommon.   Most countries that are poorer than China don't have the social order and infrastructure to manfacture goods. Most countries that are wealthier have strong environmental and worker protections which make manufacturing more expensive. The Chinese government has more or less decided that economic growth is the most important thing. As a result, cities have terrible levels of pollution and workers are treated very badly, but the economy is growing at a tremendous pace. There's also a level of efficiency acheived by having all the factories together. If a company is trying to make a cell phone, for example, they have plants that can make the circuit boards, plants that make screens, plants that make screws and gaskets and cases and wires all next to each other. And since the workers have very few rights, orders can be filled very quickly. If a customer needs a special order filled, they can go out into the worker dorms, wake everyone up and put them on the floor in the middle of the night until the order is filled. All of these factors make Chinese manfacturing very cheap and very efficient, to the point that other countries really can't compete. But it comes at a major price to the workers and their society. The big question is how long this kind of economy can be sustained. ",
