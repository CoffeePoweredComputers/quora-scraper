            "answer_text": "Wireless earphones were around, but Airpods were the first made by Apple. We all know the media attention Apple products get. Especially when it's a new product line. (See: iPhones weren't the first smartphones, but they became more popular than the older ones) (see also: same for iPad).They were one of the first TRULY wireless in-ear earphones on the market.They're trendy, much like the Beats by Dre headphones some years back. They're trendy partly because of the build quality and premium finish, the relatively hefty price tag, and the company that made them. People use them as a fashion accessory too, and that just makes more people curious enough to want to own a pair.3b. Social media made it cool to own Airpods. 4. They're actually good. The sound quality is remarkably better than the earpods and on a par with many mid-level earphones. Using Airpods with an Apple device is an experience others in the industry have struggled to match, and it's mostly thanks to that magical W1 chip. It's smart and seamless. In addition to all this, the Airpods are quite durable. ",

            "answer_text": "Hmm. The freedom of wireless, combined with the reliability of a wire. Yes, AirPods have a SOLID connection between a phone and the AirPods themselves. \u201cThey are easier to lose than normal\u201d Yeah, if you\u2019re clumsy. Ever since i got my AirPods, i haven\u2019t lost a single one. And so do my friends who also own AirPods. If they are easier to lose because they don\u2019t fit your ears, that\u2019s a you thing. AirPods are a \u201cone size fits all\u201d earbud. If they don\u2019t fit you, look for other wireless earbuds (i recommend the Galaxy Buds, but you know, your choice) \u201cThey are harder to use!\u201d I\u2019MMA STOP YOU RIGHT THERE! Are you telling me that a product designed for convenience, is harder to use? Are you telling me that opening the AirPods case, pressing the \u201cConnect\u201d button, and using it, is harder to use?  (neat little battery popup) If you think AirPods are easier to lose, and harder to use (no rhyme intended), you obviously haven\u2019t felt the feeling of wireless freedom. You\u2019ll find they are EASY to use, and you can\u2019t really lose them easily. (unless they don\u2019t fit your ear shape, or you\u2019re clumsy) ",
