I\u2019d never like to draw or sketch on a laptop (as if I could anyway :p) I\u2019d never be able to write programs in an IDE on an iPad or heck, even an android tablet for that matter. Each has its use case and if someone says that xyz is an all-in-one, then there inevitably, will be hidden compromises. I\u2019d never say that an iPad Pro is an all in one. Combined with the magic keyboard, it\u2019s actually heavier than a MacBook Air, and much much more than some chromebooks. I\u2019d never say that the surface Pro X is an all in one. It\u2019s doesn\u2019t even run all the apps they give on the Microsoft Store. The perfect all in one doesn\u2019t exist because it cannot (as of yet) Till then, certain things will be difficult to work on an iPad. And other, on a laptop. ",
