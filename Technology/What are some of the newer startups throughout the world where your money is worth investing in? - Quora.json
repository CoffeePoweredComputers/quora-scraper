            "answer_text": "Google\u2019s driverless delivery startup - I don\u2019t remember its name, sorry. it eliminates labour cost. you can deliver more in a single run. Logistics is a very place to invest your money as you don\u2019t know what product(maybe they can compete with uber eats) could be delivered. So it has a great potential. Currently this one is what makes me think. I\u2019ll edit later if i remember other good companies that are emerging. But if you are a person who isn\u2019t an angel investor or a venture capitalist, you cannot invest in start-ups as these companies are of high risk. They are kept out of reach by SEC(U.S.A\u2019s SEBI counterpart) And Indian Securities Regulator SEBI from hands of common people that don\u2019t have a lot(in millions) of money due to the fact it requires millions of money injections in these companies to grow and we would have nothing to survive if our bucks go away forever. I hope it helps. ",
