            "answer_text": "Taiwan is ahead of China in terms of Technology and Quality. Right now Taiwan is focussing on High End Technology due to its small size and it leads in Semiconductor design and manufacture and stacking. China on the other hand leads in Low and Medium End Manufacture like say a Portable Ultrasound or Portable Sauna or a Massage Chair or a Teddy Bear or a Pencil Sharpener or a Laptop or a Mobile Phone. So if you want to build a $ 10 Million - $ 250 Million Factory to build Mobile Phones or Laptops or Toys etc- China is the best place to do so and gives you the best quality for money. If you want to invest $ 2 Billion in CVX Chip Design or to build a stacked 7 nm Processor technology - Taiwan is the best place to go China is however speedily closing this gap. The Gap is narrower than it was in 2012. China needs another 2 - 4 years to master the manufacture of high quality chips/processors and once that is done - China can deliver at 1/2 the cost of Taiwan and threaten the entire Taiwanese business and way of life.
