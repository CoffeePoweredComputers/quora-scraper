            "answer_text": "There are so many ways you can go with this answer, but I will offer this: It\u2019s killing reading. People can\u2019t read deeply anymore, especially long texts. They are blithely unaware of current events except for the most superficial stuff \u2014 what celebrity wore what, for example. Books? Newspapers? Smart people still read these, but average folks \u2014 who follow the trends of their peers \u2014 avoid them. But they spend hours on sites. And how can they get through a book with push announcements always beeping? Social media has given us all ADD. Yes, I know \u2014 we are reading now. But there\u2019s reading and there\u2019s reading. The latter is what we\u2019re doing less of \u2014 what, to stare at yet another kitten meme? ",
