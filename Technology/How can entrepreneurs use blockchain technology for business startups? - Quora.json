            "answer_text": "Blockchain technology is, beyond question, one of the hottest topics among entrepreneurs worldwide. While it was initially outlined for cryptocurrencies, it has quickly evolved into something of greater significance. Employed in several areas and industries, blockchain tech is successfully opening doors for small, medium, and large businesses. This is the reason why most of the business owners are integrating blockchain development services in their ecosystem. How blockchain technology helps businesses: Secure and Efficient Storage of DataIt's no secret that entrepreneurs need to have easy access to their data anytime and anywhere. Therefore, most of the time, they use cloud platforms. As awesome as this is, it still makes startups depend on a third-party, which is a solid concern when we're talking about highly-confidential data. Well, blockchains manage to make the cloud storage decentralized - meaning that no one can delete or manipulate data. Hallelujah, right? This increases data security and efficiency, as well as cuts down reliance on third parties. Entirely Automated Legal AgreementsEntrepreneurs are certainly familiar with agreements and contracts being delayed due to signatures, approvals, or dependence on lawyers. Frustrating, right? Luckily, several blockchain applications are now successfully replacing or augmenting lawyers, thus allowing startups to manage the legal agreement process entirely automatically. These smart contracts get entrepreneurs rid of the annoying delays, facilitating businesses with well-established terms and clients engage faster and easier. Fundraising EfficientlyStartups are always doing things at a fast pace. And the fundraising process is renowned to be one of the key frictions points in building a company; yet, it tends to become very time, resource, effort, and money consuming. The traditional fundraising journey of venture capitalists can take precious months of traveling, emailing, meetings, events, and so on before you get tangible results. This slows down the high speed required to be established in the market. With blockchain self-verifying systems, this entire process is accelerated by letting venture companies send funds right after they've made the investment decision. It's just a matter of minutes and helps reduce the friction amount in the fundraising funnel as well as speed up all the related actions. No More Time-consuming Background ChecksBefore getting into a new business relationship, entrepreneurs have to check the other party's background in order to verify trust. This also applies to market investors. We're again talking about a lengthy process that requires a bunch of time, numerous contacts, and substantial efforts. Blockchain technology can be used in the process of identity authentication. Verifying previous work positions, job responsibilities, birth certificates, and other mundane (but critical) things make the entire check easier, saving startups a considerable amount of time. Enhanced Capital AccessFinancing their project by raising capital is a huge step for entrepreneurs worldwide. However, in many parts of the Globe, this mechanism is not as easy as entrepreneurs wish. Hidden costs of traditional loans, limited access to modern tools, and certain restrictions are just some of the issues in this scenario. Here is where blockchains can help by giving startup owners the chance of accessing funds not only from their countries but also from different parts of the world. Bitcoin and other digital currencies don't depend on location; hence no hidden exchange amounts are involved. Basically, when transferring cryptocurrencies, no restrictions and international fees are applied. This creates an equal funding opportunity for most entrepreneurs. Improved Supply Chain VerificationWhen it comes to a startup's supply chain, owners often know the vendor they are buying from, but not the vendor's suppliers. This can be a problem when the product fails and the entrepreneurs can't identify the exact culprit. By easy, quick scanning and spotting the point where the issue occurred, blockchain technology helps businesses be aware of aspects such as ethical (or unethical) sourcing, avoid counterfeit items, or make sure that the products and services delivered to customers are meeting all the promises, requirements, and expectations. This is great for all organizations, especially those that are not well-established in the market yet and must build a trustworthy relationship with their customers. Understanding these factors is vital for preventing a negative impact, exposing uncertainties, and empowering businesses. Breaking the Entry BarrierAnother awesome way how blockchain technology helps entrepreneurs and businesses is by creating online marketplaces where transactions are transparent and there's no monopoly control over data access and price. Therefore, competition in the market is increased and the barrier for businesses' entry significantly lowered down. The greatest thing about it is that it leads to the emergence of more novel products and services. Blockchain technology enjoys an ongoing evolution. More and more entrepreneurs start learning about it and familiarize themselves with the way it can help their businesses. Undoubtedly, this innovative technology is allowing both startups and big organizations to grow, easing their way to success. ",
