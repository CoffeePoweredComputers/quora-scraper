            "answer_text": "That depends entirely on what method is used to obtain the Hydrogen (H2). Historically and to the present, almost all commercial production of H2 is obtained by steam reforming of hydrocarbons (especially methane from natural gas). This is a very \u201cdirty\u201d process due to the chemistry, which produces carbon dioxide in the conversion process, plus additional exhaust CO2 due to the high temperature required for the reaction (shown in balanced form): CH4 + 2H2O + heat \u2192 CO2 + 4H2 This is a major reason why H2 has not been developed as a fuel, because there is a significant net energy cost in the cycle. It would be much more efficient just to use the hydrocarbon as a fuel in the first place. Nearly all of the H2 produced by steam reforming is used as a precursor for other important industrial chemicals, perhaps most notably ammonia (NH4), which is used to produce fertilizer. The other primary method of producing H2 is electrolysis, or splitting of water, which is H2O. However, this requires a source of energy, about 50 kiloWatt hours per kilogram of H2 produced from 9 kilograms (9 liters) of water. The only way this works as a sustainable energy cycle is to use some form of renewable energy (or limitless source) for the cycle. Then, the entire cycle looks something like this: Wind Energy + Water \u2192 Hydrogen + Oxygen In a fuel cell: Hydrogen + Oxygen \u2192 Electrical Energy + Water This is a cycle that can be sustained ad infinitum, with zero emissions. In our case, we are commercializing the process of using wind turbines to produce the H2 (and O2 with it), and do it cheaply enough so that the net fuel cost per mile is competitive with gasoline and diesel prices (as of early 2018). We expect this operation, with multiple sites around the US and the world, to grow rapidly over the next several decades. ",

            "answer_text": "Sort of. It turns into water when burnt. (H2O). So in that aspect it\u2019s about as perfect as you can get. However, our current supply is mostly a byproduct of natrual gas production. If we intend to use it in bulk, we will need to spend power splitting water apart. There are already a few places that use excess wind and solar, on windy and sunny days, to make it from sea water. Then they burn it at night. Though you loose a fair bit of energy in the process. So it would be more accurate to think of hydrogen as a clean, but not very efficent, battery rather than a fuel. At least until we developed fusion. ",
