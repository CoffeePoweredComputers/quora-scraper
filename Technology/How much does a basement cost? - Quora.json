            "answer_text": "There is no way to give any sort of accurate cost estimate to that question. There are so many factors to take into account, among which are How big is your basement?What do you want to do (man cave, rec room, additional bathroom, bedroom, in-law apartment, etc)How much of the basement you want to finish (some rooms only or the complete basement including laundry room, store room and so on).How much of the work will be done by professionals? How much do you want to do yourself?If you are going to hire, are you going to be your own general contractor, or will you just dump it in a GC\u2019s lap and let them worry about it?What sort of prep work needs to be done, especially structural and service work (new wiring, additional plumbing, insulation and so on)?What sort of quality materials and workmanship are you expecting (quality costs money)?Are you going to do it all at once, or a bit at a time.Why are you doing this (for your own enjoyment, as an investment, for an easier sell)?I would suggest that you decide what sort of money that you want to spend on the project. Look for an estimate of what it costs to do basement renovations in your local area (in the Toronto, Canada are they are currently running $40-$120 per square foot). You can then talk to a number of general contractors (I suggest three at a minimum) who will give you an idea of what you\u2019ll get for your budget and give you options. (One of the first questions most general contractors will ask you is how much you want to spend) You will then have a much better idea of the costs to renovate you basement than asking such an open ended question here on Quora.

            "answer_text": "$70-100 (CAD or USD) per linear foot of 8'-0\" (2.4m) tall poured concrete wall and footing below. Hopefully including dampproofing, drainage tile (perforated pipe) and gravel around base (don't forget bolts if continuing above with wood-frame!). This describes a situation requiring no special engineering or reinforcing. $4 per square foot of 4\" poured concrete slab (floor) on excavated, undisturbed grade. Don't forget to price-in drains below slab separately and have them installed and inspected beforehand. Also, consider the possibility (or requirement!) of under-slab insulation and/or vapour barriers. An 800 sq. ft. rectilinear foundation structure, including the main items outlined above, would cost an average of $15k. Do expect high- and low-ballers. Now that we are ahead of ourselves, let us not forget to research and price in the cost to prepare a site, excavate, acquire permitting and other planning requirements that will need to be handled first! This price range has scaled well for me, for projects from the 800'-3000' (74m-280m) square footprint range, that I have experienced. And note, this DOES NOT cover the situation described in the second paragraph of Patti Charron's answer - whereby all bets are off! ",
