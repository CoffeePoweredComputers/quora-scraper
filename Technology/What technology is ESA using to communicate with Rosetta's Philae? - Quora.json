            "answer_text": "Radio. The lander Philae has the antennas positionned on top, and as the mothership orbit passes on top of the landing site the information-exchange happens, the orbits of Rosetta are specially designed to maximize these communication windows. Then there's an interesting experiment installed on the lander that sends radio waves through the 67P comet to infer density and mass distribution called CONSERT. The data is then relayed by Rosetta towards Earth where ESA's radio network and NASA's DSN receive the signal, in around 25 minutes. That's the theory, at the moment the lander health status is fully known. It bounced several times then landed in a shadow spot where the solar panels receive insufficient light. Remember this mission was planned 30 years ago when some of the scientists working on the mission weren't even born yet and the challenges are huge. ",
