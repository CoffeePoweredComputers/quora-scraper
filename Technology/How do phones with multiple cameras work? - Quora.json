            "answer_text": "they have a main camera. And different cameras that activate by the user\u2019s will. And some cameras are just supportive modules Let\u2019s say we\u2019re using the note 10+ of Samsung. It has 4 cameras. 3 functional (Wide, Ultra wide, Telephoto) and 1 Supportive ToF (Time of Flight) camera that measures distances and adds with Blur and bokeh. When first launched. 2 cameras are working. Wide and ToF. But let\u2019s say the target is too far away. And for some reason the user can\u2019t get closer (like standing on a balcony) so the user taps on the Telephoto sign. The Wide camera turns off and the Telephoto one activates. In another scenario. Let\u2019s say it\u2019s too close. And they can\u2019t go further (standing by a wall) then the ultrawide camera activates. Turning off the wide one. ",
