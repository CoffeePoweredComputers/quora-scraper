            "answer_text": "It is not applicable here the law 'Bill Gates' kids are Bill Gates' kids'(i don't think  richness and genetics are related) . they are also human beings having their own passion and visions.great job they are done is nothing but born as a kid of world's  richest man.First one Jennifer passionate about horse riding , but i only know there was a time she became one of the most searched names on search engines for the  simple reason that there were splashed some photos of a beautiful young  girl being claimed as the eldest daughter of the wealthiest couple in  the world.  this is the childhood photo of Jennifer with her father   second one is a boy named Rory John Gates he born in  1999 so i don't think he is now in a stage to choose his own passion  and last one girl named phoebe adele. So compared to the general proportion other kids are getting, this is a  paltry sum. In the meantime, they\u2019re just regular kids dealing with  dad\u2019s regular rules\u2014even when it comes to technology. There are no  special privileges. ",
