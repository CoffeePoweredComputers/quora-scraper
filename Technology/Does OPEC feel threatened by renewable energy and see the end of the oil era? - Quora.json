            "answer_text": "So oil and gas producers are generally threatened by renewable energy but also see opportunities from its development. As Craig Lawrence pointed out in his answer, they see a big threat from electrification of transportation. I would add that they also see a threat from electrification of residential, commercial, and industrial heating. The industry, however, is not nearly as aggressive in their opposition to renewable energy as the coal industry. In some cases, in some sectors, their view is fairly nuanced. Firstly, petroleum represents a tiny percentage of global electric generation. Natural gas, however, represents a significant share of global electric generation and residential and commercial heating. OPEC produces about 20% of the world\u2019s natural gas. Here is where stuff gets nuanced.: Natural Gas fed combined cycle generation is the cleanest, lowest carbon form of fossil generation and also the easiest form of fossil generation to ramp in order to deal with variable wind and solar production. Until we develop cheaper, more reliable storage systems or overbuild renewable generation to the same levels as current conventional generation to cover reliability of supply, natural gas is the critical transition technology. So natural gas will stay in high demand for at least two decades. In fact, a transition to electric transportation and/or heating could extend this outlook further. If we have to double or triple the worlds generation resources to move to EV\u2019s, all electric locomotives, and all electric heating, chances are that natural gas generation will continue to have a place in the mix of generation. The other nuanced aspect of all this is this: Oil Wealth just ain\u2019t as stupid as Coal Wealth. The Koch brother\u2019s might think that shoveling out campaign contributions is the way to protect their investment in coal, but at least some of Oil Wealth is looking to invest the money they have made and the money they are making now in the future. The major oil companies have been investing in renewable tech for years and have recently been investing more in this sector. Here is one article covering what some of the majors are doing in this sector: How the 6 major oil companies have invested in renewable energy projects BP and Shell, in particular, have been going whole hog for renewable investments. It is very hard to track what OPEC specifically is doing in this sector because exactly where OPEC wealth goes is pretty clouded. But I can tell you one thing\u2014the number of cold calls from Middle Eastern oil rich countries looking for ways to invest in renewable energy is pretty taxing. Demand for oil as dropped during the pandemic but it has not dropped enough to do real long term damage to the industry. The demand line is still pointed up or flat for the next decade. The life of an oil well is about 20 to 30 years with most of the production in front half of its life. A gas well\u2019s life and production runs about the same. So the horizon for real return on capital investment for the Oil and Gas industry is about 10 years. If demand falls, one thing to do with those returns is to invest them in something with high demand. But the industry knows what is going on and the smart money in the industry is diversifying. Finally, on a point of nuance, about 7\u201313% (depending on year and economic ups and downs) of petroleum production goes to non combustion products\u2014lubricants, insulation, chemical feedstocks, building roads, plastics, etc.. A transition to a low carbon economy will increase demand for some of the most profitable sectors of this market\u2014perhaps by a factor of two to three times current demand over the next three decades. I would be surprised if the oil guys are not thinking about this. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes - OPEC is certainly concerned about the threat of renewable energy reducing the demand for oil. But, it\u2019s not really renewable energy they are worried about - it\u2019s the electrification of transportation. That vast majority of oil is consumed for transportation. As cars, trucks, busses, ships, and planes start to convert to electric, or even hydrogen propulsion - the demand for oil is going to drop. The steep drop in price of renewables will ensure that those electric vehicles will not be charged by fossil fuel generated electricity, and that they hydrogen will not be generated from fossil sources. In this near-future environment, there will still be a demand for oil for a long time, as the various transportation fleets switch over to electricity and hydrogen. And, during that time, it is the low-cost producers (typically OPEC) that will be able to stay in business.
