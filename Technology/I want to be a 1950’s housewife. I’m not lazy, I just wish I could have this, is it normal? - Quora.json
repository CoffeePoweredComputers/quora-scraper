            "answer_text": "If you really wanted to be a 1950\u2019s housewife you would be far from lazy those gal\u2019s worked their asses off because they didn\u2019t have half of the labor saving things we have these days, and the stuff they did have was slow, cumbersome and often required a lot of interaction so you couldn\u2019t just leave it to get on with things while you did the shopping. What I suspect you mean is you want to be a homemaker, a stay at home spouse, and if you and the person you marry are happy with this there\u2019s absolutely nothing wrong with that choice. That\u2019s the point, its YOUR CHOICE no one is forcing you to do it when you would rather be doing something else, that you be able to choose what is best for you is what feminists fought so hard for. And no, just because we have more conveniences to help run a house now still doesn\u2019t mean its a lazy choice washing, cooking, cleaning, laundry, ironing, grocery shopping, home management, household finances etc and that\u2019s before kids come along then you have childcare, homework, feeding, chauffeur, social secretary (they have a lot of appointments), PTA, after school activities etc all while still completing your normal homemaker workload. Its hard but very rewarding work which is unfortunately often under appreciated even by the homemakers own spouse. If you do go down this path make sure your spouse appreciates what you do. I am of course assuming you do actually mean a homemaker with all that entails rather than a spouse who deliberately seeks out a rich partner because they think this means they will never have to lift a hand again, if this is you then you are sorely mistaken, in its own way being a trophy wife can be just as hard work as a traditional homemaker most people who can afford to keep a spouse in such a manner expect a prenup, and it comes with an expiration date just ask any of trumps ex\u2019s ",

            "answer_text": "Lazy??? it\u2019s a life style choice or that Wish of a choice! the fact that the word \u201clazy\u201d comes to your mind is because of the change in society that dictates certain choices and definitions ( how is that a choice if it\u2019s being dictated???) there were values in those \u201c stay at home mother\u201d days that now we have lost to.. money! All the men that come home to a .. tired woman INSTEAD OF a happy smiling wife. All the children that leave the house way too early in the morning only to get to their baby sitter before school starts. All the women who change from soft kind demeanour to harsh masculine ways in order to be able to work and protect themselves in outside work scene. And many many other things we have lost to gain.. a second car, bigger house, more extra curricular activities and all and all. there are of course many pros and cons but my point is: You are entitled to your wishes and feelings and your inclination towards being a housewife\u2026 is very natural and beautiful. BEWARE though that housework is 24/7. no breaks, no bonuses, no vacation time off, no sick days\u2026 people forget how much the loss of intimacy due to tiredness due to outside jobs is effecting their mental and physical health , their marriages and\u2026.
