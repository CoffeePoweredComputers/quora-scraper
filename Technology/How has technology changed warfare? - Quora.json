            "answer_text": "Artillery, naval gun fire, attack helicopters and fighter craft were the next advanced warfare technologies that were used in killing the enemies. Technology has always been the contributing factor to the advancement and development of war equipment's. They played a significant role in the way war was fought. The history of war dates back to the days of early human civilization. Today the arms and ammunition of warfare\u2019s has come a long way from mere use of the spear, bow and arrows to high tech war equipment\u2019s. Advances in technology have led to inventions and usage of nuclear weapons, space weapons, stealth air crafts, missiles, laser-guided weapons, submarines, drones etc. Weapons have over the years evolved and so has the method of using them. In the earlier days a bow and arrow was a common weapon used against to sneak up on the enemy and shoot an arrow in him or throw a spear at him. Soon, armor and shields reduced the effectiveness of bows and arrows which encouraged people to build new warfare equipment\u2019s. Till the nineteen hundreds, soldiers fought in troops where they would do the most damage to the enemy. Later on as guns became a common weapon the troops were equipped with them and deployed in several ranks. A bullet fired from a gun could easily penetrate and kill the enemy. But initially guns like these were pretty inaccurate. Over the period of times the guns improved with time and weapons became more accurate. Soon, Machine guns, grenades and cannon were popular among the troops and were being used in wars. Explosive shells that killed a group became even more common and accurate, creating high level casualties. As the explosive advanced and radius of bombs increased, the military\u2019s become more vulnerable to it. Artillery, naval gun fire, attack helicopters and fighter craft were the next advanced warfare technologies that were used in killing the enemies. Technology has always been the contributing factor to the advancement and development of war equipment\u2019s. They played a significant role in the way war was fought. With ever changing technology and advancement the changes in the means of warfare are even more. Today, technology is becoming more precise and lethal. The cruise missiles, which can strike with pinpoint precision, are now given much importance. The war fare equipment\u2019s built today are so advanced that one cannot even imagine the way wars will be fought in the future. With the increasing number of weapons for mass destruction creating a lot of attention, it has now encouraged the need to develop smaller, faster and more evasive equipment\u2019s to avoid any detection by the enemy. Would not be surprised to see technology that uses satellite weapon with the images and use it to attack individuals on the planets surface. Special images can detect missile silos and transmit their location to attack units. Also developments like remote controlled aircraft could have many advantages. So, even if it is shot down one need not worry about loss of a pilot when using such technology. This can maneuver and probably fight better than an aircraft with a pilot. By developing satellite technology for the means of war fare it will be easier to destroy air crafts and thereby increasing the accuracy available from spy satellites. As warfare move into space, many things could probably change and become more accurate for militants, but at the same time it could increase the potential risk of mass destruction as well. Although all of it is yet theoretic and not put into practice or may be most of it not been perfectly developed, but current technological trends are heading this way. The desire to minimize the risk to friendly forces is leading towards more automation and more advanced weapons. A lot of weapons have change the way battles are fought. As new weapons enter the battle, the battlefield continues to expand. As 21st century warfare continues to evolve, it becomes complex each day. Understanding the way technology has changed warfare and the way it is seen is critical to the wars of the future. ",

            "answer_text": "Technology has made missiles smaller, smarter and they will travel at hypersonic speed, and have the capability to evade the most sophisticated defence systems known to man. And there will be more of them. War has changed yet the concept remains the same. The origins of future wars are already here, being laid in policies and ambitions, rivalries and resources, greed and grievances. The technologies that will be used to dominate and destroy are already in use or in development. They will bring more conflict to cities, where casualties will multiply one hundred fold, compared to Nagasaki. There will be greater terror, chaos and fear. War is always ruthless, but it\u2019s going to become much worse. While men still have the ability to press a button and release destruction on the world, the world will never be safe. Proxy and civil wars will continue to flourish, as will conflicts on the edge of power blocs. The danger of inadvertent escalation is high. We have already survived numerous accidents with nuclear weapons, but eventually our luck will run out, and when it does, cities will likely become ground zero. The world\u2019s city-dwelling population exploded dramatically on the last 10 years and according to the United Nations will increase by another 10 billion by 2050. To dominate a nation has come to mean dominating its population centre and while we have the capacity to do so none of us are safe. ",
