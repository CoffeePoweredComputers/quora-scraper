            "answer_text": "R.I.T. Has one of the very best Job Placement rates after graduating. They are mostly known for G.C.C.I.S., which is the Gollisono College of Computing and Information Sciences. When I graduated I already had a full-time offer for the company I had started working for my senior year. The best thing about RIT is the co-op program. I didn\u2019t realize how much I really learned at RIT until after I tried to hire an intern at my company. Other colleges seem to focus more on parties or just getting you ready to live by yourself, but at RIT I learned fundamentals that are required for my every day job. Most of this I learned outside of the classroom, because the people that make it into RIT are among the most brilliant and dedicated you\u2019ll find. Get yourself into a Special Interest House like CSH and you\u2019ll learn more than you will the rest of your life. Another fun little story, right after I was accepted to RIT my dad was bragging to someone from his work about me getting in. Someone overheard him and pulled him aside and gave him his card and told him to have me give him a call after my first year when I needed a co-op (paid internship). He worked for Lockeed Martin and had a few RIT grads that were his smartest employees. You\u2019ll find lots of those \u201coh you\u2019re graduating with an SE/CS degree from RIT? When can you start?\u201d RIT isn\u2019t better at everything, the math and lit classes are less than perfect, but for the high-tech stuff it\u2019s the best in the business. It\u2019s well worth attending but only if you dedicate yourself to learning. The weather is crappy and the social life is hard to find, leading to a pretty high drop-out rate, but if you can make it the real world is a breeze afterwards. ",
