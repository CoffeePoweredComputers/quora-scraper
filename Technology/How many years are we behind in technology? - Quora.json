            "answer_text": "So, you ask if we are \u201cyears behind in technology\u201d. If you are in the USA, in general we are pretty much up to date. There are technologies where we are very much in the lead, and some we need to get up to speed on. The driver for most technologies is actually military in nature. The US lost a lot of our leadership when the \u201ccold war\u201d ending \u201cdividend\u201d was taken. We failed to continue research and advancement and sat on our laurels. The same thing when we all but stopped our space development after we completed our lunar missions. Then we let the \u201cnew friends\u201d from Russia and China come over to be trained, and allowed them as h1b visas work in critical industries to steal out existing technologies. They took those technologies and continued development, where we just sat around and worried about societal \u201cjustice\u201d, and went into \u201cself evaluation mode\u201d. Fortunately, we are starting to catch up again. That being said we still did some research and engineering advancement, and did a lot in the electronics areas. So we do lead in areas. ",

            "answer_text": "Most high technology begins with military purpose. It takes around 10~20 years for the products coming from military research & development to be available in normal business market. Internet or GPS is a good example. Originally they were excusively developed for military use only, but nowadays everyone can use them with their smartphones in daily life. It must take time not only because it needs to be kept as secret, but also the whole society needs to build social and economic infrastructure to widely distribute the high technology to people. ",
