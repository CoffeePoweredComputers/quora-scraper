            "answer_text": "Gas powered? If we\u2019re talking about petrol/gasoline and diesel (as your profile says you\u2019re from London), then many countries including the UK have already enacted legislation banning new sales of petrol and diesel vehicles for that year and did so with confidence. Bills were passed mostly after or before several UN Climate Change Conferences this past decade. Petrol and diesel car sales ban brought forward to 2035 If you\u2019re referring to the US then only two states out of 50 have put legislation forward at the state level; California and New Jersey. At the federal level? \u201cOregon Sen. Jeff Merkley and California Rep. Mark Levin have introduced legislation that would require 50% of sales for new passenger vehicles to be zero emission vehicles (ZEVs) by 2025 and end U.S. sales of new gasoline-powered vehicles by 2035, while boosting the market for battery electric vehicles and hydrogen fuel cell vehicles.\u201d New Legislation Calls for Gasoline-Powered Car Ban by 2035 I think it\u2019s a great step forward to attaining net zero carbon emissions by 2050. Not really confident the US can do it on a federal level but if they enact it state-by-state then it leaves attainable goals for each region and not just a blanket ban that would be impossible to follow for less affluent and less environmentally conscious states.

            "answer_text": "From an environmental stand point it is a move in the right direction. From the stand point of someone who lives in the state with the highest taxation in the nation. I have to ask \u201cWho\u2019s going to pay for this?\u201d there is a huge cost in infrastructure that has to be made to achieve this. We continue to give the extremely wealthy and corporations tax breaks and bust the middle classes balls with taxes. We give the wealthiest people tax loopholes that a semi truck has no problem driving through and eliminate virtually every tax loophole for the working classes. So I have to ask Joe Biden and Gavin Newsome. WHO IS GOING TO PAY THE BILL?! ",
