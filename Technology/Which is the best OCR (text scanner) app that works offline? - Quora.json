            "answer_text": "Hello, You can use Accurascan, a free OCR scanning app available for a trial version. This light-weight app is available for both Android and iOS devices. As it works completely offline, you can be assured of no virus or malware attack. Also, the best thing about the app is that it scans in real-time at a terrific speed. However, if you need an OCR scanning app to meet your business needs, it is advisable to go for its SDK/API which is available for both mobile and web platforms. In short, with the help of Accurascan's web SDK/API, you can integrate Accurascan with any existing app or customize it effortlessly to meet your specific scanning needs. Hope this helps you.
