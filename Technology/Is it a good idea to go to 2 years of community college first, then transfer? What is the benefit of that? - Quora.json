            "answer_text": "It is a much easier path to being accepted to a 4 year college since transfer from a 2 year to a 4 year college is ever so much easier, in terms of GPA requirement, than going directly from high school to a 4 year college. If your high school grades are excellent and you don\u2019t need the closer attention the community college affords (the professors at a community college are there to teach while most 4 year colleges hire professors to do research but give them teaching responsibilities as well), then do go directly to a 4 year college. The pace is faster, it is much more competitive, and it is more expensive, remember, though, to go directly to a 4 year college. ",

            "answer_text": "Attending a community college for two years and then transferring to a four-year university is the best option for many people. The main benefits are: Tuition is far less expensive at community colleges.Community colleges tend to be smaller and to offer more educational support services.If you did not perform well in high school, may be a path to enrolling in a higher ranked university than you would have been able to gain admission to if you had enrolled in a four-year university straight out of high school.",
