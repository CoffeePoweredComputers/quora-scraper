            "answer_text": "Find out the chipset and GPU built in; consider also that you might not want to unsolder and resolder a BGA CPU to put the replacement in, and see if there are any reasons the CPU would not be compatible with the available BIOS/uEFI and chipset (e.g. it's a Phi Xeon that can hit 380W the laptop will never be able to supply and sink, plus the pinout's pretty different.)  On the notion it looks good to go, perhaps get a few extra hints on doing it neatly at e.g. The Free Repair Manual who sell tools like triwing screwdrivers and heatsink grease, and otherwise enjoy the concordance of others who have gone before you.
