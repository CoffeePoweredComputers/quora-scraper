            "answer_text": "I started my venture into *NIX on FreeBSD 2.2.1 back in \u201997. Was a wonderful time, it was back in the days where you made your own kernel with just the drivers you needed and spent hours adjusting your X window config to fit your CRT monitor and graphics cards exact specifications. But after three years and two computers I started at my second job and got to run whatever OS I wanted, so I installed FreeBSD to the admins delight, the rest of the guys ran Linux. But my editor of choice that I\u2019ve been running the past year had just a linux version and not a FreeBSD one at that point, and after a test running it on the server piping the output to my terminal, I gave up and installed Linux. Oh well, twenty years later I still isn\u2019t running FreeBSD on my computer again but you got FreeNAS and my game console is a PS4 which runs a FreeBSD based OS. I don\u2019t think the use of FreeBSD elsewhere have gone down. They were in a bit of legal battle in a critical era of the web my recollection is correct, if not it would probably have been the household choice for webservers instead of Linux. Oh well. ",

            "answer_text": "Hmmm\u2026 How can I put this? I\u2019m a big fan of FreeBSD. I think that it\u2019s a complete pity and to the detriment of the human race that Linux became popular and FreeBSD did not. For FreeBSD to be on the way out that implies that\u2019s somehow \u201cin\u201d. Despite my love for FreeBSD, I have to admit that it is not \u201cin\u201d. It has never been \u201cin\u201d and almost certainly will never be \u201cin\u201d. Linux has too much market share and too much momentum. Short of some colossal and intransigent gaff on the part of the Linux crowd, that\u2019s just not changing. It seems very likely that FreeBSD will continue to putter along in its current niche, helping out the folks that need it. Will it expire completely? Not likely anytime soon. Too many old fogies like me prefer it. ",
