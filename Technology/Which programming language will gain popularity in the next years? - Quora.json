            "answer_text": "Typescript or next-generation JavascriptRustPersonally, I see no functional language gaining necessary momentum. I am afraid that F#, Clojure or Scala are not going to kill their mainstream counterparts. Let's face it. Nobody really cares for functional languages except for functional propagandists and apostles. They are completely different from what your average programmer expects from a C-like language. Even in the C# world was LINQ adoption pretty slow as far as I know and LINQ is a functional concept which was secretly put in completely different language saying not a word about functional programming because such a word could have discouraged happy OOP-only developers. Just imagine your standard Java guy learning Clojure! Not a chance! I saw plenty of Javists writing Python with absolutely no understanding there is a subtle paradigmatic shift. And with Python being quite C-like what the results would be with Clojure that came from LISP? Personally, I dont like Java or C# much, but they are not bad languages. Therefore I would bet on changes in C/C++ and Javascript world. With Javascript which was never intended for bigger projects (not mentioning its not-well-thought design) and terribly obsolete C/C++ I would hope for quick adoption of Typescript (or new ECMA standard) while the Rust might be your silver bullet for anything else. Saying that I am not that naive to really believe in it. You know the Rust is really complex languages with a cool design. But it is complex (not complicated as C++ is) and a new kid on the block meaning the tooling and libraries are probably not good enough. In fact, I don't expect big changes except for PHP to die and R, Swift to rise. I omitted Kotlin and Go because I dont know what to think about them. Honestly, I don't see their purpose. ",

            "answer_text": "Gain popularity? That is quite difficult to predict since the most popular languages are the ones that gain the most popularity in numbers. So to answer your question I will list out the ones that I believe will stay popular or have a good percentile growth in users: SQL - In the modern world, data is key. If you and your business collect and analyses data efficiently, big decisions will be much easier to make. Effective data analysis can inform marketing, operation, and strategy decisions and SQL remains the most popular way to store and analyse this data.Python - Python is very popular when it comes to the Sciences, particularly within data analysis fields. It is relatively simple to write a new scientific program using Python. This makes it a must-learn language for people like researchers and lab assistants.Kotlin - Kotlin was developed as an alternative to Java. It addresses several issues inherent with the Java language and is starting to become the language of choice for many large Android teams. Some of the most attractive features of the Kotlin language include: It\u2019s concise, safe, and user-friendly.PHP - PHP is like the language of the internet. PHP has made the list of the top programming languages due to one single fact \u2013 it is everywhere! Over 80% of websites use at least some PHP code as part of either their back or front-end design, which means that there will be work for PHP developers long into the future.Solidity - This is a wild horse nominee as it has received huge popularity in the recent years mainly for its blockchain use. Solidity is used to write smart contracts that can be executed on the Ethereum blockchain. As blockchain technology is adopted at an increasing rate, the demand for Solidity developers is expected to increase exponentially. But it isn\u2019t a great choice for your first programming language as the crypto world is really unstable.That\u2019s all for my list. I believe that these 5 languages will continue to grow massively in 2020, but the list is not complete. As I am not an expert in programming(sad, but true) I would rather recommend you read this article that I found and based my answer from: Top Programming Languages: Get The Top 10 Programming Languages 2020. And if you feel that my answer is incorrect or has some unclear information, please let me know. Dylan ",
