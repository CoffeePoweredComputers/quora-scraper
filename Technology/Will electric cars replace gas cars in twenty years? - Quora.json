            "answer_text": "In the U.S. in twenty years I'd expect electric cars to be somewhere between 20% and 40% of the cars on the road. I'd expect a good proportion of families to own one electric and one ICE vehicle. I'd expect new vehicles to be about half and half. Things that slow complete adoption of electric cars are. Age of our fleet. The median age is 12 years. That means if every car from here onward was electric, 12 years from now our fleet would be half electric and half ICE. We aren't even close to that sales mark.Range. This is improving and in someways this makes it worse. Why would a person buy an electric car now to keep for 6 or 7 years if they are going to be much better in 3 years. When I lived in San Antonio it was over 40 miles to the other side of the city. A car with a 150 mile range is marginal in that situation and I basically end up back at home with a car that's not useable until I recharge it. With an ICE car I can solve the refuel problem in 10 minutes max.Charging infrastructure. A lot of people live in apartments, houses with on street parking, mobile home courts and a bunch of other situations that aren't going to allow them to install a good charger. Until there are a lot of electric cars landlords have no incentive to install charging stations unless they can charge more. I suspect in some cases a lot more. There may come a time when chargers are mandated by code, but that is going to take a lot of political capital to make happen in a lot of places. In fact in many ruralish places there really isn't a structure to mandate it. For a while I had a San Antonio address but lived in an unincorporated part of Bexar county. The city had a little control over building but not much.What I'm going to call the bullshit factor that doesn't necessarily come from the electric car industry but they are certainly a \u201cvictim\u201d of it. People know that at least in the past EPA mileage figures weren't what they could count on. CFLs and later LEDs weren't as bright and last no were as long as they said they would and a bunch of similar things. People don't trust the range figures.",

            "answer_text": "I find it hilarious that people can tell the future because their car is electric and they got the money to get one along with installing a charger that can recharge as quickly as 20 minutes. I dont have the ability to charge an EV even at level 1 because the outlets in the garage only will work with power tools and fans. Anything beyond that you trip the circuit breaker and let's face it, you dont want to start an electrical fire by plugging in something that is unsafe. Itll cost me $3,000 or more to upgrade my wiring or I can buy a new gas Honda Civic for under $25k and not worry about the wiring as I wont need to do anything with it. In my opinion even in China and Europe the EV market will stagnate at around 30% of car sales would be EV and the rest would be combustion engine vehicles. Why, because no matter what EVs has limitations. EV owners think they are superior but gas cars drive further, can be refueled to full capacity every time, only use 15% or less additional fuel in the winter, takes 5 minutes to refuel.. ..but the arguments continue which is really better. Supposedly EVs are cheaper to maintain, you charge overnight, you don't drive over 30 miles a day and you'll be stopping every 3 hours sitting for 30 or more minutes to rest anyways on road trips. But the reality is if EVs are so great there would be no need for countries to outright make bans of new combustion engine sales when 99% are still buying new gas vehicles. So no I don't think EVs will replace gas anytime soon. ",

            "answer_text": "No, but it\u2019s possible that there will be more of them than gas cars. Electric cars aren\u2019t the end-all in transportation; they\u2019re a third option, next to gas and diesel. They\u2019ll meet the needs of 80\u201390% of owner requirements, but there\u2019s still that 10\u201320% it won\u2019t. Commuter cars will skew toward electric. Cars that are heavily driven over long distances will stay gasoline - I know every EV owner likes to rationalize how \u201cgreat\u201d it is to take a 30\u201390 minute break from driving a long trip while waiting for charging, but the reality is that\u2019s a trade-off that many users aren\u2019t willing to make (myself included - I wouldn\u2019t use my EV for a long road trip, period). Heavy trucks will still primarily use diesel. Diesel is more energy dense than any battery that exists, and \u201ctime is money\u201d in the trucking business - if your wheels aren\u2019t turning, you aren\u2019t getting paid. The Tesla and Nikola semi trucks have too short of a range and take too long to charge to be viable for long hauls. If charge times improve (to, say, the 5\u201310 minute range) or battery swaps become the standard, this will change and EV\u2019s will likely replace gas vehicles. As for diesel, I predict we\u2019ll still have diesel vehicles on the road 100 years from now. ",

            "answer_text": "Eventually, the EV will replace the internal combustion powered vehicle for a few reasons. Foremost will be the appreciable effect on pollution, specifically greenhouse gasses overall and so called \u201cpoint of source\u201d pollution which refers to the immediate emissions from the vehicle and the net improvement in air quality for the individual, especially in regions where there are a high concentrations of traffic. Another less obvious benefit will be a reduction in noise pollution. Next would be tangible improvements in efficiency, cost and performance which is something that has value to the people purchasing the vehicle. Since EVs are more efficient at converting fuel into power and power into motion the end user enjoys a reduction in driving costs. This is also compounded by the less complex more reliable drivetrains requiring less maintenance and due to the way electric motors generate power and the packaging advantages inherent in small motors with the low placement of batteries over their ICE powered counterparts. Finally there will also be a substantial benefit to EV manufacturers since EVs will have considerable value to the consumer and are cheaper to produce compared to ICE vehicles which will translate into more profit for vehicle manufacturers since consumers comparatively are willing to pay more for an EV product when comparing profit margins on vehicles. For example the typical ICE powered vehicle after all investment is included (design and manufacture) the typical profit margin is between 4 and 7% and can be as low as 1%. On the other hand Tesla maintains they see as much as a 30% margin on their various vehicles which is a very substantial increase over ICE vehicles and that includes a less efficient operation. If Tesla can achieve economies of scale comparable to a traditional vehicle manufacturer that profit margin could increase substantially. When will it happen? Hard to say but I suspect the tipping point will be much like cigarette smoking where it will become largely unacceptable to own and operate an ICE vehicle both due to shifting social attitudes and some government intervention coupled. Along the way people will simply be sold on the inherent advantages of the EV product (which of course is another discussion altogether since vehicle consumers more than any other are so called \u201cbench racers\u201d where perceived performance advantages which largely translate into illegal and reckless driving have merit). Now in the interest of fairness I have to admit I\u2019m one of the knuckle draggers. I love my internal combustion powered vehicles specifically in a rear wheel drive format hooked to a manual transmission. For me the EV is the antithesis of all I hold dear when it comes to driving since I love the interaction with the vehicle but I\u2019m fine with the future since like horses, wagons, sail boats, camping, bolt-action and black powder rifles there will be a place for anachronisms like me. Probably on a road course and a quarter mile track with alcohol for fuel (refineries will eventually give way to solar and wind farms so petroleum will become increasingly rare and expensive and oil will move to other sources for profit but alcohol will always have a place) but there none the less. And while being an admitted luddite I can\u2019t deny the mostly positive effect EVs will have for the future as we approach a planet filled with eleven billion people and to be frank I came along at a good time. Old enough to remember both golden ages of internal combustion engine performance and having the space and freedom to use them mostly without the increasing social stigma as we go through a generational change and social values change. Not a bad trade indeed since by the time ICE vehicles almost solely become the province of the 1% I\u2019ll be mostly too old to drive anyway and besides I\u2019ll either have my autonomous EV people pod or order up transportation from an autonomous ride hailing service by the time that happens anyway.

            "answer_text": "Will electric cars replace gas cars in twenty years? Yes. Without a doubt or at least certtainly in new car sales. The UK and other European countries have said all new cars will be at least hybrid by 2040. But as battery range in plug-in-hybrids increases, people will see the engine being used less. Then they will be annoyed by the expensive servicing cost for the engine that is only used rarely. Also as engines are used less - liquid fuel is used less, so the fuel filling stations start to close down - so you get range anxiety in an engine car. I heard only last week, that Porsche are going 100% electric in all cars by 2030. Now here\u2019s the thing - I often ride my bicycle in the evening. When the air is clean, you can really smell when a car goes past - and its worse when its a diesel. And yes VW-Audi cars do seem to smell worse. When people get used to breathing clean air, they will start getting pissed at people driving stinky old engines cars down their street. ",

There will need to be an enormous transformation of our infrastructure to support this move. Think of how many gas stations you see on your drive to work every day? You will need the same number, if not more, of charging stations to support the move to EV. Additionally, companies will start incentivizing ICE cars towards the end to make them very attractive to drive, the nations of OPEC will likely greatly reduce the cost per barrel because without huge markets like the US their primary export will disappear. Supply and Demand principles will be very interesting to see at work during this transition.

But in the industrial areas such as heavy trucking (semis.) and mid size trucking ( pickup trucks/ delivery vans etc.) that a larger percentage will still be ICE powered vehicles\u2026UNLESS.. there is a radical change in the design of battery power density (where batteries get smaller/lighter for the amount of power they produce) and at the same time a reduction in price per watt/hour of these batteries, with a equivalent / better life expectancy and safety (not going to blow up etc.)\u2026.If this happens, and I will not be surprised if it does, then my opinions on the above will change leaning more towards \u2018yes\u2019 for heavy and mid size commercial vehicles\u2026.

Reasons: Price: everything depends on price. if it\u2019s cheaper people will buy it. Maintenance cost: less maintenance, less moving parts, less hasle. Refueling: You might laugh at this one. But think about it, why do we need gas stations ? Because you can\u2019t produce your own gas or diesel at home. They have become prevalent and convenient because they are everywhere. You never worry about not finding a gas bar. Now, in 10 years, when the fleet is reduced to half its size. What do you think will happen ? Gas stations will become scarce, most will close. People are going into growing businesses, not dying ones. Try running around finding a gas station because you can\u2019t charge at home. Now range anxiety has switched side. Anyways, watch Tony Seba\u2019s videos to understand the big picture. ",

Just imagine how much quicker than charging your batteries or even than pumping fuel it would be to swap your depleted battery for a freshly charged and tested one. Slide or drop out the dead bank and slide in the fresh bank. Done. I'd write the cheque myself to develop this program if I could. But instead we'll all keep burning fossil fuels while engineers attempt to conquer Ohm\u2019s Law with current technology. I say use the tech we have now to develop swapping stations. Then work on producing longer lasting, faster charging batteries while converting millions of drivers to electric almost overnight. That's the only way I'd personally replace all my internal combustion powered vehicles with electric. ",

            "answer_text": "I will begin by using history. When WWII began for the U.S. virtually all railroad locomotives in the country were steam powered. But there were some diesel-electrics mostly used for luxury passenger service. Twenty years later the last of the steam engines in service were being celebrated as they were replaced with the more efficient, easier to service and run Diesel-electric engines. Nostalgia for the age of steam still runs strong, especially amongst my generation, born during the war years, but now the nostalgic railroad enthusiasts include the early diesel-electrics. I think the other commenter here have not considered what the electric car is becoming today. Just a better type of car. There will be efforts to save the more iconic ICE types as collectables, but with the fast improving EV\u2019s and self driving becoming common, the paradigm shift going up at a non-linear rate is nearly upon us.

And you won\u2019t find anyone willing to pay more for an inferior vehicle. It will probably take another 5 years after that for all type of vehicles up to and including large SUVs to be available in all electric with acceptable range. Now cars last a long time, so you will see SOME gas cars that are bought between 5\u201310 years from now still on the road 10\u201315 years later, but 20 years from now I would estimate that fewer than 20\u201325% of the cars you see on the road (in the US and Europe at least) will be internal combustion.

Users are just not aware of how beneficial it is to use an electric vehicle over a gas guzzler. As the person who uses one, I can certify that the cost of maintenance is less than 10% of that of an internal combustion engine. The number of moving parts are 1/20th compared to that of an internal combustion engine. The only part that really requires thinking over would be the battery. It will give up on you in 5 years. but the amount have saved on petrol or diesel over the five years is more than compensating for the cost of a new battery. Consider this. I spend rupees 65 to fully charge my electric car, which is less than a litre of petrol. My mileage is 120 km. My cost of running is 65 / 120. Which works out to ~ 50ps per km. It is the best solution for in city commuting. Range again is a concern for long distance usage. but I believe business companies will get into the mode of looking for recharge points or battery exchange points to overcome this fallacy. in fact I think there is a big market for battery recharge points or battery exchange points.
