            "answer_text": "Artificial intelligence affects every individual's life, and this changes mushrooms from commercial enterprises and non-commercial organizations. Before delving into the future of Artificial Intelligence and what it means for enterprises, it is imperative for businesses to leverage the full potential of artificial intelligence in their day-to-day business processes. Let's now understand the major upcoming trends of artificial intelligence of 2020 and beyond. Major Upcoming Trends of Artificial Intelligence to look out for Here are the top 6 trends you need to keep an eye out for. 1. RPA will streamline business processes  While right now, most robotic systems deployed in the workplace help employees automate simple tasks such as manufacturing, packaging, and production lines. More advanced software-based robots take on the high-frequency, repetitive, and relatively more complex jobs that employees administer on computers like getting forms filled, storing them, analyzing their data, and generating reports. Robotic process automation right now frees us from the monotonicity of menial and time-consuming but essential administrative work. Therefore, it allows your workforce to indulge in more complex, strategic, creative, and interpersonal tasks. In the future, enterprises that already use RPA will look for more ways to leverage these tools to enhance their business processes. This will replace the traditional practice of outsourcing operational tasks to less expensive off-shore locations by several in-house robots. In-house robot developers can also be put in place to design and deploy robotic intelligence as and when needed. This futuristic practice is called Robosourcing, wherein businesses will be outsourcing tasks to robots to help improve in enhancing their business processes and also employees' satisfaction and efficacy. 2. Hyper-customization on the customer end AI-powered recommender algorithms (e.g., Amazon's \"Customers who bought this item also bought\" and Netflix's recommended programming) is something consumers are becoming quite accustomed to. And it's good for business, too. AI will enable businesses to serve up the right content to the right people at the right time based on what they've consumed, inquired for in the past, or their demographics. Take an example of Netflix, the leading entertainment streaming platform. Once logged in to your account, you receive relevant recommendations on what to consume next. Those recommendations are based on your behavior on the platform, like what genre of shows you previously watched, etc. When you choose to see the suggestions or don't, the machine learns your pattern and better understands your behavior. Artificial intelligence through ML can also help enterprises to serve their site visitors with brand's content like articles, blog posts, videos, ebooks, or other types of content that they might enjoy or need next, based on how they've interacted with the brand in the past. In the future, this personalization will be more sophisticated, allowing businesses to deliver tailored customer experiences to everyone. 3. AI will process computer simulations to give precise decisions  The quality of information available on customer trends, demand and supply of a product or service, and the past, present, and future market trajectory directly affects an enterprise and its operations. Cognitive AI helps in gathering this data and allowing businesses to make data-driven decisions. This data processing requires real-world interactions. But, as the methods of simulating real-world processes and mechanisms in digital forms are now improving, access to accurate data is easier than ever. For instance, Car manufacturers can gain thousands of hours of driving data without vehicles, even leaving the lab with the help of advanced simulations. This leads to big cuts in manufacturing costs. It also gives precise reports on desired variables as there is an increase in the quality and quantity of data possible for gathering. When AI enables computers to be robust and accurate-enough with data, it is possible to create many digital world simulations. This also helps mitigate the risks of expense and danger of testing AI systems in the real world. In near future, we will see an increase in the accuracy and availability of real-world simulations, which will help AI give more robust and accurate business decisions. 4. Repurposing of all software and hardware  AI will seep deeper into the day-to-day lives of humans. This will be partly because the hardware and expertise needed to deploy AI become cheaper and more available in the future. AI will, therefore, be used more across all kinds of tools, gadgets, and devices. Right now, we are already using AI to make our mobile apps smarter and efficient. These apps give us AI-powered predictions on our computers, phones, and watches, apps that help you measure your things in real-time, and apps that automatically recognizes faces and sorts photos accordingly in your phone's gallery. In the coming years, as the cost of hardware and software continues to fall, AI will be used to empower day-to-day complex devices like automobiles, household appliances, and workplace tools. Technology such as augmented reality and virtual reality display and paradigms like the cloud and Internet of Things sounds like SciFi but will become a reality in the near future. In the future, we will see a lot of devices of every shape and size that will start to think and learn for themselves. 5. AI and Human Intelligence to make a better team Contrary to the common idea that AI will replace human jobs and make human employees obsolete, AI strengthens the capacity of every social employee, by helping them do better complex tasks and giving them adequate data. All devices capture of processing large volumes of data. They capture every transaction, every customer gesture, every micro- and macroeconomic indicator, and all the other information to help make better decisions. In the future, this data-rich environment will grow, and AI will help enterprises scrutinize all these data and create workflows for employees to digest. IT departments will have a flow of information using machines (databases, distributed file systems, and the like). AI will break these massive volumes of data down to small summaries for human consumption. Humans will then process these summaries using tools like spreadsheets, dashboards, and analytics applications and supplemented with human logic and other info. This is highly processed, and now manageably small data is presented for decision-making, which can be known as the \"data-driven\" workflow. Even in the future, human judgment would still be the central processor; only now, it would be using summarized data as a new input. 6. A paradigm shift in the entertainment domain  Entertainment is a way of stimulating oneself. It also creates a portal for humans to indulge in different realities. AI helps entertainment providers to create new realities efficiently. There always have been news making rounds that AI-generated music, poetry, or storytelling is now likely as good as humans. But there is still some way to go until their output is as enjoyable to us as the best that humans can produce. However, it is not possible to undermine the influence of AI on entertainment media. This year we saw acclaimed director Robert De Niro de-aged in front of our eyes with AI's assistance, in Martin Scorsese's epic The Irishman, and the use of AI in creating brand new visual effects and trickery is likely to become increasingly common. Some months ago, Netflix released the first-ever interactive show Bandersnatch, where viewers could interact with and control the storyline. Moreover, in video games, AI will be used to create futuristic scenarios and human-like characters for players. AI will also help players to adjust gameplay and difficulty, so players have a tailored and immersive experience within a single game. AI is also taking a quantum leap in terms of entertainment and gaming with augmented reality and virtual reality. Conclusion Artificial intelligence is not going to make human intelligence obsolete, but it will make things easier for everyone involved from big businesses to a single consumer. Artificial intelligence massively reduces the possibility of manual errors and leverages data on making the right decisions leaving no room for doubt or error. ",

This book is a Computing Machinery and Intelligence, the latter raises the question of bringing machines to a form of intelligence. He then describes a test today known as the \u201cTuring Test\u201d in which a subject interacts blindly with another human, then with a machine programmed to formulate sensible responses. If the subject is unable to tell the difference, then the machine has passed the test and, according to the author, can truly be considered \u201cintelligent\u201d. From trending technology Google to Microsoft via Apple, IBM, or Facebook, all the big companies in the IT world are currently working on the problems of artificial intelligence by trying to apply it to a few specific areas.
