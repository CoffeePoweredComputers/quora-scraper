            "answer_text": "Top 10 Online Business Opportunities to Make Money Money makes the web go around. Whether you\u2019re on a mission to find a new source of income or just looking to increase your paycheck with a side gig, the internet can offer a variety of solutions for you to choose from. With such a great selection it\u2019s easy to get lost. And although trial and error is a method we usually would recommend, it\u2019s probably not a good idea to invest time and resources on experimentation when something so crucial as your income is at stake. The solution? Research, and fortunately for you we can save you time with that. Below is a list of 10 online business opportunities that have a high potential for generating profit. Read through and consider which of these options might work for you. 1. Teach Online Classes:Your expertise and knowledge can be very useful to you when you start your online business. Whether you\u2019re a certified chemistry teacher or a knitting master, you can create an online course and charge students for access to the study material. 2. Do Affiliate Marketing:On the web, affiliate marketers are people who promote various online services and receive a commission for making sales. Many online services have an affiliate program \u2013 Wix.com has one as well! This type of business is especially worthwhile if you already have a blog or a website set up and can simply start working on promoting your affiliate goods. 3. Write for Pay:If you happen to be a gifted writer, your skills could be valuable to a huge variety of target audiences, from companies that need tech manuals, to college applicants who need help writing their resumes, or small businesses looking for good newsletter content. 4. Design Wix Websites:You have no idea how many times we\u2019ve seen this pattern \u2013 a person in need of a website creates one using Wix\u2019s web publishing platform, is very pleased with the process and the outcome, publishes the website and then receives offers from friends and acquaintances to design a site for them as well. The idea behind Wix is that everyone can create websites, but not everyone has the time or the will to do it, so why don\u2019t you step in and fill the need? Check out WixEd, our very own online course where Wix users can become certified web designers and start their own business in web design. 5. Open an Online Consulting Agency:Provide professional and specialized observations based on your field of expertise \u2013 health and wellness, finances, law and more. Here you can choose whether you want to work solely online or combine face-to-face service with your digital one. 6. Use Your Research Skills:The internet created a neverending source of data. Companies searching for business intel, an individual interested in family genealogy or an author in need of background material do not always have the ability to search this vast pool of knowledge with a fine-tooth comb. In these examples and others, they would prefer to hire someone to perform online research. Might that someone be yourself? 7. Get with the Retail Program:With online sales continuously on the rise, selling products to web shoppers is definitely a worthwhile path to follow for business purposes. Using Wix to create your own online store, you can set up a retail business with minimum effort and costs. We even have a guide that can help you choose the best products for your online store. 8. Offer Text Editing & Translation Services:It\u2019s the most straightforward process you can imagine. A customer sends you a text for proofreading, literary editing or translation purposes, you do your work and send them a document back. This kind of hassle-free operation will leave you plenty of time to focus on promoting your service. 9. Become a Social Media Marketer:Small business brands and professional freelancers often require help with promoting their work on social media platforms. You can train yourself to understand the fine art of social media marketing and offer to either take over their social marketing efforts or to provide consulting services on the matter. The Wix Blog will provide you with an abundance of reading material on how to market on social media. 10. Create Custom-Made Art or Music:If you want to support yourself as an independent artist without having to take on an office job or wait tables, why don\u2019t you use your talent to make extra money? You can offer people from all over the world the option to commission illustrations, caricatures, sculptures, video art, designed candles, custom-ordered songs or anything that your creative force is able to produce.
