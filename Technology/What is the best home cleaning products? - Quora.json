            "answer_text": "I use Mr. Clean Magic Eraser for the stove and refrigerator, if there\u2019s any spots on them. Then to polish them, and faucets, and the curtain rod, I use Wieman for Chrome. Lysol wipes for the bathroom and kitchen trash can. For furniture I use Weiman furniture polish, the Weiman products are great, and make the furniture shine. For floors I use the Swifter mop, it\u2019s great, especially if you have a bad back, it fits in the smallest places. ",
