            "answer_text": "How many farmers and professional hunters do you know, personally? What percentage of the people you interact with each day are farmers or hunters as their main job? 200,000 years ago, every human was involved in food production, and people still starved. Minor illnesses like the flu killed huge numbers of people, because spending a week in bed meant you didn\u2019t eat. Very few people spent much time on R&D. When New Stone Age technologies came around, like Clovis points or sewing with bone needles, they stayed static for a thousand years or more. Nobody industrialized change or technical progress. Change was not valued so much as safety, because if technological change lowered productivity even a little bit during the adoption process, whole tribes would starve to death. It\u2019s hard for most Americans to understand the famine that was endemic to the prehistoric world. The last famine in America was the dust bowl of the 1930s, and that came when we had tractors and chemical fertilizers and railroads. Imagine how much more common famine was before those things, before we even had domesticated animals like horses or oxen to pull ploughs, before we even had modern ploughs! So, the reason we didn\u2019t have technical progress is that nobody was working in R&D, they were all trying not to starve to death. 500 years ago, humans had steel ploughs and animals and enough laws to protect some investments in agricultural efficiency. That allowed a class of academics who tried to understand the world better, and pass along that knowledge so it became cumulative. People arrived at a philosophy of knowledge where questions were answered, not by appealing to authority, but by experimenting. Once we had a class of people engaged in research, knowledge growth became exponential. More knowledge led to more productivity which freed up more people to seek knowledge, which led to even more agricultural productivity. At some point, most people were no longer engaged in farming, and we eventually reached the modern economy where farmers are relatively rare. ",

            "answer_text": "I think you are like me. I found it incredible that we are being told such things. They don\u2019t have the ring of truth to them. Somehow we know they are not true. Life has been living and there has been lots of technology out there for a very long time. I had a realization that I could verbalize when I was nine years old. \u201cIf scientists can do no better than this, then I had better get busy and do something.\u201d I found that idea tended to be inspirational. I have found that there is a concept called \u201ctyranny.\u201d That has to do with tyrants and what they do and how they operate. They tend to destroy others. That includes their knowledge or knowledge of them. All nations were tyrannies before the time of Ancient of Athens. Since then there have only been three nations that have been Democracies. All the rest have been tyrannies. I\u2019m not trying to say Democracies were perfect. I\u2019m saying they were a little better and respected others a little more, most of the time. Socrates respected the difference enough to die for it, rather than escape. Did you know that all the books of the Mayan religion in North and South America were collected together and burned in 1547? One church tried to destroy all the knowledge and the future\u2019s knowledge of another religion, including all their technology. Did you know they had a golden age something like the Golden Age of Pericles, that is Ancient Greece. That same church burned a man alive, Bruno, at the stake for the knowledge he had and was communicating to others. Galileo had to recant all he believed and said about the Sun being the center of the universe and planets revolving around it, not the Earth. Do you think Science or \u201ctechnology\u201d might be guilty of this same thing since that time? I think this is being done, in the name of Science. Tyranny lives. To try and reconstruct the entire Timeline of technology used by human beings would be a daunting task. I can assure that there are many gaps where tyrants have knowingly destroyed the technology that did exist and all knowledge (almost all) of it. That is one way that technology gets lost. There is another, that may be the main way that technology gets lost. That is the ability to study. A child that can not study will not learn the technology of the generations before him or her. So this subject is most vital if one wishes to preserve technology, how things are done and what is known. I\u2019m saying there was lots of technology and there was lots of advancement. You just have not heard of it. Partly that is due to it having been destroyed before you could learn about it. But there is plenty known about such things if you look for them and study such things. Did you know there was a steam powered model airplane that flew for over 200 meters in Athens about 530 BC? That one you might find on the internet. Who did it? (one of Plato\u2019s tutors, Archytas) What school did he run? (Pythagorean school at Turantum.) What else did this school do? I have no idea, but it was probably a military secret. Did you know there was a battery before Volta - zinc-copper? (Baghdad Battery iron - copper), Arythea Battery zinc-copper 5000 BC from a monastery that still exists.) Did you know there was a star-chart from 75,000 years ago (See the books by James Churchward.) One of Plato\u2019s tutors was a woman. Her name was Aspasia. She taught him Rhetoric. She ran a school in Athens, the Milesian school - Wikipedia Have you ever tried to find the technology that women brought into the world down through history? Difficult to find. Why? I have been currently looking at this and finding more more such contributions that are not appreciated. See Plato\u2019s book Menexenus (dialogue) - Wikipedia which was written by Aspasia. So if the knowledge of the technology available during the time period from 200,000 BC to 500 BC was not destroyed by a tyrant, never written down because it had to do with a woman, or had to do with a religion, or was not passed down because a religion forbid it (Arystarchus - Helocentric Universe 200 BC), or because people were not taught how to study and the next generation simply did not learn it, what other ways can technology get lost? What is another basic way to hide technology? Make it bad. Have you seen the English laws on magic from about 500 AD? Pretty grim justice for anyone that contemplated that technology. Did you know Pythagoras drowned a man that divulged something about the technology in use by the Pythagoreans? How about the idea of ghost? Is that a good thing or is that something that sounds bad, because you were taught that way? Now, how about your central idea of \u201chuman?\u201d Why not human-being? Is the idea of a \u201cbeing\u201d so bad? Actually, you can make a person gravely ill by simply placing his attention on one factor related to beings or the soul. (There is a technology of getting a person through this that actually increases intelligence.) Another way to prevent technology being known is to say it is dangerous. Have you heard someone say, \u201cIt is dangerous to work on the human mind.\u201d? That is a way to discourage someone from personally examining the functions of the human mind. How about this method? A tyrant pays people to research and get prestige from what the tyrant wants, and not get paid and get shunned for wanting to learn about what is not \u201cpolitically correct.\u201d That is another way to lose technology. A tyrant simply makes it \u201cpolitically incorrect\u201d to even discuss it. At a committee meeting on educational standards one teacher said to me, \u201cWe have to be politically correct!\u201d I did a double take. Why? Why do we have to be politically correct? Good luck on your search for technology, Leon ",
