            "answer_text": "10 years ago, the virtual reality industry was just getting started. A few games had come out that was barely functional, along with the occasional flight simulator. Just in the past couple of years, everything has changed. Now there are over 40 million active VR users around the world, with that number expected to triple by 2020. 75% of top brands from every industry have released VR content this year. Now that the technology is stable and easily accessible, brands and businesses are increasingly looking to VR technology and incorporating it into their marketing strategies. In fact, online marketing consultants will often suggest exactly that for businesses who want to expand their reach in innovative ways and tap into the next big trend in consumer technology. Plenty of big companies understand they missed the initial tech boom of the internet for growing their business and do NOT want to miss out on the coming revolution from virtual reality. What makes VR marketing so compelling \u2013 is that you can now offer people an experience that is fully contained within the simulation and can expand the user\u2019s line of empathy unlike anything before. Once you can get someone to truly understand and relate, making a sale is much more likely aside from buying a programmatic banner ad online or a pre-roll commercial on YouTube. Here is a look at several examples of all the different industries that are using VR to creatively market their products, this is the first of many to come! 1. Entertainment \u2013 Scale the Wall from Game of Thrones At the height of the show\u2019s popularity, the minds behind Game of Thrones created a VR experience that allows you to climb the famous 700 ft wall of Castle Black featured prominently during the series. They did this back in 2014 before the 6th season was aired, and a video of the experience went viral and no doubt helped the already surging popularity of the show.  2. Apparel \u2013 Climb a Mountain with Adidas When Adidas launched their TERREX line of outdoor apparel and accessories, they created a pretty inspiring experience to go along with it. VR users could join professional mountain climbers Ben Rueck and Delaney Miller as they climbed mount Delicatessen. Not only did this introduce people to Adidas new line of products, but it also inspired a new generation of climbers who, without the VR experience, would never have realized they had a passion for it.  3. Awareness Campaigns \u2013 Become a Prisoner and \u201cStep to the Line\u201d Many activists and entrepreneurs see VR\u2019s potential to give people an experience that they otherwise might never know about. After all, empathy comes most often from personal experience. One example is the project created by Within and Defy Ventures, who partnered together to create a short film that documented the lives of people incarcerated in a California maximum security prison. The film is called Step to the Line, and it aims to show the commonalities of the human experience and break down the social stigmas associated with prisoners and ex-convicts by giving users the chance to see, hear, and be present for the experience of being incarcerated.  4. Samsung VR Rollercoaster Samsung has partnered with Six Flags to create rollercoaster experiences. Riders not only experience the amazing thrills of a real rollercoaster at Six Flags but also accompanied by a VR experience that matches the ride.  5. HiQ Volvo \u2013 Drive a Car in VR Cars are changing and so is the way cars are purchased today. Volvo\u2019s new VR program allows you to browse for new cars at home at lunch or even when out shopping in town.

Volvo demonstrates the cars safety technologies and how it actually works to give the customer the possibility to participate in the experience in VR. No car company has done this before and you can actually see how the car behaves in critical situations. The program takes you through a Scandinavian landscape in a Stockholm city at night and brings you close to a near collision. Giving the user a better understanding of how the car reacts to things happening around it.  6. Van Gogh Sunflowers VR Exhibition Imagine if you could use virtual reality to bring you to one of the rarest pieces of art in the world? One of the greatest painters of all time, Vincent Van Gogh has a sunflowers series of paintings created in 1888-9. You can now visit these 5 paintings without traveling around the world (Philadelphia to Tokyo) and on your virtual reality headset! Willem van Gogh great-grandson of Van Gogh will narrate the exhibit, sharing personal family memories of these paintings. Sunflowers 360 was released on August 10, 2017, on the Facebook pages of each museum and through the Oculus store.

Entering the gallery in VR, users can independently view each painting or go on a guided tour.  7. Eurostar Odyssey: The Underwater Train \u2013 Transportation Crossing the English Channel?

Project VITALICS \u2013 VR in Healthcare Today, various industries are building solutions for those that are movement impaired and can\u2019t get around due to health issues. What if you could use VR technology in the chair to give you the feeling of flying through the sky and controlling your own motion around the world? Companies like Limbic Life in partnership with Samsung are using virtual reality headsets to market their products in an immersive environment that gives freedom and happiness. There is no gaze or motion tracking for navigation due to nausea and not feeling intuitive for the user but rather sensors. \u201cPatients enjoy being in the chair and the freedom of movement it allows. They enjoy VR a lot, especially the flying games. When they get up from the chair, they\u2019re in a good mood and feel happy. They feel like kids again. We don\u2019t use our hands or our gaze to navigate in real life. The design of the Limbic Chair allows the use of both systems in parallel. It\u2019s really a novel movement platform that translates our natural body motion into VR navigation.\u201d \u2013 Dr. Patrik K\u00fcnzler, CEO of Limbic Life  In conclusion, this is just the beginning of major corporations using virtual reality and bringing it to the masses. The next generation of commerce is experiential marketing and virtual reality is the perfect engine and platform to do so.

            "answer_text": "Here's how AR and VR can be used to more successfully tap into new markets and effectively expose your brand to a newly engaged audience. AR (the ability to overlay digital objects onto a surrounding real-life environment through a computer or smart device)... and VR (the ability to delve into a completely computer-generated environment)... Are useful in meeting all key customer-engagement strategies. Seeing the benefit, my augmented reality company has partnered with Candy Lab (another AR company), and disruptive company Fluffr (http://fluffar.com) The mission is to provide users the ability to earn real money by interacting with our AR experiences, which prompts multi-sensory engagement, provides intellectual experience and establishes an emotional connection to the desired brand. But who is this technology targeting, you ask? An augmented and virtual experience is especially effective with the group of Generation Z (or post-millennials) shoppers who are coming of age. Unlike millennials that tend to weigh the differences between traditional and technological choices and then select the most advantageous option, post-millennials expect companies to offer computerized forms of reviewing, informing and purchasing their products and services. The senses - sight, hearing, touch, smell, and taste - are our links through which we interact with the world. When it comes to marketing brands, there are ample studies revealing how engaging the senses directly affects how consumers respond - the more senses engaged and the more pleasant the experience, the better the response. Both AR and VR technologies more deeply engage customer senses by immersing them in enhanced environments via digitally altered venues particularly involving visual, auditory and touch. Strategies designed around AR and VR platforms deepen and strengthen customer bonds by more fully engaging the entire person. In order to achieve organic growth, competitiveness, and profitability, marketers must implement VR and AR tech into their marketing plans.  ",
