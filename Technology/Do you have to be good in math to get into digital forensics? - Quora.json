            "answer_text": "Good question Jeffrey. At minimum you should be able to be sufficiently capable of high school level mathematics such as algebra, a smattering of trig and better-calculus. If you\u2019ll be studying cryptography and security you\u2019ll have to be somewhat proficient in advanced algebra and Python. You can get an idea from Bill Buchanan\u2019s channel as to what cryptography involves. If you are a generally logical person but weak in math, you can master math easily with supplemental non-credit courses at the college you\u2019re attending. From a personal perspective I have always been terrible at math but since taking classes and further independent studies, I\u2019ve found it opened up a new world for me and my practice. Concluding, math is an important part of your studies but logic skills will get you a long way. ",

            "answer_text": "I did some research and you typically need at least at cs degree or engineer degree with the following soft skills. Network skills, including TCP/IP-based network communications (much of modern forensics involves reading network traces) Windows, UNIX and Linux operating systems C, C++, C#, Java and similar programming languages Computer hardware and software systems Operating system installation, patching and configuration Backup and archiving technologies Cryptography principles eDiscovery tools (NUIX, Relativity, Clearwell, etc.) Forensic software applications (e.g. EnCase, FTK, Helix, Cellebrite, XRY, etc.) Data processing skills in electronic disclosure environments Evidence handling procedures and ACPO guidelines Cloud computing If you're bad at math forget about the other requirements listed.

The majority of people working in the field do not have technical degrees and probably have not taken any math courses beyond what they took in high school or what was required to meet their general education requirement in college.
