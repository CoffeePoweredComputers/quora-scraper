            "answer_text": "Be not afraid. Here is something I wrote last December for my 80th Birthday. - Random thoughts of an Octogenarian. When you reach the age of 80, you can't do as much as you used to, but that's OK because no one expects too much from you any longer. Many years ago, my father told me I was the best Christmas present the family ever received. I was so blessed! I\u2019m not sure how my parents raised a family when they couldn\u2019t communicate with others on the internet. Does anyone ever read answers to any of those surveys they ask us to fill out? There are more good people in the world than the other kind, otherwise, none of us would be alive today. My youngest granddaughter told me that when I am 100, she will be 30. Looking forward to that. Some things that looked like bad luck at the time, turned out to be good luck in the long run. People have taught me more by what they do than by what they say. My siblings have been some of my best teachers. Do advertisers think I want to buy something when they insult my intelligence? I always feel spoiled when I\u2019m in the shower. Those little black things on the floor aren't living bugs; they\u2019re sock bugs. Expect the unexpected and use a pencil when writing on the calendar. I\u2019ve never been good at following directions. I wish people wrote directions that fit my way of thinking. Why have my toenails become so difficult to reach? I'm grateful that my husband has helped me through my many growing pains since we first met 60 years ago. I'm happy that my husband and I raised children that are good moral adults, and they have blessed us with wonderful grandchildren. It is much easier to forgive than it is to hold a grudge. I have a lot of trouble keeping up with the way many words being used today have very different meanings than they did when I was young. I hope I never offend anyone by accident. The Holy Spirit listens better than any of those electronic gadgets. It is hard to believe the \"experts\" when they keep changing their pronouncements. Physical Therapists help many people to avoid surgery. God is the best multi-tasker. I don't get some jokes told by the younger set. They have a different frame of reference. Eyewitnesses are not always reliable. Two or three different people witnessing the same event often see and remember different things. Basic nature doesn't change, but the way it is displayed can change at any time. Lying is never justified. Someone always gets hurt when anyone lies. No one has all the answers, but some people act as if they do. When people refer to movies I've never seen or music I've never heard, I have no idea what they mean. If I had the 80 years to live over again, I\u2019d probably do it all the same because I learned from all of my mistakes. I still have a lot to learn, but I think there is still time to make more mistakes. ",

            "answer_text": "Here are my ways to convince myself of the advantages of getting older in my retirement years. Have you ever heard the remark that age is only relevant if you are a cheese?  All of my career it seemed I was one of the youngest guys in the room. Then, overnight, I looked around and was shocked to discover I was the oldest guy in the room. Working on my third career, I don\u2019t know why that should have been a surprise to me. It was though \u2026 a reality check.  But why?  Who knows, especially since I have no fear about the value I bring and my ability to keep delivering relevance in a young person\u2019s world going through rapid change. Luckily the feeling did not last long. Here are my top 5 tips on how I focus on keeping \u2018one step ahead\u2019 of the cheese: Do not rest on past successes \u2026 There is nothing more dangerous to life success than a great last result, is there? We are \u2018only as good as our next result\u2019. Stay paranoid. Make yourself a project \u2026 Hairdressing icon Vidal Sassoon was famous for having said: \u201cThe only place you\u2019ll find success coming before work is in a dictionary.\u201d We have to work on ourselves. Put pressure on ourselves. Critique our days. Give back to society. Be our own very best coaches and cheering squads. All of this applies as much for our personal lives as for our business lives. Continue to add to your connections and be a continuous learner \u2026 Woody Allen said: \u201c85% of the secret of success is just turning up.\u201d Turn up to events. Make that phone call. Read that book. Do that training. Have the courage to ask that question. Make the effort. Stay connected to what\u2019s happening around you.  Is a priority \u2018ninja\u2019 \u2026 Getting more of the important things done every day. Be obsessed with getting priorities rights, on what\u2019s really important, every day, and make sure you spend the majority of your day on these priorities. Embrace change \u2026 Darwin said it was not the strongest of the species that survived, but the most able to adapt to change. There will be more change in the next five years than we\u2019ve seen in the past 50. Get excited by change. Be part of the most movements that you can. Help shake things up.   We\u2019ve got one shot at our lives. Work hard on yourself to stay relevant if you want the chance to avoid being the cheese.
