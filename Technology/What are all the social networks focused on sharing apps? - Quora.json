We're not trying to make this an actual social network, but a place to find simple down-to-the-point information: what apps do people use. As we are a small startup currently working out of Cancun, Mexico and we are ambitious to get our app out there, we're working on a pretty cool guerrilla marketing campaign to launch the app. If you are interested in the topic you are welcome to follow our campaign via social media #OperationKingKong ...  Launch is planned for August 10. :)   ",
