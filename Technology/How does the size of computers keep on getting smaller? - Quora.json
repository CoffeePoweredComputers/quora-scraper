            "answer_text": "You need more advanced machinery to make devices with smaller line size. You could not turn out a mechanical watch mechanism using a wood lathe - you need a more accurately made one with precision cut gears. Back in the 1980\u2019s integrated circuits were made with photolithography with visible light. It was not possible to create features finer than the wavelength of light. Later, machines were developed using shorter-wavelength ultraviolet light, and then as I recall electron beams. In the \u201970s and \u201880\u2019s computer chips were designed by hand, and printed circuit boards laid out by hand with coloured tape. Later, they were designed by computer, and printed circuit boards laid out by computer-aided drafting tools, so that traces were more accurate and could be made closer together. Components became smaller and were assembled by robots, which can do a better more accurate job than humans, so boards can be packed with components closer together. Technological progress is iterative, and all bound together. Modern microscopes for instance used to build and diagnose integrated circuits use computer-aided design in the optics, which gives better images, and that depends on having computers created in an earlier phase of evolution.
