            "answer_text": "Interactive projectors and smart boards, both are highly efficient technological devices, and hence to identify which one of them is better than the other would be quite difficult. In my opinion, the suitability of such devices majorly depends on the requirements of the space they have been installed in. In order to find out the perfect equipment for your use, I would suggest that you check out the websites of companies offering interactive applications for Business, Education and Entertainment. Both these equipment are quite popular in the modern \u201ctechnology-enabled\" classrooms that are supported by the strategic use of diverse information and communication technologies (ICTs). In these classrooms, teachers get to use multiple types of digitized applications, equipment, websites and extensions to supplement their teaching methodologies and connect with students efficiently. ICT classrooms are especially designed to foster a system of interactive learning, while enabling the students to get the benefit of technology-based education. The technological tools used in these classrooms may include interactive smart boards, digital projectors, SMART notebooks, etc. ",

            "answer_text": "Neither is better. In mostClassrooms I've visited, the IWB has become a very expensive digital projector and I can think of much better ways to spend money. While I've seen a (very) few people use an IWB effectively, I think the device is an problematic technology. Despite its sophistication, it is an artifact of 19th C teaching models limited to a 1:many, sage-on-the-stage pedagogy.  A better investment would be to deploy something like AppleTV which allows multiple users to share screens and work collaboratively. ",
