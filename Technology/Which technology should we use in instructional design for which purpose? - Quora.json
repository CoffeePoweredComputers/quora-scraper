            "answer_text": "Not to be flippant, but your BRAIN is the most important technology. To design functional and meaningful instructional design, you must have a strategy. In your mind, you must plan a solid foundation of basic content to introduce the students to the material. This requires you know your subject to the point of mastery in order to communicate the subtleties of the subject. If you don\u2019t know your subject, you will be cheating your students out of a meaningful education. My method is to write out an outline of what I think the students need to know, to \u201cchunk\u201d it into smaller bits of information so each step is clearly presented. Presentation can be spoken, visual demonstration, written, acted out and interacted with your students. Not all students learn the same way so the material must be planned and presented in a variety of ways. Decide how much you can teach in a certain time, an hour, or two, and then pace your material so the students have a chance to absorb it. I\u2019d present it in a variety of ways so the students have a chance to fully comprehend what it is you wish them to learn. At the very least, repeat the information. We all benefit from repetition. Lastly, plan a way to assess the students so you can tell if they actually understand what it is you\u2019re teaching. The best way is to have them demonstrate to you, orally and visually, the objective. Engage them in conversation and have them explain the process to you. I use Microsoft Word or Google Docs as a writing software. I use both PowerPoint and Prezi as presentation software. I use Adobe InDesign as a page layout program to construct any instructional sheets. Hope this is what you need. ",

            "answer_text": "I would say that knowing the subject matter is almost less important than understanding how to impart information. it is common practice to expect someone with expert knowledge in an area to automatically be capable of teaching. This is a dangerous myth. Knowing how to teach is a separate skill from the subject matter being taught. This is a common error and it is usually the student who suffers since there is this expectation that the person who is the expert will obviously be able to teach so failure falls to the students responsibility. Therefore you have several variables to deal with. There is the desire of the student to learn. There are the varying methods that individuals take in information such as visual versus reading. Then there is The consideration of whether the subject deals with tangible or intangible information such as, respectively, math, or political science. Next is what is the best method for teaching a particular subject. There may be multiple ways such as Socratic, rote and test, or problem-solving for some examples. Next has to do with how the subject is applied in real world situations. There are cultural issues that often need be addressed as well as age of the student (both generalized by population and specific to an individual.) Once all of these things are accounted for as well as other non-generalized specifics, it is then that you determine the technology that would be best suited. Even then, you will have to address resource issues in implementing them. All of these points are high-level considerations that should lead to a detailed specification as to how the instructional design is going to be implemented. There are many more points to be made here, but this gives an overall view. ",
