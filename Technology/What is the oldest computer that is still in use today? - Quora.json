            "answer_text": "In 1958, the United States Department of Defense launched a computerized contract-management system that it dubbed Mechanization of Contract Administration Services, or MOCAS (pronounced \u201cMOH-cass\u201d). The system was designed to use the latest in computation and output technology to track contracts in progress and payments to vendors. Fifty-seven years later, it\u2019s still going. If one stretches the definition of a software program, the oldest one in use is probably at Sparkler Filters, a maker of water filtration devices that was founded in 1927 and is based in Conroe, Texas. To this day it relies on a 1948 IBM 402 punchcard system for inventory and accounting along with an IBM 83 sorter and IBM 129 keypunch, according to the firm\u2019s long-time repairman, Duwayne Lafley, who lives in New Mexico. The IBM 402 doesn\u2019t have memory, though: it relies on programs physically wired onto plugboards, which are swapped out for the task at hand. In 2013, the firm said it was moving toward PCs, but it hasn\u2019t switched over yet, Lafley says. Question of the Week: Oldest Computer Program The oldest computer in use by the federal government has been found ",
