            "answer_text": "Will we ever invent cars with no moving parts? We invented data storage, guns and jet engines with no moving parts, could cars be next? Wheels would be the only acceptable moving part, as long as they use maglev or a similar system. You may want to rethink your examples again. None of your examples have any correlation to automobile technology. You might as well say \"Since we can turn sewage into drinkable water, why can't we make a car with no moving parts?\"  I'm assuming by \"data storage\"  you mean going from spinning platter hard drives to solid-state drives.  SSDs can't even move themselves so what technology of SSDs can be used to move a vehicle? In the end, the moving parts of \"data storage\" have no correlation to moving parts in a car. And what \"gun\" has no moving parts? Sure I can make a \"bang-stick\", but I'd hardly call that a \"gun\". Or are you talking about lasers or Tasers? Again what do those have to do with automobile technology?  And there are very few \"jet engines\" that don't have moving parts. The only jet I can think of that (potentially) would have no moving parts is a pure ramjet.  But pure ramjets have a very limited operating speed range because they use the forward motion of the engine to do the compressing of the air, rather than using a turbine fan. But you have to get the engine moving forward fast enough first before the ramjet action takes place. In other words, you gotta get the plane moving first with some other engine before you can use the ramjet. So really, even ramjets will have \"moving parts\". Now to your \"car\". Did you plan to steer the car? That's a bunch of gears and rods as stuff to make the wheels turn.  \"Maglev\" in your example are all trains on fixed guideway systems.  Thus no need to \"steer\" the vehicle. If you were going to use a guideway, then you have more train than car. And if you're not using a guideway, then that eliminates \"maglev\" because the magnetic part of the maglev is in the guideway. Thus back to wheels.  Then what about bumps in the road? You'll need some sort of suspension. Non-maglev trains have some sort of suspension system with a lot of moving parts, just like all cars on the road.  And since this is not maglev, then you need brakes, meaning a bunch more moving parts. And then you still need to get in and out of the vehicle.  In other words, doors. Which also means windows that can be rolled up and down. Oh, leave the windows permanently closed? Then you'll need air conditioning and possibly heating, which has moving parts.  (Which, by the way, even maglev trains would have these.) The closest you'll probably get to a vehicle with minimal moving parts is a bicycle, skateboard or rollerskates. Notice, no motor and no enclosed body. Obviously those vehicles are not practical in all situations. But ya ain't gonna get a car with ZERO moving parts. ",

            "answer_text": "I assume you are talking about the railgun when talking about guns and (sc)ramjets when talking about jet engines? Well as noted by many other people already the scramjet and railgun have very large limitations: The scramjet can only be used at high speeds while the railgun needs high power and a large construction. As to your question about cars with no moving parts. I assume we could already do a decent job in removing many moving parts. Engine: The engine is possibly the biggest piece of moving parts in a car. You could replace this with electrical engines which have less parts. Brakes: I don\u2019t see how you can make brakes without moving parts. The quickest way to stop something is by ramming something else against it, simply speaking. Unless you have something like reverse propulsion engines.. Internals: You could replace many of the internals. You can replace the central heating and air conditioning system with electic ionisation systems. You can replace the stearing wheel and other control components with digital interfaces. While hard to use, it has already been done by people. You could eliminate motors with artificial muscles made from carbon fibre and uses electricity to cause them to contract or release. For example with stearing. Keeping all this in mind I do think we can reduce the amount of moving parts but never realy eliminate them all as long as you are using wheels. If we can eliminate the wheels we can probably make a car with almost no moving parts or at the very least extremely little. However would a car still be a car if it floats/flies? ",
