            "answer_text": "Fortunately nothing is sooo wrong about this device! Im saying this with the perspective of keeping its price in mind! For ~25k this is a very good deal! Even though you get a SD700 series in this device it still will be extremely good because of the amazing Oxygen OS! And I can say that it will fare well with all other devices in this midrange segment! Apart from that you don't get a headphone jack! Which I feel maybe subtle cuz of the new airpods trend. You get a warp charge 30T which is just blazingly fast! And considering the 24,999 segment I believe that the storage of 64GB is little less as it has a 48MP camera which can very soon pile up your memory! So I would suggest you to buy a higher Variant(128GB) Rest assured! It's an amazing phone in that range! Ofcourse you cannot compare it with phones in 50\u201360k range! ",

But like every other smartphone it also has some drawbacks like It doesn't have a headphone jack.It has Snapdragon 765G while you can get Snapdragon 855+ below 30K.No expendable storage option.Plastic edgesIt base 64GB varient is just not a good option. 64GB is just too low for a smartphone currently.",
