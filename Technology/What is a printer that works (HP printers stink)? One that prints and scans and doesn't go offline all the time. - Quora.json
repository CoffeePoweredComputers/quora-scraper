            "answer_text": "All combo printers/scanners/faxes have their shortcomings, they do none of the things they can do particularly well, so I\u2019ve found that separate devices suit my purposes. I use a Samsung laser printer that\u2019s 10+ years old and works under both the windows and Linux machines in my house. I use an old all-in-one HP that\u2019s 15+ years old exclusively for scanning, because it does that function pretty well and doesn\u2019t do the others well at all. (It\u2019s an ink jet, with fax capabilities, which is why I will replace it with a dedicated scanner, if it ever dies). It also works with both windows and Linux machines. As to why your printer goes offline all the time, that sounds like it could be a driver problem, try updating the installed drivers on your computer. There are a lot of diagnosis questions that could be asked. These will cover the make and model of both the computer and the printer, and if you\u2019re using a local network, how both devices connect to the network (wireless or Ethernet, with the latter far more preferable) and what program seems to be the one you\u2019re running when the printer goes offline most often. So, if updating the drivers doesn\u2019t work, or connecting it to your network via Ethernet doesn\u2019t work, you need a pro. You are unlikely to get anything more from Quora. ",

            "answer_text": "I have a couple of printers, a Brother 3170CDW and an Epson Ecotank ET-7750 inkjet. That specific Brother works well and was inexpensive initially and relatively so to run. However, it is not intended as a high volume printer. If your print volume is high, I\u2019d look into their monochrome business class lasers at ~$500. The Epson inkjet is actually cheaper to run than any laser I\u2019ve come across. In the Ecotank series, Epson\u2019s given up on the razor and blade pricing model. The ink comes in figuratively Coke sized bottles for ~$15/ea. That\u2019s enough to print through Costco sized boxes of paper. The issue with the inkjet is that it will plug up if not used at least once a week. I use a script that prints a test page every three days to minimize the problem. Even then, clogs still happen. The problem is that accumulated wet ink eventually balls up like day old snot. That gets dragged across the paper sometimes as well. When the built-in head cleaning doesn\u2019t work anymore, a manual cleaning is necessary. This means powering off the printer, and moving the print head to where it\u2019s reachable. The gunk comes off with lint free tissue (Kimwipes.) A cleaning like this is good for maybe 10 reams (~5000 sheets) of paper. One last suggestion, if you scan a lot, spend the money and get a real, dedicated scanner. Look into Fujitsu Scansnap machines. I\u2019ve had one for 15 years. It still works: no jams, no mis-feeds, ~30 pages/min, double sided scan, automatic straightening, OCR, conversion to PDF. It\u2019s one of the tools that just works. ",
