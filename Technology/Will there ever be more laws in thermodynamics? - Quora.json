            "answer_text": "Non-equilibrium thermodynamics[1] is a work in progress, extending studies into systems far from equilibrium, such as planets being bathed in radiation energy. Not only the direction of entropy is being examined, but the rates at which entropy is generated. Some fundamental laws might yet be found, linking the development of complex systems, such as life, to the requirements of thermodynamic efficiency.

            "answer_text": "Basically thermodynamics is a misnomer. In fact it should be called thermostatic. Real thermodynamics is often called non equilibrium thermodynamics. This is a very complicated subject and very little is known. There is lots of room for new ideas. ",
