            "answer_text": "Mobile phone processor is literally the brain and heart of the device and while many people compare the processors on the basis of their brands, these miniature elements have a lot more to offer.  Thus, mobile phone processors can be compared on the basis of elements more than just the brands and some of these are as follows: Size of the processor: The size of the processor is the major factor which determines its performance, heating ability and battery drain. More is the size of the processor, more would be its battery drain and heating. Earlier, the processors were manufactured as big as 28nm (yes this is big in terms of processor). However, nowadays you can easily get even 7nm processors. For instance, the new Mediatek Dimensity 1000 chipset is a 7nm chipset. CPU: CPU cores: On the basis of CPU cores, the processors can be single-core, dual-core, quad-core, hexa-core, octa-core and deca-core. More cores means the processor would easily handle more number of jobs without any lags. Nowadays, you can get only up to 8 cores in a processor. Mediatek first manufactured deca-core CPUs but these were bot so effective.CPU Frequency: CPU frequency is also known as CPU clock speed and defines the number of clock cycles CPU can perform in a second. It is generally measured in hertz and processors at least up to 2GHz are considered good for the usage.CPU Bit: It defines whether the CPU is 32-bit or 64-bit in operation. Memory: Type and Frequency: It defines the type of memory used in the processor and the max frequency at which the memory can operate. For instance, Mediatek Helio P70 uses LPDDR3 memory which has a max frequency of 933MHz and it also contains LPDDR4x memory which has a max frequency of 1800MHz.Memory Size: This is the maximum internal memory a memory-type can support. For instance, LPDDR4x can support up to 8GB of memory.Gaming power: Nowadays, smartphones are bought solely considering the gaming power they have and brands such as MediaTek, Qualcomm and HiSilicon have offered specific gaming chipsets as well. For instance, Mediatek Helio G90T in Redmi note 8 pro is a specific gaming chipset.  Camera Support: Yes, processors are also classified on the basis of the camera support they can provide. Plus, they also have a specific video capture resolution. For instance, the max video capture resolution in Mediatek helio p70 is 1920 x 1080p GPU Type and Frequency: GPU or Graphics processing unit keeps track of the graphics in the smartphone and processors can be compared on the basis of this feature.  AI Support: AI is one of the major factors which separates a simple smartphone processor from an AI-infused one. AI is measured in MAC/s. These are some of the major factor according to which the processors in a mobile phone can be compared. ",

            "answer_text": " Buying a mobile phone is not an easy task. We have to always do a thorough research in various fields before deciding on a smartphone. There are a lot of factors to consider before buying a phone like the price of the phone and if your budget is compatible, then the requirement for which you are primarily looking for a phone and then finally and most importantly, performance. To measure and discern how powerful a mobile phone is and how well it performs, we should know about processors. Now, I know it can get a bit technical and not a lot of us really understand the intricacies that go inside building a smartphone. However, it is well-advised to have a basic idea about the processors in a phone that will only help us to identify what to look for. I\u2019m going to state some of the basic areas of a processor that we usually look at before buying a new smartphone. CPU and GPU: This point helps us understand the specifications of the Control Processing Unit (CPU) and the Graphic Processing Unit (GPU) including what to look for in their specs to determine whether the phone will function well or not. The difference between the frequency or the clock-speed of the CPU and core of the CPU plays a crucial role in identifying the worth of the chipset and its subsequent performance. The CPU has a number of cores that vary from dual to deca, with the octa-core being the most efficient in terms of performance. You would have heard most phone chipsets boasting of an octa-core processor, well this is what it all means. Now coming to the GPU, this one is simple. The GPU takes care of the graphics of your phone, so it is always better if the phone claims to have a stronger GPU because that results in better graphics.  Gaming chipsets: With that we come to gaming. If you are a gaming enthusiast you might already know what to look for when buying a phone. There are some processors that are specially designed for gaming and have enhanced technologies to ensure a seamless performance without slowing down the phone\u2019s interface. For instance, the Gseries chipsets from MediaTek are specially designed gaming chipsets that tackle issues like latency and stutter and heating to give the user a powerful and smooth gaming experience, even while playing heavy-duty games. RAM & Memory: Now coming to this part, it is well known that processors come with a fixed memory or RAM as we call it, in a phone. We get chipsets ranging from possessing 1GB to 8GB RAM, which is the usual. This is supported by an internal storage capacity that is always greater than the RAM and can be further expanded with additional memory cards. All these factor in when talking about the performance of the processor. Simply put, the bigger the RAM the better the performance. Smartphones that come with greater storage perform comparatively better than those with lesser storage.  Camera Support: Cameras have become an integral part and a very crucial point in decision making when it comes to buying a smartphone. Whether you are a gamer or just a regular user, a good camera performance is appreciated by one and all. The chipsets that power a smartphone determine how well the performance of the camera is. A good processor will also boost up the camera performance with embedded technologies like AI and make operations easier and the customers happier. The newly launched MediaTek G95 chipset offers features like multi-camera photography for gaming and comes with an inbuilt AI processing unit or an APU. ",
