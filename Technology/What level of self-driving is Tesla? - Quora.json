            "answer_text": "It doesn\u2019t quite fit any of the standard \u201clevels\u201d\u2026and the exact description of those levels varies between descriptions. Let\u2019s go with my first google hit here:  Level 1 is cruise control. Practically 100% of modern cars have that. Level 2 driving is very easy. Level 2 is where the vehicle controls steering and acceleration/braking under simple circumstances and the human has to be ready to take control. Tesla certainly manages this\u2026but so do many other cars with \u201clane centering steering\u201d and \u201caugmented cruise control\u201d. Level 3 vehicles are a bit odd. \u201cThe driver is a necessity\u201d - but \u201cis not required to monitor the environment\u201d\u2026but must \u201cbe ready to take control of the vehicle at all times with notice\u201d. So\u2026eh? What this seems to be saying is that the car does drive itself - you can play games on your cellphone while it\u2019s driving - but you have to be ready to take control if the car beeps at you or something. So this imagines a car that KNOWS when it can\u2019t drive and tells you long before it fails to drive correctly. Time for you to drop the cellphone, look around you - assess what traffic is nearby and what speed the AI is taking you - and THEN take control before the AI panics and gives up. That\u2019s an odd sort of a car. One that\u2019s detected that it can\u2019t cope and needs a human\u2026yet can maintain control for the time it takes for the human to take over when they aren\u2019t paying attention to the road. That\u2019s weird\u2026.I can\u2019t imagine a car like that\u2026and Tesla can\u2019t do that. If there is a situation where the Tesla AI can\u2019t cope - you have to take over RIGHT NOW!!! Level 4 gets more controversial. Level 4 vehicles don\u2019t need human interaction \u201cunder certain conditions\u201d\u2026but evidently a human still has to be there for those other not-certain-conditions. But my Tesla can self-drive across a parking lot without a human involved. I don\u2019t even have to be sitting inside the car. This does fit what Level 4 demands\u2026the car completely self-drives and the human is only there in case of an emergency\u2026so you could argue that Tesla does that. So does a parking lot qualify as \u201cunder certain conditions\u201d? If you think it does - then Tesla is Level 4 but not Level 3 ?!? Truth is - that in almost all driving situations, you need a human. Level 5 means the car literally drives itself, everywhere, no human intervention required whatever. There are no Level 5 cars out there - and Tesla isn\u2019t even close. So I dunno\u2026Level 2 or Level 4 but not Level 3. CONCLUSION: I don\u2019t think this \u201clevels of autonomy\u201d scale is at all useful. If you want to get all hard-core over it - you\u2019d say that Tesla is EITHER level 2 or level 4. But it\u2019s CLEARLY ***WAY*** better than any other level 2 car on the road - it\u2019s not even comparable. Tesla\u2019s can overtake, stop at stoplights and signs, slow down in school zones, change lanes to get you to the right freeway exit. Handle roadworks that have coned off lanes\u2026comparing that to a car that can stay in the center of it\u2019s lane and not rear-end the car in front is ludicrous. But then the Level 3 description gives no credit for all of those things and allows a crappy Level 2 car to pass the test if it can merely say \u201cI give up\u201d with 10 second\u2019s notice. Level 4\u2019s allowance of only needing to drive without a human in some circumstances gives Tesla a passing grade if those circumstances include ONLY driving in a parking lot at 5mph or less. Sorry - but that scale is essentially useless for any purpose I can imagine. Basically, level 2 is very easy to attain, level 5 is virtually impossible - and levels 3 and 4 are too much of a mess to really mean anything. ",

            "answer_text": "Short answer is Level 2. Allow me to expound on that. SAE International defines autonomous driving at 6 levels (Level 0 - Level 5):  Tesla is currently at Level 2, and is close to Level 3 for travel on limited access highways. To be Level 3, which will allow the human driver to take his hands off the wheel and divert attention away from the road, Autopilot will have to anticipate situations in which it will need assistance, and give reasonable advanced warning to the human driver to take over (i.e., within a few seconds). So for, example, Level 3 Autopilot will pass control to the human driver when weather conditions deteriorate, a road construction zone is detected, an emergency vehicle is approaching, or the car is exiting the expressway onto secondary road infrastructure, to mention a few. Level 3 Autopilot will have to handle things that happen with little or no warning, like braking for an animal crossing the road, steering away from another vehicle to avoid a collision, or detecting and driving around a pothole. Elon Musk has stated at Tesla\u2019s Investor Autonomy Day (April 2019) that Autopilot will be \u201cfeature complete\u201d for full self driving by the end of the year. It\u2019s not clear what that means exactly. It seems reasonable to expect that when Autopilot 3.0 hardware and FSD software is released this year or early next, Autopilot will advance to Level 3 for interstate highway travel. That would be a huge accomplishment for Tesla, putting them clearly in the lead for bringing autonomous cars to market for general use. Tesla will not be able to build out the Tesla Network of ride hailing robocars until Autopilot Level 4 is in the bag and regulators approve its deployment. To get to SAE Level 4 will require many millions of miles of shadow mode testing of the new hardware and software, plus months of incremental improvements, and, of course, regulatory approval based on solid statistical evidence that the system meets acceptable safety and reliability standards which probably don\u2019t even exist yet. Several states have already passed legislation to allow self driving cars to operate on public roadways provide they meet certain requirements. For example, as of July 1, 2019, Florida allows self driving cars to operate throughout the state as long as the owner of the car carries one million dollars of liability insurance. That\u2019s a formidable requirement. However, at the same Investor Autonomy Day presentation, Elon Musk speculated that Tesla would be liable for costs incurred from accidents in which Autopilot was determined to be at fault. So much is happening these days in the development of autonomous vehicles. It\u2019s going to have a huge impact on the way we live in just a few short years. ",
