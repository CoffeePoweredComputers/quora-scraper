            "answer_text": "No. Acronym comes from \u201cakron\u201d (\u201ctip\u201d or \u201cend\u201d) and \u201c-onym\u201d (\u201cname\u201d). An acronym is a series of initial letters from a longer name that are pronounced as a word: NATO, UNESCO, SCUBA, NORAD, HUD, ICE. They are often confused with initialisms, such as FBI, CD, ATM, ADD, CBP and BRB. These are pronounced by saying each individual letter, even though some of them could be pronounced as words. Acronym is neither an acronym nor an initialism. ",
