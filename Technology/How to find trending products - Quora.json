            "answer_text": "You can play around with Google Trends and watchcount, however IMHO if you are serious about eCommerce you need a subscription to Terapeak. A couple others worth checking out are Jungle Scout and Unicorn Smasher. Terapeak shows you all types of data about eBay and because they are a partner of eBay it\u2019s 100% real accurate data. You can see the hottest searches, hottest selling items, you can see the top 20 competitors in any category of any item. You can see if number of listings is trending up or down, you can see if price is up or down. You find out the best day of the week and time of day to end your listings, etc. While Terapeak is specifically for eBay most of the data works for Amazon as well. On the Amazon front you have Unicorn Smasher which is a free program and Jungle Scout which is a paid program. Unlike Terapeak Amazon has no partners so while the data is pretty good it\u2019s not 100% accurate it\u2019s an estimate based on BSR ratings. Personally I use Terapeak and Unicorn Smasher. While Jungle Scout is slightly better than Unicorn Smasher it\u2019s $39.95 where as Unicorn Smasher is free so for me Terapeak and Unicorn Smasher together do the trick but honestly I use Terapeak for most of my eBay and Amazon sales as well as Affiliate Marketing stuff as well, specifically the eBay Partner Network.

            "answer_text": "Found a great answer from the ProductPro Blog: Days away from the beginning of a new year, store owners are searching for the next big product to take online retail by storm in 2018. The predictions are in, and researchers are sharing which products they expect to see take off in 2018. We\u2019ve curated a list of 10 products that have garnered a significant amount of buzz ahead of the new year. Fidget Toys After the fidget spinner exploded on the market in April this year, many manufacturers and suppliers began looking for new ways to innovate on the viral product and recreate its popularity. Fast forward to December 2017, and fidget toys show no signs of slowing down. With new variations being created and research showing health benefits for children with ADHD, expect to see the demand for fidget toys continue to rise in 2018. Athleisure Shopify recently released their list of products set to trend in 2018, and athleisure was included. Athleisure is essentially active wear that is worn as everyday clothing. While it was previously reserved for activities such as exercising or going to the gym, new fashion trends have brought products in this category into everyday trends. The category itself includes leggings, capris, sweatshirts, hoodies, sports bras, and more. Sourcing products from this specific category is simple with apps on Shopify like Air Waves and InkSewn USA that offer athleisure products. Smartwear From backpacks to touchscreen gloves, smartwear is the future of technology in the clothing industry. Smart backpacks are a growing market that allow travelers, whether it be to down the street or across the globe, to charge their electronic devices while on the go. Touchscreen gloves are another piece of smartwear retailers can expect to see trending in 2018. At the moment, this product category is fairly limited to gray/black colors with few fashionable options. Expect to see brands merge luxury and fashion into the touchscreen glove market in 2018, causing its popularity to rise. ",
