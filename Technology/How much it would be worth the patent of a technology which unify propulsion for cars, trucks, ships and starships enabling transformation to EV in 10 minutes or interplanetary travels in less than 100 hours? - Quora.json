            "answer_text": "I am also a registered Patent Agent with significant experience in patent litigation, so I can offer you some insight: A patent is a temporary grant of ownership, sort of like a deed to a piece of land. In terms of monetary value, its worth lies only in what other people are willing to pay to use it or buy it outright. It doesn\u2019t matter what you think its worth; the rules of supply and demand control the price. Like land, it all depends on what else is for sale out there, compared to what you are selling. Breakthrough inventions as you describe are almost always covered by multiple patents, to claim all the aspects of the invention. The US patent office doesn\u2019t want very large complex patents and will force you to break your patent application into pieces. If you discover the only possible way to do something (potentially very valuable!), you cannot get a patent. By definition, if there is no alternative way to accomplish what your patent application does, then its a law of nature and not patentable. So, the answer to your question is: It might be worth trillions of dollars or it might be worth zero dollars. It depends upon many things, most of which are unknown. ",

            "answer_text": "Since everyone else is talking about patents which have limited to no real value anymore (a very crucial agriculture patent (3 point hitch) had been violated so much it was auctioned off on Purple Wave auction site for a couple dollars for example), I will discuss what you asked. The value of such as invention is unfathomable. It would be more than the entire value of the earth since it would mean you could mine several thousands or millions of planets for all of their value. How much that would be worth to you depends on several factors. First I do not think any one would be able to keep it and stay alive. Too many people want it and would stop at nothing to get it. Therefore it would have to belong to an organization which would also be under attack from other organizations, but since no single person can be sorted out, everyone gets to live (albeit in court rooms.)
