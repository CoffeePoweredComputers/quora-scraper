            "answer_text": "The best way is to find out what is your unique view on life. Do you think that the life cycle for a particular product is too long? Do you think people are over qualified to do something that could be automated? Something that you think doesn't make sense, but everyone else feels is normal.  Then don't keep it a secret. Tell everyone. If most of the people you talk to tell you it's an idea that would never work because of [blank] infrastructure, cycles, etc. you're onto something. Basically you're trying to find out what your problems are before you build anything, and infrastructure can be solved.  Don't worry about how you're going to solve the problem yet, but map out what is the real problem that isn't being addressed. Even in non-tech aspects, I can think of three household problems I would tackle if my plate wasn't already full. There's a whack of problems waiting for you to solve.  Prototype your solution. Asking a customer what they want from a product gives you an endless list of things that'll take forever. Make a simple version of your solution, and show them what it is, and ask them to figure it out themselves.  Everyone thought it sucked? Back to how do you solve the problem. Repeat the cycle until you know you have something. And good luck! Doing something is easier than thinking about it, so try not to think too long and get going with your idea. ",
