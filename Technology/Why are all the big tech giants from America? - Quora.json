            "answer_text": "There is a definite bias towards big tech giants being either American or Chinese companies. From America, we have Amazon, Apple, Google, Facebook, and in China, at least Tencent, Alibaba, and perhaps Ant Financial when they IPO. Unicorn companies (private companies with > Billion dollar valuations) are also predominantly US or China based. I believe that there are 5 reasons for this. Free flow of people, technology and capital, which is particularly crucial for technology companies.The US is the best at this. In spite of the Trump administration, the US continues to welcome educated, talented people from all over the world, and capital is abundantly available.China is also good at this. It also has notable disadvantages in terms of a lack of transparency and corruption, favoring large, state-owned enterprises and restricting capital when it suits them, but makes up for this by \u201cco-opting\u201d and supporting its national champions as they emerge.The US has great Universities, but so does Europe and other parts of the world. However, US Universities do a better job of promoting and fostering entrepreneurship.These advantages are crucial for technology companies, because scaling a small company with a proven, viral business model requires the ability to add resources quickly. The speed at which capital, people and technology can be added to a growing enterprise in the US is unrivaled.Favorable regulatory/government environments.Amazon, Facebook, Google, and Uber, Airbnb et al have all benefited tremendously in their early years from \u201cregulatory vacuums\u201d in the US. US regulatory tradition is to investigate after market domination occurs, and to slap a fine on the offending company. We promote an environment where all companies -small and large - can (and do) act and deal with the negative consequences of what they did later, at a cost that is economically justified by the advantage gained.By contrast, Europe has stronger regulations with protections for citizens versus companies.In addition to the lack of regulation clarity, China and India have significant issues of political interference and corruption to contend with.Large markets.Both the US and China provide large markets for initial growth and experimentation.In view of market size, the EU should also have large technology giants. It doesn\u2019t because of a very different tradition that values privacy over corporate rights. We see the EU doing better job of safeguarding citizen data from abuse than the US government and agencies.Global ambitions and capabilities of US and Chinese companies.The mind set of both groups of companies includes developing unassailable market positions (becoming a virtual monopoly in everything but name) and global expansion.The fact that we are looking at a narrow 20 year band of economic history.At one time, the British East India Company dwarfed all its competitors. Economic and geo-political power are often highly correlated. The US, and Britain before it, and China increasingly help local companies with \u201caccess to foreign markets\u201d. The world is moving towards multiple \u201cspheres of influence\u201d again, and the make-up of the list of technology giants reflects that.As other parts of the world \u201ccatch\u201d up with the West, we will see more and more Indian and African companies in the Global 100 list.Thank you for the a2a.

            "answer_text": "They\u2019re not. Tons of Chinese Internet companies exist and are massive: Baidu, Alibaba, etc. but you\u2019d be right to say worldwide \u2018giant\u2019 companies are often American, including 9 of the top 10 as of March 2019:  There are many reasons why, 9 of 10 companies (and the only companies to hit $1 Trillion) are American. Most of them boil down to network effects. You most often here about network effects when talking about social networks, but all companies are themselves networks. Because of this, companies in the U.S. benefit from advantages and assets that other markets (eg Chinese counterparts) don\u2019t possess: Language Dominance: most around the world speak English. Not as many speak Chinese or Japanese or can even read those characters. It\u2019s therefore easier to consume U.S.-based services or products.Huge domestic market: After factoring in language, the U.S. domestic economy provides an educated, consumption-oriented market. Our people are rich (relatively speaking) and used to trying out new things, which can support a company before going global.Networks of experience: another network effect, the \u2018Silicon Valley\u2019 network may be overrated, but it is real. Entrepreneurs, investors, mentors and coaches have done it before and the ethos of paying it forward means that it\u2019s usually easy to find someone experienced to help you navigate the competitive landscape.Access to (more) intelligent capital: Silicon Valley funds toys that could be disruptive, but often focuses on growth and real metrics. Having an idea isn\u2019t enough. Unfortunately, other countries have been known to pour in massive amounts of money that then see them funding bad ideas or even worse, bad companies.Cultural Advantages: like it or not, America is often seen as a tastemaker in tech with companies like Apple before it. American Media dominates pop culture worldwide, leading whatever app Rihanna is using to become extremely popular. No surprise she doesn\u2019t jump for the Chinese app first. America also encourages going it alone which is important for enabling entrepreneurship.No \u2018shady\u2019 stuff: you can be certain that companies have more independence in the US than in China, where many residents openly live in a surveillance state and state companies steal IP all of the time. The US for all of its NSA non-sense tends to have pretty good rule of law for protecting IP once you\u2019re big enough.Socially Acceptable Capitalism: in many countries, you can\u2019t keep your gains if you strike it big. The government will tax you, or society will look down upon your wealth. Not in America! In the U.S. your billions and billions are yours to keep\u2014in fact, many people will think you\u2019re a god for making it happen.Critically, these advantages not only boost U.S. competitiveness, but draw many of the world\u2019s best entrepreneurs to the U.S. to start their companies. None of these obstacles are permanent, but some of them will take a generation to overcome, as well as a global shift in mindset. China has the highest probability of doing it, as it surpasses the U.S. in GDP and builds its society deliberately. Other countries with similar advantages could achieve this, but have yet to show the promise. For example, India could potentially get there, but it has systematic problems of its own that have left it far behind China despite starting in roughly the same place 30 years ago economically. Looking at the rest of the world, it\u2019s highly unlikely another country will take the mantle unless there is major political upheaval. The durability of these advantages remain to be seen. Some of these factors could change in a generation, but some many never change. If they don\u2019t, the U.S. will remain unchallenged in being best place to build technology for the 21st Century. ",

            "answer_text": "Why are all the big tech giants from America?  America has always been a Superpower. The highest competitor. But to quote Gab ... \u201cAccording to reports the White House has a drafted an executive order to address social media censorship by targeting Section 230 of the CDA. This is bad, very bad. It\u2019s easy to get excited that action is finally being taken against the Silicon Valley oligarchs, but this isn\u2019t the right solution. Section 230 protects American companies from foreign authorities with far less liberal speech regimes than our own. Using executive power to water down Section 230 is a horrible idea and will inevitably harm alternative technology startups like Gab in the long run. Removing immunity from a publishing platform, like Gab or Twitter, would result in worse outcomes for free speech than simply doing nothing and letting the market sort things out. In fact, it would only likely lead to regulatory capture for Big Tech making them even more powerful. As a philosophical matter: in the United States the government has no business patrolling anyone\u2019s biases and thoughts, whether they be individuals at a protest or individuals working together as a corporation. In a free country a corporation should be free to be biased. Apple censors music to comply with Chinese Communists. Twitter lets Pakistan tell it what users around the world, including Americans, can and can\u2019t say. Gab is biased towards American law and freedom. Gab is thriving because we don\u2019t patrol legal speech which is protected by American speech laws, particularly the first amendment and rulings on it. Gab is a threat because we violate the unspoken rule, shared by all big tech companies, that every user of the Internet must be subject to aggressive content moderation, which in our experience, users hate. From our standpoint, the mobile app ecosystems are the biggest choke point, particularly with Apple which does not permit iPhone users to direct-download third party applications to their phones. Apple and Google have an unquestionable duopoly on mobile app distribution with 98% marketshare. We believe the big tech companies have sufficiently close connections between them that they can and do collude to remove competitors. Gab is the perfect example of this abuse of market power in action, being banned by both Apple and Google app stores for refusing to censor \u201coffensive\u201d speech. Of course anyone who has ever visited Twitter, Facebook, or Reddit knows that there is plenty of \u201coffensive\u201d speech on those websites, yet they are allowed to remain on both app stores. Apple should lose its stranglehold over what apps users can download on iPhones, Google should be broken up, and the individual corporate officers responsible for these anticompetitive practices should be individually punished. Google is a vast repository of private information and we believe that their App Store dominance is only one small part of their anticompetitive activity across the wider economy \u2013 which includes dominance over SEO, advertising and the flow of dollars to online publishers, as evidenced by a recent $1.7 billion antitrust fine levied against Google by European regulators. We believe that an antitrust investigation of these companies will reveal all manner of anticompetitive conduct in areas as diverse as search ranking, advertising, mobile app distribution, browser bundling, and even browser performance. Otherwise if the Republicans and President Trump want to stop Big Tech bias, watering down Section 230 of the CDA is not the answer. Taking antitrust action against the anticompetitive and monopolistic behavior of Silicon Valley while joining and supporting alternative technology platforms like Gab Social and others is. Gab is 100% Funded By People Like You\u201d. ",

            "answer_text": "The U.S. has a substantially better venture funding, tax, and regulatory environment for startups than pretty much anywhere else in the world. Among the reasons for this, you should include at the top of your list strong intellectual property law and enforcement of intellectual property law. The only thing really close, anywhere else in the world, are the London financial technology startups, and you aren\u2019t going to raise nearly the VC funding in London as you can pretty much anywhere in the U.S.. Note that we are only talking finished products here; if you were to talk about manufacturing, China \u2014 Shenzhen in particular \u2014 has everyone else beat, hands down. What started out as a currency manipulation advantage has since outgrown that, and is now a substantial supply chain advantage \u2014 China still manipulates their currency; it\u2019s just that, if they stopped doing that, everyone would still manufacture in China. Israel \u2014 specifically Haifa \u2014 wins on complex semiconductor design. Russia and the former soviet republics are the only potential competitors for the U.S., but they pretty much ignore intellectual property law, and they are relatively corrupt, such that if you start making money at all you get bought out, even if they have to shoot you. India is totally out of the running completely; they don\u2019t believe in intellectual property pretty much at all, and while they won\u2019t shoot you, any time one company acquires another \u2014 like when Microsoft acquired Nokia \u2014 their government is going to \u201cdiscover\u201d billions of dollar in \u201cunpaid taxes owed\u201d: their corruption is top-down. So the U.S. it is; for all its warts, and for all we complain, it\u2019s the best place to start a tech company. ",
