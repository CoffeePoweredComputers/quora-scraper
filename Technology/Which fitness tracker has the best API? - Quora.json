            "answer_text": "It depends on your definition of \"best\". I'm biased, but here are a few things I think about. Commitment to an API. Fitbit has had a public API longer than most of its competitors have existed (Feb 2011, The Fitbit Public API has arrived.). It has a growing, dedicated API product, engineering, and support team. Breadth of API. The Fitbit API has over 70 endpoints (and more on the roadmap). Fitbit's own apps use the same public API that is available to third-party developers. Only account management and device communication features are reserved for Fitbit's own apps.Quantity of integrations. Fitbit has thousands and thousands of integrations, mostly by users who want to play with their data.Quality of integrations. Fitbit has dozens of integrations with popular apps and services like Weight Watchers, IFTTT, Strava, Lose It, MyFitnessPal, and MapMyRun. It's integrated into every major corporate wellness program. Fitbit trackers have been used in many research studies. Fitabase.com is product that enables researchers to more easily manage large studies using Fitbit trackers.Ease of use. Fitbit uses standard OAuth 1.0a and uses many REST concepts. (OAuth 2.0 support has been announced, but not yet released.) It has both resource request access as well as change webhooks. It has both resource-oriented and time-series-oriented data access.",

            "answer_text": "They just came out with the best fitness tracker. I just found out about it today. Much better that fitbit and all that other junk!  It's called Gymwatch. Designed by germans i guess. It's gonna cost you a hefty $199 for one sensor or $389 for two sensors. Maximum effect with 2 sensors but one works just as fine I guess. Check up on it and watch or read a couple reviews.  I was personally looking for fitness trackers for 2 years now. I have to get this GymWatch as soon as my budget finds fit. ",
