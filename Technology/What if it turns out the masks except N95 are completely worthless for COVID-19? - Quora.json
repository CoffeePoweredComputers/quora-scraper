            "answer_text": "This won't happen. Masks are tested to determine their effectiveness and we also have actual experience to go on. Masks of all kinds significantly slow and reduce the amount of breath droplets released into the air by the wearer and the quantity of virus particles that become airborn and the distance they travel. But it's important to use the masks properly for effectiveness and many people aren't. For instance, many people including politicians who are setting an example for the rest of us remove their masks when speaking. This makes no sense since speaking increases the droplets being expelled into the air. It also means they're repeatedly touching their masks and faces. I see people wearing masks with their noses uncovered. We know the coronavirus inhabits the nose because we test for it by swabbing inside the nose. To be effective, masks need to fully cover the nose, mouth and chin. Some people are wearing masks that are too small and don't cover their noses sufficiently. N95 masks protect the wearer while other masks protect everyone else by keeping the air relatively free of droplets and virus particles. This is why masks can't be a personal choice. Everyone has to wear a mask in indoor public areas and preferably outside as well in order to keep us all safe. Dealing with a pandemic is not a DYI project. ",

            "answer_text": "Further to the other answers: It is indeed true that wearing a mask is little protection for the wearer. (Although even 10\u201320% lower chance is of value.) But that isn\u2019t the point. It is established fact that wearing a mask means that droplets of saliva and other body fluids sprayed out by a mask wearer are largely intercepted by the mask. Which means that virus particles in those droplets won\u2019t get into the air either. There is an analogy that might be relevant here. Why do surgeons wear masks during surgery? It isn\u2019t to protect them. You don\u2019t wear a mask to protect yourself. You wear one to protect others from you. Given that someone who is infected with covid-19 might be spreading virus for a week or more before starting with symptoms\u2026 ",
