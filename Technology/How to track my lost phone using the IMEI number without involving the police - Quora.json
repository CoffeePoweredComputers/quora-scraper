            "answer_text": "The IMEI number is of no help. If you get with the police, a private detective or the carrier all they need to know is the phone number. From this, they can get whatever information they want. If you give them the IMEI number, they will likely stop working with you immediately, no matter how worthy your search is. Only someone trying to scam them would even have an IMEI number. So you lost your phone. If it is an Android phone, Google has tools to locate and remote wipe a lost phone. If it is an iPhone use Find My Phone - this can even remote activate Location Services to make it pretty simple to find your phone. You can also with either make the phone make noise and lock it to prevent anyone from being able to use it. If you have problems with this - CALL THE CARRIER. They can help you and if the phone turns out to be stolen ONLY THEY can lock the phone to prevent resale and reactivation. ",

If you really want to track your cellphone, Your phone cost is must be above 30,000/- because police department have huge workload so they will not entertain you if you have less cost cellphones. Now, you need to reach to the police department with written applications providing all details like, When it was stolenLocation detailsTimeMobile original bill copySIM NumberIMEI numberIn written applications you must provide detail information and you can also mentioned that your phone can be used for terrorist activity so you can request them to help track your cellphone.
