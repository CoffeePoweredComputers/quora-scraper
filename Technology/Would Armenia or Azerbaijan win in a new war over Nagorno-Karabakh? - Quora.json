            "answer_text": "I answered a similar question on Quora, so let me bring up the key points of \"who would win\" or rather in this case \"who prevailed in the latest 5-day skirmish?\"  Statistics are clearly on the side of Azerbaijan. They have a much larger army and their military budget dwarfs that of Armenia and Karabakh combined. They have rich natural resources (oil), while Armenia has zilch, pretty much none whatsoever. And lastly, their population is 2-3 times bigger. So going with statistical facts, the answer is pretty obvious: the more powerful Azerbaijan with its well-equipped army would clearly have no problems trampling Karabakh. But as we say, the proof can only be found in the pudding. As the recent events of April 1-5 showed us, it's not quite that simple. In a shocking turn of events, Armenians not only stood their ground, they actually got an upper hand over their more powerful neighbors. I understand that in the age of information each side will present their facts and make themselves look like the winner, but let's see what we know so far and try to derive some conclusions: First, it's pretty clear that the offensive came from Azerbaijan's side. Why? Simple. Karabakh has no motives to escalate the conflict. Azerbaijan has tons: they understandably feel the land is theirs, they feel confident and ready, and of course, their ego and national pride is still pretty sore from losing the war 20 years ago. Time is also not on Azerbaijan's side and clearly working against their current government. Mr. Aliev knows that with the currency devaluation and falling economy, he's sitting on a ticking timebomb. And what do we do in such situations? We \"Wag the dog\", i.e. divert the attention. And what better direction to divert the public's attention to than towards the enemy lines. Karabakh on the other hand is doing pretty well in their current status quo. They got the land, they won the war, they have absolutely no reason to start the fire. The planned blitz-krieg of re-occupying Karabakh not only failed, but actually back-fired. As a result, there were almost no territorial gains other than a few hundred feet here with a fairly significant cost of human losses. While neither side is reporting a large number of casualties, there are actually numbers that simply don't add up. Simple fact checking over the internet suggests that Azerbaijan suffered a lot more losses than they admit. Multiple sites list names and photos of killed Azeri soldiers, and if you add them all up, the number turns to be far greater than what Azerbaijan's side is reporting. The fact that Azeri forces were driven back within 2 days and the army of Karabakh liberated their 2-3 villages (Tavush, etc) further strengthens that point. Azerbaijan army wouldn't just fall back for no reason. Most likely Karabakh forces trapped their enemy, causing pretty serious damage and casualties. Then - the ceasefire happened. Now the $64,000 question: how come? How is it possible that the severely outnumbered, under-equipped army of Karabakh did so well, while the massively equipped, supposedly well-trained and armed force of Azerbaijan did not? I feel there are several key factors contributing to that: One: like it or not, but Armenians are pretty fierce fighters. Fighting is in their DNA. They are survivors. They had to be. After all, two thousand years - and these folks are still around, outlasting mighty empires that came and left. Azerbaijan on the other hand is a fairly young nation with more trading traits than those of warriors. They are merchants. Not fighters. Holding the gun is not in their blood. Two: Karabakh landscape is very rough for an advancing army. For the defending side, on the other end, the rugged terrain is actually quite favorable. Ravines, mountains, chokepoints are abundant, making it somewhat easy for defenders to trap and annihilate the offensive side. Three: Armenia throws everything into the pot. They defend their motherland. I read stories of elderly men and schoolkids volunteering to go to the frontline all the way from Yerevan. In other words, they would rather die than give up their land. Fourth: Sorry, Azerbaijan readers, but your military strategists suck.  Fifth and final point: Azerbaijan keeps underestimating their enemy. They did that in the 90s and they are making the same mistake all over again. History has tons of examples where uber-powerful armies were defeated by a much weaker enemy. And you don't really have to go that far... remember Soviets slowly collapsing in Afghanistan or the US army being worn out and driven away by the Vietnamese? History will repeat itself over and over if lessons are not learned. In this case Azerbaijan has not. ",

            "answer_text": "There is a problem. If you mention back on the Armenian-Azerbaijani War at 1992\u201394 over Karabakh region, then Armenia could have won. But using with modern weapons, then it could be different. Not just say, Armenia\u2019s victory at 1994 had never faded on the eyes of Azerbaijanis as a sign of its weakness. From then, being just a group of people drinking coffees and playing around the oil field Baku, Azerbaijanis have become more seriously on fighting to take back Karabakh. I think that Armenians may, or mayn\u2019t know about it. Currently, Azerbaijan\u2019s economic performance led them into a total supports from many corners in the world. They can rely to buy not just Russian, but also Turkish, Pakistani, Korean, American, Israeli and NATO weapons. Also, Azerbaijanis can believe on the supports from Turkic world, notably Turkey, due to Turkey\u2019s NATO status. Armenia, meanwhile, lacks a lot of modern equipments. Imagine, if Turkey and Azerbaijan together attacked Armenia? The country would not stand long. Armenians are brave people, but they could just only beat Azerbaijan. How about Turkey? Turkey is much powerful than them and Turkey is not a jerk like Azerbaijan. Another sad disadvantage for Armenia is right on, Georgia. Their neighbor in the North of South Caucasus often feel discomfort with Armenia due to its pro-Russian stance. Georgians many time accuse Armenians for causing violences in Abkhazia, siding with Russian force, or rather, a mass separation of Samtskhe-Javakheti from Georgia. Georgians are more careful after the Karabakh War, in the fear of Armenian \u201cinvasion\u201d. So for Georgia, despite its Christianity value, they might back Turkey and Azerbaijan to gain cakes. Russia would not try to side because they might damage the relations with Turkey and Azerbaijan. They would rather stand between two river banks instead. So, with the current status, Armenia could have only one plan to win: Negotiating with other big powers: they must stop relying on Russia. They need to ask the United States, India, China, Germany, France, Italy and the UK to prevent Turkey. Other side, they have to encourage Iran to fight with them as well.Try to prevent Georgia going to war against them: it is nonsense to say Georgia would \u201cfight\u201d with Armenia against \u201cMuslim Turk hordes\u201d, because of Abkhazia and Armenian policy. Armenia must, at least, put Georgia in neutral stance as soon as possible.Armenian diaspora must form a group to support and raise the question over Armeno-Azeri war and they may need help from those powers in order to make Azerbaijan\u2019s stance weaker.War has changed and I don\u2019t believe Armenia would win again if 2nd Karabakh War happened. Azerbaijan would have beaten Armenia by any causes, despite of Armenian bravery strong enough to 200%, due to lacking allies. Only Armenia obeys this, might be they would have change the fate of war.
