            "answer_text": "The concept of fixed and variable costs usually are tied to manufacturing or other processes that have a \u201cfixed\u201d cost component, such as rent, depreciation, loan payments, management, and a variable component such as cost of goods. Let\u2019s say you have a factory with $200,000 worth of equipment in it. If the equipment is turned off, you still have to pay certain expenses. RentInterestBasic utilitiesSecurityAnd, a depreciation component. Even if not used, it costs just to have it sit there.Now, let\u2019s assume that you can make ink pens, and you sell them for $1.00 but it costs you .50 to make it, including, the plastic, the labor to run the machines, electricity, etc. So your variable costs are .50 per pen and your fixed costs are, let\u2019s say, $10,000 per month. So, in order to cover your fixed costs, you must make and sell 20,000 pens per month. Of the 20,000, you gross $20,000. Your variable costs are .50 per pen or $10,000, therefore, your gross profit is $10,000, just enough to cover your fixed costs. For each pen you make beyond 20,000, you earn .50 profit. The major rule in the computation of fixed versus variable costs is, that in the long run, all costs are variable. You can sell the equipment, sub-lease the building, etc. It is typically used in short-term analysis. ",

            "answer_text": "You add up all the money your business spends, on everything except the cost of the components/materials that go into your products, and the total variable labour costs of the hours spent on building your products.It's worth pointing out that some of these \"fixed costs\" (as distinct from \"variable costs\") are in reality, more fixed than others. If you are making decisions today, it's probably too late to renegotiate the price you're going to pay tomorrow for the office electricity, or for everyone from the Chair to the Janitor (all of whom are fixed costs if they aren't building products). But it isn't too late to change your mind about a new file server, or an exhibition you might attend in 6 months. And it isn't too late to make decisions about lots of things you were thinking of spending money on, this time next year. ",
