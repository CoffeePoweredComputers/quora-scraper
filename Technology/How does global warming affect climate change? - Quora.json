            "answer_text": "The first thing to understand is what climate is and what it isn\u2019t. Climate is simply the long term average of weather, it is not weather in itself. Perhaps the best way to describe the difference is that when you go on vacation you pack for the climate, but you dress for the weather. So what you are really asking is how does global warming change weather patterns. Weather patterns are the result of a temperature differential between two points. Warm air rises over the equator, and climbs to a very high altitude where it cools. More rising air pushes this cooling air away from the equator and it in turn descends at around 30 degrees latitude. Similarly, in the polar regions cold air is descending and moving away from the poles. These two air streams meet at around 60 degrees latitude and the conversion once again causes air to rise. Thus we have cells of circulating air caused by the temperature differential. The Earth it self has a tilt which causes these areas to move south or north with the seasons, but the overall driver is still the temperature differential. Global warming theory tells us that the Earth should warm much faster at the poles than at the equator, thus reducing that temperature differential, and as a result there should be more settled weather. That is fewer and less severe droughts and hurricanes in the mid latitudes. That is also what we are seeing in practice. A further change is that as the atmosphere warms up it can hold more precipitable water before becoming saturated, and this can be seen in two ways. Areas that get a lot of rainfall already could see the amount of rain that falls in a single event increase. Thus there is a chance that floods could increase in volume. Countering this is that dry and arid area could also experience an increase in rainfall, and as a result desserts could start greening and other ares have enhanced plant growth. This increase in vegetation may reduce, or slow the runoff from heavier rainfall, and thus reduce the effects of floods. Thus the reduction in flow is likely to be confined to areas of high vegetation, while large built up areas like cities would see an increase in runoff. ",

            "answer_text": "Here are some:  Roger Fjellstad Olsen's answer to What are the causes of climate change? WHAT THE PEER REVIEWED SCIENCE SAYS: From about 1880 our C02 emissions started to dominate CC , and after 1950, according to scientists, humans ARE the dominant cause of CC.  Fourth National Climate Assessment (NCA4), Volume I peer reviewed by the National Academy of Sciences, the world\u2019s most prestigious academy, founded by Abraham Lincoln, with over 200 Nobel Price winners among their members. This report is an authoritative assessment of the science of climate change, with a focus on the United States. It represents the first of two volumes of the Fourth National Climate Assessment, mandated by the Global Change Research Act of 1990. The 600 page report was created from input by scientists working at 13 different federal government agencies. \u201cBased on extensive evidence \u2026 it is extremely likely that human activities, especially emissions of greenhouse gases, are the dominant cause of the observed warming since the mid-20th century,\u201d For the warming over the last century, \u201cthere is no convincing alternative explanation supported by the extent of the observational evidence.\u201d Climate Science Special Report: Executive Summary  Lets look closer at how global warming is effecting plants and biodiversity. Increased carbon dioxide levels in air restrict plants' ability to absorb nutrients. Rising carbon levels threaten diets of hundreds of millions of poor. Carbon dioxide makes plants grow faster and create fewer micro-nutrients. Rising carbon emissions could make vital food crops from wheat to rice less nutritious and endanger the health of hundreds of millions of the world's poorest. Plants cannot live on CO2 alone; a complete plant metabolism depends on a number of elements. Plant growth has one limiting factor. In most of the world the limit is water. In mid-high latitudes it's sunlight. In really high latitudes it's water again (for plants frozen water is the same as no water). In tropical rain-forests the limit is trace nutrients; there's practically none in the soil, it's all in the biomass and leaf litter. The thing was that CO2 never was the limiting factor so more CO2 won't give more plant life. There are some short termed positive sides to increased CO2 in the atmosphere for some plants, but the added heat cancels out this, and the net impact is very likely negative, especially in the future. Not all crops are hybrides like durum wheat altered to tackle harsher and warmer climates. Weeds benefits faster from more C02. Biodiversity, insects and oxygen producing phytoplankton in the oceans are already effected by global warming. Farmers world wide are hit hard by floods and droughts. They need stability and predictability for their crops/harvest, not a rapidly warming world. Negatives from more C02 include: The added heat cancels out any short termed positive effect for some of the plants. Heavy downpours and droughts are likely to reduce crop yields. A 20 years study of crops grown under enhanced CO2 finds that there is an upper limit to C3 enhancement from CO2, while C4 plants, after a sufficient length of time, adapt to high CO2 by improving their uptake of nitrogen. So: Increased CO2 ultimately depresses C3 growth, while C4 plants, which include numerous pest varieties, will become more vigorous. The net result is depressed food production. Plant quality declines as CO2 levels rise. CO2 enhanced plants will need extra water both to maintain their larger growth as well as to compensate for greater moisture evaporation as the heat increases. Where will it come from? In many places rainwater is not sufficient for current agriculture and the aquifers they rely on are running dry throughout the Earth. Increased carbon dioxide levels in air restrict plants' ability to absorb nutrients. Rising carbon levels threaten diets of hundreds of millions of poor. Carbon dioxide makes plants grow faster and create fewer micro-nutrients. Rising carbon emissions could make vital food crops from wheat to rice less nutritious and endanger the health of hundreds of millions of the world's poorest.Weeds benefits faster from more C02. Pesticides becomes less effective at higher C02 levels. Increase in crop losses to insect pests in a warming climate.Biodiversity is already affected by GW.Insects and their habitats are already affected by pollution and CC. 75% of our food crops and nearly 90% of wild flowering plants depend at least to some extent on animal pollination and that a high diversity of wild pollinators is critical to pollination. Insect pests also \u201cbenefits\u201d from warming.Oxygen producing phytoplankton in the oceans are already effected by global warming.Extra C02 makes the oceans more acid. Coral reefs are already damaged from coral bleaching.Greening the earth adds to the land albedo effect and is amplifying global warmingClimate change happening 'too fast' for plant and animal species to adaptFarmers world wide are hit hard by floods and drougts.
