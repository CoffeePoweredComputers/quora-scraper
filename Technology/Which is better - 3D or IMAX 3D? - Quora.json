            "answer_text": "I\u2019d say that if you like 3D movies, and the 3D in the movie you want to watch was well done, then IMAX 3D is mostly better than \u201cstandard 3D\u201d, whatever you mean by that (perhaps RealD, since their 3D system is pretty common). Some advantages of IMAX 3D: Screens are larger and the audience sits closer. This increases the portion of your field of view which is occupied by the image. You will be less aware of the edges of the screen, and more likely to feel that you are part of the 3D world - instead of looking at that world through a window frame.3D projection is quite a bit less bright than 2D in most systems. IMAX systems start out about 50% brighter than the industry standard, and often remain brighter in 3D mode (depending on what you are comparing against).Most IMAX 3D projection (film and digital) uses two projectors and displays left and right eye images simultaneously. This avoids a class of artifacts where objects that are moving left to right or right to left appear to be at the wrong distance.On the other hand, if you don\u2019t like 3D movies in general, or if the 3D is badly done in a particular movie, the large field of view of IMAX is likely to emphasize the unpleasantness. I do like 3D, and I will say that the very best movie 3D that I have seen has been in IMAX movies. ",
