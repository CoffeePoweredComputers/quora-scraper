            "answer_text": "Hi, I am not going to give any examples of turning points that happened in my life. But I have learnt one thing in my life, how to get the turning point in my life. Whenever I was starting a new action in my life, I got stuck up with what should I do next? I don't know! Then I would stop that action and start another new action/activity. One day I realised why I am jumping from one to another one. The answer to one question that made me to full stop all my actions was Q): WHAT DO I DO NEXT? Ans): I DON'T KNOW! Then I realised that I have to change my answer from \"I DON'T KNOW!\" to \"I WANT TO KNOW.\" This made me to change all the full stop (.) to comma(,) in all my new actions. This point of changing 'full stop' to 'comma' in all my actions is the turning point. Thanks ",
