            "answer_text": "There are several manufacturing technologies: stamping, milling, casting, etc.; I think it depends on what you are manufacturing. Obviously, the technologies employed in manufacturing dishwashers is different from those used to produce plywood. For example, in WWII, when the U.S. Army needed a replacement for the Thompson sub machine gun, the examined the British Sten Gun and German MP40 and seeing that they were created from welded steel stampings, set about to design their own cheap sub machine gun using the same manufacturing techniques, and awarded the manufacturing contract to the Guide Lamp division of General Motors rather than any of the American gun manufacturers. The reason for this was unlike gun manufacturers like Remington, Winchester, or Smith and Wesson, GM Guide Lamp company had extensive experience working with metal stamping. This meant that they would be quicker in tooling up and would be turning out guns quicker and cheaper than the gun manufacturers could. So before you can answer the question what are the best technologies for manufacturing, you need to answer the question what do you want to manufacture. ",

            "answer_text": "That\u2019s not an easy question to answer without knowing which specific manufacturing industries you\u2019re referring to. But there are some cool up and coming technologies which are likely to change manufacturing drastically (some have already). Virtual reality, Internet of Things, 3D printing and smart manufacturing software are some interesting topic points you can research. All of them basically come to the point of integrating your operations with software and tools which allow business to grow without getting bogged down in menial details. Which of these elements is likely to become the best/most effective is yet to be seen. ",
