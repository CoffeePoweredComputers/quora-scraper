            "answer_text": "That question is strictly a matter of personal preference. I have had every version of the iPhone since the iPhone 4 and the plus size of every one since the iPhone 6 Plus and the Max size since the 10S Max ( I currently have the 11 Pro Max). I am waiting to preorder the 12 Pro Max when it becomes available. Some people still like to be able to operate their phone with one hand, and for those individuals all of the Plus or Max size devices are far too big. The sheer size of the device presents challenges carrying it and using it but for gamers and video enthusiasts they are the way to go. You have to decide what you want to do with it and if it\u2019s worth the inconvenience to carry and use it. The largest version of iPhones also typically have the most advanced features of the series as well if that is a factor in your decision. For me I always opt for the biggest one available but like I said it\u2019s a matter of personal choice. ",

            "answer_text": "The screen is a little big bigger, but the bezels have shrunk so the device itself is \u201conly\u201d 2mm or so taller/wider. Which on paper at least is pretty tiny. So I think the 12 Pro Max will for sure be too big for people that thought the 11 Pro Max was too big. Good news, there are multiple smaller sizes for those people! The 12 Pro Max might be too big for people that were \u201con the fence\u201d about the 11 Pro Max being too big. For most people that were happy with the 11 Pro Max\u2019s size I would guess the 12 Pro Max is also fine. You will probably get more accurate answers in a month or so when people actually have the new devices! ",
