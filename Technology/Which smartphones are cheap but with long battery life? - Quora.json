            "answer_text": "Depends on your budget , under 15k asus zenfone max pro m2 is the best option for you because of 2 obvious reason . The massive 5000mah batteryPure and stock android \u2014 which increases the battery management and also phone runs a lot smoother compared to any skin from the manufacturer.Now talking about the performance of m2 1. It has Qualcomm snapdragon 660 aie chip inside which is also found on the nokia 7plus (price \u2014 around 29k) which is very good chip for daily stuff and even heavy cpu hungry games like pubg , asphalt 9. 2. Again pure android increases the smoothness and overall running experience of the phone . Overall phone looks premium has all the bells and whistles an average user wants in a phone like dual camera , display with a notch , good camera , fast charging , an average weighted phone , good build. I totally recommend it . But you should try all the options available for you . Real me 2 pro can be an alternative but just that phone has skin , no pure android. And less battery capacity. At the end of the day , decision is yours . Check all the options under your budget . Peace out! ",
