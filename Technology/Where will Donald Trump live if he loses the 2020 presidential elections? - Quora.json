            "answer_text": "It is a very valid question. Donald Trump will be able to play games in criminal, civil, and bankruptcy courts for a couple years. Maybe four? But certainly not much longer. He needs a place to live while he is dodging jail and bankruptcy. Trump is not a rich man. That's why he hides his tax returns. Realistically, he is facing massive lawyer's fees once he leaves office. It is legal for him to use his leftover campaign war chest to pay criminal defense fees but not legal fees in civil court. The rules of the Mar-al-lago charter issued by the city of Palm Beach specifically forbid Trump from turning a \u201ccountry club\u201d into a \u201ccountry club and residence\u201d. It can only be one or the other. There is no way Trump has enough money to both acquire Mar al lago as a residence and pay the yearly taxes and maintenance: $2 million to $3 million per year. We know this because Trump would have done just that when he acquired the property. Trump has recently petitioned Palm Beach for a variance to allow a large boat dock. They said no. Trump very very badly needs to establish a legal residence in Florida to take advantage of Florida's generous bankruptcy laws (like O.J. did). But it appears that Trump does not have enough money to just go buy a Florida seaside mansion. If he could do so, he would. Almost certainly, Trump must live in Trump Tower post-presidency. Trump is carrying unspeakably high debt. He needs to either make the payments, or face foreclosure and a lifetime of lawsuits then execution on his assets, or seek bankruptcy protection. New York state bankruptcy laws will not help Trump. He'll be wearing a rain barrel if he tries that. Maybe his Russian oligarch creditors wil forgive the billions they loaned him but why would they? If they foreclosed, they would gain tens of millions of dollars in clean lucre. As we well know, Donald Trump is an extremely careless and stupid man who presumes that he is above the law. There should be a clear and obvious plan in place by now for where Trump will reside. So why isn't there? Mar al lago? First, that's not permitted under the club charter. A bankruptcy judge is not going to let Trump break the rules and then thumb his nose at his creditors while chillin\u2019 at a country club. But then, also, is an ex-president really going to spend his days as a shabby \u201cguest\u201d at a country club when all the other members have million dollar houses? Trump Tower it has got to be -- at least until the whip comes down. ",

            "answer_text": "Where will Donald Trump live if he loses the 2020 presidential elections? Well since he owns Trump Tower in New York, Mar-al-lago in Florida, where he could change it into a resident and forego the resort, and a host of other resorts around the world, I think he has a lot of locations to choose from. Some have said he is in financial trouble because he refuses to release his tax records. People who believe this need a lesson in history and when tax records were actually released. Richard Nixon was the first President to release his records, not because he had to but because he wanted to. The Presidents after that time were asked, and they complied. THERE IS NO LAW that requires a person running or elected to President to release their tax records. They do release a summary, which is quite lengthy and extensive, which Donald J Trump has done. To me this is just another attack on him because he dared to win in 2016. At this link is a list of property managed/owned by Trump - he has many places to go. ",
