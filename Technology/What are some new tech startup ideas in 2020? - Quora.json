            "answer_text": "The easiest business to start is to buy a franchise of a good company, Becoming a franchisee provides the independence of small business ownership with the advantage of the support of a big business network that benefits the franchisee, their staff, and their bottom line. Franchisors usually provide extensive training, so franchisees learn everything they need to know to operate successfully using the franchisor\u2019s proven business model. Because of the advantages franchising ownership provides, franchisees often secure financing for a franchise easier than financing a start-up. A franchisee is buying into an existing, proven brand. Franchise brands have generally done the work to establish their brand reputation and image. Customers often prefer to do business with brands they know and trust. Franchisors have put the time in to refine the operation of the franchise locations to achieve a viable and profitable business model. This saves franchisees time and money. Franchisees can often take advantage of cost sharing savings, using the collective buying power of the franchise system. This is a valuable advantage enabling franchisees to start a new business on a firm financial footing. Running a profitable business is as much about making money as it is about saving it as well. Set up item or administration. A franchisor offers an item or administration that has sold effectively. An autonomous business depends on both an untried thought and activity. Three variables will enable you to foresee the potential accomplishment of an franchise. The first is the quantity of franchises that are in activity. The second indicator is to what extent the franchisor and its franchisees have been in task. A third factor is the quantity of establishments that have fizzled, including those purchased back by the franchisor. The best franchises I can suggest you now a days are Online services, They are the franchise options for many reasons, low cost and less initial space are the two important features of it. Look out for a company like Phixman.
