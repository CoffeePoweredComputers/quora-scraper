            "answer_text": "Heinrich Hertz in 1887 was the first to make a spark gap transmitter. It consisted of a low voltage battery, a telegraph key to make or break current going to a transformer; thus the voltage was constantly changing in the primary (in later circuits there was a second set of points that did the interrupting automatically via the rising and falling of the magnetic field of the primary when the key switch was closed). The transformer (basically 2 magnetically linked inductors) had a primary low voltage winding, and a secondary circuit consisting of a many more turns of wire than the primary to step up the changing voltage into many kilovolts. In the original circuit, a high voltage capacitor was formed by 2 spheres or flat plates across the secondary; these formed an LC circuit such that by changing the capacitance, the frequency of resonance could be changed (transmitter frequency). A spark gap, also across the secondary, allowed voltage to build up until it ionized the air and sparked across the gap, causing the inductance (L) to resonate with whatever value of the capacitor (C) creating radio waves. These waves were detected with a simple wire/spark gap (the length of wire and the capacitance formed another LC circuit that resonated at the transmitting frequency). At resonance, current would spark across the spark gap, just like the transmitter spark gap. See The Discovery of Radio Waves ",
