            "answer_text": "The US mint opened in 1792 and production of the draped bust quarter began in 1796. No such thing as a 1788 quarter. If you\u2019re talking about the statehood quarters, there are eight (Georgia, Connecticut, Massachusetts, Maryland, South Carolina, New Hampshire, Virginia, New York) that say \u20181788\u2033 on them. Those were years of statehood. The Georgia and Connecticut coins were struck in (and dated) 1999 while the rest were struck in (and dated) 2000. They didn\u2019t make a quarter in 1788 to remind you that, if you happen to be looking at the coin in 2000, that the year will be 2000. The coins were made in two freaking thousand. If you pulled these coins from pocket change, they are worth $0.25. Production of these coins numbered in the billions and they had the exact same composition as every other base metal Washington quarter. ",

            "answer_text": "If you're asking about a United States quarter dollar from 1788, your coin has zero monetary value. The first U.S. quarter wasn't minted until eight years later, in 1796.[1] Perhaps you meant a quarter from the year 1999 that commemorated the year Georgia became a U.S. state, which was 1788 (the year \u201c1788\u201d was prominently featured on the back of the quarter, along with 1999).[2] It\u2019s a very common quarter and there appear to be millions of them in circulation, so unless it\u2019s in extremely good condition or has a rare defect, it\u2019s probably not going to be worth more than face value. I noticed that silver collectible versions seem to sell on eBay are offered for about $15, while regular uncirculated versions of the coin seem to go for around $1 to $1.50.
