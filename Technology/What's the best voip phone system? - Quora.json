            "answer_text": "it depends on your budget and your business requirement.a system that will be best for person A can not definitely be good for person B.in the VoIP phone system market, there are numerous providers who provide numerous solutions to address different kinds of user requirementssome VoIP phone system is best for startups who have less user requirement some are specifically designed for enterprise who have more than 100 users.if you want to use a VoIP for your personal use then you can use skype for business or WhatApps for business but it will hamper your credibility as I think and I have experienced that this type of solution is a little unprofessional.the good one according to me is Grasshopper, RingCentral, Nextiva, etc.the best one will be CallHippo VoIP service as they provide value for money service. most importantly they have plans which can address all type of use requirement from a startup to an enterprise they have services and custom plans for all type of users.",
