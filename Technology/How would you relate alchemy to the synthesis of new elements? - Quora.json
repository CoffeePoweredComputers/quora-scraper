            "answer_text": "Completely unrelated. Alchemy did lead to fundamentally essential chemical techniques centuries ago, but it\u2019s philosophy and approach, like other ancient concepts such as Astrology, Magic, Geomancy, etc. are thinking processes relegated to the ancient past. The journey away from Alchemy, and other magical thinking, began in the 8th Century, with the choice made by Ab\u016b M\u016bs\u0101 J\u0101bir ibn Hayy\u0101n (Ab\u016b M\u016bs\u0101 J\u0101bir ibn \u1e24ayy\u0101n | Muslim alchemist) to depart from the works of Alchemy at that time. Western Chemists did follow his lead, by the 18th Century, but Ab\u016b M\u016bs\u0101 J\u0101bir ibn Hayy\u0101n, was the first of what eventually became modern Chemistry. Please refer to: History of Chemistry | Famous Chemists for further details. The technologies which exist today are based on science, engineering and mathematics, not magical thinking or fantasies. Science isn\u2019t easy, obvious or something one can acquire by charting horoscopes, reading palms or reading Tarot cards. Science, especially modern science, requires testing, and re-evaluating experiments determining the actual results verifying either errors or confirmation of results. It is however interesting, challenging and instructive as there has been no better educator than what science learns from natural processes. So science has grown to understand the correct approaches nature uses to build elements from within stars, and science has been able to build nuclear systems to mimic some of those steps, but Alchemy, nor Astrology, nor the rest, have been able to make any meaningful contribution since at least somewhere in the 16th century. So as a historical curiosity Alchemy, Astrology and so on can be interesting in understanding social and political decisions of the past. However, trying to apply that ancient system of thinking in a modern technological society is to seek defeat for the same reason one may believe one can recharge one\u2019s cellphone through prayer alone under a full moon. There are many cultures lost in ancient concepts. Some ideas are harder to leave behind than others like prejudices against women, fears and rumors regarding gender and race, and more. Sadly much of that is also bound up in Alchemy, and other ancient practices for the same reason a sewer collects everything abandoned to it. No one needs to blame anyone else, rather each person is responsible for their own thinking. The cleanup process begins in one\u2019s own mind.  Believe nothing merely because you have been told it or because it is traditional or because you yourself have imagined it. Do not believe what your teacher tells you merely out of respect for the teacher. But whatever after due examination and analysis you find to be conducive to the good, the benefit, the welfare of all beings, that doctrine believe and cling to and take it as your guide. \u2022 The Buddha (c. 563/480 \u2013 c. 483/400 BCE)  \"I see nothing but Becoming. Be not deceived! It is the fault of your limited outlook and - not the fault of the essence of things - if you believe that you see firm land anywhere in the ocean of becoming and passing. You need names for things, just as if they had a rigid permanence, but the very river in which you bathe a second time is no longer the same one which you entered before.\" \u2022 Heraclitus, 5th Century BCE  \u201cAn experiment is a question which science poses to Nature and a measurement is the recording of Nature\u2019s answer.\u201d \u2022 Max Planck ",

            "answer_text": "Nothing to do with each other. Alchemy did look at the material world but through layers of mistaken religious, magical and mystical blather. It was wrong in principle and never did much more than provide a few glib charlatans with a reliable living through fraud. It never really got anywhere until alchemists dropped the mystical nonsense and just kept what could be reliably and repeatedly observed about the chemicals they messed about with. The actual sysnthesis of new elements came about through modern physics and chemistry and an understanding of radioactivity that related atomic properties to the number of protons. It was eventually discovered how to add protons to an existing atom. It has zero in common with alchemy. ",
