            "answer_text": "Pretty much any fused deposition 3D printer can print shoes. How long it takes will depend on how much material is used. Like, sandals will print faster than sneakers. Whether or not the shoes are comfortable or last long depends on the material(s) used. Most thermoplastics aren't particularly durable or wear resistant, but the options are increasing all the time.
