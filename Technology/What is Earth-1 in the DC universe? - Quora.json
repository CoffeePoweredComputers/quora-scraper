            "answer_text": "From 1956 until 1986, Earth 1 was the primary Earth in the DC Multiverse. Before and after that (until 2006), there was only a primary Earth, so no name was assigned to it. In 2006, a new Multiverse of 52 worlds was created, and the primary Earth once again received a designation of its own: originally, it was just called \u201cNew Earth\u201d and was distinct from the other 51 worlds of this new Multiverse, which were numbered from 1 to 51. A few years later, in the Final Crisis event, it was given the designation of Earth 0, making the designations Earths 0 to 51. When the New 52 launched, it was renamed Prime Earth, not to be confused with Earth Prime a.k.a., Earth 33, otherwise known as \u201cthe world we, the readers, inhabit\u201d. In this new Multiverse, Earth 1 was assigned to a world where the heroes were only just now emerging in the present. It was being handled through graphic novels, each written by a high-profile writer and putting his own spin on the starting character. So far, there have been three volumes of Superman: Earth One, two volumes Batman: Earth One, one volume of Wonder Woman: Earth One, and one volume of Teen Titans: Earth One. I understand that there are plans in the works for volumes dedicated to Green Lantern and the Flash. However, this new Earth One thing has become something of a vanity project; and as interesting as some of the stories have been, the whole thing seems to be sputtering out. ",

            "answer_text": "Depends\u2026 pre crisis? Post crisis? Or current writing which has all positive multiverse universes written as earth 1, earth 2, etc\u2026 One poster answered pre and post crisis. In current continuity\u2026 earth -1 is the dark mirror or dark multiverse equivalent to earth 1. It no longer exists as it was destroyed but before it's destruction by Batman the Devastator it was similar to Earth 1. Where they differed, batman's mistrust in superman was founded and he battled superman until he lost his arm and used a doomsday virus to beat him. From that point on, Batman became the devastated. While his world was ending, his story hadn't. He was recruited by the Batman who laughs and joined the dark knights, twisted dark multiverse versions of Batman. ",
