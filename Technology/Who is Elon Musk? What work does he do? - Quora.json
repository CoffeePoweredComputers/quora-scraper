            "answer_text": "Who is Elon Musk? What work does he do? There are sometimes moments where I don\u2019t have a clue about some topic, person, whatever. Do you know what I do? I type \u201cGoogle <topic>\u201d into the search window of it. Occasionally, if it looks that it might be a very common topic or a known person, I type in \u201cWikipedia <topic>\u201d. I suggest you do the same.At least this is what currently children are taught in primary school. There are a few options: you might be already too old and you didn\u2019t have computers and internet when you attended school,or you really skipped some very important classes in your school.But in either case, I don\u2019t know how you managed to post a question on Quora.there is a third, although less probable option, you have some mental disorder and you forgot how to use Google.I suggest you urgently see the doctor.",
