            "answer_text": "There are a lot of factors to consider a PC which decide a PC can play a game or not Which CPU does it have Intel/AMD(Vega graphics can run games but Intel doesn't compare) How old is the PC hardware (15 year old PC vs 1 year old PC u know the difference so that is that) A cheap PC generally cut costs on removing GPU, slower RAM speeds,weaker SSD, reducing cooler quality, taking lower quality PSU etc. So more the quality more the performance (in some cases) The major difference between a Normal PC and a gaming PC is that gaming PC's are Heavy duty machines and normal PC's are wellll\u2026weak! The last and most importantly the definition of playing is variable too!!! I define a PC as gaming if it can run modern titles at minimum 1080p medium+high settings at 60 Fps for next 2 yrs or so without any issue,and I don't mean all games but majority games even a normal PC can run Fortnite but can it run super resource itensive games like Warzone.But people can also define it as a PC that can run games(even at low fps and it's absolutely! Wrong) So consider above points and decide yourself,everyone has a different way of defining \u201crunning\u201d games. Thank you ",
