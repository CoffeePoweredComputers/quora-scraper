            "answer_text": "If he tampered with the phone a lot he probably installed an app that records the calls. If you have no experience with phones (which would allow you to find and uninstall the app in question), you can perform a factory reset of the phone and then re-install all apps you need. Just google your phone type and factory reset to find the procedure. You will lose everything on the phone, so save your pictures first. If there is more at stake you could also hand over the phone to a lawyer as evidence or use the phone to plant wrong information to mislead the spy. ",
