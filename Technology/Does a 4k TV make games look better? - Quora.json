            "answer_text": "Hard one, as you said TV. TV\u2019s can come with a game mode that can allow better viewing and removal of poor refresh rates. Ghosting is a common issue on TV\u2019s. Back to 4K, yes they can, provided they are actually 4K. But the source also needs to be 4K too. A PC graphics card can push a 4K signal, but the latest consoles may not be able to push a 4K signal and are then upscaled. Xbox One X displays native 4K. All other Xbox\u2019s get Upscaled from 720p or 1080p. Likewise PS4 Pro can produce native 4K. They don\u2019t do this by default so you will need to go into settings and set the output to 4K. On a PC your graphics card will produce lower framerates at 4K than 1080p or 2K (1440p). An Nvidia 2080 can produce decent FPS at 4K on all games. ",
