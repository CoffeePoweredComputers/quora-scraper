            "answer_text": "Yep, we do. The reason why isn\u2019t exactly obvious, so bear with me as I lay it all out. I started as a CDMA engineer back in 2000. Everything then was voice. We moved to 3G WCDMA in 2003, and there was voice and video calling, and data was an option, but you got 384kbps max, and usually a lot less. But you didn\u2019t need it. All the big carriers were openly debating whether wireless or wireline was the future. Some bet big on wireline. Some went both ways. But at 384kbps you were caught in no mans land. ADSL was much faster, 3G data was hideously expensive and carriers were wondering if they had invested in a dud. I remember reading article after article questioning the business case for 3G. Then around 2006 things started to change. the first generation of HSDPA came out, and we went from 384kbps to about 2.1Mbps. And suddenly people took notice. The iPhone when it first came out wasn\u2019t 3G capable, so this wasn\u2019t a huge factor (it became one when the iPhone 4 came along. I was working at Ericsson Japan when on the Monday morning meeting my boss showed us what that phone did to the network - it was so wildly popular but had so much signal load on the network that everywhere where it was released the networks got hammered). The point is, in the mobile world, if you build a fatter pipe, you will find an application for it. I regularly deal with companies who have over 100MHz of 4G spectrum deployed and it is starting now to come under heavy load. It took a few years and was sporadic, but 100MHz when you think that user devices now are able to utilise all of the spectrum, and there are a lot of people using it at the same time, that additional capacity, while seemingly redundant when it first comes out, rapidly finds a lot of use. Fast forward to 5G - if done correctly it has the potential to replace wireline networks in places where wireline is limited by long distance to the DSLAM. People on their phones may not individually suck down a lot of data, but as a replacement for outdated broadband (ADSL) where the carrier doesn\u2019t want to spend money pitting and piping fiber to the residence, 5G may become (and I use may cautiously as there is a lot more involved) another de facto broadband standard to service fixed addresses. This is to say nothing of future mobile apps - I am sure the bandwidth requirements are not going to go down there any time soon. The flip side is the cost. If 5G means new frequency bands, then that means new antennas at the cell site which means massive cost to the carrier. And that may be a great hindrance. But in short I think 5G will get going and take over. ",

            "answer_text": "Depending on who you talk to, the term 5G can mean everything from blocks of spectrum at 24 gigahertz or above to a dedicated cellular standard managed by the International Telecommunications Union. The differing definitions are a nightmare for anyone trying to make sense of what is purportedly the next big thing in communications. This is profoundly different from 4G, which was tied to a specific standard in telecommunications set by the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP), a group of telecommunications standards bodies. But unlike 4G, 5G isn\u2019t just for carriers. It\u2019s for everyone, so everyone wants to play a part in saying what it means. Thus the term 5G is all inclusive. The carriers and their equipment vendors tend to use the phrase to talk about delivering wireless connectivity using a combination of cellular and Wi-Fi services. Carriers will use small cells, Wi-Fi hotspots, cellular towers and anything else at their disposal to ensure a connection. (They used to call this \u201chet net\u201d or heterogeneous network.) The FCC and others have expanded the definition of 5G to cover the airwaves folks will use to deliver next-generation wireless services. So Google and Facebook\u2019s plans to deliver gigabit wireless broadband using spectrum above 24 GHz also count. The FCC basically uses it to mean \u201cfuture communications\u201d and also spectrum. But slippery terminology aside, the key thing to think about when talking about 5G is that the goal of the transition is to handle more things on the network, as well as a huge variety of things. When 4G was rolled out in 2010 and beyond, carriers were trying to boost capacity on their network and lower the cost of delivering bits of information over the air. 4G was for the iPhone era, when mobile data consumption began to overwhelm networks because suddenly everyone was carrying around a little computer. But 5G is about variety. The internet of things will need wireless service for everything from trucks to temperature sensors. Not only will the number of devices multiply, but they will have different needs. Downloading an app requires a different level of service than sending sensor data. Medical devices require less latency and more security than playing Pokemon Go. To handle this, carriers are embracing software-defined networks in their core so they can efficiently slice and dice spectrum and customer bills as needed. This is why AT&T is building a network that Intel\u2019s Diane Bryant compared to those of her cloud computing customers. It\u2019s also why companies such as ItsOn are succeeding. ItsOn offers a service that allows carriers to change their pricing and service offerings in hours as opposed to weeks. Delivering a flexible array of services for an infinite variety of devices will take a lot of agility. For telecommunications operators, the wrinkle in 5G efforts is that all of this transformation happening in both their core networks and in the types of devices they have to connect is also happening at a time when their revenue is under assault. We may hate paying big bucks for wireless data, but carriers hate the loss of differentiated voice service and incredibly expensive texting plans a lot more. Carriers have had to shift their pricing tremendously over in the past decade while consumers used a lot more of their product. And delivering data over a cellular network is expensive. Historically cellular connectivity has been priced at a premium, but carriers are waking up to the fact that they have to rethink their strategy. ",
