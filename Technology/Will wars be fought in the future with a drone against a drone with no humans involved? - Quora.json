            "answer_text": "The point of war is to, rightly or wrongly, impose your will upon the other party. People are stubborn and will often not accede to their opponent\u2019s demands unless the penalty for not complying is greater than the loss of whatever condition for which they were fighting. Admittedly, this may not require direct violence, the Soviet Union essentially capitulated because the contest drove them to bankruptcy \u2026. it didn\u2019t help that the system that they were trying to perpetuate was less economically robust. I don\u2019t think we can call the \u201cCold War\u201d an actual war, however. I would have to believe that casualties will always be a part of war otherwise there would be no lever strong enough to force the opponent to capitulate. ",

            "answer_text": "No, war loses most of its effectiveness without death and destruction of property. It\u2019s more likely drones will be used to carry out assassinations and attacks on civilians and infrastructure. Of course drones will be used at countermeasures to these attacks but humans will still be in the picture. ",
