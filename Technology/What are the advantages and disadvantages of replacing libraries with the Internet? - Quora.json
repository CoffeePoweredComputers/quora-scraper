            "answer_text": "Libraries are local institutions dedicated to providing people - regardless of their background, resources, origin, etc. - with the information and assistance they need to answer whatever questions and resolve whatever issues they seek to answer or resolve. Libraries seek to cater their services to local needs and to facilitate community, and nobody is expected to buy anything. There is no way that the internet - a for-profit entity motivated solely by the goal of further enriching the already wealthy with no concern whatsoever for any common good or even the survival of the planet - can even begin to replace libraries. Anyone who thinks otherwise misunderstands both the purpose of a library and the limits of the internet. ",

            "answer_text": "There is no advantage in replacing libraries. The disadvantages are many. There are still people who do not have Internet access. Beyond that libraries offer much more than physical books, movies, magazines, computer access, etc. that they offer. The programming that libraries offer is focused on their local population which the Internet can only do to a limited extent and if searches are very precisely constructed. One more reason why librarians are so important. They are trained to help patrons do Internet searches! ",
