            "answer_text": "Let\u2019s assume by successful sales funnel you mean one that has the ability to easily up-sell a person through the sale process. From initially expecting to spend $20 now to $70. The biggest threat to this would be the inability to rank on the platform it is on (Such as google or Bing). With most people finding their product through a quick google search using keywords, a fall in this would be the biggest downfall to any business, especially one that relies on visitors to work. While there are ways around this such as receiving traffic through other means and paying for ads, it is a very serious threat that needs to be taken seriously. ",
