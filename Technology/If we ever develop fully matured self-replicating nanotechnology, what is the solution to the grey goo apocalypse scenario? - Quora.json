            "answer_text": "There is about 6 scenarios we could face, They are intelligent nanobots, w/ InternetThey are intelligent robots with an intranetThey are not intelligent nanobots, and simply have the barest of Internet connection or none, and are very lightweightThey are very strong nanobots that have no internet Or intranetThey are EMP proof military grade nanobots with no internetThey are Skynet grade intelligent nanobotsWe never even knew about then until it was too late\u2026Take in mind, these scenarios assume that the robot\u2019s code is messed up enough for it to reproduce with said mutation ablet unscathed enough to still allow it to reproduce. If possible the first thing we'd do is see how far they spread. By the classical scenario of 1 robot per 1000 seconds, they should be about a ton large in a day. Keeping in mind that they are robots, not human general's, they spread in a robotic fashion, going the most efficient route possible. Saying this is true, anything could kill them, including a well positioned bombing. The easiest way to destroy them would be to do it before they spread. The only scenarios this wouldn't be possible in is scenario 6\u20137. If they already spread, then we'd go to scenario one and spread a computer virus. If that is not possible, we'd go to scenario 2, and then we'd insert a bugged nanobots into the intranet that applies a virus. If that is not possible, then we'd go to scenario 3, and in theory we could disable them with an emp, or radio waves, or a strong magnet Scenario 4 is the same, but it leaves us with less options, and leans towards an EMP. Scenario 5 suggests that the only solution would be a nuclear weapon or 3. Scenario 6 suggests that we are probably doomed. Scenario 6 suggests that an advanced intelligence is controlling the nanobots, and therefore it is useless to attempt to locate them for they could be anywhere. The best solution we have is to locate said master computer, destroy it, then use it to destroy all nanobots. The only problem is, how long would that take? Remember, we only have a few days before nanobots overwhelm the earth. Scenario 7 I'm going to assume didn't happen, purely because you said we need solutions would imply we know about the problem. Scenario 7 is probably the deadliest though. If all else fails, we could all hide in bunkers and nuke the earth. You'll notice that as you go farther down in solutions, the scenarios get less and less likely. What is the likelihood of a military grade nanobots without internet? What would even be the point of that? And how would we not know about the nanobots overwhelming a lab? Well, you never know. I covered them too, not because I think they will happen but they could happen. ",
