            "answer_text": "Yes.  The original \u201cclosed captioning\u201d system was deployed in the early 1980s, concurrent with the widespread adoption of home video cassette recorders. This system relied on text encoded in the analog TV signal scan lines not visible on the screen and was specifically designed to allow the captions to be included in a recording. Most commercial pre-recorded tapes released by major studios also incorporated closed-captioning. Now, if you want to encode your own captions in a VHS, things get a little trickier. One thing you can\u2019t do is add titles to a tape that has already been recorded; you must dub over to a new recording and encode the captions in real time. However Vintage NTSC captioning encoders remain expensive. What you would be more likely to do would be to digitize the original material (offering an opportunity to enhance or edit), and work with it in the digital domain including adding subtitles, and then output the result as a composite signal which would then be recorded onto your new VHS. Why you would want to do this is a mystery. ",

            "answer_text": "They can be included as part of the video signal- usually done for foreign-language films. These are always shown. One system that was used is \u2018closed captioning\u2019. Subtitles were encoded on the tape and were normally invisible to the viewer. But when the signal was passed through a special decoder, the subtitles were revealed. Usually this was done for the benefit of deaf viewers rather than translation to a different language. ",
