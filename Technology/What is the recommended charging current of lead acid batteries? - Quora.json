            "answer_text": "For an industrial FLA (flooded lead acid) battery a common standard was 15A to 17A per 100AH for the bulk charge to 80% and then 3A to 5A per 100AH for the finish charge. 80% of full charge or about 2.39VPC (volts per cell) is the point where the cells starts to gas. The water in the cells disassociates into hydrogen and oxygen which bubbles to the surface and escapes. It is also the point where the charging starts to produce heat rapidly. If the charge rate is not reduced at this point the battery will get very hot which reduces the life of the cell and can be dangerous as well. The cells will also use water faster and have to be refilled more often. Automatic charge controllers use several methods to achieve this. All are based on the on charge voltage, end of charge voltage and sometimes the battery temperature as well. A standard charge would be up to 5 hours at high rate and 3 hours at finish rate. SLA (sealed lead acid) and gel cell batteries require a different charge profile since it is not possible to replace any lost water in the electrolyte (acid). Every battery manufacturer will have data sheets describing the specific charge requirements for their product. Now days it is far more complicated. Fast charge systems where the battery is wired and communicates with the charger to monitor the battery temperature and state of charger are common. The batteries and chargers are designed to operate as a system. They work. ",

            "answer_text": "Every model of battery has a datasheet, which recommends what its maximum charge & discharge rates are, usually in the form of some fraction of 'C', the battery's A.H. capacity. For example, a car battery with 200 A.H. capacity might - for example - be rated for maximum C/5 recharge rate, which means 1/5th of C = 1/5th of 200A = 40 Amps. ",
