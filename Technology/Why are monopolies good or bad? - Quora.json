            "answer_text": "Monopolies are bad only when they have unethical business models or biased support of the government, or both. Monopolies are widely looked down upon in our society. The term monopoly, however, has taken on bad connotations to the point where goodness is rarely, if ever, associated with it. The one-sided evil ascribed to monopoly is so pronounced in most people\u2019s thinking that one is tempted to coin a new term to convey the idea of monopoly in its good sense. [1] However, monopolies are not as bad as they appear on the outside. Here\u2019s what people say about monopolies which are not completely true. Monopolies are bad because the monopolists have no incentive to innovate or invest in R&D of new technologies.I believe, monopolies actually foster innovation and new technologies. When companies are not involved in a cut-throat competition, they have one less thing to worry about. Companies in very competitive markets fight so hard for survival and making profits, that they can hardly allot time and resources for innovation in their product and technology, and for research and development. Take Google for example. Do you think Google could have invested in newer technologies (self-driving cars, wearable computers, mobile phones) if it faced fierce competition from Yahoo and Bing?Monopolies strangle budding companies and stop competition.A company becomes a monopoly by merit by offering a service or product which is so good that it is way above its substitutes. In a free-exposure market, a new company entering the market with the same business model has no other option than to compete against the years of experience, expertise, and trust.\u201cIt\u2019s easier to copy a model than to make something new: doing what we already know how to do takes the world from 1 to n, adding more of something familiar. But every time we create something new, we go from 0 to 1. Tomorrow\u2019s champions will not win by competing ruthlessly in today\u2019s marketplace; they will escape competition altogether, because their businesses will be unique.\u201d- Peter TheilThis again explains how monopolies help in innovation in the long run. If you are merely copying the giants to become a giant, you will go nowhere. You have to create something new to dominate the market. There\u2019s no reason to think that new innovations can\u2019t stand against monopolies. AT&T dominated the US telecom market throughout the 20th century. This is how the near-present scenario looks like: With the technology and market changing so fast, the biggest mistake monopolies can do is not to adapt themselves and invest in innovation. Remember the times when Internet Explorer was the only reliable web browser you knew? Well, what are you using now! It would be too limiting to think that you can\u2019t compete and overturn the monopolies.Monopolies can control prices and qualityIt may make sense theoretically that a dominating company, being the sole supplier of a product or a service can control the prices and quality. While it may be true to some extent, it does not paint the whole picture. History has shown that monopolies can be overturned and no company in the present scenario would take things to an extent so as to jeopardize its dominance. With the advent of the internet and diversification of other monopolies, other companies are lined up to grab any opportunity resulting from even a minor goof.Footnotes[1] Good and Bad Monopoly | Leonard E.

            "answer_text": "Consider a market with one dominant force, not a monopoly, but one company that is \u201cThe Brand(s)\u201d. Now consider a time when who \u201cThe Brand(s)\u201d are suddenly changed, why was that? Nokia and Ericsson dominated the cellphone market throughout the late 90s early 00s. Where are they now? Apple and Google outplayed them and suddenly \u201cNormal phones\u201d weren\u2019t the \u201cit item\u201d, now \u201cSmart phones\u201d was the name of the game. Now Apple and Google are \u201cThe Brand(s)\u201d This is actually also a proof of why monopolies rarely form in a free market. Neither Nokia or Ericsson managed to overtake the other, just as Apple and Google now. So how does monopolies form? From what I can tell it\u2019s through force. Governments decide that \u201cproduct A\u201d is of some special status, and that the government should control it some how. They might tell Nokia that \u201cYou are the only one allowed to produce phones\u201d Now what would happen? First of all, no competition from Ericcson. This means that there is no one trying to out perform your products. No need to innovate on design and performance. Just release a new one every now and then. What\u2019s worse: Since Nokia has the governmental monopoly we have to wait longer for smart phones. Instead we go with Nokia Communicators for ages. Another road to monopoly is simply: There is a limited marked for a product. Simply put: Once you have a machine, you don\u2019t need a new one. Here you rarely see competition. It also results in higher prices. This is a very rare occurrence, and often seem to happen when a company tries to create a market. (Here too through laws or regulation). An example here is the company Tomra. They are a result of the Norwegian government wanting a bottle return system. Stores needed to charge extra for bottled beverages, and return that money when a bottle was returned to the store. So Tomra designed a machine to detect and count bottles, and give a receipt you could cash in.This is a very limited market, with little to no grounds for competition. While Tomra has innovated through the years, they have a hard time selling new products. They are also bound to the governmental laws on what sort of products has this \u201creturn system\u201d in place. Summary So I would say Monopolies are bad, for consumers and for the companies themselves. Consumer: Higher PricesSlower innovation\u201cOne size fits none\u201dCompanies No one else who innovates that you can copy and improve onLimited markets",
