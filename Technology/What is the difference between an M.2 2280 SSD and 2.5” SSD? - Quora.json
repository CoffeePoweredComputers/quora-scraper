            "answer_text": "A 2.5\u2033 SSD connects to a computer using a normal SATA interface pretty much the same as a standard notebook hard drive. As mentioned by other members, this allows for a direct swap for systems that only allow (or came from the factory) with an HDD only. It retained the same size and form factor and was used on earlier desktop computers due to their huge gain in speed (read and write) as opposed to conventional hard drives.  The SATA SSD retained the form factor/size for compatibility and easier swap. The actual SSD part consisting of the NAND, controllers and connectors are actually a lot smaller and in some cases do not even occupy half of the casing. M.2 is a form factor that was designed for a slimmer and smaller implementation of the SSD. It resembles a \u201cstick\u201d very much like RAM but with the \u201cfingers\u201d or contacts on the end as opposed to the sides. M.2 devices are usually implemented on newer devices (both laptops and desktops). However, not all M.2 SSDs are the same.  Here are two similar looking M.2 SSDs. Pay close attention to the portion with the contacts or connectors. The green M.2 SSD uses the SATA bus to communicate with the motherboard. It only serves to make the SSD thinner for use in earlier laptops/ultrabooks and some desktop motherboards. In general, the SATA M.2 SSDs are no faster than their regular 2.5\u2033 counterpart. The black SSD is also an M.2 SSD but it uses the PCIe interface to communicate making it a lot faster than regular SATA. NVMe drives are also a form of PCIe SSD and then can vary in transfer rates leading all the way up to about 7600MBs. Compare this to traditional SATA speeds of up to 600MB/s and you will see that the PCIe interface is much more superior. Those notches are keys that fit into a slot on the connector. A PCIe SSD will not fit into a motherboard slot designed for a SATA SSD.  Now 2280 refers to the size or more appropriately, the length of the SSD from the connector to the retaining screw end. Like already mentioned, there are several variants but the 22 refers to the width and (30,42,60 and 80) refers to the length. Both SATA and PCIe SSDs can come in these length. The motherboard usually dictates the maximum length of SSD that you can fit into it.  A third version of SSD is available as well. This is referred to as mSATA. This was an earlier implementation of the \u201cstick type\u201d SSD but were not as popular and widespread as the M.2 format. It is also keyed (notched) and fits into a totally different slot. However, there was much confusion with this form factor because it was the same size as Mini-PCI express devices. They were not electrically compatible. It was more common to use the mSATA slot/interface for add-in cards (in laptops) usually for bluetooth or wifi as opposed to storage. ",

            "answer_text": "Both use solid state nonvolatile memory chips, but as you described it, the difference is mostly in form factor. However, there can also be a difference in the data transfer protocol. Your usual 2.5\u2033 SSD is usually packaged with a cover that allows it to be installed in a computer\u2019s drive bay. They use the SATA data transfer protocol which was originally designed for magnetic Hard Disk Drives. SATA is plenty fast enough for HDDs but becomes a bottleneck for SSDs, which are capable of greater speeds that SATA permits. You will still find much faster speeds with a SATA SSD than with a SATA HDD. The M.2 2280 SSD, as Mr. Radd says, look like a little pc board with bare chips soldered onto it. The M.2 describes the kind of slot they are where inserted. The slot sort of reminds you of the PCI slots on a desktop motherboard but are oriented so the SSD will lay flat along the motherboard and secured with a screw so they don\u2019t wiggle out in use. the 2280 designation describes the physical dimensions of the SSD, 22 mm wides and 80 mm long. The M.2 2280 SSD and the slot may also use the SATA protocols, but look for one that uses the NVME protocol. NVME is said to be 6 times faster than SATA or more, and was developed specifically for SSD\u2019s. If your device has a NVME M.2 slot, be sure to buy a SSD that also uses that protocol. If your device does not have an M.2 slot but you want to enjoy the greater speeds of NVME, you can also purchase a carrier board that plugs into a PCI slot on your desktop motherboard. ",
