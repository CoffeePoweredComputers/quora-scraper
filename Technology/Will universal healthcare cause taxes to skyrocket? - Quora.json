            "answer_text": "No! In fact taxes will decrease for everyone including the who are presently on Medicare. We have an entire system that has been built on people not having health insurance. We pay for redundant health insurance over and over again in everything and we don't even realize it. Homeowner\u2019s and auto insurance- we pay bodily injury liability to pay for the medical bills of people that get hurt in an accident. We don't need to buy that anymore. Workman\u2019s comp- it's obsolete with universal healthcare. We\u2019ll pay a small portion of it for lost wages or negligence but there will be no more medical bills to cover. We\u2019ll save a fortune. Property taxes will go down- our schools and municipalities overpay for auto and property insurance too! They have fleets fo trucks and hundreds of employees they don't need to pay these bills for anymore. Even those retirees on a fixed income wIll benefit from universal healthcare. The cost of health insurance will go down all across the board. Single payer is just a better way to buy things. It\u2019s a Costco model of purchasing. You buy in bulk, leverage your buying power to force discounts and then you share the savings with your members. Single payer is just a big GPO- Group Purchasing Organization. It's how shopping clubs and big box retailers bring you the same items for much less. If you consider that then Canadians have managed to get their insurance costs down to $2000 per person it's not hard to see that we can easily afford that for each and every American just by taxing the wealthy. We\u2019re currently paying about $35k per family per year now. So that\u2019s about $27k in cash right in your pocket immediately. Even if they did need to increase your federal withholding by $2,000 a year we\u2019re all still way ahead of the game! Working class people will be able to make back all those wage increases we\u2019ve done without since the 1980\u2019s. Hospitals recoup lost revenue by eliminating their billing departments, and they save in what they\u2019re paying for their employees healthcare. They save again in malpractice insurance- patients will not have huge bills and damages to sue for anymore. Only cases with genuine merit will be worth suing for. Doctors can reduce their overhead also. Medicine will be driven by need instead of by ability to pay. Civil suits will drop in number all across the country shrinking our civil court system and savings us money again. Each and every independent American worker will be able to make money on this deal just through cost savings alone. ",

            "answer_text": "I\u2019m going to paste an answer I made to a similar question: The current US healthcare setup costs $11,250 per citizen annually. It provides adequate or good healthcare coverage to about 80% of the population. About 10% are under-insured with spotty coverage and cost-based access issues. The last 10% are restricted to emergency rooms only. The average developed nation spends $4,000 per head to cover everyone. That $11,250 the US spends is about 50/50 public/private, half paid for by the government in the form of Medicare, Medicaid, VA, CHIP, IHA, etc, and half paid for privately, out of pocket or through insurance. Employers get a tax break for providing healthcare to their employees that is not included, about $200\u2013250 billion, I believe. So about $5,600 from taxes, and about $5,600 privately not counting tax breaks. The average developed nation provides healthcare to 100% of the population for $4,000 per resident. The more high-cost developed nations, Western Europe mostly, average about $5,500 per person. Most but not quite all developed countries get better results than the US. But the spending\u2014spending half or less of what the US does to cover everyone\u2014that is not exceptional. It's not unusual. It is not an accomplishment. It is the standard performance. It's done by some nations we do not normally consider to be paragons of effectiveness. It's not considered difficult. It is the normal. The US spends almost $2 trillion more than you\u2019d expect from the population size. Trillion with a T. The US military budget is $700 billion or $0.7 Trillion, just for comparison. So moving to a system about as expensive as the high-cost nations average should save about twice as much as the US spends on the military and infrastructure. Well, a bit more, maybe 2 normal infrastructure budgets more. ",
