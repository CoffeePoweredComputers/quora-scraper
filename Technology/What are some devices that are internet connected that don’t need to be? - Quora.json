            "answer_text": "Your fridge? Well, not mine and probably not yours either, but fridges in general have no legitimate use for an Internet connection. Likewise, coffee machines and microwaves. I get the coke machine that started all this decades ago. Done by a bunch of nerds as a technical exercise, and it worked really well. But it was always intended as a joke from what I\u2019ve read. The thing is, the more home devices that get connected to the Internet, the more likely something in your house will be compromised. Because those devices are built by companies that have no idea at all how important, difficult and expensive IT security is to implement. So they generally don\u2019t bother. I\u2019m not impressed that the controller for the aircon here insists on a WiFi connection. So does the inverter for the solar system. Neither of them need it. If the aircon needs an engineer it doesn\u2019t actually arrange for one to call, I get to see a cryptic message and I\u2019m expected to call the company and ask about it. So, why exactly does the thing need WiFi? The inverter tells the company how effective it is, but it can\u2019t tell me, I have to login to the company web site and see - which I rarely do. IoT will massively increase the number of connected devices in our homes, but I\u2019d like to see a benefit analysis. leave the cost out, just tell me what it\u2019s all going to give me. All this is IMHO of course - YMMV :) ",

            "answer_text": "I dont simply deam that thing A doesnt need a wifi connection, but a I look at what the connection provides. The washing machine that lets you know it is done\u2026gee if only it made a sound or you could set an alarm. The smart fridge is getting there, but certianly not there yet. Taking a picture of things does not help that much because I have more than 1 item on a shelf and not everything is transparent. Now the day it can self-scan the firdge and tell me that 1/8 a gallon of milk, 4 eggs remaining in the carton, and that my sour cream has expired - - - now a smart fridge is useful. WiFi cant put my item in the toaster/microwave or take it out, thus I am right there in the kitchen - so what producticity am I really gaining??? I am certianly not going to leave my bread in the toaster over night to start in the morning. Now there is A LOT of devices that dont need an internet connection, just a wifi connection. It is asine that to communicate with the IoT device 25 ft away from you, you have to go out to a server on the internet 500 miles away.I get it, its the easiest way to make it \u201cdownload app and press button\u201d simple for the masses, but they should be built so that they can all be setup and controlled directly from inside the network as well ",
