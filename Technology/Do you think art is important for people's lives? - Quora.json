            "answer_text": "Very Important! The arts are the application of \"aesthetic\" or perceptual understanding to the \u201cmaking\u201d of things (drawing, painting, sculpture, ceramics, literature, drama, poetry music, dance, film, video, etc.) that affectively influence human awareness by evoking the passions. Affectively means to have, \"A feeling or subjective experience accompanying a thought or action or occurring in response to a stimulus; an emotion, a mood.\" (https://www-oed-com.libproxy.utdallas.edu/view/Entry/3321?rskey=3umth0&result=1#eid) Defining what art is has always been a challenge because the experience of art does not necessarily lend itself to expression in ordinary language. We can undoubtedly classify humanly made objects by use, such that a pipe wrench we know is a tool with the intended purpose of tightening pipefittings and is not usually or ordinarily considered a work of art. If there were no pipes, there would be no use for the existence of a pipe wrench, Even suggesting the \u201caffective\u2019 nature of art is problematic because toys are a distinguishable kind of humanly made object, but do not have a purpose like a tool. Toys exist to evoke enjoyment usually through physical manipulation, but are not ordinarily considered works of art, which makes them somehow different than works of art. In this sense of utility or having a purpose like a tool, works of art are useless, meaning they don\u2019t have a purpose outside of themselves to act on another object like a tool does. Philip-head screwdrivers only exist because of Philip-head screws. Works of art evoke our passions, which are often \"ineffable.\" \"Ineffable\" means that which, \"\u2026 cannot be expressed or described in language; too great for words; transcending expression; unspeakable, unutterable, inexpressible.\" (https://www-oed-com.libproxy.utdallas.edu/view/Entry/94904?redirectedFrom=ineffable#eid) Aside from the utility of a coffee cup to hold coffee, the shape, texture, and color of the coffee cup can evoke a response, such as saying, \"it is beautiful.\" Hence we can intentionally experience anything \u201clike\u201d a work of art, but that does not make that object a work of art when compared to all other objects in the world. We have \u201cart\u201d like experiences with sunsets, and sunsets are not works of humanly contrived art, Saying why the coffee cup or sunset is beautiful may be challenging and more appropriately the activity of the humanities in terms of art criticism. See: Jackson Pollock, Blue Poles, 1952, originally titled Number 11. Source: https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/62/Bluepoles.jpg For a more humanistic interpretation under the category of art criticism regarding the above mentioned painting by Jackson Pollock, viewers are often challenged to appreciate this type of abstract expressionist art. For many, visual arts must represent recognizable things in the world that can be named. Abstract Expressionist Art mostly does not lend itself to being recognized as relating to anything that can be seen or named in the world. Rather, Abstract Expressionist Art is more like music. For example, jazz music without lyrics expresses passion. Likewise, abstract expressionist painting can express their meanings, not in words, but in that the color, lines, shapes, and textures themselves seek to evoke a passionate response. The comedian-musician Martin Mull is said to have first said (although Elvis Costello claims first usage credit too): \"Writing about music is like dancing about architecture.\" Talbert, B. (1979, Feb). Bob Talbert\u2019s quotebag. Detroit Free Press. Retrieved from: https://quoteinvestigator.com/2010/11/08/writing-about-music/ This suggests a disconnection between what is experienced and the effort to explain art. Describing the meaning of a work of art, at least on the emotional level may be indeed confront an \"ineffable\" circumstance for which language fails to adequately express meaning. Furthermore, this suggests the question that if the meaning of a work of art could be wholly and satisfactorily explained, why even make the work of art? Thus, the arts allow us to engage our passions, not necessarily in words (with literature, poetry and musical lyrics being extraordinary uses of language), but in the contrivance of media. Learning the craft of making art is necessary to free creativity from being unable to execute and creatively express what\u2019s sought in the work of art. For example, a musician's creativity is limited or restricted by what they cannot perform on their instrument. Learning more of the craft of music on an instrument translates into a greater range of ability and therefore, betters performance and allows for the possibility for greater creativity. ",

            "answer_text": "I draw/write/play music almost every day. Art has always been a part of me for the longest time. If I lost the ability to do these one day, I imagine I would be very lost and aimless. I have been drawing since I was little. In kindergarten, I used to draw many many drawings every day, so many that I often ran out of paper to draw on. Being a very quiet child who felt alienated in a rich-kids kindergarten (many of my classmates had wealthy or influential parents), drawing was one of the things I amused myself with when I couldn\u2019t relate to them or didn\u2019t dare join them. Drawing continued to be my best friend in the times when I was alone. From a young age, I had been exposed to music as my father performed music as a side gig and loved playing different CDs of songs in the car. I started learning an instrument myself in 2011 - the piano. At first, I didn\u2019t like playing it very much. I probably would have quit if my parents didn\u2019t push me to continue. I don\u2019t regret it though since I am able to hear songs I like and play them without digging up scores now. When I\u2019m feeling down, I\u2019ll play around with one of my favourite songs and feel better. Just tinkling on the piano has the wonderful ability to lift my mood. When I\u2019m sad, I play sad songs. When I\u2019m angry, I hit the notes as hard as I can. I started writing a lot in fourth grade. At that time, I would enter daily journal entries about my day and write about the shenanigans of school life. I would also express my thoughts, feelings and secrets through my writing. As already mentioned in another answer of mine, my diary was the keeper of my secrets, my closest confidant and my ranting bag. My thoughts and ideas flowed more naturally when I wrote than when I spoke. This is true till today, though I have gotten better at talking to people. These three forms of \u201cart\u201d are very important to me. Sometimes, I have feelings which I don\u2019t really know how to express to other people, or I don\u2019t trust people to keep a secret, so I write it. Sometimes I need to sort out my thoughts, so I write a little to do that. Playing the piano makes me happier and helps me \u201cvent\u201d my emotions. Drawing (or doodling, rather) keeps me awake through boring lessons. Drawing things also help me to stay motivated. Drawing is a common talking point for me and my friends. I am also considering pursuing a career which requires me to draw a lot. I don\u2019t know another career path which I am more interested in. You know they say, you are a collage of all your favourite things. If I couldn\u2019t draw, write or play the piano, I would lose a very big part of me. I\u2019d be pretty much lost without art in my life. It\u2019s definitely of high importance to me. Have a good day! ",

            "answer_text": "This is the question I\u2019m answering - just in case someone changes the wording: How important is art in your life? I learned to draw before I learned to talk. I learned to paint before I learned to write. I learned to make interesting pictures that lots of people liked a lot, while everyone else was watching cartoons. I started painting in Watercolors when I was 11 years old. I did my first 6ft x 30ft. mural in colored chalk of the Hoover Damn with the Colorado River on the blackboard in my 8th grade class, when I was only 13 years old - it was left there for the rest of the school year, because everyone liked it. I started an Art School correspondence course with Famous Artist\u2019s Schools in Westport, Connecticut, when I was 15 years old. I started painting in oils on canvas when I was 17 years old. I started making nice picture frames for my own paintings when I was 19 years old. I had my first formal Museum Exhibition when I was only 21 years of age. That was in June of 1967, I also quit my day job as an emergency room L.P.N., Nursing School, and Theological Seminary in the same month\u2026 to be a full time Artist. \u201cI never looked back.\u201d Today my very beautiful original Artwork is in Museums and important collections in nine countries. Collectors in high places say that \u201cI\u2019m doing my very best work ever in the past few years.\u201d Recently I was inducted into the Marquis Who\u2019s Who Albert Nelson Marquis Lifetime Achievement Award Society and received the Award in the month of January and posted on the Marquis Homepage February 20th of this year. The Award is here: https://wwlifetimeachievement.com/2020/ In conclusion, Art has been the general focus of my entire life, and I\u2019m still painting.

            "answer_text": "ART is a widely ranged word that makes an impact on every aspect of our life. Look at those things you are using every day in your life. From toothpaste to the shower curtain, from bed sheet to shirt, all are represented with a bit sense of art. Imagine, what would happen if those marketed without having any pleasant sense of art? Actually, we are habituated with those things in our normal life and have a very short time to evaluate those things in an artistic manner due to our fast lifespan. We like to drink coffee or tea but overlooked the charming design of that coffee cup or just concluded this way, - \u201cit\u2019s good\u201d. How good is it? Who composed this design? What did the artist mean with this nice design? Think about a long blank space of your wall. How good is it? Now, hang a painting on that blank wall and try to understand the difference of the look of your room. Color makes us charm and has the ability to improve our lives. Color therapy is now a well-known treatment in modern medical science. It has won language. At the past, when I was making paintings of musical series, I discovered nice stuff. In our ancient Indian musical scripture, that anonymous author described the figurative form of musical scales like SA, RA, GA, MAA etc and defined the body color of those figurative forms that would convey the seasonal effect in our soul. As an instance, think about the rainy season in India. What should be the body color of that figurative musical form? Most probably, it would be the same as the rainy cloud. No, because it accordingly should have the ability to make an impact on the human mind. Below is an example of that figurative form I composed based on the Megh-Raga.  You probably noticed that the body color of the male figure is red, Why? because it indicates the storm and the calamity appear with the rain. The overall composition followed that ancient musical scripture which makes the impact of the rainy season. We love the rainy season and a similar thought also make us romantic in the form of music or painting. Without having ART, most probably our civilization would be incomplete in any manner. Remember, to write a history of human civilization in any ear, historians have to depend on the literature, art, music and other folk culture to make it authenticate. This is why we need art to make our lives more pleasant and hopeful. ",

            "answer_text": "Art refers to so many connective areas of our life - visual arts, sculpture, architecture, cathedrals, music, dance, theatre, film, TV, literary works, poetry, martial arts\u2026 For those partaking of art, who are riding the magical ball spun by others, it leads to connection, and aha moments, to wider and wider concepts about living and meanings. About uniqueness, separateness, and community. For those producing art, it is a journey of exploration, a \u201cwhat if?\u201d moment, a challenge to be greater than you are, a mountain to climb, an inner world to conquer. If I was to pick just ONE example, out of multi-millions of possible examples, I would use the film and narrative of The Life of Pi. The concept and literary work was written by Yann Martel, a French Canadian. The film was scripted by David Magee, and the film was directed by Ang Lee. Quite a cast of talent went into the making of this one artistic expression (and it was commercially viable: it grossed US$609 million, on a budget of US$120 million). The endeavour alone of turning a book into a film brought a lot of people employment for a time. I personally saw the film twice, and that may not be enough to comprehend all the aspects of meaning and literary devices to be found within it. The story itself has so many twists and turns, and mind-expanding imagery.    Bringing the concept of natural bioluminescence into the minds of thousands of film-goers is, in itself, something quite stunning. Importance is of course, subjective. Food may be the only important thing in your life. I guess if you lived in dire poverty, that could very well be a true statement. Unbelievably, for thousands of people living on this planet it is true. But art is how you feed your mind. Food for the mind, which for many, we can\u2019t live without. ",

I find that if I go too long without actually creating things, I get incredibly antsy and I literally begin to lose functionality.  I start getting really aggravated by minor frustrations, I snap at people, and the quality of my work begins to suffer.   Additionally, I would hate a bland world that is lacking art.  Between all the fiction (and non-fiction) books I read, the streaming TV shows I watch during dinner, the video and board games I play, the galleries I visit, the art stores I paint at, the designing that goes on in my print shop - nearly every aspect of my live revolves around art in some way.   My partner is also and artist, and so most things the two of us talk about relate to art in some way, shape, or form.   I think art is vital to humans as well.  It may just resonate with some of us more than others, but art really permeates our way of life, whether it's the design of your plates to the design of your house, or the bus you take, or the shows we all watch.  I'm writing this from a hotel room, and there's art in the desk that's in my room, and the overall design of the hotel lobby.   Art gives us something to enjoy, and I think without it, we would all live in grey concrete slab rooms that are perfectly square with no decorations and we'd all wear the same bland parka-things and we'd all be perfectly miserable in our boringness.

That can mean writing something for myself, or it can mean posting something here. It can mean going to a performance or a museum to view the works of other people. It can mean being a part of a participatory improv or costume event where I interact with a group or have made a costume. It can mean making a drawing or using digital painting and my photos to make a stop motion animation of my dog rolling around at the park, which I did this morning: \u00a00:00-0:30 Art being a part of my life doesn\u2019t mean I force it to be a part of other people\u2019s lives. Although it makes me glad when it is: creative expression is a gift and teaches creative problem solving and other life skills that go far beyond making something aesthetically interesting to look at or experience. As an adult this feels pretty optional but amazing : I think it\u2019s vital as education in schools. Art being a part of my life doesn\u2019t mean anyone necessarily understands how much a part of my life art is. Some of the people who went to art school with me are much more commercially successful as artists. Some are fabulous and persistent, talented artists. Some are pretentious pricks. For them, the emperor is naked.

Not how anyone else thinks that \u201cshould\u201d be done or imagines that might seem. I hope that\u2019s how many people include the things they love in their lives. But I respect if it\u2019s not.

It's my profession, and I am committed to it, so it comes second only to the people in my life (and sometimes they have taken a back seat to my career development too, if I am being honest with myself. An art education requires any, every, and all available resources, for years, to do properly.) And an art practice requires no less dedication of time and resources.  It was important enough that I chose to live in a poor neighborhood in a smaller apartment rather than a nice house in a better place. My mansions are my best paintings. :) It was also important enough that I decided not to have kids so that I could pursue my work. So instead of a growing family I have a growing body of work. Many working artists can and do make great parents too, but I felt that I couldn't do both and so I chose art. Seeing masterpieces in museums helps me reconnect with myself and it's like seeing lights in the dark if I feel lost about where my work is going. Working in the studio can take away my stress and even physical pain if I am not feeling well.  I take great joy in introducing a friend to artists in the museum they haven't seen (or being introduced to new work by other artists.) It also makes me happy that the things I know about art and art making are things I can pass on to other people when I teach art. It makes me happy when someone buys one of my paintings and it becomes clear how happy they are to have that addition to their home. Thank you for the A2A and good luck with everything! ",

As a child I coped with loneliness through writing stories about animals and illustrating them, and at 18 I wanted to go to Art School but my parents didn\u2019t like the idea, so I studied art and design to become a teacher instead. Later I found a way of working part time and painting 3 days a week at a studio space with other artists in the East End of London. Falling in love with someone who had given up a successful career in business to study art, gave me the confidence to further my training at a London art school. I have always thought of art as taking my life on a journey, that brings me into contact with people and places which become very important to me. And so it brought me here to Spain where I fell in love with the country and a particular person who later became the father of my two children. However for several years while my children were little, I stepped off the path of Art, and began to feel lost; until making up stories to tell my children, which I wrote down and illustrated, brought back the need to spend more time being creative. After my divorce, art became my whole way of life. Not just bringing me into contact with new people and experiences but showing me the way forward as a light through difficult circumstances. ",

Unless you are a total recluse in a dark room, live in a dense jungle, or in a lonely remote dwelling without Radio, T.V, transport P.C, or visitors, it is pretty difficult to shut off all avenues to visual or audible intrusion upon the senses. you would see some form of visual arts such as illustrated adverts or canned music.

As a child, I used to draw everywhere I could. I would draw on the bottom of the kitchen table and even on my bedroom door. My mom did not like that. I definitely saw some punishment for that, but it didn't stop me from creating.  As a child, I wanted to be a Disney animator. When I saw  Maleficent turn into a mighty dragon for the first time, I was mesmerized. I never felt my illustration skills were up to par, but that didn't end my passion for art. In college I chose to work in digital media. This allowed me to marry my loves of technology and art. I have been work as a web designer ever since. Yet I still felt something lacking. That was until a few years ago. That was when I decided I would mix my passion for art and my knowledge of the digital world. Now, I have made it my mission to help artists get their work out to the world. Many artists need help realizing their full potential. They create great art, but don't know how to share it with more people. I am actively trying to help them doing that. Through my website and podcast on creativity, I am trying to show artists what is possible with hard work and know how. ",

Since Art is one of the known peaceful forms, that engages people either in direct dialogue with society on different levels, raising subjects of education, humanity, politics, social differences and spiritual growth. Besides that, Art is growing \"divine\" in us, a sense of universal belonging to the world without geographical boarders, ethnic religious or national differences. When we look at Art, we experience emotions and feelings that don't differentiate us on the base of sex, skin colour, age, social status, we all have a door of letting Art's influence into our emotional process. The process that makes us think, observe, react, assume and act. All of that brings change and in my eyes it is a better change. Art transforms the change in the forms of music, painting, performing, acting, writing, sculpturing, cooking, designing, producing and many many more. The most important and very simple task for any human is to be a better person and Art Industry tools are perfect resources helping to achieve that. ",

My grand grand father was also an artist, and one of my ancester was Jose Mar\u00eda Espinosa:  He was a famous painter but also he was called \"El Abanderado\", the person who carried the flag during the battles for the independence of Colombia. So art has been around since I was a child.  I started to draw when I was 10 until I was 18, but then I thought I couldn't life of my art, so I decided to study other things. 12 years later, for circumstances of life, I started to draw and paint again. And since then, I haven't been able (nor that I want to do it) to stop working. Right now I'm doing the two things I like more, painting and writing. Both are ways of doing art and I love both but I know I cannot life from writing. At least not from writing novels (I don't like the betseller type of book).  So even though I'm going to keep writing, I'm focusing mainly in my plastic art work. It's what I am, and what I enjoy. I have been lucky in having great parents that support me. Money has never been a real issue in my life (I mean, I haven't been poor), but I am extremely aware of its importance. That's why I didn't choose to do art until I was 30. I always feel I couldn't life and make any money. Big mistake. You should do what you are passionate about and money will come. Art is now my life. I wouldn't see myself doing nothing else.   ",

Nothing distracts your focus except your inspiration as you yearn to complete what you are doing and review the product of your achievement. Such is the addictiveness of art.

So, the broader answer is, \u201cArt defines much of who I am and what I accomplish as a human being.\u201d In this regard it is not so much a profession as it is a life discipline. I, like every other human, was born with an innate curiosity. I now this because I am alive. If we weren\u2019t curious and seeking , we would die for lack of nourishment.That seeking, questing curiosity drove our first encounters and helped to set \u201cus\u201d apart from everything else. That proprioceptive sense, exercised early, helped us see others and others. OK- What art does is postpone the erosion of curiosity, inquiry, and search. The questions art asks are, \u201cWhat if \u2026, How might \u2026, If, then \u2026, Etc. These are questions of dreamers. Dreamers live in the lands beyond the current means. Artists live there almost constantly, so do innovators. If I had no art in my life I would have no song to sing (the song that Thoreau said mostly dies inside us unsung), no countenance that anyone would care to see, no life outside the day-night progression of days that mark our time- nothing to note. It may be different for others but that is the importance for me. Best Wishes and hopes that you get many good responses. ",

            "answer_text": "As Michelle has pointed out \"art\" includes such a wide variety of media that is pretty much woven into the fabric of the world we live in, that its difficult to imagine a place without it. Music of some form is all pervading, as is evidenced by the number of people one sees wearing headphones, graphic art is ubiquitous, to the point of being a kind of background noise of images. It quite obviously cannot all be of the highest quality, so from that point of view one can question quite how \"important\" it is. From another point of view, music in particular can define a kind of social grouping that the individual can be a part of, and is used to cut out the rest of the world to give a sense of personal space....or as an aid to concentration. I think the majority would say for those reasons  it is both important AND essential. If you are talking about \"High\" art....that passes on ideas and feeds the spirit, so to speak....then it is far less important, even though it should be. I take the view that enough of it gets through the \"white noise\" and clutter, that good does come of it, though it may be a long slow process like a drip feed; even a TV or Movie version of a great book will pass on a little of its content, and hopefully encourage a few of those that normally wouldn't, to turn the pages.The arts that surround us helps to define the culture we are a part of. Inventive and questioning, it is in a constant state of change, and that change challenges us with new things, that questions our taste and our values, and that has to be healthy. ",

I don\u2019t consider those arenas as arts, but as crafts or elevated hybrids. i can only speak to what I see in America. Art probably means more to people now than anytime in the past. But we are a young country full of families with a long history of hard scrabble living or new immigrants who gave up everything to come here. Art had/has nothing to do with staying alive. The major art loving areas mainly are in the big cities, especially along the east coast, not in the bread basket or 100 miles south of Alberta. Limited exposure, limited art. Creating & appreciating art require exposure to good art, training, & the economic ability to give time to it. As I docent I can see the awakening to art in the faces of the children I guide. Give America a few more generations & the love of Art will be widespread. ",

With mankind its being Art first, before the science and technology follows. Art is the best means of catharsis. The very basis of advancement in science and technology, is determined by the creative mind of the Artist. So Art gingers science and technology, and is given accomplishment by Art. For instance, all the sophistry needed in modern movies, is dreamed of by creative scripting, the scientists go to work on that, and fulfill the yearnings of viewers. Any society, denied of arts, suffers asphyxia in all human endeavours. Arts, engenders brotherhood, values, norms. It is a time capsule of human kind, and equally exposes the science and advancement. It aids the language and all means of communication. The Art of a period, tells alot about its people and values. ",

            "answer_text": "Great question and deserves a lot of explanation, but I will make it short. Enjoying any type of artwork, for example music or a painting, can stimulate dopamine production in the brain which is responsible for making us feel happy and promotes positive emotions. Art therapy has been used for healing and improving general wellbeing throughout history. Art making is known to be a source of relaxation and it is a great method of self-expression. Almost everyone realises the music they enjoy and brings them joy and happiness. We individually identify colours and shapes we like, too. Colour psychology and the effects of colours on people's moods and thoughts play a major part in our individual lives. Colour therapy (or colourology) was used in Ancient Egypt and Ancient China for healing. Art is an expressive language that interprets sounds, shapes, images, lines and colours in ways which words cannot. It connects deep inside our feelings. Surrounding ourselves with things that we like can definitely improve the quality of life. ",

Although I do have evidence in photos of the inside of my parents house with scribbles all over the walls. My father played guitar and was a professional photographer/videographer while I was growing up. We also had many paintings hanging around our home.  It didnt stop there though, I continued drawing throughout highschool and taught myself the guitar. I would take all the art and music electives that I could. I never really considered making art a career until a few years after highschool though. I moved from a small backwater town in northern New York to Toronto, because there was more oppourtunity. I didnt have any money for school and had no idea what I wanted to do with my life. I specifically remember what resparked my desire to make art. I reread \"The Da Vinci Code\" by Dan Brown, and from there it was like a tidal wave. I read and watched everything I could about Leonardo then the rest of the renaissance greats, soon I was trying to find out everything about every type and style of art. I began painting, which up to this point I had only done drawings. And now three years later, I am getting closer and closer to my goal of being able to paint like the old masters. I still have a long way to go, but it always keeps me interested and is pretty much all I think about now.  So in conclusion art isnt just important in my life, art is my life. There isnt much room for anything else any more. ",

Everyday unless I'm not feeling well (which sometimes I'll still do it) or having a terrible art block I draw. How long do I draw? I try to do an hour minimum which it's not as if I time myself but when I notice my clock states 10:30 pm I can figure out how long I've been at it. With everyday life you'll go out and about to the store or hang out with some friends but that hour will still be somewhere in the day. When I'm writing this it's summer break so I've went three- four hours at a time on a painting or in my sketchbook. I love art, it's my passion (sounds cliche because it is), and I want to use this passion for a living (still cliche). Not only do I work in visual arts I also do creative writing. I'm working on a novel right now and the amount of research I have to do kills me (but I love it). When I'm around creative people I feel that we click more, even if we don't do the same mediums or styles. When I speak, I try to be creative with my sentences along with my vocabulary ( I like learning if you couldn't tell already). Art is the first thing I really became hardworking in, it's something that I do in my free time so I don't have free time. Art's many things but I'm not going to go reading off a list. To sum up my answer: art is pretty damn vital :) ",

I enjoy people's creativity in my major Canadian city neighbourhood. There are over 130 murals in a 30 x 8 block area. I've had the privilege of preparing them as street banners, walking past them, and the original murals they came from a time or 2 a week. We're prepping 11 history boards of significant homes and buildings, naming the architect and style, with an archival and a modern photo for each one. Who was the owner, what was the story too. They'll be on light standards across from the home or business. Mount Pleasant was the cities first suburbs in 1888. Best job I've ever had; hands down. Economic development for businesses. A neighbourhood that in 1990 had more than 50 arts groups meeting there. Most have moved to cheaper digs but the spirit of the like minded people who\u2019s friends moved here is part of the local tone. A majority of businesses reflect local tastes. Craft beer is the rage. Farm to table food. Street festivals. Vancouverites like food from all over the world. There's another art form. I'm thankful to my mentor, she opened my eyes to art as part of community building. Joining seniors to kids from the centre's day care to paint street banners. Developing Grants that involved matching credible donors. My man is home see ya later. I enjoyed telling my story. ",

The Prime Minister [Neville Chamberlain], who spoke with so much feeling and thought on this subject, has reminded us of the old saying that it is by art man gets nearest to the angels and farthest from the animals. Indeed it is a pregnant thought. Here you have a man with a brush and palette. With a dozen blobs of pigment he makes a certain pattern on one or two square yards of canvas, and something is created which carries its shining message of inspiration not only to all who are living with him on the world, but across hundreds of years to generations unborn. It lights the path and links the thought of one generation with another, and in the realm of price holds its own in intrinsic value with an ingot of gold. Evidently we are in the presence of a mystery which strikes down to the deepest foundations of human genius and of human glory. Ill fares the race which fails to salute the arts with the reverence and delight which are their due.\u201d ",

It's purely a joy to listen to music, admire a painting or even read a poem. Good movies are also a piece of art. The characters on the screen can connect to you with some touching dialogues, melodious Background music, face expressions and a story you can feel related to it. Art is not something that evolved in a civilized society. Tribal people have their own music and dance. Early humans painted on caves way before they learned to speak or write. Art influences every individual everyone irrespective of its importance in their life. The diverse art and culture of different places inspire a modern human to travel all over the world. Art of a present culture becomes the history that future country. Most of the religious books are in poetry form. Many worship places of religion are a piece of artwork.

From that day on I drew every day, even to this day, even while waiting for my cancer op, Christmas Day, Boxing Day, even when I\u2019ve been very ill.

Without creativity, sales would not increase and life would go on pretty much as normal but, taken back in time, that would mean we\u2019d still be living in trees. Certainly without creativity there would be no technology, nor yet the ability to solve the problems technology sometimes causes. We are creative because we are artists.

I have always had problems with holding onto friendships, love, which I want to consider the most important thing in life, but people tend to let me down and not value me as much as I have the capacity to value them. People are myopic, self centered, and I have gone in and out of this jaded feeling of depression and a feeling of giving up on life because I never seem to find that reciprocation and feeling of community. Art ultimately serves as my mission to leave behind the findings of my analysis of living life, society and theories about the universe. I am devoted to that. Maybe I will be able to communicate something about the way life should be, and be part of a change that benefits people of the future. There seem to be immutable truths that guarantee the continuation of human suffering, but we can\u2019t know if those can be overcome unless we try to communicate our ideas. ",

Makes us question ourselves, our morality, such as it is, our society in which we are all forced to live, whatever it may be. As a species, we are constantly asking questions. Whence do I come? What is my purpose, if any? If I have a purpose, what might it be? How does a statistical probability manifest itself into a world in which such things do not appear? Such questions may not, in truth, be privy to any kind of answer but still we ask. Art, being a human construct, asks the questions in a slightly different way. We should be thankful that it does. ",

Everyone has heard of them. How many entrepreneurs do we know by name further than 100 years ago? Henry Ford. Will we know who Steve Jobs was 50 years from now?

If you look at older written works you can see they spawn the future in many cases. If you look at how art progresses it follows a odd circle around technology. Technology is feed by the dreamers who dream of the possibilities. Technology allows us to dream bigger. Many times art helps other areas progress. We may not be able to put a term to it. We may not be able to define it. The effect of art is apparent everywhere. If art was unimportant it would not generate so much debate. If art disappeared today, progress would certainly slow down in the not so distant future.  Words like essential are accurate (as Michelle Gaugy stated).

The thing is, if the heroines experience the gloomy things (especially those in the wars or\u2026), I would feel sad and while I am in the real world I will think I am in such a peaceful or good world that I should be more hard-working and positive toward my life, as a reward. If the novels are happy-endings, I will also feel satisfied, because those are exactly what I hope. When it comes to the broad environments, like countries and international relationships. Compared to other things, art is relatively more accessible and I believe people will be more rational if they know more about the world. Of course, some would be led to a wrong direction if they touch something harmful. It seems that people can be aware of the emotions rooted in the art pieces without the same languages, which I think is so amazing. ",

And we see visual art in advertisements and in our places of religious worship and in constantly on the internet. The arts are so woven into our existence that I'm not certain that \"important\" is the correct word. I think perhaps that \"essential\" is the word that is more appropriate. The arts travel with our humanity. They alway have, and I suspect, always will. They express parts of us that words are inadequate to express and they bind us together in ways that we need. They operate on the level of the heart and the soul, and we cannot do without them. ",

My all time number one painter is Jeroen Bosch. I have a collection of books written about hos works, his live, etc. In music, I enjoy jazz, but only when I can pnay an LP. I don\u2019t like listening to jazz on a cd or so. It ruins the warm and mellow sound when digitally remastered. But I also like new wave: The Sisters of Mercy, Joy Division, The Cure,.. I like the progressive rock by Pink Floyd. I really liked Nirvana and I have a huge collection of everything by The Doors. ",

I consider multiple disciplines\u2014visual arts, music, performing arts, various disciplines of design\u2014to be art, and I have been a creator, a fundraiser, an expert, and a layperson of different kinds of art. When a work is beautifully made and moves something inside you, it can impact your entire life. I have remembered specific scenes from movies; massive paintings that stopped me in my tracks; the most delicate movement of a ballerina's hand. When I create something that I am truly proud of, it sticks with me. I can recall the emotions I felt when I was making it; the moment when things clicked and the piece felt complete; the sense of accomplishment when people felt moved or impressed by my work. Enjoying art when you are fully present and appreciative is an emotional high, and I encourage everyone to at least try to pursue or appreciate one art form of their choice. When you get that moment, even if it only happens rarely, it's all worth it.  ",

Art is so broad and fluid that without it the world would be barren and uninhabitable. ( at least I believe this to be true for most intellectuals as well as artists. Personally no art would be a death sentence. A tortuous one at that. Slow and painful. Lack of color and imagination. Without hope and despair. It allows us to be unique and individual in a world of cookie cutter people and things. When one looses their sense of self we lose everything. ",

Those who are true artists create because they MUST. Its in their makeup, its a need that is forever present. A constant effort to give some form to what is seen inside their mind. If you are asking the question of those who are not \u201cartists\u201d then look to yourself (assuming you are not an artist) for that answer. Your reply would fall within a full spectrum of importance as well as range of art forms. Someone might say \u201cart is unimportant\u201d but dress in the most current fashion. Some might never visit an art museum but have a huge collection of music. IMO art is a way to escape the reality of life which also ranges from person to person. If you struggle to feed, clothe and shelter yourself then art may not even exist. If I haven\u2019t answered your question, then clarify what your asking in your next attempt at the question. ",

To shut myself up in solitude and create something, to draw to paint to sculpt, glue, cut and snip; the smell of turp and a swipe of paint on my blue jeans; the buzz in my brain and the palpitation of my heart. How important? It is at the core of who I am. Sometimes when I am forced to stop art-making because of life events and circumstances, I get very exhausted if I can\u2019t get back to it soon. If it is a long time - like maybe several weeks, I get droopy and distracted and malaise sets in. Just imagine if someone prevented you from eating\u2026 ",

Creation is such an elegant image that its complexities seem simple. That\u2019s art. That\u2019s beauty. I\u2019m never going to be able to, but try to emulate it in my work. And, I pay for the joy of it by doing my best. When I finish and get to sign one of my pieces, my heart lifts and offers that joy to the energies of the Universe. I let the piece go to try do more with the next one. I\u2019m inspired. I\u2019d be lost without the art of creation, within Creation. I can\u2019t resist saying thank you, every day.

It ornaments the world I live in and helps explain the long-gone worlds that led me to this point in time. Art makes me embrace the past and feel hopeful about the future. It makes me laugh and it sobers me up when reality requires it. Art is the distraction I so often need and demands that I focus on what matters most.

There were no blinding lights blurring out shadows which are as much a part of vision as light itself. Without shadow how is one to detect the beauty that is in the light? In a simpler time people weren't being assaulted from every direction with what purports to be \"breaking news\". They knew who they were and understood the simple requirements of surviving in life integrated with the need for simplicity and beauty. And so it is that my paintings are simple and beautiful (I hope) and perhaps return us, if only for a short time, to a world that is a bit less frenzied and a bit more stable. ",

I would compare it to suddenly losing the sense of taste. I spend a lot of my free time on photography. Occasionally I get good photographs. I regularly visit the municipal art gallery. I am also one of those (I'm sure) annoying people who visits art auctions and doesn't buy anything, just looks. The Internet is also a blessing as I can look at paintings that are in galleries overseas. I read a lot about the philosophy behind the various art movements - this is almost essential to appreciate the paintings/sculptures. So, If I had to give a figure, I'd say 7/10 - I don't need to sell my creations to get by, but if nobody made works of art the world would be a very dreary place for me. ",
