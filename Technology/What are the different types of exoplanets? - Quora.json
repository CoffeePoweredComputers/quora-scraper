            "answer_text": "Exoplanets are generally classified on the basis of a few characteristics like: MassOrbitComposition Classified by mass Giant planet \u2014 A massive planet; generally composed of gases or \u2018ices\u2019 like ammonia, methane, water etc.Mesoplanet \u2014 Planets that are smaller than Mercury but larger than Ceres.Mini-Neptune \u2014 Planets smaller than Uranus and Neptune.Planemo \u2014 Planetary-mass object that does not have any activity in its core.Planetar \u2014 Brown dwarfs or sub-brown dwarfs. They\u2019re pseudo-planets.Super-Earth \u2014 Greater mass than Earth, but lesser than Uranus and Neptune.Super-Jupiter \u2014 Planets more massive than Jupiter.Sub-Earth \u2014 Planets less massive than Earth.Classified by orbit Circumbinary planet \u2014 A planet orbiting binary star systems.Double planet \u2014 Two planets orbiting each other.Eccentric Jupiter \u2014 Massive planets that have highly eccentric orbits.Extragalactic planet \u2014 Planets that are not in the Milky Way.Goldilock\u2019s planet \u2014 A planet in the habitable zone of its star.Hot Jupiter \u2014 Massive gas giants orbiting close to its star.Hot Neptune \u2014 Less massive gas giants orbiting close to its star.Pulsar planet \u2014 Planets orbiting pulsars.Rogue planet \u2014 Interstellar planets.Classified by composition Ice planet \u2014 A planet predominantly composed of solid ammonia, methane or water (ice).Iron planet \u2014 A planet that has an iron rich core with no mantle.Lava planet \u2014 A planet whose surface is completely covered with lava.Ocean planet \u2014 A planet whose substantial fraction of its mass is made of water.Silicate Planet \u2014 A planet whose crust is made of silicate rocks.Terrestrial planet \u2014 A planet like Earth, made of rocks. Since sufficient data\u2014like composition of core, crust, mantle, density etc.\u2014is not available to deduce conclusions about exoplanets, they are classified broadly as: Gas giantsHot JupitersSuper EarthsRogue PlanetsPulsar PlanetsWater WorldsChthonian Planets \u2014 Gas giants that have migrated closer to its star after its formation.Exo Earths Related Info-graphic:  To know more about the detection of exoplanets, read: How do astronomers find an exoplanet?

            "answer_text": "Five of the exoplanet types refer only to size (mass and diameter). In order, from smallest to biggest, they are rocky planets; super-Earths; mini-Neptunes; ice giants; and gas giants. Planets in the super-Earth and mini-Neptune size range may be ocean planets, having liquid-water oceans hundreds of kilometers deep. ",
