            "answer_text": "How did Apple beat Samsung to the one trillion dollar value with Samsung involved in many other products? Samsung and Apple have completely different strategies and this shows in their products and in their financial results. Samsung is active in hundreds of product categories and is aiming to sell good enough products at a competitive price. This results in high sales figures, but a low margin for profit. Apple on the other hand is active in a very limited number of product categories and is aiming to sell premium products at a premium price, which results in lower overall sales than other manufacturers, but has a very high profit margin. There is a lot more at play of course, but in its simplest form I think that is the reason that Apple outperforms Samsung in general and the stock market \u2018appreciates\u2019 that by paying a lot for Apple shares with a market cap of more than 1.000.000.000.000 US Dollars as a result.

            "answer_text": "Sometimes focus is better than diversity. Ok, so the one trillion value is market capitalization. This means that you take the number of shares of the company and multiply by the share value and it\u2019s over one trillion. I.e. it\u2019s a really a measure of what the stock market thinks about the company. That\u2019s a little different from what consumers think. Capitalization is related to things like future earnings and profit margin and the anticipated revenue. By focusing obsessively on a few things with a higher profit margin. Apple keeps the profit margin up with a high investment in both design and in research and development. Ie keeping the focus on new things with less competition. In this way, via future anticipated revenue, Apple is worth more to the stock market than Samsung which has many things at much lower margins. Samsung is a valuable company, it does many things outside of phones though. Most of those are in quite competitive markets with lower profit margins and lower revenue expectations. ",
