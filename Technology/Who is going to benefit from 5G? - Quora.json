            "answer_text": "The future applications that will use 5G are endless and will impact almost everybody both directly through personal use and indirectly with IoT solutions that support your everyday life such as smart city applications. The industrial applications are already being rolled out utilising private 5G networks. Looking at the technological advances 5G offers over 4G we are all aware of the amazing high speeds we\u2019ve been told about for years. Less is mentioned about the network slicing capabilities, increasing the current limitation on the number of IoT devices from a few thousand to one million per square km and the super low latency 5G will bring. Another benefit is that the cost per Gb is expected to drop dramatically over the coming years. ",

            "answer_text": "First, ISPs as 5G deploys in urban areas first as it requires no service guy to visit and add you to the service. Second, local city services like parking, surveillance, drone, driverless deliveries. Then the 5G pricing will go up on subscribers like you and I to pay for infrastructure. Third the set up of highways will get lots of attention for the first driverless trucking. Trucking wins. Then 5G pricing goes up more. Rural areas will never receive 5g 100g unless you are within 500 feet of an interstate or where there are sufficient subscribers. Secon ",
