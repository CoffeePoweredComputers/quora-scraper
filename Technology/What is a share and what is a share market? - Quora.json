            "answer_text": "[For beginners] Suppose I want to start a business. I need a 1000 rupees for that, but I only have 600 with me. I offer my friends to be partners in my business. Two of them - F1 and F2 - agree and they contribute 200 each. Our business takes off and, by virtue of our respective contributions, my share in the business is 60%, while F1 and F2 hold 20% each. Here, Rs. 1000 is the equity capital of our business. Our business is running cool and we now plan to expand it. We want to double the equity capital of our business so that we may increase our production. Thus we need Rs. 1000 more (to make our equity capital Rs. 2000). This time we don't ask individual friends, we just spread the word around that we are planning to expand and anyone is welcome to contribute. This is called public offering. 10 gentlemen come forward with Rs. 100 each. Thus each of them becomes a shareholder of the company, holding 5% share each (100/2000*100). If we divide the Rs. 2000 equity capital into 20 parts of Rs. 100 and call each part a share, then every gentleman holds 1 share of the company, while I hold 6 shares (I had contributed 600 in the beginning, remember?) For all practical purposes, a shareholder is an owner of the company to the extent of his shareholding. The gentleman holding 5% share will receive 5% of the profits of the company as dividends when the same are given out. In all major decision involving the running of the business, each shareholder has voting rights and the weight of their vote is in accordance with their shareholding. Now we come to the more interesting part. A shareholder of a \u201cpublic\u201d company (not to be confused with government owned company) is free to sell his shares to anyone else. This is basically what happens in the share market (BSE, NSE, NYSE, etc). People buy & sell shares of the hundreds of companies listed on the share market/stock market (Shares & Stocks are the same thing). The company is NOT involved in these transactions. If a company is doing well, people would love to own a part of it, thus the price of shares of that company would increase due to the rise in its demand. Mr. A who had bought 1 share of my company at Rs. 100, now sells it to Mr. B at Rs. 120. That 20 rupees is solely Mr. A\u2019s gain. Mr. B now has 1 share of the company. However, irrespective of the price at which people buy/sell shares in the stock market, the company would treat the price of each as Rs. 100 only. That's the price at which it had originally sold the shares in the public offering. That price is called the face value. The voting rights & dividends are based on face value. The price at which people buy/sell in the stock market is the market value. Now you might be wondering, why is the stock market so bustling? Are people really eager to own a part of companies? Not really. Most people participate in the stock market to make gains out of the rise and fall of the share prices. That's called day trading. When people feel that the share prices of a company is going to rise as it is doing good, they buy the shares of that company, only to sell later when (& if) the price actually rises. So day trading is all about speculation. If your hunch is good, you make money; if your guesses go bad, you lose. However, saner minds participate in the share market with a motive of investment. They buy shares of a company they feel might do well in the long run. They study the performance, vision, quality of the incumbent management, robustness of the products/services of the company before putting in their money. They also keep in mind the overall prevailing health of the economy or particular sectors thereof before investing. They use their voting rights judiciously and enjoy whatever dividends the company doles out. Sensex/Nifty are just aggregates of share prices of a bunch of companies. We cannot track all the shares at a time. Thus we make an index out of a basket of shares to understand the mood of the market. Sensex and Nifty are indexes. ",

            "answer_text": "By buying a share, you are investing money in the company. As the company grows, the price of your share too will increase. You can get profit by selling the shares in the market. There are various factors that affect the price of a share. Sometimes the price can rise and sometimes it can fall.

Secondary Market: The shares bought in the primary market can be sold in the secondary market. The secondary market operates through over the counter (OTC) and exchange-traded markets. OTC markets are informal markets wherein two parties agree on a particular transaction to be settled in the future. Exchange-traded markets are highly regulated.

But if you have dependants and commitments, you can allocate more portion of money to bonds and less to equity. Buyback: The company buys back its share from the investors by paying a higher value than the market value. It buys back shares when it has a huge cash pile or to consolidate its ownership. ",
