            "answer_text": "About the same as a sword with two sharp edges. Science has brought about technology, and as a result we live in a society with many luxuries that couldn\u2019t have been dreamed of 100 years ago. We now no longer need to slave away on a farm, or have women die during childbirth for the most part. We can travel from one end of the earth to the other in short periods of time - much faster than what was traditionally possible by horse or weasel (weasels are useless at pulling sleds!), and we have more time to do the things that we want to do. Now, we have nice jobs, in nice places, with nice computer assisted/robotic assisted tasks to do, clean water, tasty food to eat and shoes that have been designed to exactly fit your foot. But\u2026there\u2019s some drawbacks. With all this extra technology, we have forgotten how to communicate with each other, social interaction skills are largely missing or incomplete in society. Large portions of the population would rather just throw an E-mail or a text message at someone else and expect that they\u2019ve read and understood it. The transition from farms to desks have brought about an unnatural level of posture related issues, eye-sight problems, radiation levels, as well as exposure to synthetic materials that \u2018bass-off\u2019 and slowly kill us via the \u2018slow-kill\u2019 process. Our food is largely tasty and pleasing to the eye, however it\u2019s generally always been sprayed heavily with pesticides just to keep the bugs off, and everything in this life is done purely for a profit. The children of this world are now consumed by little gadgets and \u2018screen time\u2019, they find it almost like a drug (as to even some adults). Can people remember what they used to do when they were on a train or a bus even 20 years ago? Patience is diminishing as we are all getting used to the \u201cI want it now\u201d syndrome that science has made possible, by making things so available in all aspects of life - things that become too easy are taken for granted. People become vain, self-centred, time-wasters, back-biters and vengeful, Science has created a divide between what has been used for good, and that which has been used for not-so-good. Sorry, I think my intentions were good about writing a really concise answer to this question, however I have been distracted by numerous computer related issues. I hope the point still got across though. Cheers! ",

            "answer_text": "Science and technology are the drivers behind things like health care, even equal rights and social justice. In medicine itself, science has enabled us to: Treat disease through immunization. At its peak, polio claimed the lives of almost half a million people. The lives of people infected were terrible - it causes paralysis (or the inability to move). Polio is almost eradicated now through global efforts for vaccination. Wiping Out Polio: How The U.S. Snuffed Out A KillerAntibiotics. Things like a urinary tract infection, or lung infection, or even tonsil infection may seem like minor issues but in the past, these were major problems that killed many people. Antibiotics were developed through research, and even have gotten us to the point where we consider HIV, which used to be deadly, a chronic illness.Surgery. The first suturing techniques (stitches) were first perfected in the 1900\u2019s which allowed us to remove organs that were dtysfunctioning, and tie up blood vessels that were leaking, and even attach new limbs, organs, or blood vessels to improve people\u2019s lives. Surgery involves a lot of new technology and there are even robotic approaches being developed.Structures of care. Although the electronic health record isn\u2019t perfect, it allows us to see patient\u2019s past histories easily and their lab values. We used to have to go to medical records and get a stack of patient charts, but now we can click through health information easily.There are important next steps however, with technology. This includes. Personalization of data. Even though we can say in a population 3/10 might have a heart attack, it doesn\u2019t do you much good to know that you might have a chance of a heart attack. We are moving towards new ways to analyze data and understand disease that can tell you with much more precision if you are at risk of disease.Improvement in systems of care. New technologies like blockchain have promise for ensuring data is easily accessed, stored, and reducing redundancy in health systems. This has important implications for patient\u2019s own data as well as drug delivery.There\u2019s a lot of other ways but technology and improvements in technology have enabled us to live much longer lives than those in developing countries (70\u201380 years vs. 50) and there are many more important things to come!

            "answer_text": "Over the last 2 to 3 decades, technology has become more and more a part of our daily lives, to the point where it has taken over our lives. Take a moment, stop reading this post and look around you. What do you notice? Do you see tech, gadgets, computers, video monitoring? Notice how our lives are surrounded by gadgets and tech appliances. The PC at your desk, the cell phone next to your bed, the Wifi router, shoot your thermostat \u2013 all these are examples of how technology has transformed every aspect of our lives. Some for the good and others may not be so good. In this post we are going to look at some of the latest feats in technology and analyze their positive and negative impact on our lives. The advent of smartphones has simplified our lives immensely. People now connect with their loved ones more frequently and easily through video calls and instant messaging services. Tasks, like creating slides, reading emails, and creating documents don\u2019t require a PC anymore. In a nutshell, smartphone and apps have changed the way we work, communicate and play. In addition, the booming expansion of e-commerce and internet-based companies is directly proportional to the rapid proliferation of smartphones. While the smartphone revolution has made our lives easy, it has also made us lazy. Today, the whole world is at our fingertips, and thus we don\u2019t have to work or move around like we did previously to get things done. Our sedentary lifestyle and lack of physical activities can be partly attributed to the over-dependence on smartphones. This is especially true for the younger generation, who are constantly glued to their cell phones. In the modern era, cell phone addiction is having a negative impact on our lives. Care needs to be taken to deal with this issue in an effective way. While the concept of Robotics and AI sounds exciting, it is not without its flaws. Many people believe that implementation of robotics and AI will lead to mass layoffs and unemployment. We have already seen how factory workers lost their jobs when automated assembly lines were introduced. Now, with driverless cars, intelligent chatbots, and more knocking at the door, it may turn out that drivers and customer support agents are going to have a hard time keeping their jobs.

Without it we would - quite literally - still be living in caves and worshipping the sun and moon, and cowering in fear when the earth shook or the local mountain spouted fire. Now - don\u2019t get me wrong, earthquakes and volcanoes are still pretty scary stuff, but at least we understand them and can deal with them on a slightly more rational basis than going \u201cTHE GODS ARE ANGRY! WE MUST SACRIFICE TWO DOZEN VIRGINS!\u201d because that didn\u2019t help anyone. Especially not the two dozen virgins. We live in a rational, scientific world and it is incumbent on us to do our best to understand it. And to try to tame it, so we can understand it more. It wasn\u2019t god, or any other divine being, that eradicated smallpox. It was science. And it was one of the greatest achievements of humanity in recent history. And speaking as someone who has had multiple surgeries and benefited from a fuckton of medical advances through my own lifetime, let alone all the medical advances that came before my lifetime, I am kind of glad science and technology and x-rays, and ecgs, and echo scans, and MRIs and so on came along, and I wasn\u2019t just reliant on witch doctors trying to detects the demons inside of me. Because that would have sucked. We live in a rational, scientific world. And as rational, scientific beings who have the ability to understand it, we owe it to our children, and future generations to give it our best endeavours to do that. ",

            "answer_text": "Here is my attempt to answer the question in an elementary sense. Since ancient times science and technology have played a major role in the survival and welfare of homo sapiens. Think of the invention and use of tools for hunting, for the production and cooking of food, the manufacture (the word originally meant making by hand) of clothing, the assembling of materials for constructing housing (along with the technology for building), etc. Today, technological advances are being made in medicine and neuroscience which go a long way to lengthening life expectancy. A second dimension is the use of science and technology in the development of art and a sense of the spiritual. Think of the study of the heavens, the search for fundamental elements which make life possible in infinite ways (e.g. earth, water, air, fire). This study continues to this day (e.g. the search for a unified theory of fundamental forces) and will always be part of our search for meaning and beauty. Think also of the technology of recording images in caves, creating sculpture and writing so as to leave a record for later generations. This in turn has led to educational systems that transfer information to successive generations more rapidly. In the past 120 years there has been a modern communications revolution leading to a sense of a global world. While the pace of development - especially in communications, science and technology - brings major challenges at the present time, there are opportunities for mankind to develop a more peaceful and conscious way of utilising science and technology for the greater benefit of mankind while protecting the natural environment. Hopefully, that will lead to more fulfilling lives and a brighter future for humanity. ",

Thanks to science-based medicine, nobody gets smallpox anymore. In the 20th Century alone, Smallpox was responsible for between 300 and 500 million deaths. The Second World War, by comparison, killed around 80 million. For the past 12,000 years, this disease terrorised the world; it killed peasants and kings alike, it shaped societies and destroyed them, it broke sieges and decimated armies. In more than one instance, entire wars have been won or lost off the back of a chance epidemic of smallpox. For 12,000 years, human civilisations were brought to their knees by this disease, and yet in the past 200 years we brought it under control. In 1958, when there were still 50 million new cases each year, the WHO declared war on smallpox. By 1979, the disease was wiped off the face of the earth. It's easy to forget the horror these diseases caused when few people today have had to live through them, and smallpox is absolutely not the only disease that humanity has brought to its knees through similar efforts, but it is so far the only human disease that has been completely destroyed as a result of the concerted, global efforts of science-based medicine. Nobody gets smallpox anymore. If that doesn't make your hair stand on end, go back and read it again, because it's important. ",

            "answer_text": "Expert answer of the following questions could drop the high HAI rates: 1. Is there or not human fecal dust* in hospital wards? 2. Is it or not a threat for patients, as causing HA Infection? (99.000 deaths /yr and 1.600.000 cases only in USA). 3. Is there a way to prevent its forming? *\u201cFECAL DUST: It comes from fecal residue, left AFTER wiping with t. paper (complete or, worse of course, incomplete) . Through drying and friction it turns out to dust and through air is going to all surfaces, at first stage the uro-genital organs, causing UTI, and later to all house, causing food contamination. That phenomenon is more intense in hospitals, as the patients are usually debilitated, weak, with mobility restriction etc, particularly if there are hemorrhoids or anus hair and are unable to wipe properly. So the flying fecal dust reaches to all ward surfaces, dispersing its pathogenic microbes and so being the cause, among others, of the known fatal HA INFECTIONS. The flying fecal dust emerges mainly from cloths of patients that can MOVE around, not the ones that are on pampers. Have in mind that in a more than 2 beds hospital wards, moisture and temperature conditions harbor microbes and also microbe density, due to constant feeding from feces residue on patients, is a one more factor that increases microbe chances in developing antibiotic resistance. It is obvious that the known hygiene measures, as is hand washing etc, are not enough, as now a new microbe source, up to now ignored, is added. Up to now NOT A SINGLE scientific study have ever doubted fecal dust\u2019s existence and its role on microbe dispersion, but however no hygiene measures are imposed or advice is given by Health Institutes, particularly to women to prevent UTI, or any guiding to hospital hygiene managers to reduce HAI and the growing danger of microbe resistant to antibiotics. Why a comparison test is not made between a hospital, where all the special measures to prevent human fecal dust forming are taken and those, where no special care is taken, as the usual practice is, regarding the HA infection rates, so a safe scientific decision to be made about fecal dust\u2019s role on causing HA infection? On the case this test is not done promptly, everyone is entitled to think, that there are very strong reasons that other interests, than public health protection, are guiding science research.\u201d ",

Science is a subset of technology. It is the study of techniques that have some distinct and easily expressible mathematical component. Easily, here, means that there are systems of symbols, equations, etc. that \"everyone\" knows. and uses. A person may not find it easy to learn and/or to use these systems of symbols, equations, etc. Basically, science is the business of understanding and expressing observable patterns such that any and every reader can reproduce the patterns perfectly, given the same data, equipment, etc. There are 6 foundational technologies in the world -- (the study of) hearing, speech, vision, taste, smell, touch, and thought. The closer that any product or service comes to improving any of these 6 things in an interesting (rather than practically useful) way, the more popular it will be and the more it will affect the operation of the world as we know it. The rest, in my opinion, falls under \"build a better mousetrap.\" I would prefer a technology that allows both, me and the mice to live, without me having to bother to trap them, etc. ",

Something as quick as a snack, or perhaps a longer more social affair with the family, or a date! Either way the demand for readily available and diverse food types is ever growing. The call for freshness means that food that is ready for consumption may have been picked, or harvested, only days or hours before. The technology needed to keep this happening for a growing world population will have to be ever more sophisticated.  Transport will need to be more innovative. Incredible amounts of fuel are currently used, and it's almost certain that this presents the biggest challenge to technology in both the automobile, and aeronautical industries. Perhaps new clean fuel and engines will emerge? Or a new way of transforming energy.  Although it's hard to imagine how, but both telecommunication, and computer technology will continue to evolve. My guess is that hardware, or at least basic hardware, will sooner or later be free! Of course both of these sectors will impact entertainment. We are already in an era where we can access past and present entertainment in multiple ways. Perhaps we will dream in entertainment next! ",
