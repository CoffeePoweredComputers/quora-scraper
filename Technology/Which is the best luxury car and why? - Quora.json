            "answer_text": "To you, congratulations on your success. To others, I\u2019m not going to disagree with all of your options, but here are some factors for you, the buyer, to consider when looking at those cars, before you decide on what to choose. You want something fast, but not built to be fast. There\u2019s a difference of course when we\u2019re talking about cars, comfort comes first. Rule out any sort of \u201csport\u201d focused cars. Joy hit a good point with the XJ, sitting in it makes you feel special and great because the interior quality is amazing, but I had a friend recently sell his due to a crazy amount of reliability issues. The car just kept having problems and he swapped to a Maybach. Here\u2019s my question for you and whatever your answer is, may point you into the direction of your next car. Do you care about the driving experience? No : Check out Audi. I\u2019d say go for the A8L W12, the low-key stylish beast that is my dream daily driver. Good: It\u2019s bold and stylish, which I love about it. The incredibly thing about it is that it\u2019s incredibly comfortable, so aesthetically pleasing (and this is coming from a graphic designer), and the W12 Engine produces such a smooth ride. When you accelerate it feels like you\u2019re taking off on a cloud, but suddenly your pupils focus in on the heads up display that\u2019s flashing the \u201c100 mph\u201d right in front of you. It\u2019s stylish and complicated, I would go for this over the S-class and the 7. Those head/tail lights get me every time. Bad: This car doesn\u2019t have the latest technology from Audi, it has everything you would need and more, but it\u2019s lacking stuff that would make it great. I\u2019m all for simplicity. Hell that\u2019s why the Rolls Royce gets credit where it\u2019s due, it\u2019s simple. Newer, cheaper cars are starting to have that beautiful new LCD screen instrument cluster that shows information besides just the basic stuff, this is a necessity for a luxury car. There\u2019s other small techy conveniency stuff too that is necessary for something as reputable as an A8. It\u2019ll be implemented in the next generation and hopefully Audi won\u2019t mess up like Mercedes did. Also, the materials available aren\u2019t bad, but aren\u2019t great. I like being in this car, but not the same way as how I like being in the Jaaaaaaaaaaaaaag. You can drive it, or spend more money and be driven in it, your choice.  Kinda: The Mercedes S550 Coupe is probably the one I\u2019d tell you to go for. It\u2019s plenty powerful, comfortable, packed with technology, and reputable. Good: It\u2019s also super good looking and as a luxury car, it does its job of showing the guy next to you at the traffic light that you\u2019ve done well for a 21 year old, because no child with daddy\u2019s credit card would use that 130k on a S-Class Coupe. As I said below, the tech can get annoying, but if you like obsessing over your car and learning every bit, go for it. It\u2019s so good looking with those wheels in the picture I attached\u2026 Bad: Don\u2019t get me wrong, the S-class is fantastic and I love the technology as a tech guy, but this is not the car I would get to daily drive in. The S-Class overcomplicates so many things that really don\u2019t matter at all. To the point where I have to spend hours on hours studying a manual just to find out what air intensity means and how that differs from another feature. Hell, even for me, the guy who revolves his life around tech, I can\u2019t be bothered to spend that much time learning about all that stuff because who cares, it\u2019s a car, you should be able to get in and drive the damn thing and be done with it. Drive it, or if you want to be driven, get the 4 dour.  Yes: Get yourself a BMW 7-Series. Almost as much tech as the Mercedes, really good to drive, reputable, and the materials are on par. Even though I\u2019m a BMW guy, I have nothing to really say for it. I guess it\u2019s nice, I guess it\u2019s good to drive, the tech\u2019s there and not too overcomplicated. It\u2019s not a bad choice but I would still choose the A8 because it makes me feel a lot more special.  ",

            "answer_text": "It all depends on how you define \u2018luxury\u2019 car. For me a luxury should make you feel good, comfortable and really almost as if you are in the office. In this sense, I would have to say there are quite a few cars that can definitely exude this kind of experience. But for the sake of argument, I also will have to break it down into several groups.Please keep in mind it is \u2018luxury car\u2019 and not sporty or performance luxury car. Luxury would also mean the badge can carry some sort of prestige. high Tier premium luxury: the Bentley Mulsanne and flying spur- defines the epitome of high end luxury. Hand crafted and expensive all over mid tier premium luxury: the Lexus Ls500 and the LC500 coupe -award winning interior and exterior whose quality can be found in more expensive cars. low tier premium luxury: Volvo S60- different trim levels and the most expensive one rivals a Mercedes Benz E class hope this helps- again, luxury does not mean fast - I have another list of performance luxury sedans ",
