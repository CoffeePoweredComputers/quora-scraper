            "answer_text": "Market penetration is a measure of how many consumers use a product or service when compared with the overall potential demand for that product or service. Market penetration can also be used to develop strategies employed to increase a particular product or service's market share. In other words, market penetration is the percentage of customers that can be reached in a given period of time, at least once. This is also measured relative to a target group, which may theoretically be less than the entire economy.

            "answer_text": "Market penetration refers to a quantitative measure of the usage of a product by a customer. It is compared to the total estimated market for a particular product or service and expressed as a ratio. It is then used for the development of strategies required to increase the total armlet share of a product or service.
