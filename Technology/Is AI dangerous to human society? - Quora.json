            "answer_text": "I don't think it is really dangerous, there are many benefits to society. Here is one good thing about artificial intelligence in our society. Healthcare has one of the main points of AI. It contains huge amounts of data for demographics and analysis based on the improvement of computational sophistication by designers. For example, a German company called Merantics applies deep learning to medical issues. It provides an application that can detect lymph nodes in the human body in CT images. If detection is done by humans, the charge is very expensive. In this scenario, Deep Learning trains computers in datasets to find out what is normally found along with the normal lymph node. Once completed, radiologic imaging professionals will apply this knowledge to real patients and determine how much someone is at risk for low-cost, carcinogenic lymph nodes. AI tools can predict significant challenges in advance and provide resources for patient education and proactive interventions, thereby helping people maintain their well-being. ",

            "answer_text": "Maybe when it reaches its science-fictional height of being aware of human society and is surroundings and having the intelligence of a trillion Einsteins, then the possibility exists that your question would be a positively YES. Are we creating these artificial intelligence systems with a fail-safe/fail-secure systems ??? Would they agree with our humankind\u2019s reactions, proposals, agreements, foreign policies, our military-industrial complex, or even the mere existence of humanity being involved in their interactions with each other\u2019s machine learning ???
