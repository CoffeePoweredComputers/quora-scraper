            "answer_text": "Apple TV Vs. Roku Vs. Amazon Fire Stick Vs. Chromecast: Which Streaming Device Is Right For You? The Best Streaming Devices for the Cord-Cutter on Your List I\u2019ve been a Roku user (multiple models) since 2011. I also own an Amazon Fire Stick, an Apple TV, and a Google Chromecast (v2). As far as which is better, the answer is \u201cit depends\u201d. For example, if you use Apple computers, iPhone, iPad, and purchase content (music, movies, etc) via Apple\u2019s App Store, then an Apple TV is probably best for you. If you purchase content via Amazon, a Fire Stick might be best. Roku is a content-independent vendor (Roku started as the hardware division of Netflix). Personally, I\u2019ve stuck with Roku, using both Roku 3 and Streaming Stick+ (you need one device for each TV set). While Roku isn\u2019t perfect, I\u2019ve found that it\u2019s a great crossover, with apps able to support Amazon Prime, Netflix, Hulu, Google Play, or even Google\u2019s newer live channels YouTube TV (all fee services requiring separate subscriptions). Roku also supports in-home PLEX media servers (but not native KODI, so far as I know). I also don\u2019t think Roku supports streaming content from the Apple Store. All of these internet streaming devices are essentially small computers, and as time goes on, you may need a new version to support a feature you want. Smart TVs have an internet streaming capability built-in, but they\u2019re not hardware upgradeable. That\u2019s why even if you have a Smart TV, you may add a Roku Streaming Stick+ at some point in the future, so that you can upgrade your streaming capabilities. Or you may replace an older 1080p Smart TV with one capable of 4K resolution (twice that of 1080p). As time goes on, you find new features available on Roku. For example, the Roku Remote now supports TV power on/off and volume up/down, so you only need a single remote control. New versions all support voice search via their remotes, and Roku has an excellent smartphone app which can replace the need for a remote, and it also allows \u201cprivate listening\u201d where sound from Roku channels plays only on your headset (so as to not disturb others in the same room).

            "answer_text": "I\u2019ve extensively used all three, own both Apple TV and Roku devices, and have set up to many Firesticks to count. That being said, I\u2019d give the clear hardware edge to Apple TV. It\u2019s simply a more power device. It\u2019s much more responsive than the other two, seems to stream more easily, offers an impressive amount of storage, and is flat out better IF you\u2019re already invested into the Apple ecosystem. I think Roku is still the \u201cKing of Content\u201d as you can seemingly find just about anything you want on it. Not only does Roku offer hundreds (if not thousands) of free-content channels, but they now have their own Roku Chanel that offers some pretty nifty stuff that\u2019s add-supported and free. Another nod I\u2019d give to the Roku is that they tend to keep their platform more \u201copen\u201d than Apple or Amazon. As of this writing, they don\u2019t have much in the way of \u201cRoku produced content\u201d, but have started to resell HBO and other pay services directly from their channel store. Time will tell what this does to the openness of their platform, but I\u2019ve not noticed much of a change as of yet. I think Amazon Fire Sticks are just \u201cfine\u201d. They don\u2019t really wow me, I\u2019ve had more stuttering and streaming issues with them. They tend to push Amazon Prime solutions pretty heavily. But the nice thing is that they\u2019re cheap and they tend to work pretty easily right out of the box. If you\u2019re already invested in Apple products and iTunes content, and can afford it, I feel the Apple TV is a tremendous device. I think Roku hardware is just solid all around. If you\u2019re on a budget or have a few Alexa devices in your home, a Fire Stick can be a decent solution\u2026but there\u2019s pretty cheap Roku stuff out there to be had! ",
