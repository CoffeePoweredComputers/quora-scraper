            "answer_text": "I never have captured the voice of a spirit or entity on my phone, nor pictures of any, but it might require an app for that sort of thing. I did capture an EVP, electronic voice phenomenon, on a tape recorder I used back when I was living in my childhood home in Delhi, Louisiana. I put the recorder(old fashioned type) on an old table, which was probably an antique, which had belonged to my deceased great grandmother. Turning it on high, then playing it back, I heard the voice of my Father, also deceased, talking to a female, then I heard her replying to him. Though Dad died after my great grand mother did, (she had died before my birth)they had known each other in life. My great grandmother died of breast cancer which had metastasized. Dad died of congestive heart failure. I actually dreamed about it before he died, although the dream was highly symbolic. I was 8 and he died when I was 9 1/2. It was to be the first of many dreams that predicted the future I would have during my lifetime. The ability to dream such is called precognition. ",
