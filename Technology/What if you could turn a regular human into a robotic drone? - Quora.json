            "answer_text": "In some ways, at modern manufacturing plants, we already have. turned humans into robots. Take a look at this YouTube video and come to your own conclusions.  Look at the role each employee has and their function. Ask yourself how repetitive their job(s) are and what variances in their role are. When we consider that this plant runs 7/24/365 and where humans are positioned and \u2018working\u2019, I think you may come to the conclusion that the humans are in fact carrying out robotic drone functions. The level of human interaction between co-workers or the machines is almost zero. Now, if you are asking can we replace human \u2018parts\u2019 with robotic limbs, etc, that can be achieved - partially. If we look how far robotic technology has progressed, the microchip is used in implants that operate pacemakers. We are only beginning to understand what can be achieved at the micro controller level. Cognitive functions are not here yet and will be decades away from implementation - if at all. The human brain is the most complex organism on the planet. Each human cell has a trillion atoms [math]10^14 [/math]The knowledge required to fully understand how each cell interacts as a collective organism is being explored. How muscles receive electrical signals from the brain is one of the most fascinating areas of exploration that is now understood. Each membrane is polarized with a negative and positive signal. Scientist know it can be manipulated, the question is; what supports the transmission from brain to muscle in the same precise approach the brain currently does. These signals move your muscles at transmission rates that exceed 7 milliseconds. A membrane is a complex shell that wraps around a cell. The inside of a membrane is also polarized, which allows neurons to transmit the electrically charged signal from the brain to the muscles. All this stuff is way over my head and that was to change in 2003. When I was part of a team that developed some of the first tele-robotic medical arms communications systems to test if remote controlled robotic arms could be used to perform surgery by a doctor that was hundreds or thousands of kilometers miles away, I was given briefings that quickly blew past my wee little brain and had to learn a lot more than I bargained for. We were responsible for the data transmission system between the doctor and the \u2018patient\u2019 operating table which has the robotic arm. We had to prepare a network connection that had a little latency as possible. We needed to achieve a target of less than 150 milliseconds per 160 kilometers (100 miles), at all times with no buffering of data between the operator and the robotic arm that would perform the surgery. The speed of light takes .82 microseconds per 160 kilometers. There are 1,000 microseconds in a millisecond. The fibre optic technology we were using performed at 5.5 microseconds per kilometer or .0055 milliseconds. This project taught me how some of our human extremities function and interact with our brain. We did talk about some of the Hollywood \u2018droid\u2019 style movies that dreamed up some wild ideas. At the time Alien and AVP series was a huge hit. The experts suggested we are a long way from the ability to replace or repair the human brain\u2019s muscle control functions. The basis of the project was a NASA grant to explore how tele-medicine could possibly be used in an emergency between a space craft and earth - with a doctor in his office and perform surgery on a patient aboard the International Space Station or between earth and the Moon - a 4.224 second round trip journey. I was skeptical we could make it work but my boss was adamant and sure enough, he was right. Holy mollies\u2026 Astronauts return to the deep for NEEMO 9 Having a Doctor aboard a ship or remote base, flying around doing nothing most of the time is expensive and consumes a lot of cargo space and supplies. The Doc had to be eliminated and an alternative solution put in place. At least, that was the goal. After 18 months, the program ended . We could operate the system successfully across 1,600 kilometers (3,200 km\u2019s round trip so to speak) and proved a robot could suture an open wound on a patient. The latency was horrendous but manageable. The ISS orbit is only 408 kilometers above the surface of earth. At 408 km\u2019s, the best we could do at the transmission level we tried on the ground was a round trip of 175 milliseconds between the operator and the \u2018patient\u2019. The goal\u2019s next step was to develop methods that could work between earth and a Moon base, some 384,000 km\u2019s away or 768,000 round trip in 3 to 4 seconds or less after relaying through a few satellites because the Moon is in orbit around the earth and not geostationary. Given the very small distances a microchip would have to travel inside a human body, latency would not be a problem. Managing how many pathways to each muscle area is where the problems will arise. How many pathways would be required across the millions and millions of membranes that surround each molecular cell? I mentioned earlier how many atoms are roughly in each cell, now guess how many cells are in a human body and how many are only used for muscles. It\u2019s in the trillions and trillions too. Some estimates put the total cell count in the average adult is over 37 trillion cells. How would a microchip know which muscle membranes/cells to send a signal too? How many muscle locations would implants would have be placed in your body? I think the numbers could be staggeringly high. But don\u2019t give up. Enter nanotechnology, robots that are smaller than the size of a human cell. Tens of Billions of dollars are being spent developing it all over the world. These tiny robots could be programmed to be placed in specific areas of the body and act as homing beacons to send brain signals and activate a human muscle. It is going to require some incredibly complex algorithms and computational capabilities that have to fit inside a nano sized robot. Nanotechnology - Wikipedia I think it\u2019s technically possible, but exactly how and when is still unknown. ",

            "answer_text": "\"We are the Borg. You will be assimilated. Your biological and technological distinctiveness of us will be added to our own. Resistance is futile.\" \"Who the hell are we to determine the next course in evolution for these people?\" \"Captain, I think I speak for the crew when I say: to hell with our orders\" These are just a few quotes from Star Trek movies. The Borg was one of the more vicious enemies of the federation. They apparently started out as a mixture of human biology and alien technology. They would take a human body and introduce technology to it in order to enslave the human host and use the body as a worker in a hive. They shared a collective consciousness and could build anything and could adapt to almost any situation. The Delta quadrant was almost completely occupied by the borg in 2278 when the USS Voyager got stranded by the caretaker. By the end of their fourth year they encountered the Borg on a weekly basis, and even capture and de-assimilate a human drone. I still say Kes and Seven of Nine would have made a good team up like Tom and Harry, but the franchise was a CBS company, so they couldn't have more than seven regular cast. (If you don't believe that, count the onscreen cast of Price Is Right, NCIS, or CSI.) ",
