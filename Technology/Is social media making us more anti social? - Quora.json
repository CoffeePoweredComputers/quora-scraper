            "answer_text": "Over the years social media has grown to be one of our primary methods of communication[1]. As social media continues to grow and people continue to move their lives onto online database, people are becoming more anti-social. Due to the ease of social media, millions of people have begun to move their interactions and conversations to the online world. For example, instead of catching up with an old friend or colleague in person over lunch, coffee, etc., people will simply text or message each other on social media platforms eliminating face to face interactions[2] . Furthermore, due to constant Facebook and Instagram profile updates, some people feel as if they are already caught up on the lives of their friends and feel no need to personally message them at all making them very anti-social. It seems as though instead of making an effort to verbally reconnect with old friends, people would rather sit at home on their technological devices and learn what their friends are up to through a social media platform. This perfectly illustrates how social media is making many people in our society more anti-social. Secondly, when individuals do chose to hang out or meet up with friends face to face, their conversations are often interrupted or cut short due to social media, thus making them more anti-social[3]. Think about it, have you ever been telling a friend or family member a story only to look up and see them sitting on their phone scrolling through their social media feeds or texting? Sadly, the answer for most people would be yes. When people do choose to hangout or catch up with friends they are no longer present in conversation due to social media and technology[4]. People will partially pay attention to the conversation being held in person while either having a completely separate conversation online through the use of social media or simply by just checking their social media feeds. This results in short conversations that lack the depth, importance, and interest proving that our society is becoming more anti-social. One of the very upsetting parts about this is that the constant use of social media, even when in the middle of a conversation, is becoming more and more widely accepted[5]. This constant interruption of using social media while in the middle of face to face interactions helps lead to the fact that the ability for individuals to have strong, focussed conversations, is slowly weakening at a rapid rate as we become more anti-social due to social media[6]. It has gotten to a point where teenagers will hangout in complete silence for long periods of time while they check their social media feeds, not saying a single word to their peers sitting in the same room. This clearly demonstrates how society is becoming much more anti-social due to social media. People simply need to make a more active effort to get out of their houses and meet up with others face to face to have good conversation and maintain connections rather than turning to social media platforms to do so. When doing so, it is vital that individuals remain present in conversation rather than constantly checking their phones to see updates on their social media platforms. This will help society break free from the anti-social bubble we are beginning to form around ourselves.

            "answer_text": "Not necessarily. I know many people who are active on social media and most of them seem perfectly well-integrated to me. They combine social media with a healthy social life. However, this is just my experience. What I would say is that people have become conditioned to social media - in the sense that everywhere they go - they are virtually glued to their phone. This does strike me as anti-social behavior in that such people have a conditioned dependency - much like drug addicts. Furthermore, one of the perverse side-effects of social media is that it heavily promotes mob mentality - which is inherently anti-social. Because people are inclined to gravitate towards those who share similar opinions and beliefs - this disposition tends to reduce their capacity to think critically. Mob mentality is unfortunately embedded in our DNA. Because human beings are pack creatures who have always existed in small groups (not mass societies) - this was how we survived and still do. Research has shown that moving against the pack provokes the alarm circuits in our brain while conformity keeps us calm. So essentially, it\u2019s easier to fit in rather than stick out. This is where the dreaded phrase \u201cmob mentality\u201d comes from - which describes how people are influenced by their peers to adopt certain behaviors. Mob mentality is fundamentally anti-social and is rampant on social media in particular. Furthermore, neurobiologists have found that when people break off into groups, their brain produces chemicals that diminishes their normal thought pattern to a more primitive state. Which literally means people stop thinking when they\u2019re amalgamated into groups. An extreme example of such mob mentality was highlighted by \u201cDr Hannah Arendt\u201d who coined the phrase \u201cThe banality of evil\u201d. She controversially argues that what happened in Nazi Germany could largely be blamed on ordinary people conforming to mass opinion without a critical evaluation of the consequences of their actions\u201d. The underlying point here is that we need disagreements and debates to sharpen ourselves. Succumbing to conformity quashes growth - thereby creating stagnation in the process which brings upon it a sort of putrid rot. It makes you wonder how many past atrocities could have been averted and future acts of violence - if people thwarted away the herd mentality and started thinking for themselves. In my ideal world, social media wouldn\u2019t exist. Too much knowledge and information is a bad thing; too much circulation of news and gossip is a bad thing; too much of anything is a bad thing when it\u2019s on display for other people to see. Social media only promotes a busybody culture - from which the mob mentality emerges as a consequence. Hope this helps ",
