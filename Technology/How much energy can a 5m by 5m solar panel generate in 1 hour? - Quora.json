            "answer_text": "What type of solar panel? Different types (and different manufacturers) have different efficiency rates. Renogy is one of the top rated manufacturer of solar panels for RVs and other mobile uses. They aren't the very highest efficiency available, but they are near the top so I'll use them as an example. Their 100 watt panel is 47.2\u2033 x 22\u2033. That's about 1.2m x 0.56m, or .672 square meters. If we arrange the panels for maximum use of space with no area wasted, we can fit 37 of those panels into the 25 square meter area that you referenced. Assuming no loss of production due to a poor quality charge controller, and perfect placement and lighting conditions, that 5m x 5m array can produce about 3,700 watts, which translates to about 275 amps at 13.5 volts.

            "answer_text": "First off, the solar constant varies by season between 1300 ish Watts per square meter to 1400-something. So perfect world scenario, with everything aligned perfectly lets take 1400 x 25 square meters = 35000 Watts. If you\u2019re talking about a Photovoltaic panel (heating panels are much higher efficiency in the 80% range, but just heat is less useful.) so multiply by let\u2019s say 14 % = 4900. So perfect world with really good panels you can look for just shy of 5 KW, which means 5 KWH per hour. Unfortunately there are tons of things that will subtract from that output: a slightly incorrect angle, dust, clouds, bird poop, high temperatures. For a stationary panel this theoretical figure would only apply for one hour of one day when the sun lines up perfectly with the panel. ",
