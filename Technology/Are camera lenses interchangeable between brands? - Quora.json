            "answer_text": "Camera lens compatibiltiy is based on lens mount, not necessarily brand.  Canon and Nikon each have their own proprietary lens mounts for both DSLR and newer MILCs (Mirrorless Interchangeable-Lens Cameras).  Many other companies make lenses for these cameras. That\u2019s generally under license, but not always \u2014 it can be reverse-engineered. Sigma got in big trouble in the 1990s when Canon moved from film to digital and their Canon-mount lenses didn\u2019t work on the digital Canons. Lens companies making manual-only lenses, no automatic exposure or focus controls, can generally reverse-engineer a mechanical lens mount. So a Sigma-made EF-mount lens will fit on a Canon, a Sigma-made F-Mount lens will fit on a Nikon. But not the other way around.  And a few others license the Canon EOS EF lens mount for their own use, mostly in the video market. But there\u2019s no Canon lens on a Nikon, or vice-versa.  It wasn\u2019t always that way. In the early days of Japanese rangefinder cameras, Canon cameras came with Nikkor lenses. This is the Hansa Canon from 1936, with the standard 50mm lens.  Sony\u2019s E-Mount is proprietary. It\u2019s been widely circulated that Sony open sourced the mount, but that doesn\u2019t seem to be quite true. Rather, they release the specifications of E-Mount lens hardware and firmware to any lens or lens adapter maker free, but it still requires approval by Sony.  Olympus and Panasonic together created the first MILC system in 2008, the Micro Four Thirds System. This is not a proprietary lens system, though it must be licensed to be used. So technically, any company can build a Micro Four Thirds camera.  This has led to quite a few specialized Micro Four Thirds camera bodies, and pretty much any lens you can imagine. Every M43 camera can use every lens, but there are a few issues. Panasonic uses a weird artificial intelligence algorithm for fast focusing that requires custom data in the lens that\u2019s not available in other companies\u2019 lenses. Both Olympus and Panasonic support hybrid image-stabilization between in-camera and in-lens stabilizers, but they don\u2019t work across brands.  Most recently, Leica, Panasonic, and Sigma formed the L-Mount Alliance, around Leica\u2019s full-frame L-Mount system. All three companies currently make camera bodies and lenses that are compatible with one another. There\u2019s no official announcement on whether anyone else will be able to join this party.  In recent years, adapting lenses between camera brands has become a popular thing to do. Part of this was driven by the adpotion of MILCs. The distance between the camera\u2019s lens mount flange and the sensor or film is called the flange focal distance. If I have a camera with a shorter flange focal distance than the lens I\u2019d like to use, it should be possible to adapt that lens.  Here\u2019s my Canon FD 400mm f/4.5 lens mounted to my Oympus OM-D E-M1 Mark II, a Micro Four Thirds camera.  And my Olympus OM 50mm f/1.4 \u2014 from the OM-System of the 1970\u20131990s \u2014 mounted to my Fujifilm X-Pro 1. In both of these cases, I\u2019m mounting older, fully mechanical lenses. So no electronics allows for a very simple adapter, just a bit of machined metal.  Back when I had a Canon system, I could actually fit my old Olympus OM lenses on the EF bodies with one of these. There wasn\u2019t much difference in flange focal distance between Olympus (46mm) and Canon (44mm), but it was enough for a purely mechanical adapter.  Here\u2019s a Sony A7 wearing a Canon EF 24\u201370mm f/2.8L lens via a Metabones adapter. This adapter is actually an active one. It\u2019s got a tiny microprocessor that hooks to Sony electronics one one side, the Canon electronics on the other, and translates between their control protocols to allow the Sony to focus and set aperture in the lens. This is actually necessary for some adaptations. Canon EOS EF dates back to the film era, but it\u2019s also fully electronic. There\u2019s no aperture ring on a Canon EF lens, no way to adjust it directly.

            "answer_text": "You can get adaptors but even then that is no guarantee that they will all fit all lenses even then. When I bought my camera they told me even the Canon M50 can not even fit all Cannon lenses and I would need an adaptor. For me an adaptor is a turn off. It is just one more thing to look after and one more thing that could get lost. I just like the idea of lenses that fit strait on much better. This is one reason why I didn\u2019t buy the Cannon M50 that and the fact the M50 was not a professional enough camera for my liking as well as the fact it felt cheaply made compared to what other brands had to offer. That said there are some Tamron and Sigma lenses that fit Cannon cameras, I am not sure in terms of the M50 though. Now, I have been told that Panasonic cameras of course fit Panasonic lenses, some Tamron and some Sigma ones as well I think. However, on top of this from what I understand is Olympus lenses also fit strait on Panasonic camera bodies. I have also been told Olympus camera bodies fit their own lenses of course but also some Tamron and Sigma lenses as well as Panasonic camera lenses. Both Panasonic and Olympus both make great cameras. Olympus is known to be a very good brand in the camera world. However, Panasonic is relatively new to the camera world but don\u2019t let that fool you as Panasonic\u2019s cameras are great, I have owned a Panasonic camera. I personally have a Sony 6400 and that has a reasonable amount of Sony lenses for it but not the choice that Panasonic and Olympus cameras do. However, that is not a problem for me as I have what I need and is also a great camera. I have been told and I agree that Cannon in this price range is dragging their feet and has catching to do to meet what Panasonic, Olympus and Sony offer. As for Nikon I don\u2019t know enough about their mirrorless cameras. However, to be honest after looking at mirrorless cameras in this price range closely I agree with that criticism about Cannon\u2019s offerings. It seems in this price range Panasonic, Olympus and Sony have passed them in quality. ",

            "answer_text": "The short answer is \u201cno\u201d. All camera bodies have proprietary mounts. A Canon lens doesn\u2019t fit on a Nikon camera. The long answer is \u201cyou can buy an adaptor to make them fit\u201d but I would have to have a pretty good reason to go to the trouble. Sounds like one more thing to carry and lose. If you can\u2019t afford the lens for your camera it would seem easier to buy a lens from a third-party manufacturer. Order it in the mount you need. Purists say only buy the brand name, but for those of us who aren\u2019t selling our photos, a high quality, third party lens can be good enough. ",
