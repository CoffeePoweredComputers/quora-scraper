            "answer_text": "Even if Apple hasn't made it's own VR headset similar to devices from rivals like Google Daydream View and Samsung Gear VR, you can still find a respectable selection of iPhone VR apps in the App Store. To get into virtual reality on your iPhone, you'll need any handset from the iPhone X down to the iPhone SE. Really, your iPhone just needs to be running iOS 11. Your iPhone already has all the motion sensors, processing power and proper screen resolution you need to run VR. One more thing: you will need a headset. Don't worry \u2013 you can get one for relatively cheap. Google Cardboard headsets can be found for free with some promotions, however you will only pay around $15/\u00a310 if you buy one from Amazon. Cardboard is the system needed for top iPhone VR apps from the App Store. Once you have your set-up in hand, you'll want to download the dedicated Cardboard app to get into VR. You can also give the Zeiss VR ONE headset, which is made of plastic, a go. The iPhone compatible version can be found on Amazon. No matter what headset you choose, the VR-enabled app will get you where you need to go. Just slot in your iPhone, pop on some headphones (Bluetooth works best) and enjoy the virtual world before you. ",
