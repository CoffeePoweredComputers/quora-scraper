Don't expect better charging times or anything, it's just that the new Macbooks are somewhat engineered differently and it seems that Apple had to change the physical shape of the port to make it work with slimmer bodies. Edit: The shape of the port itself is a bit slimmer and wider on the new macs:  But the actual pins are not different at all, just designed a bit differently (new on left, old on right):   Images from:http://www.tuaw.com/2012/06/11/apple-introduces-10-magsafe-2-adapter/http://www.applebytes.me/the-2012-macbook-air-soars-with-ivy-bridge-review/ ",
