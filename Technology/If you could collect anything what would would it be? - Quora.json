            "answer_text": "If money were no object, I would collect French bisque dolls from the 19th to early 20th century and French automatons. But the upkeep on these dolls and mechanical figures would be an expense of their own on top of the initial cost(!) So, I\u2019m happy with my actual \u201clow rent\u201d current doll collecting range. I\u2019ll just admire the fabulous French items from afar. ",
