            "answer_text": "In 2004, when NASA discovered the EARTH was the CENTER OF THE UNIVERSE. This is the most profound discovery in the entire history of science, but NASA covered it up. Not because anybody actually believes it's true, but rather because it proves the so-called \"science\" we have been taught is nothing but fairy tales. Lawrence Krauss is a Prof. of Theoretical Physics at Arizona State and arguably the loudest spokesperson for Atheism on the planet. He states - That's crazy. We're looking out at the whole universe. There's no way there should be a correlation of structure with our motion of the earth around the sun \" the plane of the earth around the sun \" the ecliptic. That would say we are truly the center of the universe. https://www.edge.org/conversation/lawrence_m_krauss-the-energy-of-empty-space-that-isnt-zero Researchers at MIT were looking over data from NASA's WMAP satellite when it was noticed that there IS a special direction in space. Cosmologists have dubbed this the \"Axis of Evil\". You can read more about this here - Dragan Huterer is a Prof. of Physics at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor. He explains in great detail what has been discovered here -Why is the solar system cosmically aligned?http://www-personal.umich.edu/~huterer/PRESS/CMB_Huterer.pdf At first, scientists simply laughed this off as some kind of fluke or mistake, because it just couldn't be real. Even though the findings were confirmed by looking back at the earlier COBE satellite data. Rather than admit the truth NASA tried to prove the WMAP satellite was broken. quote -So perplexing is the axis of evil that Hinshaw and WMAP's principal investigator, Chuck Bennett, have obtained a grant for a five-year examination of the WMAP data. They hope to explore the possibilities that the WMAP instrument was in error, or that something else went wrong. \"There's no question there's stuff that looks unusual,\" says Bennett. We will have to wait and see whether the study reveals the axis of evil to be a cosmic mirage, or shows the big bang model to be in serious trouble. The Universe: The new Axis of Evil After about 10 years of failed attacks on the WMAP data, the scientists figured that the European Space Agency's PLANCK Satellite would finally discredit the data.Here's what they found -PhD. Matthew R. Francis is a physicist, and Director of the MD Anderson Planetarium from 2007-09. Finally, the strange anomaly WMAP first observed in 2001 at the largest scales is still there. Some people held out hope that the WMAP results were a fluke, an error arising from the observatory's basic construction. However, Planck is sufficiently different in design to make that hope futile. The effect is real. (Some sources made this sound like it's something new, but maybe that's because cosmologists tried not to call attention to it in the last decade.) Planck results: our weird and wonderful Universe The PLANCK satellite's lead cosmologist took this approach - \"Why characteristics of the CMB should relate to our solar system is not understood. ... I was explicitly told not to say anything about God in this talk \" which I've just violated,\" Efstathiou said half-jokingly. http://www.nbcnews.com/science/planck-probes-cosmic-baby-picture-revises-universes-vital-statistics-1C8986034 George Efstathiou is a Professor of Astrophysics at the University of Cambridge and director of the Kavli Institute for Cosmology. It\u2019s hard to believe some book burning NAZI collapsed this answer, under the pretense that the quotes were not properly attributed. Every single person that was quoted had their names prominently displayed along with their indisputable academic credentials also following each quote was a direct hyperlink to the articles being quoted. Short of including their home phone numbers it would be impossible to more accurately attribute these quotes. Obviously the real reason this thread was collapsed is because the truth about the fairy tales being taught as science has to be hidden at all cost. ",

            "answer_text": "There isn\u2019t any advancement. All inventions that today\u2019s technology uses were made until about the late 70\u2019 of the last century, with other words, today\u2019s technologies are just applications of said inventions. America basically stopped inventing things, I like to see a coincidence with tax rates in the 1970s going down from their postwar heights. There was simply not enough government money to fund research. Don\u2019t be fooled to think that private companies did come up with groundbreaking technologies as it was always either government funded or outright government research (look up ARPA) that came up with the groundbreaking stuff.
