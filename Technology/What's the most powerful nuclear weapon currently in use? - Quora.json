            "answer_text": "In principle, the previous authors have already said everything. Only I would like to correct some authors, for example: Allen E Hull Yes, you are right soon demonize these missiles, and more powerful SARMAT missiles will replace them. Known as SATANA-2 \u201cWe live in an age of precision bombing.\" The need for \"city buster\" bombs no longer exists. \" It is only partially true. In connection with the inadequate statements of Donald Trump that he plans to withdraw weapons into space, the Russians reacted. At the moment, the Ministry of Defense plans to reanimate the Sakharov project. The Sakharov project is the creation of 200-megaton nuclear torpedoes (I recall, the strongest in the nuclear bomb is 50 megatons). Russia must be 100% sure that at any time, whatever the circumstances, it can guarantee the complete destruction of the United States and its Allies. In the first place, these torpedoes will be directed to Britain and the United States. \"I decided that such a carrier could be a large torpedo launched from a submarine, and I fantasized that it would be possible to design a straight-through water-steam atomic jet engine for such a torpedo ... The target of an attack from a distance of several hundred kilometers should be the enemy's ports. Such a torpedo can be made very durable, the mines and the fence network are not terrible for the torpedo.Of course, the destruction of ports - as a surface explosion of a torpedo with a 100-megaton charge jumped out of the water, and an underwater explosion - is inevitably paired with Pts I was one of the first people I discussed this project with Rear Admiral Fomin ... He was shocked by the \"cannibalistic nature\" of the project and remarked in conversation with me that military seamen were used to fighting an armed enemy in open combat and that for him the idea of \u200b\u200bsuch a mass murder is disgusting. \"I felt ashamed and never discussed this project with anyone again.\" Academician A. Sakharov. Thanks to Trump, now these torpedoes will exist. I think it makes no sense to explain that 15 such torpedoes can be blown off, their total capacity is 3000 megaton. ",
