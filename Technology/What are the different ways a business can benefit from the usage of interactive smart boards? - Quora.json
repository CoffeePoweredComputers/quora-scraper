            "answer_text": "I could see a business using this technology for online training in many different areas. For instance, salespersons can use video conferencing at remote locations to learn about new product introductions without having to come to the business location. This saves time and expense and allows questions to be asked in a real time manner and also to do queries on different elements. I guess it will all depend on what you are trying to accomplish and your imagination. I presented just one scenario but I can think of several others immediately. I will leave it to you to use your imagination to find these other uses. ",
