            "answer_text": "Ah, nightclubs have many dangers, only some of which revolve around the ever-present women's fears of being rufied and date-raped. The moment you walk into a nightclub and take that first drink, at any time afterward, management can have you tossed out and/or arrested for public intoxication. It's simply up to the management from then onwards, because they don't need a reason, just a whim. Granted, they'll lose customers if they do it too often from whim, but most clubs have long lines eager to step inside and replace you, so it might not help you. Even if you're the designated driver that night, and have only been imbibing soft drinks or water, proving that you're not intoxicated or drinking alcohol is on you. If you get arrested, or just ousted, you might have to prove it much later, in front of a judge! This can give an innocent person a police arrest record that will follow you until ($$$) expunged. And your friends testimony on your behalf on a night when they were admittedly drinking may be readily discounted by a judge. Only a blood alcohol test might save you then, but most innocent people will refuse it when offered that night. Lawyers suggest refusing it, depending, so I don't know what I'd do myself. There are nightclubs that have terrible security, allowing knife fights and other situations inside, and then there are \u201cgood\u201d places that turn out fighters when they catch them starting something. I put the word \u201cgood\" in quotes because these places often oust miscreants together, which means fighting will resume outside immediately. If you were being picked on by a big bully, and get tossed out with the bully, you now have less protection than you had inside, and can only hope your pals (if you had any with you) saw you getting rousted and can follow in time to save your bacon. Because thats when bullies will restart the violence; when you're alone, in a dark parking lot. A few venues enjoy the crowds and $ betting on parking lot fights bring on, so they don't exactly discourage it. The worst places get a reputation with police, some departments increase patrols, some rightfully avoid patrolling the worst from fear for their officers. Some newspapers publish incidents, which you should look at when choosing where or where not to party. The nicest thing a nightclub can do for its patrons is to turn out fighting miscreants separately, after the first party has been seen driving away; most don't care. I would escort each party to their vehicles, or a taxi if I were management. To them, both parties in a fight are seen as equal aggressors, which is not always true. If you see someone starting to get aggressive with one of your friends, it's often best to seek out a bouncer and tattle. If you wait, one of your friends could get hit, be blamed for starting a fight (and ousted to the dangerous parking lot), or get arrested. But if you point out the instigator early, the bouncer will be more alert and prone to blame the real instigator. And even the sweetest people can get aggressive when drunk, so your own friends might surprise you here. One of my girlfriends shocked me by admitting she'd been kicked out of my favorite clubs for fighting. She was meekly kind-hearted, and gentle without alcohol. Or maybe it was that she wasn't used to being in a stimulating & crowded environment, who knows? These are dangers that have little to do with date rape, but just as serious, and not only a problem for men. She turned out to stay sweet when partying with me; one of her other friends, whose I never cared much for might have been encouraging her to get rowdy. But it was still a shock to hear, and the bouncers eyed her all night, every time. And if she got ousted, then beat up by a bigger girl, what would protect her from getting raped at that point? Then you've got your date rape escapades. (I'm female, so here's my POV. ) My sisters and I used to strictly attend nightclubs as a group, promising to call police/interfere if we saw someone being led/carried away by a potential kidnapper or rapist. We monitored each other's drinking/intoxication levels, so that it seemed suspicious if one of us passed out after a single Coca-Cola, for example. We danced in groups, even when with different male partners, and we especially watched carefully when bartenders mixed our beverages. This because one sister got a rufie straight from the bartender when she was alone one night. This bartender was even a friend of hers, but he apparently valued friendship with the customer who paid for the rufie most of all. It can happen. No drinking stuff we'd not seen safely prepared ourselves, especially drinks bought by strangers. We also tried to stick to shots or premixed drinks, like a frozen margarita, which offer little chance for recipe changes, because bartenders have quick hands. We made a strict rule about taking guys home \u2014 never until our agreed-upon time, and pals have veto power. I'd add a safe word to approving take-home dates today. Un- or semi-conscious people can't give a safe word, you see. Sometimes a vetoing friend will see more negative about our guys than we do while being courted for sex. Driver designated always goes home alone, and last, because it's their job to watch that night. Sometimes we'd allow a new girlfriend into our mutual security nightclub rounds, but if they bailed, or failed to follow the rules, they were not invited back. We never did any extra drugs, but xtasy, etc was rarer then, and coke/heroin/meth too hard core & $$ for our college budgets. Today, if you must use more than alcohol, I'd secure it myself, test well before sharing time, and avoid using what I didn't bring myself. Sure, some risk is fun, but you really won't enjoy waking to find yourself chained in somebody's basement for the rest of your short life. These rules will help keep it fun. If you don't have a group like this backing you up, it's very risky to have a good time at any nightclub. Ladies should help each other, but don't count on it, either. Many a predator has been known to employ a female sidekick to help victimize other women. If you don't know them, and your instincts give you the slightest bad vibe, best to try a new nightclub, where better fun could be safely had. Honestly, knowing the recidivism rates for crimes like sexual stuff, serial rape-murder, and even habitual fighting means that anyone who's done these things before will do them again if given the opportunity. Don't let your wanting to have a fun time become their next opportunity. ",

            "answer_text": "Clubbing is a great pastime for most people. You get an opportunity to mingle and socialise after a day or week of hard work trying to earn a living. It should not be dangerous if one consumes alcoholic drinks in moderation and does not indulge in drug use. Social misconduct comes from excess use of drugs and alcohol and then impaired judgements. My advice to you is plan you night well. If you are going to drink don't drive. Try to go out with a friend when you can. Never leave your valuables or drinks unattended. Plan how you will get back to your home in advance. Avoid roaming desolate streets on your way back home. Avoid impulsive behaviour and descisions and enjoy yourself. Long gone are the days when a man could go out and pick up a nice girl in the club and bring her back home and it works out just fine. ",
