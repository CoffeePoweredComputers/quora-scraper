            "answer_text": "It's a variation on an old optical illusion known as Pepper's Ghost, which was first demonstrated in 1862 (although is actually quite a bit older): Pepper's ghost  It's basically works like a beam splitter in reverse: instead of taking light from a single source and splitting it into two paths, it takes light from two sources and joins it into a single path, where it can be viewed.   The Haunted Mansion in Disneyland/Disneyworld uses the same sort of illusion to create the ballroom populated by ghosts.  The \"smartphone\" version basically uses the same idea, with a few wrinkles.  A truncated pyramid of glass is set atop a monitor which draws four versions of the scene which are then reflected by the sloping side.   In essence, each side acts like a partially transparent mirror, and the image that is on the screen is seen as \"inside\" the pyramid.  Unlike a true hologram, there is no \"inter-depth\" in the image, it appears as a flat object inside the pyramid, but if you shift sides, you'll view a different version of the object, which can be quite effective.   Here's a demo done with a larger monitor.  ",

            "answer_text": "Halographic 3D phone When we firstly hear this word,a question came in our mind,what does halographic mean?If I am right! Let me know you: Holography is a photographic technique that records the light scattered from an object, and then presents it in a way that appears three-dimensional. A hologram (pronounced HOL-o-gram ) is a three-dimensional image, created with photographic projection. The term is taken from the Greek words holos (whole) and gramma (message). The holographic principle is a property of quantum gravity theories(Quantum gravity (QG) is a field of theoretical physics that seeks to describe gravity according to the principles of quantum mechanics, and where quantum effects cannot be ignored,[1] such as near compact astrophysical objects where the effects of gravity are strong.) which resolves the black hole(A black hole is a region of spacetime exhibiting such strong gravitational effects that nothing\u2014not even particles and electromagnetic radiation such as light\u2014can escape from inside it) information paradox within string theory(In physics, string theory is a theoretical framework in which the point-like particles of particle physics are replaced by one-dimensional objects called strings. It describes how these strings propagate through space and interact with each other). After knowing the basic definitions and principle its time to know its working and here it goes: A hologram is a physical structure that diffracts light into an image.A holographic image can be seen by looking into an illuminated holographic print or by shining a laser through a hologram and projecting the image onto a screen just like the engineering drawing in which we draw by imagining with different angles.
