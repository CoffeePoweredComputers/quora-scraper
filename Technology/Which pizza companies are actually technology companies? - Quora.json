            "answer_text": "Every pizza company is a technology company. How Pizza Hut stopped innovating its pizza and fell behind Domino\u2019s   \u201cTwenty years ago, Pizza Hut was an innovation powerhouse. It employed food scientists who patented crusts that didn\u2019t break down when mixed with garlic and trotted out blockbuster products like BigFoot, the Edge, and the Triple Decker. When the chain launched Stuffed Crust in 1995, the stock for Pepsi, its then-parent, increased about 50% over the next year; the Big New Yorker, released 4 years later, led to a 9% rise in same-store sales. Wild, innovative pizzas made markets move. But today, Pizza Hut rarely offers new items. In recent years, the best it\u2019s managed to do is change the cheese in its Stuffed Crust from mozzarella to cheddar, or trot out an occasional, ill-fated appetizer like the Stuffed Cheez-It. In 2017, Pizza Hut\u2019s parent company, Yum Brands, spent ~$22m in research and development \u2014 $10m less than it spent in the pizza golden age of the \u201890s, accounting for inflation. That same year, Yum invested $130m for pizza delivery technology and related marketing.\u201d In 1994, Domino\u2019s was developing a website that let customers drag virtual toppings toward an onscreen pie. Pizza Hut\u2019s service merely transmitted typed orders to a center in Wichita before routing them back to Santa Cruz. But what did it matter? As Stanford economist Nathan Rosenberg opined that year, the push to bring pizza delivery online was an instance of \u201csophisticated technology being put to trivial use.\u201d He was wrong: Online delivery is now the most important part of the pizza business.
