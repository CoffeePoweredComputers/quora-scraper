            "answer_text": "Transitioning from physical to digital \u201con-demand\u201d media has been a staggered process. If you omit radio as a different mechanism entirely, the history of recorded music focuses on delivery mechanisms, access, and making music more on-demand. Vinyl (physical shellac)Cassettes / 8-track (physical tape)Compact Discs / Minidiscs (digital in physical form)Digital downloads (digital media in a permanent download)On-demand Streaming (digital media in a non-downloadable format)\u201cOffline\u201d streaming (digital media in a temporary downloadable format)What exists after streaming is still very much so up in the air. If the past is any indication, bandwidth will continue improving, resulting in improved sound quality. Making the music more \u201con-demand\u201d has been achieved and led to similar results in Film / TV and Video Games. What happens next is essential to keeping music relevant \u2014 making it more interactive. Virtual Reality: At the most obvious level, concerts become accessible to all. It gets exciting when you think about PAST concerts being accessible (think being able to walk around at Woodstock in 1969, CBGBs in the mid-1970s, etc.). One outlet that\u2019s already pursuing this in the virtual space.Interactive Mixtapes: On the recorded media front, Artists, DJs, and creators unleash interactive mixtapes (think Turntable.FM with a room full of dancing souls interacting).Augmented Reality: Imagine a walking tour of Greenwich Village with songs playing alongside spots Bob Dylan used to frequent. Augmented Reality is already here.Artificial Intelligence (AI): Perhaps something taps into your Likes / Dislikes to create a custom soundtrack attuned to your musical taste, created on the fly without a flesh-and-blood composer. A biochemically enabled release of music to up your endorphins or put you in the right headspace? Possible.",
