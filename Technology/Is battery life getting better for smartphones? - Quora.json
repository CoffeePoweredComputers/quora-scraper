            "answer_text": "Yes it is but not for the reason you may think.  Smartphones batteries are tiny. Your laptop probably has a 10x bigger battery, of course depending on which phone and laptop you use this can vary significantly. Your laptop doesn\u2019t really last that much longer than your phone. Why is that? Well its all due to the hardware and the software on modern devices. Laptops generally use higher end hardware for their computing needs and they need the power to handle the software on these chips. Smartphones on the other hand use software that is designed to be used on lower end chips and be just as fast. Thats optimization for you. The batteries haven\u2019t gotten much more dense than say 10 years ago to make a sizeable difference. Our phones just got bigger and we could add a bigger battery to the device. This meant that optimization wasn\u2019t as highly valued say about 5\u20137 years ago as it is today. Most phones coming out today are just as powerful as some mid grade laptops and they last quite along time. A similarly powerful laptop would burn through its battery much quicker than a smartphone. Now we can\u2019t just put smartphone chips in a laptop and expect them to last a week since these two devices are designed for different tasks. Now you did ask the question referring to battery life on smartphones and yes it is getting better, but the main reason for this is not because smartphones just have a bigger battery, its because every year these smartphones become more and more efficient.

            "answer_text": "Yes*. Battery life has consistently been getting better, as new batteries that come out are able to cool, reserve less energy, and have more recharge cycles with less material. Applications and software is even helping with algorithms like autodim, battery life extenders, etc. So yeah, getting better. WHATS not getting better is how we use our phones for EVERYTHING now. 2009 we spent and average of 39 minutes a day using a smart phone. AVerage today? 4 active hours a day. That's 1/4 of our TOTAL WAKING HOURS using a smart phone. ALso while there are apps that cool battery usage and overheating, etc, there are also apps that DRAIN the heck out the the battery. The more complicated the apps, the more they do, the more processing power they require,and that drains the battery quick! using it as a calculator? not even worried! Using it to watch a netflix movie with running email, snapchat, facebook, 2 other video chat softwares, 40 open tabs on your browser in the background? That battery will die SOON!SO in short, its a mixed answer, battery life on its face is improving, but power hungry apps and our own usage is not helping anything. ",
