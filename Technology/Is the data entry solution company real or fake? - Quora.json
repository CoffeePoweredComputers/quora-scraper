            "answer_text": "My advice is these companies are fake. Apply for data entry in those companies which is known to you and you can also visit those companies. If these companies are out of state then don't apply for these jobs. There is a company called global solutions USA. They provide work from home form filling jobs. 800 forms have to filled within 8 days with 90% accuracy else we have to pay back to the company. We can also ask for more time. Initially they won't ask for any registration amount but they will provide an bond agreement where it is mentioned that if there are any irregularities from the employee's side then the employee has to pay 8k to the company. But I had filled about 400 forms after which my server crashed. I contacted the company and also my recruiter about this but they said that they are having some technical issues and it will be corrected soon or technical support will contact me within 48 hrs. But I was contacted by a lawyer from Rajkot at 3 pm and was asked to pay for breaching the contract by using multiple IP addresses. I had to pay 11500 (8000 to company+ 3500 legal charges) for activating my id else legal case of around 1lakh would be charged against me. I said that I haven't used multiple system but they refused my claim saying that they had proof. I had no proof that I haven't used multiple sysytem. So I paid the amount. Then I had to pay extra amount of 4k baceause they showed that from the 400 forms around 200 forms had error. So it will be impossible for me to maintain 90% accuracy. I was shocked by seeing that many errors. I had previously taken screenshots of a few submitted forms which I emailed to the company which clearly showed that those forms were error free. But they refused my claim stating that it was false. I had no choice but to pay that amount within 3 hrs since the lawyer's office closes by 6 pm. I had to borrow money from many people for this. ",

They tell me that for registration pay 1785rs I pay and registration. After that said pay 3080 rs for getting details of the job. After paying these amount we get the mail to do the work details. After one week I do the work they said that you will get salary within 30 mins pay 6880 rs these are refundable amount after paying this u will get the salary code. I got the salary code then send the agent then they said that. After paying 7990 rs for getting salary. Then I paid the amount I told them I have no amount to pay. So plz give the salary. They tell me wait madam you will get within 30 mins. After that they will tell me there is gst code by paying 9999 rs after I became angry then I told them there a lot of terms to pay they said that no mam. After that I paid and said this is my last transaction. Then they said K. I borrowed some one and paid the amount. After 30 mins they are telling pay 13000 rs for last submission. I told them sharply I don't have the amount. Then they are telling if you didn't pay the project will be closed. I pay the amount also will be gone. So don't plz cheat these types of poor peoples\u2026 they will never get any chance by god. God will tke the right decision about these types of cheating ",
