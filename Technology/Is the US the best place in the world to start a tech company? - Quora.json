            "answer_text": "It's hard to prove that it's the best place to start a startup, but Silicon Valley has a long track record for starting and growing tech startups, with the following qualities that are often cited as contributing factors: Great access to:1. venture capital2. research (e.g., PARC)3. high quality recent graduates from local schools (e.g., Stanford)4. incubators (e.g., Y Combinator) As for reasons why not to start in Silicon Valley, there is:1. Expensive housing and office real estate.2. High cost of living (in general)3. Extreme competition for engineering talent, sometimes with outrageous tactics (Interwoven at some point offered a BMW signing bonus). As for other locations in the States, There are other tech \"hubs\" (New York City (Silicon Alley), the Research Triangle in North Carolina, also Austin, TX) that have different profiles from Silicon Valley.
