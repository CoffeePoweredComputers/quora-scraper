            "answer_text": "Here's the deal, and it works for all social platforms. If you are not paying for a service, you and your behavior is what is being sold to the people who ARE paying for the service. This is true on FB, G, Pinterest, Instagram, and every other platform. They are not \"spying\" on you; they are studying and recording everything you do and selling your behavior to people who pay for the ads that make the business profitable. \"Wrong\" people?  Who are they?  Anyone has always been able to find out about you; it simply took a bit more training, and sometimes, a badge. A friend who is building a website for a criminal defense lawyer got a call on his cell phone at 11:00 pm one night.  He said, \"how you you get my cell phone number? It's not listed.\"  The caller said, \"I'm a bail bondsman.  It's what we do.\" She didn't need FB. ",
