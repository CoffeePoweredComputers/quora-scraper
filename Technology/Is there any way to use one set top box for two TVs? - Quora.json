            "answer_text": "Yes you can. The set top boxes usually send out signals through all their ports. Thus, you can hook up one TV through HDMI port and the other one through A/V port or the even Coaxial cable port. But the drawback of this setup is that only a single channel will be played on both TVs and if the two TVs are in separate rooms, you could only change the channel from where the set top box is placed. Also I have seen in Electronics showrooms that a same channel is being played on many TVs simultaneously (around 20 - 30), so I guess there must be some sort of splitter available in the market to distribute the signal to multiple TV sets.
