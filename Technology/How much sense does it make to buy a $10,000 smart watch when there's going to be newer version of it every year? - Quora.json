            "answer_text": "What makes you think they'll be a newer version every year? Because that's what happened with Smartphones, Tablets, and Computers?  Even if there is a new version every year, that doesn't make your current version obsolete. I never quite understood all the people who complained when the iPad 4 was released 8 months after the iPad 3. My iPad 3 still worked fine and continues to work to this day. It didn't become obsolete. It still performs all the tasks I wanted it to do. It wasn't made useless by a new model coming out.  With the Apple Watch (I assume you're talking about that) it's even more that way. The Watch is basically an extension of the iPhone with a lot of sensors. So they could upgrade it with better sensors and better battery life, but your old Watch will continue to function just fine and will probably even get a software update. Additionally, if you bought the $1000 or great one you weren't buying it for functionality and more as a status symbol. It will still work for that.  Smartphones generally have a 2 year life cycle as dictated by the cell phone contract. Tablets we're still learning what their life cycle is but it could definitely be as high as 5 years. I think the Watch could be even higher as it will be hard to make an upgrade compelling. ",

            "answer_text": "Sense?  Logical rationale?   By most standards there isn't any.  However there will be an emotive tug. This is at once simple and complex, but bound up in this will be a desire to be seen wearing this thing.  Depreciation and inevitable technical obsolescence are not part of this equation. So you look at sense/logic from an emotional perspective.  How will the owner of the circa-2015 watch feel when the 2016 model, a thinner, sexier, perhaps more functional piece hits the runway?  Will they feel that their watch is still a classic timeless accessory?  Or will they feel some level of inferiority to walk around with a chunky out-of-date wrist brick?  I personally suspect the latter. All said and done, for someone wanting to wrap $10k around their wrist this makes perfect sense. ",
