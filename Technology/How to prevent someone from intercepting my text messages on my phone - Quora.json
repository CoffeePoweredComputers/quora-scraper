If it's a person near you who can have access to your actual device you're better off either putting an end to texting all together or deleting your message trail because they are intercepting your messages by actually reading them from your device.  If you're talking about a hacker then you need to invest in an encrypted messaging apps such as Signal which adds a layer of security to the already great iOS security.  Lastly - a social solution to both would be to have a second phone that isn't registered to you and that you don't always have on your person. They can't intercept that which they don't know that you have.  PS: Don't be so paranoid...generally speaking your text messaging only matter to you.  ",

Are you leaving your device laying around unlocked? Do you use a strong and unidentifiable password? Do you backup/save your messaages then delete them from your device? Those are some of the ways to protect your privacy. If you're not doing one or all of those things then you are inviting others to snoop on you so it's your own fault. Also, once you backup/save your messages and you delete them from your device then it is almost impossible for anyone to be able to retrieve your messasges as even your carrier/internet provider by law won't/can't retrieve your CPNI (Customer Private Network Information) short of a court order by a judge for a pending case. So, it's basically up to you to protect your information by using the safeguards I described earlier, if not, then you're allowing for your information to be snooped upon. There are different ways in which someone can be spying on everything you do. But for fixing service check, Private Network Information ",

There are other solutions for instant messaging someone, but aside from simply not texting people, the only thing that stands between you and someone intercepting text messages is the encryption inherent in the texting app. That speaks mainly to random people trying to 'hack' your phone. Since you seem to be asking about iPhones, though, let me assure you that iPhones are not susceptible to hacking.  There are apps available which can send a copy of text messages to the user from another device, but they are not intended for spying on random people. They're intended for parents protecting their children.  Lastly, such illicit activity is considered illegal wiretapping by the FTC, here in the USA.  ",
