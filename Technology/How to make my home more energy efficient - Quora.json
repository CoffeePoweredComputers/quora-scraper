House yachting submersible bilge pump + tiny check valve for rain tank & dam, mosquito & cockroach zapper, sewing machine, brilliant economical LED lights, flash-gun. 12 volt drill + screw-driver + many tools medium drill & attachments (jig, circular saw, sander, plane, grinder & kitchen items like mixers), micro tools, 12 v 30w solder iron, 24 volt welding from 2x12v batteries in series etc. Alternative laundry including 12volt vacuum cleaner bubbles in laundry bin water, hand or motor-rotated hot water pressure laundry, esky of laundry water on scooter or bike or boat trip, or standing on laundry in bowl whilst showering - ironing under mattress. Better than so-called \u201cRocket or Dakota Stoves\u201d (though these could be considerably likewise improved with following HELIXTOVE), small smokeless controllable one-stick HELIXTOVE stove that has air-preheating & after-burning + tiny fan if extra rocket-heat needed. Bush oven sits on top. Prize-winning homemade 25yo,3-wheel, dual, 1/4hp, 1WD, 40kg solar TRICAR needing no rego, licence or insurance on roads (not motorways), etc. SMALL ITEMS (some items worked from attached small solar panel without battery, though windup better in emergency): VOLTAP diode chain for items < 12 volts - tiny brilliant torch that needs only about 1 squeeze per week, shaver, calculators, stirrer, 3 clocks, watch, doorbell. Hose-reel garden pump where small solar panel drives its windscreen wiper motor directly - if not driven by a stream or wind - to drip-feed food plants.

Bed Hot water bottle like 2 litre drink bottles heated by microwave etc to avoid water waste. KEEP COOL: We hand-spray our T-shirt with water, then have a small fan playing on the moist T-shirt in real heat waves, that usually gets too cold & we have to slow or redirect the fan. With 2 or 4 watt car fan playing on bare legs is much cooler than if fan playing on face, arms etc; fans can often save more than \u00bd air conditioning power that we find unnecessary even in Queensland. For low-humidity areas we have a tiny 12volt water evaporator; big home units are very economical & take little power to supply cool air ducted around to each room. For outside in the sun, my favorite is a white hat topped with a small solar PV panel powering a cute little fan built into the front brim.

            "answer_text": "If you are doing new construction it's fairly cheap and easy to add in extra energy efficiency, but dealing with an existing house limits what you can do, short of gutting it. Modern building codes in many areas these days require more energy efficient construction. I speced out my home 15 years ago to be energy efficient. I brought a 1500 square foot modular house with 2x6 exterior studs, instead if the usual 2x4 construction. This allowed R19 insulation in the walls and R30 in the ceiling. Most of the house has thick padded carpet, which insulates the basement well. Windows are double pane with low E glass. The basement has thermal wrap around the top 4 feet of the walls, which stops frozen ground from chilling the basement too much in winter. I didn't feel an exotic HVAC would be cost effective, such as a geothermal heat pump. Based on my neighbors and brothers experience, I am glad I didn't take that route. Both have had major problems that cost many thousands of dollars to resolve, though both their houses were twice the size of mine. I opted for a conventional 14 SEER Trane Heat Pump, with a propane furnace as a backup, which has worked well for me. Some passive features I put in my landscaping were deciduous trees on the south and southwestern side of the house and evergreens on the north side. This provides shade in the hot and humid Maryland summers, and the evergreens act as a windbreak in the winter. I used to live in a smaller (1200 sf) house nearby that was built on a shoestring back in the late 1940s. It cost twice as much to heat as the newer house, even when oil was $1.79 a gallon. I can afford to keep the house at 70 in the winter and 75 in the summer. I am thinking of getting solar panels to take advantage of my south facing roof. They would not only generate electricity, but also shade my south facing roof in the summer. ",

            "answer_text": "Where do you live? I see a lot of people suggesting insulation and solar panels. Do not install solar panels until you've made your home as efficient as possible. If you install panels first you'll oversize the system and disincentivize making the house truly efficient. Solar and other energy sources aren't efficient, even if they're green. In a temperate climate like here on the California coast insulation isn't really a huge deal. If you're in a climate like I am start with lighting. The easiest way to start is replacing bulbs with high efficiency LEDs. The next step would be to install occupancy sensors that will turn lights on and off automatically. LEDs don't need to warm up to work, so the sensors allow you to make sure you aren't wasting light and electricity. Do you have a pool? Pool pumps are huge energy hogs. Getting a variable speed pump will save a ton of energy. After you've clipped the low hanging fruit you can start looking at the big stuff, if you can afford it. If you live in a warm climate consider a whole house fan. The draw cool air into your home through the windows after it cools down in the evening. That not only saves energy, it saves wear and tear on your air conditioning system. Speaking of air conditioning, you may consider replacing your existing compressor. Air conditioners have become very efficient in the last 15 years or so. Check out the following link: How Much Will a New Air Conditioner Save Me? If You need both cooling and heating look into a heat pump. All a heat pump is, is an air conditioner that can run both directions. When it's cooling your home it draws heat out and spells it outside. When it's working to heat your home it runs in reverse and pulls heat from the outside and puts it into your house. Keep in mind, heat pumps need SOME heat from the outside, so if it consistently gets below 0\u00b0 Celsius (32\u00b0 Fahrenheit) that may not be your best option. That should get you started. Just remember, energy efficiency is very different from energy production. Solar is great, but you'll spend to much (not to mention the environmental cost) if you put it on an inefficient home. Have fun! ",

            "answer_text": "There are many aspects and actions that you should consider when aiming at reducing energy use at your home. In general, the order that you should approach it is: Avoiding waste;Reducing your needs;Doing it more efficiently.Let\u2019s look into these in more detail: 1. The simplest and most generalizable option is questioning and analysing your energy-dependent routines and habits. Here are some examples: Are you leaving \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026 turned on whenever no one is using/needing it? (fill the blank with whatever equipment you might have at your place, e.g. lights, TV, Hi-Fi, etc.).Advice: Get into the habit of being mindful about your energy uses and avoid waste!Do you leave equipment on standby or chargers/transformers connected to the wall? (these still continuously use a small amount of energy, usually called vampiric consumption, that can add up to substantial amounts); common culprits are gaming consoles, TVs, Hi-Fi systems, computers\u2026Advice: if you only rarely use a specific equipment, you can just safely (generally) unplug it from the wall until you need it again; if it is something you use more regularly, then buy an extension with switches to turn on and off the power (some can even be switched with a remote!)Do you have a reduced-flow (water-saving) shower head or take very long showers or baths? (energy for heating water is usually a significant fraction of the energy you need)Advice: a small investment in a better shower-head can save you an enormous amount of energy and water! Shorter showers also help, of course!There are many other examples of daily aspects where energy is being used without really bringing any particular benefit (i.e. it is just wasted). If you\u2019re paying for it, make sure that you are getting something useful from it! 2. The second option is more location/culture/climate dependent and so no single answer will be fully applicable to your particular case. When you look at a building\u2019s energy uses, one of the largest tends to be ambient heating/cooling. That is why many will tell you that you need to improve your insulation, or get better windows, or wind-proof your place. In fact, the right answer really depends on where you are and what are your needs. Here are just a few examples: You live in a cold climate, then: install as much insulation as you can (particularly in the ceiling/roof); install better glazing (at least double); improve your window frames; install mechanical ventilation with heat-recovery; cover any air-leaks; etc\u2026Advice: This path is quite expensive but generally will still give you a good payback both in terms of improved comfort and financially. Better if you already had to renovate your place or if you are thinking of building from scratch.You live in a temperate climate, then: you want to capture as much sun as you can during the coldest days, storing it in internal mass, and shade the windows in the hottest days. Some of the options in the previous example also apply here, though to a lesser extent and requiring some extra considerations (for instance, insulation should go on the outside of the walls).Advice: Again, can get quite expensive, particularly because some options are not easily retrofitted into an existing place (e.g. increasing internal thermal mass);You live in a hot and humid environment, then: you really need to protect against the solar radiation (so, have proper external shading in the windows), and you will need air-conditioning. Extra thermal mass can help you cool down the building during the night and keep it cool during the day;Advice: external shading can be quite easy to install but the building codes in your city might not allow for any solution.In general, my recommendation in this front would be to either approach these improvements sequentially, while learning about their benefits, or hiring an expert. Your local climate is really important! The greatest advantage is that will immediately and permanently save you energy (through the reduction of your energy demand) while still improving your quality of life. The investment can be substantial but it generally it pays of quite quickly! Many other aspects of improving your building to reduce energy demand would be relevant here (e.g. ventilation, lighting, etc.) 3. The last option is to look into the energy efficiency of your equipment. In the previous two steps you have dealt with, first, not wasting, and then improving your house in such a way that you actually need less energy to achieve your comfort needs. Still, you will need to use energy-reliant equipment and in this case it should be as efficient as possible. A few examples of those: Fridges and freezers are particular culprits and \u2018energyvores\u2019. I\u2019d start by questioning the number, the size and quality of these.Lighting is probably the second biggest electricity user in your place if you are still using old incandescent lighting. Just move to LED and be done with it!Washing machines, dish washers, and clothes driers are another great target for energy efficiency action. Either question if you really need to have/use them (e.g. drying clothes outside at least part of the year will achieve instant savings).Water heating equipment, as explained above, can be a piece in the major energy use of water heating. If you have an old electrical tank-type solution, then there is a huge amount of improvement to be achieved. Many other options can apply (and a solar thermal panel may be a good option, depending on where you live).Many other options could apply. I could advise you starting by auditing your place, measuring each appliance and checking which are the most intensive energy consuming devices, but, in general, it is pretty obvious what the answer is. Still, such a study will not hurt and will get you informed (which is the first step in achieving improvements!). Do be aware that the highest absolute return in terms of energy savings will probably be achieved by the actions described above under number 2 (followed by number 3 and then 1). The mere fact that you asked about saving energy is already a great first step to achieving it. As I said, energy mindfulness ends up being the most critical aspect about achieving energy savings. You can be as technical as you wish, but at the end of the day, it is the human factor that determines how much energy is really used. After all, energy is used to provide for the human needs! ",

            "answer_text": "There are two main areas with two methods of improvement. First area is heating and cooling. Depending on your location, the amount of energy used to heat or cool the home can be significant. The first step is to make the house as airtight as possible, air leaks are the worst offenders in losing conditioned air. Minimizing air flow to only regulated ports and vents is usually a major upgrade, and often comes with a fairly large cost if the house is not built correctly. A secondary step is to increase the insulation value of the walls and attic areas. Direct loss of heat or cooling through the walls can be a major contributor to energy loss. Depending on the design of your house, it may be expensive or impossible to add a high level of wall insulation. The second area of heating and cooling improvement is how your house is conditioned. Using a modern heater/air conditioner can reduce your energy usage significantly. Using alternative methods such as ground heating/cooling units can reduce it even further. If you are willing to have a less regulated lifestyle then units such as swamp coolers, whole house fans or high efficiency wood stoves may provide additional cost savings at the expense of convenience or comfort. The second method of improving your house energy efficiency is in the daily use. First step is to switch to more efficient versions of your daily appliances - lights, TV, stove, etc. This will reduce your energy use when active. The other method is to reduce your vampire energy use - TV\u2019s, phones, computers, game consoles etc. often draw a base level of power while sleeping causing a continuous drain of energy. Simply putting these items on a power switch and shutting them off when not in use can reclaim up to 10% of your energy usage. To summarize, there is a wide range of things you can do to make your house more energy efficient. It is up to you to decide what your lifestyle and budget can accept in incorporating these methods.

            "answer_text": "Energy Efficient Solutions For Homes: There are a lot of ways that you can find energy efficient solutions for your home, and you need to be proactive in this so that you can bring down the cost of your electric bills and really make a difference to your wallet and the world. Here\u2019s how you can do it: 1)Audit Your Home Energy Use Getting an audit of your home energy use could be the best thing that you ever do for yourself as a homeowner. It\u2019s going to really help you to get the advice of professional energy assessors, and the assessments go into depth to assess your home\u2019s energy use. An energy auditor will go from room to room, examining your home and working through past utility bills, too. Most professional audits will also include thermographic scanning and the blower door test. This is all to determine whether your home is wasting energy \u2013 and where. Get a Free Energy Audit 2)Upgrading Building Shells Installing insulation is a way to slow down the transfer of heat by trapping the air, which leads to a huge reduction in energy waste. Your building shell insulation is extremely energy efficient and it\u2019s also cost-effective, leading to your home being insulated against air leaks. It\u2019s a fast way to reduce your consumption and lower your bills. 3)Upgrading Heating & Cooling System Your home doesn\u2019t have to be particularly large to be generating large electric bills every month, and a leaky heating and cooling system can really put pressure on your wallet. If you\u2019re interested in saving money and cutting costs, then it makes sense to upgrade your appliances in the home. One of those is your heating and cooling system, and upgrading this will stop you from using too much energy in the home. Not only will a damaged HVAC overdo it on the energy use and be inefficient for your home, but you\u2019re also going to find you\u2019re spending far too much money to keep it running. 4)Sealing Air Leaks Sealing air leaks is important when you want to find an energy efficient solution for the home because it stops the warm air from leaking out of your house, and your heating system from working overtime to heat a house that will never be warm. You can do a visual inspection of the house as well as find a professional to do a building pressurization test to check where the leaks are happening and seal them up tightly. 5)Insulation For Reducing Heat Flow Losing heat through the walls of the house can be greatly reduced by the use of cavity wall insulation. There is a gap between the walls in the house that you paint, and the brickwork outside, and when you fill this gap with insulation, you reduce the heat loss by conduction. This can save you money in the long term, as the less the heat is escaping your home, the more you get to enjoy it yourself. ",

            "answer_text": "I\u2019m a single woman and live alone. These are some of the things that I did to my home and although it saved \u2018pennies\u2019 here and there, those pennies added up. Without spending A LOT of money but a bit of time and energy, I\u2019d suggest the following (depending, of course, on where you live). The first thing I would do is check windows and doors. See if there is a \u2018leak\u2019\u2014air flowing in or out. You can do this with a small candle near the windows edges. If the flame of the candle wiggles\u2014air is coming in/out and you are loosing heat or cooling. Get some window/door sealant and apply it around the windows. I can\u2019t think of the name of it, but it\u2019s a foam stuff in various widths, comes in a roll, is sticky on one side. You can find it at home centers (Lowe\u2019s & Home Depot). Put it around the windows carefully on the inside. If you live in a desert area, as I do, and your house faces south or east, put sun screens on those windows. I made my own from materials I bought at Lowe\u2019s. Make sure your sinks, toilets, showers and outside faucets are not leaking or dripping. If they are, change the washers inside the faucets. If the toilet is \u2018running\u2019 you may have to change the parts inside the tank. It\u2019s not hard and the bits/parts come in a kit with instruction. Use lower watt light bulbs. There are various types of efficient light bulbs out there, change your bulbs. But IMO Hallogen bulbs burn too hot, so I\u2019d not recommend using those. In colder months, drop the thermostat in the house a couple of degrees and wear a sweater or sweatshirt. In summer, adjust the temp so it\u2019s a bit warmer inside and use fans rather than central air. Open up the windows as often as you can on cooler days and get the fresh air inside. If you can, add insulation into the attic. I found some brand new and unopened packages at Habitat for Humanity Resale store. Bought it all for a fraction of the cost at the home center and put up in my attic. It was a chore but I did it. I now have about 18 inches of insulation in the attic vs the 5 or 6 inches originally. I CAN tell the difference! My house faces south. Lots of sun and heat in summer hitting the house. I have an \u2018older\u2019 garage door and I insulated the inside of the door with 1\u2033 sheets of styrofoam from Lowe\u2019s. Glued it in place with liquid nails. Takes down the temp in the garage by several degrees which then affects the house. I don\u2019t use my clothes dryer in summer. It\u2019s in the garage and makes that hotter. I hang clothes outside or on hangers and clothes racks inside in the bathrooms. Just overnight and they are dry. I use the dishwasher at night and then only about twice a week. I do not use my oven during the summer unless I really need to bake something and then do it late at night when it\u2019s cooler and doesn\u2019t heat up the house. During the summer I mostly cook in my counter top appliances or grill outside. One thing I did invest in that was a bit pricey but well worth it was a \u2018swamp cooler\u2019 (or evaporative cooler). It cost me about $2000 installed. As I said, I live in the desert so it works good when our humidity is very low\u2014which it usually is. Swampers don\u2019t work well when the humidity gets up to more than about 12\u201315%. I installed it in the garage. It\u2019s a good sized one and will take down the temp in the whole house. (My home is just under 1800 sq. ft.) I put a screen door on the door between the house and the garage and have a fan near that door to draw the cooler air in. By using the swamper rather than the central air, I save LOTS of money! I can use the swamper thru most of the summer and don\u2019t turn on my central air until late Aug and/or Sept. With that swamper and ceiling fans the temp outside can be 112\u2013115 degrees and the inside of my home is about 76\u201378 degrees. Nice and comfy! I put it in 3 yrs ago and have compared my power bills from before and now and they\u2019ve dropped A LOT (from an average of $250-$280 a month with central air to an average of $125 using the swamper)! It\u2019s nearly paid for itself and probably will by the end of this up coming season! NOTE: Many newer homes are \u201copen concept\u201d\u2014all big open rooms with really high ceilings. IMO that \u2018looks nice\u2019 but it\u2019s not really very energy efficient. My home is an older home with standard 8\u2032 ceilings and I have \u2018rooms\u2019. I can close off the unused rooms so I\u2019m not heating/cooling rooms that I don\u2019t use on a daily basis (2 of the bedrooms and the dining room). I\u2019m sure there will be other folks who answer this question and can give you more and perhaps better suggestions. These things I\u2019ve done and they\u2019ve helped me to reduce my energy bills. ",

Blenders, toasters, electric blankets, hair dryers etc. Set your heat to 68 degrees in the winter and to 78 degrees in the summer to conserve energy. Seal drafty windows with weatherstripping, caulk and under-the-door seals to save hundreds of dollars yearly on wasted heating and cooling lost. Set your refrigerator to the reccomended setting. Limit the length of hot showers (10 min vs. 30 min) to conserve the energy needed to heat the incoming water. Switch from incandescent lightbulbs to LED bulbs to reduce your watt usage by 90% but still keeping the same light output. Close the heating and cooling vents off in rooms you regularly do not occupy such as a den, formal livingroom, basement, spare bedroom, rarely used home office etc. For the truly gung-ho, there are (Seek Brand) thermal cameras on Amazon that attach to your smartphone that show you where you are losing heat in your walls, floors, doors and windows by color gradients.

Things you do to save energy like, turning off lights, avoid wasting water, closing windows, etc can help you lower your energy bills. But what if there was a permanent solution to save energy and lower your monthly bills. Say hello to the energy audit. It is an overall assessment of your house so that you can go green and lower your overall energy bills. It can help you in determining how energy efficient your house is, and if there are any improvements that can be further incorporated. How Energy-Efficient Is Your Home? Using the latest Energy Gauge, a complete survey can be taken up for complete energy calculations. With HVAC system sizing, it can be used for carrying out house energy calcs. The system sizing calculation includes details like orientation and specification so that it ensures that HVAC units are correctly sized. In case of a new house being constructed, the HVAC Duct Design or the Manual D calculations is used by the inspector to do the energy calculations. Manual D calculations are mainly based on the heat loss or gain which is determined by the Manual J calculation. A Ductwork must be of a fixed size and placed in proper locations such that it differs from one building to other. An expert can help you to determine the proper size and ideal location for the ductwork to be placed. For the smaller building, however, which are reserved for the commercial use, light commercial energy calcs is used. Home energy audits can be taken up by various institutions. It serves not only buyers but builders, remodelers as well as HVAC companies to get the necessary documents for completing the project and meet the Florida energy code. ",

When a house is heated, the warm air rises and will flow out of any holes in the upper levels, and be replaced by cold air entering around windows, doors, outlets, etc., at the lower levels. This is called \u201cstack effect\u201d, and it can waste quite a lot of energy, because you paid to heat the air that is escaping, and have to heat the cold air that replaces it. Also, the draft from the openings feels cold and uncomfortable, so it\u2019s tempting to set the thermostat higher to counter that. The first place to look is in the attic. The plumbing vents, electric wires, ceiling fixtures and bathroom vents are common places where there is an opening between the warm interior, and the cold attic. These are best filled with expanding foam, but be careful around recessed light fixtures: Some must be ventilated and can\u2019t be enclosed. To find leaks inside the house, turn on all the exhaust fans and the clothes dryer and use an incense stick to check around the doors, windows and electrical outlets.

A simple and cheap check is to use a BBQ lighter as a drafting finder. On a windy day you hold the flame close to door frames windows. The flame bends if there is air flow. You then find a way to stop the airflow. Bathroom doors are a big payoff. The exhaust fan leaves a huge opening. If the door seals tight you WILL notice the difference. Best of all its low cost and diy. ",

We got triple-pane windows with a high R rating, added insulation to our attic, and made sure that the wall insulation was good.   Also, on cool Summer nights, we open the windows and shut off the A.C. to let nature cool the house down. (sometimes we use a fan to improve circulation of the air.) Close the windows before it starts getting warm in the morning, then set the A.C. thermostat to 80 F.  The human body can adjust to hot weather better if it is not spending a lot of time in an environment that is much cooler than outside.  In a day or so, the 100 F outdoor temperature will not feel so bad, and you'll use less energy.  The same goes for setting the thermostat to 60 F or cooler in the winter. ",

            "answer_text": " Insulation serves as resistance to heat flow from a warm space to a cooler one. The more heat flow resistance provided by your insulation, the lower your heating and cooling costs, and the more consistent the temperature within your home. During the winter months, heat flows directly from all heating living spaces to adjacent unheated attics, garages, basements, and even outside. That's why you may feel most comfortable in sweats and socks when sleeping! Heat flow can also move indirectly through interior ceilings, walls and floors - just about anywhere there is a difference in temperature. That's why it's never a good idea to close off registers in a seldom-used room, because the heat will eventually flow there anyway. During the summer months, things go in reverse with heat flowing from the sunny outdoors to the cool interior of your home. ",
