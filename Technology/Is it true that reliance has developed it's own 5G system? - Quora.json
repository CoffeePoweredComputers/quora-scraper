            "answer_text": "No Chance in Hell Reliance is simply increasing their 4G speeds which are now highly curtailed and calling it 5G. No way Reliance can develop a 5G network in a year. Impossible. They will simply roll out the 4G LTE that they have - and give higher speeds though introduction of faster segmented networks within the normal network and charge 10 times the normal amount - claiming it is 5G speed. Right now Jio gives an average speed of 78 Mbps at 10 PM in Chennai and 26 Mbps in Delhi at 10 PM (Speeds over 1 week at 10 PM) down from 328.8 Mbps in 2017 April in Chennai and 354 Mbps in Delhi. A 1 GB Torrent file on Jio 4G takes roughly 135 - 179 minutes on U Torrent to download completely. If Reliance genuinely provides 5G speeds - then the average speed should be 4265 Mbps at 10 PM at least. A 1 GB Torret file on 5G should take roughly 150 seconds to download completely Assuming that the Torrent file is not restricted or hampered by slow seeding networksSo Reliance Jio has to give us speeds of 4265 - 8035 Mbps to claim he is giving us 5G. No chance of that happening. Another Con for the Public of India Of course if Jio can give 4300 Mbps and i can download at speeds of 7 Mbps instead of 150 - 200 Kbps - then Yes - I will apologize. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, as per the announcement made by the chairman of Reliance Industries, Mukesh Ambani during the 43rd Annual General Meeting. The 5G has been developed totally in-house from scratch thus a first true Made in India network. He had further announced in Reliance AGM that Jio plans to offer the 5G technology to other telecom companies around the globe, which means Jio becomes a telecom equipment company too. Currently every mobile service providers around the world buy telecom equipments such as tower and network equipments and software solutions to manage the network from equipment vendors like Nokia, Ericsson, Huawei , ZTE and Samsung. This is the first such initiative by a mobile phone operator, that too, from an Indian service provider. Suddenly, Reliance has put India into global map of telecom equipment business. This is really a HUGE development for Idian telecommunication industry and Made in India initiative. Also now India doesn't have to use Chinese equipments from Huawei and ZTE. ",
