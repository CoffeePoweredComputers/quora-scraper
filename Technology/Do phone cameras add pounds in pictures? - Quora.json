            "answer_text": "It used to be said \u201ccameras add 10 lb\u201d and that was any camera. OK it doesn\u2019t add weight, what it adds is width. How? Because you are looking at a 3D body in 2D representation. Imagine looking at a cylinder. In 3D you see there is part of the cylinder closer to you then it curves away to its diameter, further away from you. You \u201cknow\u201d its a cylinder and you get a sense of width and depth. In 2D, you only see the full diameter without the sense of curving away. With lighting, you can add or subtract to the sense of width. Where the lighting is even, like for a TV newsreader, the width is \u2018flattened out\u201d and accentuated. With single source side or angle light you see the shape and textures better. Then, phone cameras tend to have wide angle lens as default, giving a wider field of view. They distort the perspective so things appear wider than in real life, what we call a barrel effect. Something like | | in real life will look like ( ) with a wide angle lens. ",

            "answer_text": "They can and when they do the effect is generally greater than with other cameras. Using other cameras (like a dSLR) you can select a lens that is a bit longer than \u201cnormal\u201d. This tends to flatten the view and record a pleasing image. Phone cameras tend to have very wide lenses (records a broad view at limited distances). Wide lenses exaggerate depth and if not used carefully can substantially distort an image, especially toward the image edges. Images produced under these conditions are generally less pleasing. ",

            "answer_text": "The prior answers are good. I would add that because they are so often used for selfies, phone cameras have wide angle lenses so they can be held at arm's length and still get everything in. Wide angle lenses tend to exaggerate perspective at close ranges, making noses look bigger and people look heavier. For that reason, professionals use telephoto lenses for portraits and model shoots; teles tend to flatten perspective, making people look thinner. ",
