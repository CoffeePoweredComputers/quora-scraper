            "answer_text": "Feedback control system Feedback control measures the output of a process, calculates the error in the process and then adjusts one or more inputs to get the desired output value.The feedback control reacts only to the process error (the deviation between the measured output value and set point). So, it is called as REACTIVE CONTROL.Feedback control measures the output and verifies the adjustment results. So, it is called as CLOSED LOOP CONTROLFeedforward control system Feedforward control measures one or more inputs of a process, calculates the required value of the other inputs and then adjusts it.Feedforward control has to predict the output as it does not measure output. So, it is sometimes called as PREDICTIVE CONTROL.Feedforward control does not check how the adjustments of inputs worked in the process. So, it is referred to as OPEN LOOP CONTROL.Read more differences here ",

            "answer_text": "How do feedback and feedforward control system differ? Control systems have an input and an output. If some of the output is fed back to the input, you have a feedback system. This usually maintains the system at a stable level. When this is not the case you have a feed-forward system. For example, a room may be heated by a fireplace using firewood. This would be an example of a feed-forward system. A heating system with a thermostat is an example of a feedback systems. Many aspects of living organisms work on the feedback principle. An elected official who casts his votes in the legislative body on the basis of his own conscience/thinking is working on a feed-forward principle. One who takes into consideration the letters/phone calls/complaints/suggestions is working on the feedback principle. A lecture on a subject would be a feed-forward mode. A debate on a subject is in a feedback mode. 23 Aug 17 ",
