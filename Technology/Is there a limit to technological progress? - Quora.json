            "answer_text": "Sadly, yes.Technology is limited by a few things, the first is Science, mainly Physics. It there is a limit to Science, and we as human being learnt everything about it, we can no longer improve our tehcnology by way of scientific breakthrough.The second is innovation, which isn't that much of a barrier since we can always have computers calculating all possible out comes and use the useful ones when we are advanced enough. We have AIs that can built yet better AIs now, sooner or later the innovation process can be handed to AIs no matter how there will always be haters about it and deny the fact.The greatest obstacle, may however, be resources and economy.Different iterations of technology will surely use resources, we may have almost unlimited resources considering the Universe is so large, it is still not infinite within our reach. There are many possible reasons for this, for example, if there is no possible way of fast intersellar travel, we can almost never reach enough resources outside our solar system in time to do most of the advancement in technology, even if the Science limit is not reached. Different possible limits like intergalactic travel, interuniverse travel, etc.Anyway, at a certain point on, no human will see the difference. Life will be pretty much the same if the Science limit is reached or the scale gets too large, it will never magically change since the technology is already pretty much star systems/galactic level and human beings are too small to notice the changes that are too far away or too grand in scale. Taking a analogy, imagine if super novae are triggered by a really advance technology, do you really feel the difference other than maybe a brighter star in the sky for a few days and astronomy news you may not even read about?

            "answer_text": "The short answer is, in my opinion, no. Someday we may, in theory, approach a limit to our knowledge of physics, biology and other sciences (should we ever reach such an advanced level of civilization). I don\u2019t know if we will, but let\u2019s assume such a point exists. All of our technology certainly depends on our knowledge of science, but is not strictly limited by it. It\u2019s limited only by how we have applied that knowledge. Many of our recent advances are a result of simply doing more with the basics which we\u2019ve known for quite a while. Recent advances in many technologies came about only because of advances in other technologies; they didn\u2019t depend on fundamental breakthroughs in things like theoretical physics. For example, recent developments in artificial intelligence are due to the existence of large amounts of data and more powerful computers, which resulted from the growth of the internet and incremental progress in computing hardware. The basic software techniques existed a few decades ago. The advance of technology has always been an uneven and unpredictable process, steadily building upon its ever changing self. Humans have always been ingenious inventors, so I don\u2019t see us ever running into a limit. ",
