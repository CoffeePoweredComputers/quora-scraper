            "answer_text": "Reopening the country is a COVID-19 scam. The \u201ccon\u201d is for working-class people to pay with their lives so that rich people who can afford to continue sheltering in place can make a profit.Any herbal supplement or natural remedy claiming to boost your \u201cimmune health\u201d is a scam. The FDA has determined that the phrase \u201cimmune health\u201d is formally meaningless, and thus is not a lie when made as a claim. It means nothing, but is used cynically by makers of quack remedies because it sounds like something real.Likewise, any claim made in a health-food store but not printed on the bottle label is not considered to be a lie. Best to stay away from these places. The sellers probably don\u2019t wear masks because their \u201cimmune health\u201d is so good.Any claim made by airlines or cruise lines about how much they clean their facilities is a scam. They cleaned one airplane (or cruise ship), one time, so they could take the pictures they are showing you. Any other cleaning depends on whether they have time before turning around the flight (or cruise). So cleaning is kind of an aspirational goal, not a rule. Same with airlines\u2019 promise not to fill the middle seat. Once you get on the plane, you may discover (as others have already) that they lied, and then it\u2019s too late to get off.Did I mention that reopening the country is a scam?Testing and contact tracing isn\u2019t exactly a scam (usually), but it doesn\u2019t help you. There is a 5\u201310% false negative rate, which means you can test negative and be positive. Meanwhile you (or the person next to you) is merrily spreading the virus. And you might get infected five minutes after you take the test. Testing is useful to authorities monitoring the health of a whole population, but mostly useless to you as an individual.",

Or selling guaranteed safe face masks that will protect you from any infectious virus, or any covid-19 bacteria (it\u2019s a virus, stupid). I\u2019m not sure how the feds will handle the promised monies, but that will probably be via the Treasury department with info from the IRS. Oh, and the criminal justice department - hey don\u2019t forget the people in the pen. LOL ",
