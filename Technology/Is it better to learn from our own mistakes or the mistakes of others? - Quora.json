            "answer_text": "Should you learn from other people's mistakes and realizations or does it need to happen to you in order for you to learn from it? You definitely have an advantage in life if you can learn from other people\u2019s mistakes and realizations instead of learning through your own trial and error. I\u2019m sure you can identify that person right now, whose life is train wreck and they can\u2019t seem to get it right. You may not know them personally, but you know of them. When you think about it, and \u201cthink\u201d is the operative word here, why align yourself with the train wreck if you have any potential to take your life in a positive direction? If that is the person\u2019s example you choose to follow, then perhaps you are a glutton for punishment or there is something familiar about the discord and dysfunction that you are drawn to. If you observe rude and insulting behavior, why do you think that person will treat you any better? Believe what the person is showing you and don\u2019t think you and your love will change them in the future. When you see the red flags waving in the wind, take heed because you don\u2019t get a trophy for ignoring them and overlooking what the red flags indicate. Red flags mean stay away, run for your life and problems ahead! You most likely will end up with disappointment and heartbreak. Life is happening all the time and all around us, so if we pay attention, we can learn a lot. Sometimes the greatest lesson is who we don\u2019t want to be or what we don\u2019t want to do. We all have the ability to make choices in our lives and when we make choices void of thought or experience, we pay the price. When we make choices based on observations of other people\u2019s successes or failures, we save ourselves a lot of time and grief. When we can learn to steer clear of potential problems that we identify and see playing out in other people\u2019s lives, we can avoid a lot of life\u2019s drama. ",

            "answer_text": "Hello~ Thanks for the A2A. I'm not sure if you have received the advice of other before (especially adults) and decide that you are going to do what you wanted to anyway? I have, I chose to go with what I wanted / felt, and ended up making (big) mistakes for not listening. And paid a price for learning mistakes the hard way.  When you are engaged in a situation, where you are the person involved, it is quite hard to stay objective and do what is logically right at time.  Then again, there are those who are able to stay objective and see the big overall picture, disconnect themselves and pick up lessons before the mistakes even strike them.  In truth, you might be able to learn better and faster when you start picking up lessons from others for more logical and practical matters. For instance, you can see how others have shared various productivity tools, life hacks, study tips and many other mistakes to avoid when doing certain things. However, there are also certain things (mistakes) in life you need to experience for yourself in order not to make them again. Most of the times, these are less practical and more personal and emotional experiences, such as losing own phone or wallet because you don't have a habit of securing your own belongings or less aware of your surroundings, being too trusting, among many others.  The thing is, for more logical and practical lessons, we are able to reason them out and if we accept them, we practice them.  For the more personal ones, when you are advised not to do something that you originally intended to do, you might find yourself fighting the urge to do it even when you choose to follow the advice or lessons of others. The more others say no, the more you will want to go ahead for various reasons (to prove them wrong, think that you might be able to change the outcome, etc) or that it becomes a recurring thought you find yourself struggling to forget (what if i did it? would it be different).  Mistakes are there to help us learn and grow. When we make mistakes, we not only learn to deal with failure and pick up lessons, we also learn to manage our selves, our emotions and reflection skills. We build our ability to assess situations and process our thoughts better. When you learn from others, the lesson may stay for a while, but when you have experienced it, the lesson stay with you for life.  If there is something that you believe it is worth going after, go for it. You might fail and end up having a lesson learned, or you might succeed and be proud of it, but don't live your life sitting on the bench worrying about trying.  ",
