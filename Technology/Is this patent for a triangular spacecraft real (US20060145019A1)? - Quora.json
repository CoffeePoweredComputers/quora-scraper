            "answer_text": "First, it\u2019s a patent application, not a patent. It\u2019s real, in the sense that some guy paid the fees to file it. But I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s real, in the sense that the invention described in the application works. Notably, the application went abandoned a couple years after filing, due to the applicant not responding to the patent examiner\u2019s rejection. In turn, the examiner\u2019s rejection primarily involved the claims being unclear. ",

I can\u2019t fathom why or how this black budget $3 billion project made it to light this way. What\u2019s important is that it did. Now we the taxpayers can file a freedom of information act requesting everything about it. This particular project was in progress way back in 1992 and definately flying in 1994. I can only imagine what kind of space missions it had. ",
