            "answer_text": "California is the father of all the world\u2019s clean air regulations. They were pioneers. It started when they did studies in the early 60s to see why the Los Angles basin are almost perpetually covered with smog. They discovered one of the main source of air pollution forming smog came from auto emissions.Soon after that, they isolated 3 main chemicals most responsible for the smog. Not in any order. 1) HCL, hydro carbon, basically raw unburnt gasoline vapor 2) Carbon Monoxide from incomplete combustion 3) Nitrous Oxide, a product of high temperature in the combustion chamber. Laws were then passed to limit these chemical emissions, and we start seeing new cars came with many add on anti pollution devices starting around 1972. model year, it usually take the auto makers maybe 3 years to start equipping their cars. I believe soon the US federal government adapted its own set of pollution laws, but they are a step less strict than Calif. They been that way ever since, until recent years when it is no longer necessary to have a special Calif. version car. From cars the pollution controls quickly spread to other emission sources such as power plants , factories motorcycles and even lawn maintenance tools. By 1980s, 2 stroke motorcycles were extinct. I am waiting for the day when someone have a heart attack, ambulance arrive, wheeled him inside and put a mask on his face. The other end of the mask will be hooked into the exhaust outlet of the ambulance. It will be THAT clean! ",
