            "answer_text": "Something right up front that helps them to loosen up and get to know more about each other. Socially interactive games or team building exercises that help them learn names and social or professional interests of other attendees would be excellent.  If the conference doesn't provide dinner, something that would group them up to go out to dinner at recommended nearby restaurants by food type (Italian, Chinese, etc.) could be good. Make it easy for those who aren't into group dinning to opt out.  Many conference attendees are jealous of smokers who are always the first to exchange names and group up when they are 'ostracized' to the designated smoking area outside and down the street.  Select someone with an appealing personality that everyone will want to meet and this exercise (some adults don't like the word game) will go better. Look for something that fits the size of your group (a dozen or hundreds?) and look for a way to link it with other professional objectives.  Example: Technical conferences will often have one breakout session where they do a birds of a feather type group session with or without assigned discussion leaders to cover special interests. Helping those people who have a lot in common professionally to find each other on the first evening of the conference instead of the last morning is very valuable.  A frequent regret at the end of most conferences is you didn't meet those from whom you learned so much or who you really enjoyed earlier in the event. ",

            "answer_text": "Personally, my pick is MeetingPulse. I have used it a number of times for big events, and each time the engagement level of my attendees has been spot on. This is a web-based system that takes just a few seconds to set up with no app download or hardware device needed.

It\u2019s a great technology for large crowds, where you may have a harder time maintaining everyone\u2019s engagement. Plus, with this software, you are sure that everyone in the audience is given the chance to take part in the discussion. Even the most shy person in the group can send in their question without having to speak in front of everybody. ",
