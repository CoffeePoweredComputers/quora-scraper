            "answer_text": "I do not quite get what you\u2019re asking. As far as I remember, copyright protection on DVDs is designed to prevent copied DVDs from being played. It shouldn\u2019t prevent a legit copy from working. Region-locked DVDs do of course exist and most DVD players can be reset a few times to change the region they play. My advice if you want a DVD player that plays the biggest range of stuff? Buy a really cheap one from a brand you have never heard of. If you get a Sony, say, it will tend to be more serious about preventing you from doing stuff that Sony don\u2019t approve of, and Sony are of course a massive content company as well as a hardware manufacturer. Get one made by someone who doesn\u2019t much care. ",

            "answer_text": "You are asking for a mechanical device that will work forever without developing a fault. Such a thing does not exist. Modern DVD players have excellent error-correction. It would be unusual to find a DVD which will play in one player and not another, unless one player is failing. ",
