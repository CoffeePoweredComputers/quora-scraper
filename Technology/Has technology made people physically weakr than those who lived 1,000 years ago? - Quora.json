            "answer_text": "On average, ABSOLUTELY. The reason is not so much that the technology has made people weaker, it\u2019s that the technology has allowed people to live longer. Back in the year 1020, you\u2019d probably be VERY lucky to make it to 40. Now people routinely live to 75. So if your population age is 90% under the age of 40 it will be on average much stronger physically than a population that\u2019s just about 50/50 0\u201340, and 40-dead. \u201cTechnology\u201d has also allowed people to not have to work quite so hard to not starve to death, and to make clothes, and to maintain the necessities of life. I would argue that the people of today expend as much, if not more physical energy than the people of yesteryear, they just space it out over a much longer period of time. Is that weaker? Maybe. Is it better for you and me? Absolutely. ",
