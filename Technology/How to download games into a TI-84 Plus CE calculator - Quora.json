You should be able to browse the variables and other data stored on the calculator.Find a game! There are many great resources for TI programs and games, including TI-Basic Developer, Cemetech, TI84CalcWiz, and ticalc.org. I\u2019ll also do a shameless plug for some of my own games: FLOW, Mancala.Download the game (usually a .zip folder) and extract its contents to the MyTiData folder usually found under Documents (or the Mac equivalent); this is where TI Connect stores and loads content by default.Send the program (.8xp or .8xg file) to the calculator; you can do this by either clicking Send to Calculator on the main screen or selecting the option under Actions.If you downloaded a .8xg, you\u2019ll need to Ungroup it on the calculator itself by pressing [2ND][+}[8] and selecting UNGROUP and the name of the group. Then navigate to the game program under PRGM and run it!",
