            "answer_text": "I started out skiing for 2 years, and recently switched to snowboarding last year. Besides what Robin Johnson wrote in their answer, and the different techniques required to do those 2 sports, I\u2019ve also noticed these other differences: when off the slope, transporting snowboarding gear is much easier than ski gear. This sounds trivial, but sometimes I get exhausted just carrying my skis and poles walking in my ski boots even before I get on the slope. I never have that issue with snowboarding.Snowboard boots are more comfortable than ski boots. I know people who literally choose snowboarding because they can\u2019t stand being in ski boots.Skiing lets you go on a much wider range of terrains than snowboarding. Moguls? Totally flat traverses? Slight uphill? Super narrow runs? No problem! Snowboarders tend to be much pickier about what runs they want to do.Falling on a snowboard is much easier. If you don\u2019t know how to fall on skis, you might end up bending your knees in strange ways that causes strains. Falling on a snowboard (and stoping yourself from sliding down the rest of the slope) is super straightforward. Also, after falling, getting up on skis is much more difficult than getting up on a snowboard. Expert snowboarders I know fall much more often than expert skiers I know; I suspect it\u2019s because of this.Skiing is much easier to learn as someone who\u2019s just getting into snow sports. But snowboarding feels more intuitive once you learn it, so it\u2019s easier to go from intermediate to advanced.Ski gear is more expensive than snowboard gear.Most ski resorts are more designed for skiers than snowboarders. Chairlifts are more comfortable on skis than snowboards, some transportation methods (like the Lookout link at Northstar) are designed for skiers to use.",

            "answer_text": "Well the short answer is that modern skis have become better because of snowboarding. Back in the day ski technique required compression and angulation to bend the ski in order to \u2018bounce\u2019 a turn it was quite hard to move from the initial \u2018stem turn\u2019 to parallel turns required to be a good skier. The snowboards arrived and used surfing style via the boards side cut to carve their turns, it wasn\u2019t long before ski manufacturers adopted wider skis with side cuts in order for skiers to emulate the ease (but not necessarily the style)of snowboarding in powder and as snowboards advanced so did their performance on the piste, not that a snowboarder really wants to join the crowds of ski pole infested rabble that use the pisted areas. Ski-ing is much easier to learn than snowboarding, but more difficult to become very good at. Snowboarding has a very steep entry learning curve and can really only be adopted by relatively fit and able folk, just to be able to get from the seated to standing position on the board, never mind actually turning, whereas even a child can be placed on a set of skis given a gentle shove and it\u2019s off down a shallow slope. So ski-ing really is the province of women and children in the minds of the snowboarder and snowboarders by their very fit and able nature tend to become quite good at it or give up, there are few half measures. Many snowboarders that have succumbed to family life and mountain trips inevitably take up ski-ing, so the benefit of modern skis that function in a similar way to a snowboard is a bonus. As to which is best a ski or a snowboard, snowboard development in recent times has lead the charge, with varieties of camber and mixed radius sidecuts sometimes not always to the sports greater benefit. Skis had the one quantum leap from long narrow to shorter and fatter with side cut and a variety of terminology that these days is beyond me, I gave up skiing in 1993 before the advent of the new generation parabolic etc so you\u2019ll have to draw your own conclusion, which is best? To me Snowboarding, for lots of reasons not least cultural. ",
