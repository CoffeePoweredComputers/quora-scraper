            "answer_text": "A colon removes moisture from a person\u2019s digested food. After the water has been removed we have what is known as stool left or as we like to call it poo or poop if your American. Our poo then makes its way though our colon to rectum and our spinster muscles then push the poo out of our body. Since women eat they poo as well so because women poo as well as men women also need to have a colon. So yes women do have colons. ",
