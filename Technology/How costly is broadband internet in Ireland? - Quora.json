            "answer_text": "We live in a rural, country, hilly area just outside a small village. As such, we are around 10km from the nearest telephone exchange. This means that wired broadband is unavailable. Our only option is wireless broadband through the mobile phone system. Due to nearby mountains, coverage does fluctuate, the signal switches between 3G and 4G regularly. Our modem is capable of 5G ! But little hope! Overall, the best provider we have found is the \u20183\u2019 network. For \u20ac29.99 per 28 day month we get \u2018unlimited\u2019 broadband - checking with the \u20183\u2019 app shows we get 700 GB+ per month, but with the local available download rate, we use less that one-tenth of that, even though as retirees we both spend a fair bit of time on the internet, and use Facetime and Skype regularly. So, we are quite happy with the price, and the \u2018unlimited\u2019 aspect, but hope for a better download performance in the future. We have tried other providers, both for internet and for mobile phones, but their signal was too unreliable in this area. Our other available options are (1) satellite broadband or (2) line-of-sight broadband. Both of these require a large capital outlay before use, with no guarantee of performance, so they\u2019re out! In larger towns and cities there are options of wired or fibre optic broadband at what seem to be good rates. Anyone wanting info on these should find it from an internet search. We just keep our fingers crossed for better downloads in the future. ",
