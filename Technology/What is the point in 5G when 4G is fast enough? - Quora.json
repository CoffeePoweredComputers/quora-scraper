            "answer_text": "The main advantage of 5G offers over 4G LTE is faster speeds primarily . There will be more spectrum available for 5G and it uses more advanced radio technology. But everything is not about speed. 5G will also deliver much lower latency than 4G, which will enable new applications in the IoT(Internet of things) space.  Hager speeds that really set 5G apart from any of the 4G LTE flavors require mm-wave high-frequency bands. These high frequencies have very large bandwidths, so they are ideal for keeping everyone connected in busy environments like a stadium. Making this work efficiently depends on massive MIMO (Multiple-Input Multiple-Output) and beamforming. While 4G base stations might typically have 12 antennas to transmit and receive data, 5G base stations might support 100 antennas. The thing about these higher mm-wave frequencies though is that they are much easier to block and multiple antennas can lead to a greater interface. That\u2019s why 5G need when 4G is fast enough.  Hope this explanation help, OKportal Technology ",

            "answer_text": "For most people there won't be a noticeable difference as increased speeds won't allow you to say watch a video any faster. However 5G does offer lower latency and that could be useful for gamers (though I\u2019d guess they'd really use broadband), maybe some financial traders might benefit. Real gains will start appearing when smart-cities and autonomous cars start appearing as they need high speed, low latency connections to update information etc and communicate with the smart-city environment. Much of 5G is hyped. ",
