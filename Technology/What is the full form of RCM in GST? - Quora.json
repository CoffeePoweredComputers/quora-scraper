            "answer_text": "In normal course of business a transaction takes place as under: When you (as a recipient) buy some taxable product from someone (being a registered supplier under GST), you pay an amount that equals the taxable value of the product plus the tax (GST) on that product to that someone (supplier). The supplier will accept the total amount, keep the taxable value in his pocket and pay the tax to the GST Department (using cash or credit or both) and the transaction ends here. Note: It should be noted here that any supplier (of goods or services) ought to be registered in GST for collecting tax under GST, otherwise, it will amount to an offence under GST law. Now imagine a situation where the supplier (as above) is not registered in GST, but the recipient (that means you) are registered with GST (Section 9(4) of CGST Act or Section 5(4) of IGST Act). [In case if both the supplier and recipient are not registered in GST then that transaction does not fall under GST law and therefore RCM does not come in picture, however, collection of GST in the instant scenario shall still amount to an offence under GST law] Now, since the supplier is not registered in GST, therefore, is not empowered to collect GST for taxable supplies. And since the recipient (that means you) are registered in GST, therefore, the transaction will fall within the purview of GST law and therefore entail payment of tax on the taxable supply. {Any transaction involving a registered person, whether as a recipient or supplier, in course of furtherance of business, shall always fall within the purview of GST law and will entail payment of tax on such transaction) Now someone has to collect the tax and deposit it in GST Department bank account. Under these circumstances comes Reverse Charge Mechanism (RCM) into picture. That is to say, here a reverse mechanism will operate to the effect that the recipient of the supply (instead of the supplier) will collect and deposit tax to the GST Department by itself raising an tax invoice in its name to show charge of tax, since an unregistered person cannot collect tax and therefore cannot raise tax invoice but bill of supply. How\u2019s that!!! (Section 2(98) of CGST Act) RCM comes again into picture under section 9(3) of CGST Act (or section 5(3) of IGST Act) wherein certain notified (by the govt.) supplies are to be mandatorily treated as supplies under reverse charge, that is, it is mandatory for the recipient of supply (instead of supplier) to charge and deposit tax to GST Department, again by itself raising a tax invoice in its name to show charge of tax. Below is the link to notification for certain supplies to be treated under RCM under provisions of section 9(3) of CGST Act or section 5(3) of IGST Act. There are as well other notifications and amendments thereof, available on the CBIC website. http://www.cbic.gov.in/resources//htdocs-cbec/gst/Notification10-IGST.pdf;jsessionid=A9D515D0A54DD6C1805900F47E50970F http://www.cbic.gov.in/resources//htdocs-cbec/gst/Notification-for-reverse-charge-CGST.pdf;jsessionid=5F035C3FA690878FA0070C81EBBD8828 Some points worth nothing about RCM: Input supplies with tax paid in RCM are not included in turnover.ITC is not available on RCM supplies, i.e. if you are supplying certain goods in RCM (under Section 9(3) of CGST Act and 5(3) of IGST Act), you cannot avail input credit for such supplies and hence the name blocked credit. (Section 17(2) and 17(3) of CGST Act), although inputs purchased in RCM are eligible for ITC if not contrary to the foregoing.As per Section 24(3) of CGST Act, a person required to pay tax in RCM under Section 9(3) of CGST Act and 5(3) of IGST Act, have to take compulsory registration.",

Generally, it\u2019s the liability of the seller or supplier to collect and deposit the amount of GST to the government. (Ofcourse he finally collects the same from customer but the immediate liability falls on him). RCM stands for Reverse Charge Mechanism as the name suggest the liability to deposit the amount of GST is reversed in RCM. Thus a person who receive the service or buys product is made liable to pay GST on such input supply received by him. Hope that helps! ",

However, this still qualifies for Input Tax Credit for the recipient. For Eg. If a registered dealer received service/ goods from an Unregistered dealer and the nature of service is subject to reverse charge in the ambit of GST Act, the registered dealer shall not pay the tax portion to the supplier, rather deposit it as a part of RCM on the GST portal. This is unlike non-RCM supplies where the supplier of service collects tax and deposits it. In RCM, the tax paid by the recipient forms a part of his Input Tax Credit just as ordinary tax paid on non-RCM supplies. ",
