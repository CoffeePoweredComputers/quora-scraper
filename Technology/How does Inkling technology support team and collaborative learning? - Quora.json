            "answer_text": "Within Inkling, groups of students with the same textbook can follow each other much like they can on Twitter. Once you're following another student, you can see their notes alongside your own, making it possible to have a conversation right in the margins of the book. This simple feature turns reading and traditional study into a shared experience, and it's really only the tip of the iceberg in terms of what they can eventually do with the platform. In the pilot program we saw instructors using this feature in really interesting ways. One teacher followed all the students in her class and asked them to write notes in the margins responding to the text. Then, during class, she would project the interesting notes onto the board and turn them into a centerpiece for discussion. This kind of thing could work well in any group setting to encourage engagement with the text and promote collaborative learning. ",
