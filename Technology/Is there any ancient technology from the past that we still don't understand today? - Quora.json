            "answer_text": "Minoan technologies are not well understood. We tend to think of technology (the art of science) as modern, however, some ancient civilisations were really good at developing new technologies and exploiting them to improve their lives. SummaryConsider the scene and oar arrangement on the flotilla fresco from Akrotiri, Thera (Santorini) to another Greek island, Delos at the centre of the Cyclades (it\u2019s naval). Images can be zoomed by clicking on them. State of the art technology before circa 1628 BCE and a glimpse into the Minoan World, enjoy \u2026  Theran white-hulled FleetSmall boats of 10 rowing oars or less, are shown as plain wooden hulls in the fresco. Those over 10 oars are white hulls or copper in one case. The significance being that large plain wooden hulls over 10 oars (non-Minoan) for transporting goods can be identified as they pass through the Cyclades and duty potentially levied. Minoan Peak Sanctuary Observatories are present at elevated mountain tops and peaks which have a commanding view of the shipping lanes, farms (to estimate areas to establish quota for tax), the night sky noting the clear markers for measurement, potentially signalling and night fires providing a beacon for boats.  Peak Sanctuaries have line-of-sight between them across most of the islands in the Cyclades. Line-of-sight to the horizon from a ship's deck is approximately 4kms by comparison.  Large Labyrs or double-axe (mirrors) could have been rested on the so-called stone \u2018horns of consecration\u2019 for signalling and coordinating fleet. Peak Sanctuaries likely used for solar observation and astronomy, as well of observing coastal approaches and shipping lanes. You can see the ware and repair on the artefacts below. N.B. The double axe is gravity cast flat in copper and would be approximately 85% reflective when polished on the \u2018A\u2019 side.    In this way, large double-axe mirrors (3m high), could be rested against the \u2018horns\u2019 on the wall of the peak sanctuary and retained using a base and rocked to signal over a huge distance, a translation of Labrys is \u2018bright\u2019, interestingly \u2018lightening\u2019 means \u2018star-axe\u2019.  Consider what is shown on this seal mirrors which could be seen from over 200kms away.  Talos (machines) possibly an early catapult (Minoans were proficient with standoff weapons, slings and archery, and as you can see are good at technical development). One can see on this seal, peak sanctuaries may be connected in some way and a catapult is implied for throwing rocks (likely protecting ports and or nature harbours), encouraging ship to anchor in ports where duty could be levied by throwing rocks at ships trying to anchor in natural harbours and circumventing the ports authority (and tax)!  The historians generally concur that early machines likely existed as accounts refer to automatons, statues that move by themselves. Although there are no archaeological early examples that survive, my own view is that pulley wheels were within there manufacturing capability, these automatons delighted audiences with their movements and \u2018sang\u2019. I think we can reasonably assume Minoans were \u2018nerds\u2019, whether male or female they loved their technology. There are accounts of Hephaestus creating a serving automaton, likely three-wheeled trolley to serve food that could at least \u2018walk in\u2019 and return. The account of Daedulus alludes to how they might be powered, he used mercury which is 13.5 times denser than water, in this way the liquid can sequence movement when it fills a pot and under gravity falls, moving a spindle or pulley wheels to actuate movement of limbs, that could also draw in air (through a whistle) as it escaped which could explain how the machines were able to sing. Though how complex these machines were is difficult to say.  The early craftsman may possibly have been able to achieve something like this, both of these are much later example and in this case, I think it is likely to be a bigger device and would use pulleys rather than gears.  There is an intriguing account of a palace of Baal having a door that opened with fire (steam), that is thought to be built by Minoan engineers. I think this possible, they had hot and cold running water to upper stories in palaces and their hydroengineering is generally considered to be comparable with 18th century Europe, the significance of this would be that they are exploring using machines to do significant mechanical work. Of all the civilisations at this time, the Minoans are on a trajectory to bring about an industrial revolution sooner, they are at the level of making many copies (batch production), then not quite there and then in 1628 BCE Thera erupted and they never fully recovered to the same level of sophistication and had other priorities.  Carian marinesThe so-called \u2018ship-wreck\u2019 fresco is in the same room as the first flotilla fresco that may be part of the same story on the North Wall, that may suggest Carians are paid in head of herd, a hecatomb - 100 cattle [/island?] at a festival to Apollo on Delos, the centre of the Cyclades. This is aligned to the oral accounts for the founding of Delos. Delos, if you would be willing to be the abode of my son Phoebus Apollo and make him a rich temple \u2013; for no other will touch you, as ou will find: and I think you will never be rich in oxen and sheep, nor bear vintage nor yet produce plants abundantly. But if you have the temple of far-shooting Apollo, all men will bring you hecatombs [hundreds of head of herd] and gather here, and incessant savour of rich sacrifice will always arise, and you will feed those who dwell in you from the hand of strangers; for truly your own soil is not rich. Homeric Hymn to Delian Apollo 51\u201360 It is known that Carians lived on Delos and adjacent islands, including Naxos, a redistribution centre. Carians supplied crew and soldiers (marines) for Minos\u2019 navy. Carians being accredited with many shield inventions, horsehair helmets and military dances (formations/drill), they were considered by the later Greeks to be the most disciplined fighters, for hire (later in history), full-time professional soldiers. Note the Ship Winter storage sheds.  Delos today, is one of the most if not the most archaeological dense sites in the entire world.   Carians were known to be driven out of the islands by Minos (ca. 1,600\u20131450 BCE) and resettled on Caria which is where they get their name from, sometime after the Thera eruption, possibly a civil war broke out as the islands did not have food surplus available. This seal may represent this, a Cretan athElite left and Carian right. This same scene is recorded on many Minoan seals but this is one of the finest (ever found), it is 1.4\u2033 in size.  Zoomed in to approximately 10mm wide, the fidelity is extraordinary, the woollen kilt has clear raised lines with a fineness of less than 0.1mm (circa, 60 microns and very consistent, a human-hair fine). It does beg the question as to how this was made without optical magnification? Read on. If you download this image and zoom in you can see microdrill holes in the hairline - only a few, the artist missed, how they produced such fine rebated square sections I have no idea, it would be admired whenever it was produced, but this is circa 1500BCE, this entire width is 10mm, it is jaw-dropping).  This is a 1mm square section and if you look carefully you can see some of the milling holes have not been worked. This suggests a tool bit of around 0.06mm and placement precision of 0.02mm, as you\u2019ll see Minoans had lenses to realise this\u2026  It is worth adding that a compass may have been used to create this seal, the significance of this is that you can dramatically increase engineering tolerances. The dividing calliper (compass) is accredited to Perdix (Daedalus\u2019 nephew), which archaeology seems to confirm is correct.  This does tend to suggest that the majority of Minoan artefact currently found are Minoan brick-a-brac, what is needed is a deserted Minoan Citadel and there is one, see fresco, its around the Modern-day airport on Thera under a large amount of pumice that has likely preserved everything! The Theran eruption caused regional and to a less degree globe crop failure with the ash fallout (tree ring circles from Ireland had been used to date this eruption and there are other written accounts as far east as China) and with this the potential inability of the islands to pay the Marines in cattle!  Vulcanologists generally concur, the Thera caldera had a single opening to the Sea to the West before ca 1628BCE when the eruption occurred, which implies that the fleet is heading North (to Delos) rather than South to Crete.  Fresco orientated to North (left), e.g to Delos, noting this is shown on the North Wall of the room also, Thera pre-eruption (middle) and today (right). Weight assisted propulsion (lost in antiquity). The oars on the large ships appear to protrude mid-hull. This may be a counterbalanced oar, that uses a rope around the oar connected to weights. In this way, the weight of the oar, at some distance from the ship, is counterbalanced and crew can be adjacent to the hull rather than set away from it, saving useful stowage space.  The fresco shows the end of the pull stroke, on the return stroke, the rope is extended further (outside the hull) and the internal weights within the hull are lifted. This would offer greater speed as work is performed continuously and unnecessary work is avoided, the oar is counterbalanced. Substantially faster passage could be achieved with this arrangement. Minoan technology is wonderfully simple. Not even Leonardo realised that work could be performed on the push and pull strokes who did explore how to harness human power for propulsion and flight. Minoan Marine Technology There are many improvements over ships of this time shown in the fresco which include: a) Freestanding deployable masts, see main fresco.b) Composite reinforced hulls, a Minoan hull has been reconstructed (shown below) using a wooden frame with strong mortice and tenon joints and reinforced with flax linen cloth, in a pine resin matrix infused with limestone powders to make them white, the copper ship would suggest reinforcement was applied inside and out, the advantage is that if the hull runs into rocks although the wooden hull will fail, the inner composite will delaminate, keeping the hull watertight to make landfall and repair, saving the ship, crew and cargo.  It is possible the Therans realised copper repels barnacles (that increase drag dramatically), the Royal Navy copper-bottomed ships for this very reason, the term today means the best. Fishing boats anchor within the Caldera to this day to clean the hull as copper is found within the islands rock formations. This seems to be limited to one ship (shown above), noting copper is a valuable commodity.  To give an idea of what a copper hull may have looked like, this is a modern cold cast part (resin impregnated with copper filings and burnished). Splendid and would keep the hull clean to go faster too if the copper colour hull is using it. If the Minoans are using limestone powders I suspect they would experiment with other things too, the inner of this ship seems to be using lapis lazuli for example and is blue (need to zoom in to see it - at the rear of the vessel by the captain's cabin and blue being a feature colour on many hulls). Lapis Lazuli imported from Afghanistan coming into Phoenician ports, along with Tin (the other sources are Iberia, Cornwall/Britanny and there is a small deposits in the Anatolian mountains).  I wonder if Orichalcum - Wikipedia which is referred to in the ancient text but only known by name in Plato\u2019s time, is not a metal or an alloy as such, but rather a composite with metal powders for cold casting or applying a metallic surface finish? The issue being this would not age well using natural resin, so I\u2019m not surprised it's not found in the archaeological archive. Second in value only to gold according to Plato. c) Devices that may be anemometers are shown on the ships hull which may deflect in wind, giving an indication to the captain and pilot of crosswinds so course correction can be made), bells appear to be shown on the line on some ships to give an audible indication of wind intensity to the crew, facing backwards.  Minoan CompassOther artefacts suggest Minoans may have had superb navigational tools. Many Minoan buildings are aligned to magnetic North, which does suggest that they had a compass using magnetite, meteoric iron struck by lightning available from Skyros, although there is only a single example of a land-based compass. I cannot see that if they had this capability they would not use it at sea. The sub markers on this land-based example represent the fractional angle to True North (1 mark/total), the main pointer is West to indicate declination.  It is worth noting that the four Minoan deities represent the four cardinal directions and seasons (solstice and equinox), a Minoan society working with these natural cycles to improve crop yields and developing conventions to assist navigation of the seas to facilitate trade. An Early Marine Sextant to establish Latitude (Jacob\u2019s Staff) *. Consider Orion (the Hunter, male) and Ophiuchus (the Serpent-holder, female), in the star chart. Click to zoom.  Labrys could have been used as a Jacobs staff to measure angles to reference stars, such as Orion\u2019s belt or Ophiuchus, the Snake bearers [elbow] on the opposite side of the sky, called the serpent holder above (in English). The height of both these constellations approximates the extent of the axial tilt of the earth, the attitude or inclination of the stars position change by this extent over the year, these are the only constellation which expresses this, both being associated with moving the Zodiac constellations around the sky. The so-called \u2018snake goddess\u2019 may be little more than a Priestess explaining how to use Ophiuchus for navigation. Minoan used a lunar-solar calendar and added a 13th month every fourth year, an Olympiad when they celebrated by jumping the bull, so Ophiuchus is possibly their name for this intercalated month, this actually shown on the Orbit calculator later in this article (note that the lunar device flip-flops before advancing a position.  There are a huge number of Labrys found, they are assumed to be of cultural significance, however, may have been a practical tool to assist with navigation and would also be a symbol of their naval power, Minos (Wanax or ruler) is accredited with creating the Worlds first Navy.  Labrys being gravity cast in copper or gold in the case of small examples are practical mirrors when polished, B side shown. A signalling mirrors on board ship (ship to ship) and at peak sanctuaries (huge - 3m high shown above, shore to ship) to coordinate fleet perhaps. `  The use as Jacob\u2019s staff is confirmed by this later Phoenician iconography that adopts Labyrs, becoming straight-edged.  \u2018Double axe\u2019 marks are used for datums on Minoan buildings as a shadow is cast on the mark precisely at typically Equinox or Solstice datums.  In this case, to refer to stars and constellations (Phoenician).  Natural Birds to estimate Longitude *Birds illustrated, which also feature on the bow and stern posts of Phoenician ships, unfortunately, no surviving Minoan white hulls have yet been found, however, a small Minoan Shipwreck has recently been found but results are yet to be published. A possible reason is that caged birds face (longingly) towards the port they were exchanged in, this has been well established by scientific studies, they scuff the bowl in the cage, cover one of the bird\u2019s eyes and they lose this ability, incredibly it looks as if they exploit a quantum effect as light as a wave rather than a particle, e.g. the two-slit experiment. The Minoans would not understand this, just recognise that birds had/have this ability (they hone to the desired location with the migratory seasons, which is what the Minoan sailors wanted to do and did). From this longitude (tricky) can be estimated by triangulation, it will not be perfect but some indication of longitude in the middle of the Mediterranean would have been extremely useful. It is known that Minoans realised high sea passage, but not how this was achieved, a puzzle that has perplexed marine archaeologists. These technologies being millennia ahead of the time, fibreglass hulls were not \u2018invented\u2019 until the 1950\u2019s AD for example, flax linen cloth is almost as strong in tension as E-glass cloth used for composite hulls (GRP) of today but flax has improved flexural qualities. This is a half-scale reproduction (video tour) Minoan white-hull - 20 oars (the mid-hull oar arrangement, freestanding masts and devices of metrology (measurement) not reproduced, but according to the fresco are used).  Palace ShipyardsThe Minoans do not appear to give away their advantage and likely kept these technologies secret, which is why little about this is known, obviously, the white hulls are on plain view in port, but no-one else knew how to build these ships and probably thought this was for decoration, the ships are pretty, featuring the fastest animals to \u2018fly\u2019 or \u2018porpoise\u2019 across the sea at speed! Ships likely produced by Palace controlled shipyards. It is worth noting that when Theseus returned to Athens the ship was kept for many centuries as a prize, had the mainland finally learned the Minoan secret of the location of metals of the world and to navigate it? Well maybe, but the mainland didn\u2019t see the advantages of reinforcing a hull! Theseus made a beeline for Skyros on his return, a source of magnetite (iron), he was thrown off a cliff, the islands clearly didn\u2019t like what he (Athens) offered. Seals. The profusion of seals found, allude to Palace seal authorisation. It is often difficult to interpret Minoan artefacts, are these possibly clay imprinted tokens for the passage for tradespeople or a kind of promissory note to exchange commodities on the next visit to port perhaps or perhaps a receipt against which the holders personal account is credited when presented to the Palace after the goods are delivered to port? Most of these impressions are found on the Phaistos Disc - Wikipedia.  Palaces had shutters over doors for air management and fountains for natural cooling, flushing toilets, sewers, aqueducts, flat concrete floors, clay interlocking plumbing for freshwater, hypocaust (for heating), steam rooms and communal bathing, alabaster glazing (before flat glass, hazy but light penetrates), paved roads and canals being evident, not just writing but blind embossed printing, lost wax casting and formers to make once well and scale production with apprentices making many copies, fancy stuff. Why would anyone want to leave? Then again, they need to gather raw materials to make these wonderful things.  The Priestess set quota for farms and monitor variance and there is evidence of economic planning to make up shortfalls through trade, winter food storage and magazines will have had significant metal reserves that they likely call upon following the Thera eruption, significant ash fallout fell on Crete. It may look like pots but the treasury is likely under the floor and you can\u2019t see it for pottery.  This is what the ladies in Minoan society did, organise, everything! The Priestess seem to collect internal revenues, the Minos external revenues (duty) and this may have been stored in the caves (protected by the Dactyls), on can see metal ingots stored in the caves, in this seal. Minos (lion) went to the caves every nine years to bring in new laws, the nine olives of victory being shown, Minos was last to leave the Arena according to mythology, which suggests Minoan leaders were appointed by talent. Briefly, the Minoan deities are shown on the top left branch: Daught Moon (Artemis), Mother Earth (Demeter); the bees, Son the Sun (Apollo) and his consort Venus; the love birds. The Minoan names are respectively: Potnia Theron (the Mistress of Animals), I-DA-MA-TE, Kouros (the Master of Animals), (J)A-SA-SA-RA-ME (Venus). The Priestess (bottom right) have corresponding houses. Mother Superior is shown behind the Griffon that represents the Great Year (a 26,000-year cycle, yes they worked this out, it 26 are shown repeatedly on Griffon iconography). The populus bottom left.  The Priestess (bees) are like civil servants with special powers, they understand the science of the day (astronomy) and administration (organisation), purposeful intervening to increase production capacity and yields (e.g. literally seedcorn loans) to support an expanding population: 100,000 in Knossos - huge, which is around 1% of the world population at the time. It is called a Palace but it is more an administration centre (Government).  It is generally assumed that coinage was \u2018invented\u2019 in Lydia around the 6th century BCE by the Priests of Artemis. Now consider these token minted by the Priestess of Potnia Theron (the Mistress of Animals and the forerunner to Artemis) and Demeter, know as the bees, respectively responsible for the Harvest and Winter food storage. They likely represent a months salary for acolytes (young trainee priestess, eight is frequently shown which represent an Octaeteris - Wikipedia that is associated with Venus, one of their four deities, A-SA-SA-RA-ME). The tokens are of a standard bullion weight and design and are found in quantity (often in hundreds) and used from around 1800 BCE. They are likely used to facilitate trade transactions and could have been drawn from the Palace and deposited at another to setup an account which good could then be drawn down from magazines against, in the main Minoans used a system of credit and reconciled accounts, drawing down goods with seal authorisation (like a credit card). Palace records show quota being set for farms, repaid at harvest time (with tax) and variance monitored and rolling over to the next accounting period. How very organised.  There is a duality in this society, robustness to defend their way of life that is tempered by the female fascination with how nature is organised (the cycles of life). This society prospered (before the Thera eruption). Minos is accredited with suppressing piracy (facilitating trade). Minoan Orbital Calculator and astronomy Closing thoughts here is a casting stone to make many copies of an orbital calculator (manual), it precedes the Antikythera mechanism by over a millennium and defines many of the periods used on the later device. The four main Minoan deities define periods of time, an Earth Day (mother), a Lunar month (daughter), a Solar year (son) and a four-year Olympiad or Octaeteris (lady - consort). The device can also predict Saros cycles when the celestial bodies return to their original position, which can be used to predict eclipses, the device is 94% accurate in doing so. Rather impressive stuff. As you can see the device on the left, can be used to express angles as fractions of opposite and adjacent, that are the underlying elements of trigonometry, and particularly useful for orbital calculation, for example, to establishing the seasonal offset due to Earth\u2019s axial tilt to accurately determine latitude. These people are geeks, they love their multifunction devices as do we today, theirs are a bit more basic but also very useful.  The device on the right is for lunar periods but mostly for keeping a calendar, the first use of a 7 day week (lunar phase), the device flip-flops before advancing one position on the left solar device each month so that an accurate 29.5 day month can be maintained (clever huh), there is additional archaeology that confirms this. The solar device and notch systems allow a four-year Olympiad to be maintained, that the Minoans may have celebrated every four years with Bull-leaping (the first games), literally the leap month celebration, according to artefacts. Minos, the Cretan ruler, \u2018being last to leave the arena.\u2019 I suspect this device is more for the populous, the Priestess likely to have even better instruments, unfortunately, none of these has yet been found. It is mainly used for maintaining an accurate calendar but can perform some very useful mathematical functions, specifically, trigonometry for orbital calculation and seasonal offsets for determine latitude. It is a remarkable device and precedes the Antikythera mechanism by a full millennium, accepting its manual, non-mechanical, but still, the hard part is determining all these astronomical cycles and is self-evident that the Minoans clearly studied and define. One can see how the idea of the cog (a huge thing) may have evolved from this, but it is not in itself a meshed gear. There is no archaeology in-between this and the mechanism (or the North facing chariot with a differential that appears around the same time) for example. If you know of some any cogs around the first millennia BCE, please do drop me a comment! Minoans understanding of the solar system and particularly optics seems comparable to that of the time of Newton considered to be the start of the enlightenment (with amazingly far fewer materials, precision ground rock crystal lens shown below that are optically superior to a single Babylonian example), I don\u2019t think they saw the value of tubes with fixed focal length, there seem to be extendable poles present at peak sanctuaries according to the artwork, two of the lens have elongated sections that seem to imply that the lens was attached to some form of pole (possibly fixed with linen thread and pine resin, it's how you attach an arrowhead to the shaft). Consider, the wedge crescent-shaped device it will recreate a Natural rainbow, the prism wasn\u2019t invented until newtons time, then again prisms are found at mountain top workshops too, what on earth we\u2019re they doing splitting light into a spectrum, we can only speculate as to what they may have used this for.  The wedge-shaped crescent lens being remarkable, it may have been used to reproduce a natural rainbow, noting Newton is accredited with splitting light into its spectrum using a prism, he did not reproduce a rainbow, simulating nature is hard to do so shows a true understanding of optics. Minoan Palaces have both light and dark rooms to study these things, they watch the passage of Venus across the Sun in the reflection of water bowls for example.  It is extraordinary what they achieved with the limited materials of the day. The meaning of the Griffons, is they protect the celestial cone which mother Earth wobbles back within throughout the Ages, a 26,000-year cycle, that they may have been trying to calculate, as the pole stars gradually drift over the centuries due to precession of the equinox (three pole stars being shown on each Griffons (2) wings in iconography, the lions digit front paws make 13 x 2 = 26, lions only have 4 digit claws on the rear shown on the each and probably represent four-year Olympiad and eight-year Octaeteris). They studied what we would call today Astronomy and Earth science, it is not just the heavens, but nature, plants and trees that can help identify metal ore, provide treatments, even a nice cuppa: a well-deserved chamomile mountain tea break! UPDATE: they have nailed the Great Year, 13 marks are shown on each griffon collar flanking the embodiment of Demeter (Mother Superior).  This is confirmed on the Saffron gathering fresco, 26 \u2018V\u2019 are shown on the single griffon's wing.   ConclusionI don\u2019t believe Minoan artefacts can be understood in isolation, they need to be considered in a wider context and generally show the state of the art before bronze age collapse. The Minoans connected three continents in trade, the ideas and commodities of the known world flowed through their ports and technological advantage maintains the \u2018Minoan Peace\u2019. A hugely productive period in the story and advancement of civilisation, before ca. 1628 BCE when Thera erupted. This technology is almost divided (scattered), the Greeks get the Priestess, the Oracle of Delphi with priests of the Double Axe: the Pythia had her hands full trying to dissuade city-states from fighting amongst each other. The Islands to some degree preserve the astronomical knowledge. The Babylonians got a lens and trigonometry, the archaeology suggests trig in a basic form originally came from the British Isles of all places! The Phoenicians get some of the navigational tools. Composite hulls and this wonderful method of storing energy for propulsion is lost to time. I hope this shows that Civilisation is a privilege rather than a right. An unforeseen event can fundamentally change the course of human progress. These people celebrated life! The art appears modern, as Cycladic art (the indigenous people of the islands, leading to the Minoans), inspired the much later modern art movement.  One way to consider the four Minoan deities being: Organisation (North), Creation (East), Commerce (South), and Science (West). In this Minoan fresco, the pigment wants to move around on the fresco wall. Art (state of), science (technology) and commerce are considered in a holistic way for the betterment of society (by organisation).  This fresco summarises the Minoans for me, OK it looks highly stylised and pretty, but the artist embeds everything we need to know, 49 lunar months are shown in the horizontal border, a four-year Olympiad. The verticle count is 14 (years), that collectively give a saros when the organised ones (the celestial bodies, their deities) return to their starting positions. I\u2019m so looking forward to a worldwide celebration next year, our own games!! This blaster virus has really upset the natural order of things.  Have things really move forward or become complicated? What can you do in your lifetime? Get busy, go places, see what can be done! All speed. Go make something amazing! ",

Roman concrete was a total mystery up until a few years ago. We could make a decent copy that might last 40\u201350 years, but there are Roman harbors which have lasted for over a thousand. We still don\u2019t really know how the Pyramids and other large buildings were made. We have some theories, but no one knows for sure. ",
