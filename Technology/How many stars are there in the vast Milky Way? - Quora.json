            "answer_text": "As pointed out, there is no way to really know. So 100\u2013400 billion is the common estimate. The interesting part of the questions is why. That answer is due to there being so many Red Dwarf stars, those that are 10\u201340% the mass and/or size of our Sun. These stars are so dim you needs really big telescopes like Hubble to see them. And then you can only see the ones that are fairly near. The estimate on Red Dwarfs ranges from 60\u201370% of all stars. But that is also a flexible situation. 70% of all the luminent stars, those that are the size of our Sun or larger and shine brightly in the night sky, are located in the center bulge of the galaxy. Due to all the dust that is already shrouding much of the Bulge, we have no idea whether that high percentage of Red Dwarfs is true for the bulge as well as for the arms. So, 100\u2013400 billion it will be until someone comes up with a narrower range. But why? If you were able to accurately count stars at the rate of 1,000 per hour, it would take 100\u2013400 million hours. That amounts to 11,000 to 44,000 years of non-stop counting. And that is just one indication how mind-boggling big numbers get on a large scale. And one galaxy is not even close to being large scale. You need to talk about galaxy super clusters to get to that.

            "answer_text": "There are only about 5,000 stars visible to the naked, average, human eye, Minute Physics points out. And, because the Earth itself gets in the way, you can only see about a half of those from where you stand. The farthest star we can see with our naked eye is V762 Cas in Cassiopeia at 16,308 light-years away. Its brightness is magnitude 5.8 or just above the 6th magnitude limit. Milky Way/Diameter 105,700 light years 105,700 / 16,308 = 6.5 meaning approx 1/6th the length of our galaxy is the furthest we can see a star. which is quite dim. now we can see 5,000 stars within 1/6.5th of our galaxy, so if you multiply that by 6.5th (which is being generous because of black holes) than we have 32,500 stars in the galaxy. But some claim there are 200 billion stars in our galaxy. Which I don't think is believable. Ahh but if 16k away we see one on this side of the globe. And 16k away we see a different one on the other side of the globe. Than that\u2019s a radius, of our range of view. So than we are reallly seeing 5,000 stars within a field of view of 32k, which means it\u2019s really half the number I said and so there are only 15,000 stars in our galaxy. Next thing to research is the brightness of different types of stars like blue, red, or yellow? Also how many are galaxies and how many are nebulas Come on nasa stop lying to us already NASA But how many shapes that are 32k diameter size fit in a shape 105k diameter? Would be the next question. And how powerful are these telescopes? Has anyone used one and found it to be millions to billions of time stronger than the human eye? 1. James Webb Space Telescope. Built by NASA with support from the European Space Agency and the Canadian Space Agency, the James Webb Space Telescope is the infrared telescope and is known to be 100 times more powerful than the famed Hubble. It has been called the most powerful telescope ever made. You can attach 9 more zeros to the end of this to get 1 billion light-years and another one for 10 billion light-years. The farthest that Hubble has seen so far is about 10-15 billion light-years away. The farthest area looked at is called the Hubble Deep Field. Astronomers Find the Two Dimmest Stellar Bulbs. It's a tie! The new record-holder for dimmest known star-like object in the universe goes to twin \"failed\" stars, or brown dwarfs, each of which shines feebly with only one millionth the light of our sun. Yellow dwarfs are small, main sequence stars. The Sun is a yellow dwarf. A red dwarf is a small, cool, very faint, main sequence star whose surface temperature is under about 4,000 K. Red dwarfs are the most common type of star. Proxima Centauri is a red dwarf. In addition, the sheer number of red dwarfs, which account for about 85% of at least 100 billion stars in the Milky Way, statistically increases the probability that there might exist habitable planets orbiting some of them. Red dwarfs are by far the most common type of star in the Milky Way, at least in the neighborhood of the Sun, but because of their low luminosity, individual red dwarfs cannot be easily observed. From Earth, not one that fits the stricter definitions of a red dwarf is visible to the naked eye. weird... Stars like the Sun make up roughly 10 percent of all stars. There are very roughly 200 billion stars in the Milky Way, so that gives us 20 billion stars. If one of every five has an Earth-like planet, that means there are about four billion Earth-like planets in our galaxy alone! 85% red dwarfs, and 10% stars like ours, I guess only 5% remain for the others. Are Blue Stars rare? Blue Period Luminous blue variable (LBV) stars are indeed incredibly rare; astronomers have only identified about 20 (maybe) and suspect there are only a few hundred in the Milky Way, tops. ... That puts their surface temperature in the 10,000 \u2013 25,000K range; several times hotter than our own star. Which stars are brighter than the sun? While Deneb shines the brightest in the constellation Cygnus, 17 other stars glow brighter in our night skies. But Deneb is much farther from Earth than most of the other stars you see, and this giant is around 100,000 times brighter than the Sun. ",
