            "answer_text": "Nobody can say that social networks, blogs, forums, microblogging services aren't media. Because we actually use them as media. Obviously they are not media in the traditional meaning: we all know why!  Cause everyone is a potential broadcaster, news producer and spreader, radio station, opinionist, and more. But there's  even more, as Gabriella Sannino wrote. You can value, connect with others, approve, judge, build a reputation. But we should realize that (just) few people used to do that in the past through traditional media, now everyone can!  I think the best term is Social Media for another reason.  The real ''social'' phenomenon is really too complex to be explained in one word, but language help us to create conventions. Social Media is a useful conventional term to indicate a lot of different tools we currently use to commutate ourself in media. Here: http://socialmediatoday.com/intranetworks/255203/what-if-social-media-were-telephones there's another interesting point, strictly correlated with my personal opinion. ",

For comparison  One-to-many = Old mediaExample: David Letterman communicates to millions of strangers via television. He can't communicate with his audience directly (react to peoples rants and questions) who are sitting in front of their TV tubes at home.  One-to-one = Direct form of communicationExample: David Letterman has a direct telephone conversation with a friend (private). ",

In the other way like social life I have a example for you - just someone haresing you and our don't know about him so you find him or the social media by help of pic's neither you inform the police then police search on the social media or social networking sites. Independence - social media is playing a key role for the independence like if someone beat you and you don't know now what would you do so you click one pic and share anyone they suggest you what would you do now. If we take a example of India (it's my country) After the independence social media play a imp role because when we won the cricket match work cup and social media help us for promote or explore us in the world then all country know what is India or where is India , what's they do this. There are many social platform like - Facebook, what's app, Twitter, Instagram,tinder , Snapchat also these social media play a role for sharing the pics , video's and information etc. ",

Social media marketing has brought audiences closer to the brands and shifted the power to the other side of the table. This is the platform that has enhanced the human values in terms of engagement, response and approach. It has personalized the marketing communication. ",
