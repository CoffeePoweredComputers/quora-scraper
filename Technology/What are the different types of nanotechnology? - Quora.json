            "answer_text": "Nanotechnology is the ability to manipulate matter at atomic/molecular level and hence achieving new materials and/or new manufacturing processes. There are many \u201cbranches\u201d of nanotech - some derived from existing areas and some are completely new. Few examples below: Nanoelectronics - is basically a \u2018continuation\u2019 of microelectronics that we have nowadays. In technology nodes below 22 nm process is dealing with atomic level thickness control. It is achieved by extremely advanced and sophisticated manufacturing tools and processes. Example below (source: Chipworks)  Nanomedicine - is a medical application of nanotechnology, targeting areas like precise drug delivery, nanometric biological sensors (i.e. insulin monitoring or other medical devices), novel medical procedures (i.e. blood purification) and biocompatible novel materials (i.e. artificial skin). Example below (source: Nanomedicine: towards development of patient-friendly drug-delivery systems for oncological applications)  Industrial application - such as catalysts, advanced composite materials, novel bottom-up manufacturing processes, daily health products (sun screen is one of the earliest nanotech products) and improved structural materials (steal, cement and glass). There are many others - nanorobotics, energy applications etc. Back to the original question. The scope of nanotechnology is as described above and it can be different between the various fields. Future trends? Well my guess is that majority of nanotech will continue to improve at the described areas but some new and exciting branches will arise. Cheers!

            "answer_text": "4 main Types of nanomaterials are\u2026\u2026. Carbon Based Materials Metal Based Materials Dendrimers Composites Carbon Based Materials These nanomaterials are composed mostly of carbon, most commonly taking the form of a hollow spheres, ellipsoids, or tubes. Spherical and ellipsoidal carbon nanomaterials are referred to as fullerenes, while cylindrical ones are called nanotubes. These particles have many potential applications, including improved films and coatings, stronger and lighter materials, and applications in electronics. Metal Based Materials These nanomaterials include quantum dots, nanogold, nanosilver and metal oxides, such as titanium dioxide. A quantum dot is a closely packed semiconductor crystal comprised of hundreds or thousands of atoms, and whose size is on the order of a few nanometers to a few hundred nanometers. Changing the size of quantum dots changes their optical properties. Dendrimers These nanomaterials are nanosized polymers built from branched units. The surface of a dendrimer has numerous chain ends, which can be tailored to perform specific chemical functions. This property could also be useful for catalysis. Also, because three-dimensional dendrimers contain interior cavities into which other molecules could be placed, they may be useful for drug delivery. Composites Composites combine nanoparticles with other nanoparticles or with larger, bulk-type materials. Nanoparticles, such as nanosized clays, are already being added to products ranging from auto parts to packaging materials, to enhance mechanical, thermal, barrier, and flame-retardant properties. ",
