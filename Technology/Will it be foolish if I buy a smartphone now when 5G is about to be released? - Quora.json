            "answer_text": "That really depends on where you live. If you are in a city with great 5G networks, then probably yes. If not, it really doesn\u2019t matter. My take - 5G is too overrated anyway. Right now, 5G networks aren\u2019t as widespread or data requirements that high for someone to absolutely require 5G. Unless your job involves heavy data consumption on the go, like a journalist, you should be able to get by easily on 4G for at least another 2\u20133 years. Think about upgrading your device to 5G by 2022\u201323, because by then 2 things would have happened: 5G networks would be more widely availablesmartphones with 5G would become the norm, and thus cheaperRight now, those two factors are the reason you shouldn\u2019t invest in a 5G-ready smartphone. Unless you plan to use if for 5 years or more. If that\u2019s the case, then its worth splurging on a 5G ready device. ",

            "answer_text": "Nope, its not foolish because rolling of 5G out will take time probably in 2021 so once it begins to spread over the nation it will atleast take time to settle down so for all this process it will take around 1 year so you can buy a 4G smartphone and spend with it for more than a year and if in case 5G is settled down then also you can run with 4G because updating to 5G is upto you. No one will force you to update to 5G (Only your Sim operator starts to intimate you that they are into 5G and they want you to update but thats not mandatory) and the advantage is when the 5G is settled and you want to buy a 5G mobile after 2\u20133 years then you will get 5G Mobile at a cheaper price compared to 2020 mobiles. Hope you found the Answer. Thank You, Have a Great Day \ud83d\udd96 Jai Hind! ",
