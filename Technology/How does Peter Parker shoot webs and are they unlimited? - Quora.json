            "answer_text": "Peter Parker in the comics is a technical genius and we get a hint of that in the latest version played by Tom Holland in the MCU/Sony movies. Spider-Man\u2019s webs are a polymer concoction he mixed himself that\u2019s able to simulate the characteristics of spider silk, but at a relative strength that can handle human weight and more. The \u201cwebbing\u201d is stored as a liquid presumably under pressure in cartridges that are installed in mechanisms called web shooters. Think of a CO2 BB gun or paintball gun for the momentary but instead of pressurized gas it\u2019s pressurized liquid. The web-shooter\u2019s aperture affects how the liquid is released and becomes solid. It can be released as a thread, as a blanket of various sizes, as a \u201cbomb\u201d completely encasing an object for example. There have been many comic moments where Spider-Man is battling so long that he runs out of fluid or where his personal life is so harried that he either cannot afford to replenish it or forgets to replenish it. So no it is not unlimited. ",

They are not, however, unlimited; in fact, the suit that Peter wears in Spiderman: Homecoming (2017) has a utility belt that is used to store cartilages of this web-fluid. Peter is seen to empty the cartilages when they no longer have web in them, and replace them with vials from the belt. In Captain America: Civil War (2016), when Tony is in Queens attempting to recruit Peter, the vial that is thrown to Peter while the two are talking is also a cartilage of web-fluid. ",
