            "answer_text": " I was a spy and I can tell you how I felt. But that wouldn\u2019t be a universal response. Not all spies feel the same about their job any more than all teachers or all plumbers. And it\u2019s probably worth pointing out that there is more than one type of spy. I suspect that, in general, there is greater job satisfaction among those who are spying FOR their own country (as I did) rather than against it (i.e., traitors). There are also double agents, sleeper agents, industrial espionage agents and a number of other spy categories each of which comes with its own inherent risks, advantages and \u201cbaggage\u201d. For me, as a CIA spy (intel officer, operative, case officer), I often felt lonely, isolated and stressed out. Think about having a job that requires you to live a double life, all day, every day. No one, outside of your fellow operatives, can know of your \u201csecond self\u201d \u2014 the one in the shadows, the one living a lie, the one that\u2019s a constant target. You nearly always work alone and, if you get caught, you may find that you are on your own. Despite that downside, my memories of those years are largely positive. I loved living and working abroad \u2014 the challenge of learning a new culture, geography, language. The work itself I found to be rewarding, challenging, often exciting sometimes even exhilerating. The CIA ingrains in its operatives that they are the best of the best. A tiny sub-class of elite, patriot-heroes (the inside joke is that they constantly pump you up with talk of how \u201cspecial\u201d you are so you don\u2019t notice how little they are paying you). That kind of indoctrination along with the genuine realization that you are one of the very few who have the skills and the willingness to take on such a difficult and dangerous task and are playing a (small) role in something very big \u2014 defending democracy \u2014 can be pretty euphoric. To put it another way, on a good day, being a spy might be the best (or at least the coolest) job on the planet. But a bad day is usually really, really bad. For many, it\u2019s more than they can handle. There was one member of my class in spy school who, after having gone through the lengthy selection and vetting process and having successfully graduated from the rigorous and stressful training program and having landed a coveted assignment in a high-profile Asian city and then having all his worldly possessions shipped there and moving into his new home, his new cover job and his new career as a spy, turned in his resignation after barely two weeks in-country. He was homesick, he explained to me in a letter, and missed his parents, his dog, Big Macs and his girlfriend (not necessarily in that order). Another fellow trainee had, as an Air Force brat, lived most of his life growing up in a variety of overseas locations (CIA loves to recruit these guys into the program) and wasn\u2019t homesick for the USA at all. However, he was so rattled by a close call during one of his first operations very early in his initial foreign posting that his nerves never recovered. He returned to headquarters short-of-tour and left the Agency soon thereafter and took a job as an investment banker on Wall Street (where, I\u2019m told, car bombs are exceedingly rare). A third friend who stayed in even longer than I did told me recently that he always felt and still feels \u201cdirty\u201d regarding some of what he was required to do as an operative. He could never fully accept that the ends justify the means. So, in conclusion, some spies love being spies and wouldn\u2019t even consider another line of work. Many, like me, are proud of their service but eager to stop pushing their luck and move on to something else as soon as they qualify for their government pension. Others discover early on that they either don\u2019t enjoy the lifestyle or simply aren\u2019t very good at it (and, unlike most other occupations, in the world of espionage being bad at your job can be fatal).

            "answer_text": "How does it feel to be a spy? If I take that question literally then I must tell you there are no feelings when you perform your duties as a spy. You are virtually one nut removed from being a machine. With the current news about our POTUS being on CNN, you get a daily dose of answers from past employees of the FBI, the CIA and all the other agencies involved one way or another with spying. Each person repeats the fact that when you work for the agency you have no political party affiliation. It\u2019s best to not make your religious affiliation be known. You exist for two reasons: Duty and Country. Even families, although they are very important to us, have to take a backseat in the scheme of all things. Most people see the James Bond movies and think that it is the real world of spying. I could only wish. James Bond was glorious duty, beautiful women, fancy cars, oh hell let me put it this way: \u2018Whine, Women and Song\u2019. No, usually I had none of the above. First of all you are becoming someone that you are not. Do you want to kill? Hell no! Do you have to at times, hopefully not often or never. But it does come to the point. Actually, it just came to me that being a spy was like acting in a movie. You are not who you say you are, so you are acting. Only the consequences of your actions are real, not fake including the blood, sweat and tears. Don\u2019t get me wrong. At times it is fantastic to be who you are not. In 13 years I had one incident that lasted 2 years where a beautiful young Asian women was involved. Within weeks we had found out that she was send as a counterespionage agent. I let her play her role, as I said, for 2 years, fed her bogus information or outdated information because I felt it would have been more damaging for me to expose her and have her arrested. My mission would have been terminated and all my hard work would have been lost. When my mission was complete, I turned all my information on her over to the agents assigned to me in the country I operated from. She was arrested and spend 10 years in jail. When she was released she actually came to America with a friend looking for me and I had to turn her in to the agencies here. I hope I have given you enough info in case you are interested in a future with one of our great agencies. Don\u2019t do it for the pay. Do it for the people who count on you to keep them safe. Good Luck and Gods speed. (I can say that now because I\u2019m a civilian, again) ",
