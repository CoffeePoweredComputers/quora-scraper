            "answer_text": "Is the internet worsening political polarisation? I find that when I\u2019m speaking to someone with an opposite political opinion in person, we tend to be more respectful and often end up understanding each other\u2019s views better. Whereas on facebook or twitter etc. it descends into name-calling shouting matches\u2026  I honestly hadn't noticed. My earliest experiences with online political discourse were on USENET, and it was truly a Wild West subculture where anything could be posted. (See U.C. Davis USENET FAQ.) Indeed, a number of distinguished law librarians ended up in defamation lawsuits back in the early 1990s on the Law-Listserv USENET newsgroups because of their inability to self-censor. At the same time, the occasional in-person \"Net Get\" at UC Davis back then proved that most of the heated online discussion in which I engaged was not as mean-spirited as it might appear. Perhaps the truly hateful haters never showed up in person at said \"Net Gets.\" Contrast that with the occasional political rally that starts out peaceful and devolves into a mob that initiates physical violence or mutates into a major civil uprising. I remember one rally that I attended at UC Davis in 1994, when I was Vice President of The Federalist Society, a law student coalition of conservatives and libertarians. We helped organize a march and rally sponsored by various other law student organizations and faculty regarding the then recent passage of California Proposition 187. After the mike was opened up, a group of undergraduate student activists escalated the situation into a takeover of Mrak Hall (the administration building) at which point the law school sponsors of the event abandoned ship. The protest remained peaceful, but many student protesters were taken into custody, and somehow the law students got blamed for inciting a mob. As Vice President of the Federalist Society, I was instrumental in organizing and sponsoring free speech forums at UC Davis Law School where anyone could say anything they wanted. We also did our best to get responsible spokespeople to articulate their viewpoints on controversial issues. And it all worked fine, until the number of people involved in an event mushroomed to more than one hundred. At that point, online discussion seemed to be much more civil than debates, marches, rallies, protests, etc.  ",

            "answer_text": "I\u2019m not expert on the subject, but I think so. When people debate in person, they tend to be civil. When they debate on the internet, they are not civil but rather revel in being mean, and I believe this has big effects on polarisation. If we\u2019re both anonymous, there\u2019s a good chance that if I argue with you, sooner or later, you\u2019ll stop arguing the point and take personal shots at me, or assign weak, strawman positions to my argument that you can tear down. The result of this is, you make me angry with you and I start to see you as someone to beat, not someone to argue with. It happens a second time with someone arguing a similar viewpoint as you did, and I stop thinking about anyone with your POV as a rational, thinking human. Of course, I am always civil, it\u2019s the other side that isn\u2019t. The other side isn\u2019t full of rational, thinking humans, it\u2019s full of those people. If I\u2019m a Democrat, they\u2019re fascists and should be fought at all costs. If I\u2019m a Republican, then they\u2019re commies and should be fought at all costs. So then instead of searching for a compromise, I just dig deeper into my own position. I\u2019d compromise with a rational, thinking human but I will not compromise with those people. In fact, I may find myself drifting farther from the center than I was initially, just to counter those people and make sure I\u2019m putting up as strong a stance as possible against those people, because they are mean and irrational and must be fought at all costs. So in summary: The anonymity of internet makes people mean, people who are mean appear less than rational humans, and therefore, the internet makes us think there\u2019s another side that must be fought at all costs and forget about moderation and compromise.
