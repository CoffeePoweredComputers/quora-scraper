            "answer_text": "Google is only 20 years old, so the world existed without it. However, Google has made a tremendous impact through their free search. In effect, they have made possible the known knowledge of the world accessible through your computer or phone. Google has promoted awareness. For example, you can research a product thoroughly before buying it, seeing positive and negative reviews. You can obtain answers to many questions instantaneously. All this would cease. That would make getting information more cumbersome. It would again be the world before Google. ",

Different disaster scenarios can produce different small time hiccups, but data loss is very unlikely  even for most of free services.  I would say, even enterprise data centers can't match this level of redundancy ",
