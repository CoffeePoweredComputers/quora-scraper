            "answer_text": "Panasonic. Toughbooks are comparatively big and heavy, but they include semi-ruggedized, and fully ruggedized models. Panasonic claims some of the fully ruggedized models meet military specification including: MIL-STD-810G, MIL-STD-461F, IP65 and optional class 1 div 2 groups ABCD hazardous locations. I do feel obliged to point out that MIL-STD-810G (for one example) allows a vendor to specify what goals they\u2019re trying to meet, and set up tests accordingly. That said, for years (like a decade or so) Panasonic has generally been recognized as having the toughest notebooks around. For example: \u201cPanasonic is the gold standard\u201d in rugged computers, said Roger Kay, president of Endpoint Technologies Associates, in an interview with DID. \u201cThey build their own stuff; they battle test it in their labs in Osaka; they do a solid job\u2026If you want to get really serious \u2013 the notebook\u2019s got to operate inside a tank in Saudi Arabia in the summer \u2013 then you have to go the full Panasonic route.\u201d That said, Panasonic\u2019s fully rugged computers do have pretty steep price tags. If a dead computer is likely to lead to people dying as well, they seem to be generally accepted as the best choice. On the other hand, if you just want one that takes everyday abuse a little better than most of the others, a Toughbook is probably going to cost quite a bit more than it\u2019s worth to you. References Computers US Military on the Move: Rugged Notebooks Lead the Way. Disclaimer I have no affiliation with, or vested interest in Panasonic (well, I suppose it\u2019s possible some of my 401K money could be in a fund that includes some stock in Panasonic\u2019s US subsidiary\u2014I don\u2019t know one way or the other on that).
