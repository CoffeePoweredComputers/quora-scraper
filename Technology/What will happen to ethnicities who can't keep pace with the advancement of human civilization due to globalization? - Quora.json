            "answer_text": "The question must be what is happening to the Biosphere now?Half the forests of the world are murdered along with the Biosphere in them.The madness is called economic progress and the murder of nature is measured in terms of economic growth,which in reality is the growth of the total murder of nature.Read below. The Macro Language The macro language is the language of the Biosphere, wherin, every organism, inhales the smell messages and exhales the response smells. Every organism develops the capacity to smell and sense even when no organism exhaled any message. The messages get sensed from the air. They develop the sensing expertise and live in the sensing habits. There may be the open smell expressions or restraints. The restraints too, get sensed. In the macro language concealment of real feelings is impossible. Today we adopted the language of words, where we automatically edit and half express, and it is impossible to tell the truth in the language of words, our language today. We are condemned to speak and write only half truths or outright lies or honest misrepresentations. We strive to escape from this basic drawback, by defining, scoping, exceptioning, and ultimately stammering. But we hammer the lessons on the hapless students. We never ask them, to go to thick nature, with forests, water ponds, birds etc, and try to breathe, smell and sense, to experience truth, the sublime emotion flow of Gaia. Today we are science conditioned and simply smirk at those who mention about revelation through, breathing, smelling, sensing, interacting and perceiving as the real language of nature, that it is part of nature. For the Biosphere the language of words is pollution. We see animals touching noses even today, for understanding each other. But we, who have developed the technomania, and worship machines for science, cannot tolerate the macro language. The object of every sage is to specialize in the macro language of the Biosphere, and experience revelation from nature or God. But the techno hysteria, which has become the madness of the human organism, is resulting in the elimination of all forests, elimination of rivers and water ponds (the Housing Colonies built on rivers after a robber sells plots on them as though he owns the river),the pollution and poisoning of the land, water and air and dumping toxic chemical wastes on every marsh, has resulted in the creation of economics, where man is given license to convert nature into an economic resource, to kill nature and convert it into economic goods. The Economic quake is more virulent and killing than a million volcanoes, spewing lava at the same time. All forests are under murder. We need the macro language, the language of Sages, to feel the emotion flow of the Biosphere, before we eliminate totally by employing robots our new rulers. Mankind is mad today. We have changed from homo sapiens to mad sapiens. YM ",

In a generatio, however, human resilience will help all ethnic groups to tide over the crisis and keep pace with globalisation whose march is irreversible for all. ",
