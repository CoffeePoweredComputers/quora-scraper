            "answer_text": "I think so. I\u2019ll admit, when I first read rumors of Apple switching to facial recognition instead of fingerprint, I thought it was a compromised that they were forced into because they wanted to shrink the bezels, that they had an original plan for putting it under the screen that failed, and since putting it on the back was a bad idea, they went with the next best thing. What I saw on stage didn\u2019t really dissuade me of that (although it did look pretty good). Even later, as you\u2019ll see in some of my answers on Quora, I have stated that I thought Apple would bring back Touch ID. Once they figured out how to get it working beneath the display, they would pair it with Face ID to make a redundant, invisible security system. Whichever one unlocked first would open your phone, making errors much more uncommon. I still think they might do this, but am not longer certain. Now that I have an iPhone X and actually use it every day, it\u2019s fantastic. When I go back to a device with Touch ID, I\u2019m rather annoyed with it. I\u2019m no longer used to making sure my device being touched in a certain way. I simply tap the screen or pick it up and it unlocks, more often than not completely seamlessly. Touch ID worked really well, but especially when you compare Gen 1 Touch ID to Gen 1 Face ID, there is comparison. It works as well and in many cases better than the latest version of Touch ID. Touch ID was great when it came out, but Face ID blows it out of the water. That\u2019s not even getting to all the little things that Face ID and the TruDepth camera let you do. Previews only showing when you look at them, but no one else? Genius! The alarm the lowers the volume when you pick up your phone and look at it? Magical! Little animated faces the follow your face? A lot of fun if a bit pointless (like 90% of what we do with our phones). The list goes on and will continue to grow. The one, and I mean literally only area where Face ID annoys me and Touch ID was unequivocally better is Apple Pay and purchases. It works fine, was more convenient with Touch ID. Having to tap the side button to confirm is for App Store purchases is necessary but more annoying than just placing your thumb on the home button and it\u2019s even worse with Apple Pay. I have to touch it to the payment platform, then tap the button, then lift it to my face to authenticate, then hold it back down to make the payment go through. Also it\u2019s constantly triggering when I accidentally press the button twice. It\u2019s an area where Touch ID made for less steps and a better experience, but I\u2019ll deal with it. Edit: One more thing that Face ID wins in: it works in the shower or when you\u2019re wet. Touch ID did not. ",

            "answer_text": "If you are using the latest iPhone X series then you must be aware of the fact that Apple has replaced the touch id with face id unlock. But is it really worth it? Individuals are uncertain while considering to purchase iPhone X due to this new replacement. Well, here we will compare Touch ID unlock with Face ID unlock. This will help you to identify which method is suitable for you. Face ID VS Touch ID: Face ID is relatively a faster method to unlock the device than the Touch ID. All you need to do is bring the phone in front of your face and your phone will instantly unlock automatically. In fact, Apple claims that the Face ID will recognize you even if you grow a beard, wear glasses or a hat after Face ID is set up. The Touch ID on the other hand is relatively slow, as at times, it refuses to recognize your finger either due to wrong angle or wet fingers.Face ID is way more secure than the Touch ID. Apple said that the chances of a random face unlocking your phone are 1 in 1,000,000 while the risk of a random finger unlocking your phone is 1 in 50,000. Hence, it can be concluded that the Face ID is 20x more secure than Touch ID. And don't worry the Face ID can not be fooled by High-end masks, printed photos of a face, and videos of a face.During winters gloves make it extremely annoying to unlock the device using Touch ID. Yes, there are certain gloves through which you can swiftly use your touch screen, but Touch ID does not work with any kind of gloves. Therefore, in such scenarios, Face ID works best for individuals.Users who prefer to check messages in class would be doomed as it was very easy to unlock the device and check messages by a Touch ID unlock.At times it is dark in surrounding, like a theatre, in such an environment it gets problematic for your phone to detect your face and unlock the device. While Touch ID does not require light.This is a very precise comparison I did. Now you decide what is better Touch ID or Face ID. Mention your choice in the comment section. ",
