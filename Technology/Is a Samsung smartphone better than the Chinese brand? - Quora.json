            "answer_text": "I already used Samsung smartphone for about two and half years so in my opinion, some good things that makes the Samsung Smartphone better than other phones, but some other things also there which makes other brands phones a good choice\u2026. As I used Samsung smartphone I had experience some good things like Samsung smartphone cameras, they give amazing picture quality. The built quality of Samsung phone are also very good ( I accidently dropped my Samsung phone number of times but it works good all time). The users interface of Samsung phone are also better as compared to other phones. The super amoled display quality of Samsung phone are awesome which other phones not provide. But some things which I don't like personally that are, the processor that Samsung phone provide in below 20k price range which other phone provide best processor in that price range. The fast charging is also not available in maximum Samsung phone. Overall the Samsung smartphone are better but the price for that phone are to much higher as compared to other brands phones which are also better at the price they offered. Also keep in mind that the brand of phone you will buy should gives good costomer service in case of any problem in phone in future. I hope this will help you\u2026 ",

            "answer_text": "Samsung used to be a better brand untill few years back.i am a samsung user from past 5 years. you\u2019ll not believe that i have sold my newly gifted iPhone 7 Plus 2.5 years back and i purchased samsung J7 Pro, because i was really impressed with the features & quality it offered within 21k, specially front camera quality with bigger aperture size and flash which enhances the selfie quality to multiple times. yesterday my old phone got some screen discoloration and i was thinking to buy new samsung phone. i thought by this time of 2020 samsung must have came up with even much better phone but to my surprise , company is now totally focusing on reducing price to compete other chinese brands. Focus on quality is now totally lost. now a days you buy samsung phone or any other chinese company phone , all is same. lastly now a days even samsung S20(1 lakh Rupee phone) is not giving me features compared to my earlier J7 Pro (21000 Rs phone). All manufactures are only focusing on bigger screen, and for that they have taken away the selfie flash experience from us. Not expected from the great minds sitting in Samaung & Apple design Team.
