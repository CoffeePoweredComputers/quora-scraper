            "answer_text": "Technology can be simple to use and complex in its implementation, it can be difficult to understand. A modern car is pretty easy and intuitive to learn, most people within weeks are driving almost as second nature. But they don\u2019t have to understand how it works. The same goes for your iPhone or Android. Easy to learn. A million man-hours of complexity inside that require about twelve years of college to truly understand, if you want to understand everything involved, from the relevant chemistry and physics to the software and algorithms, and that isn\u2019t even getting into the apps. No human could understand everything about every app available on an smart phone. But it is pretty simple to whip one out and record a fearless squirrel out for a run on a high power line, without knowing exactly what is going on inside that phone. ",

For example if we use a mouse, we feel it very easy to use and when you study it you come to a point where you feel it very complex. It is the same with everything in this cosmos. ",

            "answer_text": "Good question. KISS (Keep is SImple Stupid) is good policy. But sometimes what is simple for a person who has deep insight is complex for persons who see less deeply. The best hope here is probably for the person with the deep isight to strive to be a VERY good teacher/documenter too. But skill in inventing and skill is communicaing do not always go together. ",
