            "answer_text": "Since you have mentioned that it is a prototype, I assume that you have not completed the documentation, and the robot is still in a very crude stage. When you want to take things for manufacturing keep in mind the following things A structured Bill of Materials that are neededFrozen PCB designA well written code that can be documented for future reference.Use of standardised components that are lead free and widely available in the market.Prototypes are usually build with all available material. But taking anteing from prototype stage to manufacturing level is the challenge. We have been converting a lot of prototypes into finished products. Its a challenge, but great fun. ",
