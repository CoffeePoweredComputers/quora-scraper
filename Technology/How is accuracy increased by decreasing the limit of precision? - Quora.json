            "answer_text": "Accuracy is never increased by decreasing precision. Diminished precision results in haphazard results. The key to accuracy is precision. When I\u2019m loading ammunition specifically for precision shooting, I want each and every case to be as precisely uniform as possible. Case length, the size of the priming hole, the amount of case mouth chamfering, and when I can, even the weight of every case. I want my primers seated to as uniform a depth in the pocket as possible, which is why I never prime cases on the loading press. I want each and every bullet to be as uniform in weight, not varying more than 1/10th of one grain (there are 7,000 grains in a pound; 437.5 gr. per ounce, just to give you an idea of how minute and precise powder charges are weighed or measured). I want every single bullet to be seated to the exact same depth, with a variation of no more that .0001\u2033. Likewise, the firearm itself must be built with a high degree of precision in order to produce sterling accuracy. A 1894 Winchester lever action will never give you the level of accuracy you can get from a pre-1964 Winchester Model 70 bolt gun that has had a Timney trigger installed and a well-fitted glass bedded bull barrel fitted to the stock. The reason for this? Precision. A gun that rattles when you shake it won\u2019t produce the same results as a finely tuned rifle that has received the kind ministrations of an experienced gunsmith.

            "answer_text": "Precision alone doesn't do much. It mut be combined with tolerances, inspections , design and quality control to get an improve product or result. Thomas Jacjson's answer is an excellent example how a much more precise solution may be infererior to a solution 3or 4 times as precise but planned with much better consideration of the desired result. if yoy make it on a CNC machine and use optical compairtors to measure and inspect the parts but still assemble then with high school dropouts in a shop with a dirt floor using pry bars, sledge hammers, pipe wrenches as cutting torches for the final 'hand fitting' all the money you spent on the front end making more precise parts will only show minimal improvements in you end product. It will take a little less time to beat all the parts into place and the machines will look better with less rash fom hammers, cutting tour he's and pipe wrenches showing, but they still will work like they were assembled by high school drop outs. you need to upgrad the wole process equally not just parts of it.
