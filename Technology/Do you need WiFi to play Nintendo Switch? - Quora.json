(Which you\u2019ll also need to buy the online subscription in order to play those).. Ofherwise, no. But you will need WiFi to update games and you may not be able to play a game until you update it.. Some games update more frequently than others.. Animal Crossjng hasn\u2019t yet come out, but I\u2019d say that would be an example of a game that updates a lot because they\u2019ll most likely be adding new items and whatnot.. Smash Ultimate updates a lot.. ",

You also need software updates from time to time so you\u2019ll need WiFi for that to keep up to date. ",

Pokk\u00e9n Tournament DX is bundled with the 3.0.0 firmware, for example. During initial setup of your Nintendo Switch, you will be asked to establish a Wi-Fi connection to the Internet. If this is a concern, it can be skipped and set later. If you still expect to play online, the Nintendo Switch system supports the Wii USB-LAN Adapter (RVL-015) while docked, or any other officially licensed LAN adapters. You obviously can't update a game without an Internet connection, though. ",
