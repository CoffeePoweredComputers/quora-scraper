Only one colony has survived, by using the nulls pace generator to cloak their planet. You play as the nullship, an experimental ship which is outgunned and outnumbered by pretty much everything - but it has a cloaking device, and you have to make that be enough. No, there isn't a nullspace 1 Temporal insurgent A top down arena shooter/bullet hell based on time manipulation. Enter bullet time, create zones where time flows faster or slower, or even rewind time. Runover. You have a tank. Fight the waves of humans running at you with a range of high powered weapons\u2026 or just run them over. You have a tank This was a group project with the prompt \u201cyou have have a tank, this will be awesome\u201d. We ended up making it about a mutsnt penguin who breathes methane, and has a scuba tank filled with methane that it uses as a flamethrower, or to launch ice chunks at enemies. (Funny story: When we told our statist we needed a picture of a penguins with a flamethrower for the title screen, she gave us a picture she already had lying around for unrelated reasons. ) These are the ones I got to a finalized state. I have others which didn't get that far, including an A-life sim, an Aztec themed platformer, a physics based sandbox with a parser to accept arbitrary commands, a combination of pong and breakout, and an alien fighting off invaders from their ship.

The version that became a worldwide sensation was 100% Java.  What, did this take 1/2 hour to build or something? (image credit) Bejeweled The original version of Bejeweled was an Internet game, before Flash was huge and when applets were still a thing. It\u2019s been rewritten and copied so many times now that it\u2019s hard to tell what\u2019s authentic anymore. But the original version of the game was a good ol\u2019 Java applet.  The original!
