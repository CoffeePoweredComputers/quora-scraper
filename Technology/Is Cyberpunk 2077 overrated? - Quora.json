Hype is subjective and I would say most of the people who are \u201chyped\u201d for the game aren\u2019t clear with everything that\u2019s been confirmed to be part of it, that\u2019s a LOT of information that was scattered out throughout the recent two years and some of that information can be pretty challenging to find. I\u2019ve been keeping an eye on this game since 2O13 and there\u2019s next to nothing I don\u2019t know about it other than information that\u2019s been deliberately withheld by the company itself. That stacks up to a smaller essay of info confirmed by Projekt Red so far, and all of that is really just a smaller glimpse of everything that will probably be coming with the full package on launch. Judging from what some players know about it, this game could be underhyped. So personally, no, I wouldn\u2019t mistake it for overhyped, it LOOKS like it\u2019s overhyped because the hype is just enormous, but I\u2019d say it\u2019s very much tempered when compared to the big picture.

Considering everything that has been shown about this game, I\u2019m excited for it considering how lack luster a lot of AAA games have been lately\u2026I\u2019m looking at you Anthem. Right now I want a solid single player game, a game that isn\u2019t bogged down by four different additions, wasteful DLC and the like. Cyberpunk 2077 will be the game that will set the standard of top quality games, a standard a lot of formerly upheld companies have forgotten over greed. So let\u2019s wait and see, though for me I\u2019m hyped. ",
