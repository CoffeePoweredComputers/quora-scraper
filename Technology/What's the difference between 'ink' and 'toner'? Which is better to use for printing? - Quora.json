            "answer_text": "Ink is used for inkjet printers, and toner is used for laser printers. I find that laser printing is better, in the sense that I get a crisper print, and very important for me, no fading in sunlight, unlike an inkjet printed page. A toner cartridge is more expensive than an inkjet cartridge, but prints many more pages before running out. Also, a toner cartridge doesn\u2019t dry out and become unusable if not used for a while, which is quite important for a home printer. ",
