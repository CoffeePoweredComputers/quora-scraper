            "answer_text": "Most dog breeds are examples of selective breeding.   The \"native\" dog breed is similar to the dingo of Australia. It is a medium sized, mutt. So almost any breed you choose has been selectively bred for certain traits, as to size, shape, skills, etc.Look at most horse breeds as well. The differences between an Arabian racing horse is substantial compared to a Clydesdale.  Of course more natural breeding is shown in the differences between African and Indian Elephants.   Just keep looking, there are plenty to see. ",
