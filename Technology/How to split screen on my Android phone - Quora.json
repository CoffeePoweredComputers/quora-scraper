            "answer_text": "If you have android 9 pie then open the task view. At the top of an app you want to see in split screen, tap and hold the icon for it. A drop down menu will come and then select split screen. Next go through the task menu more to find another app you also want to see and click on it at the top. You can adjust the size by drawing the black bar between them. You can also go to the task viewer and select the app you want to split screen by doing the previous. Then close the viewer, the first app will be in split screen. Next just open another app that you also want to see in split screen either from the desktop or app drawer. Not all apps support split screen and you will usually get a warning if it doesn't. ",
