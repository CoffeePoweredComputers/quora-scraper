            "answer_text": "If this is problem solving to begin with, then what would be able to save it? And why does it change so much? Doomed or promising? What is the point? The topic is often introduced by ethics, periods like the industrial revolution, and current events, but it can stream practically forever. How does someone know which field to begin with? How do they discuss it, naively or by technical terms, or what if those lag concepts and techniques? How do they become tech oriented from any other background? Is it mathematics or applied science and where do they get their instruments from? Or is it computation? Aren\u2019t algorithms or machine learning biased? Is there a skills gap? Is automation going to displace labor? Is it accessible to everyone? Do people lose abilities when they become dependent? Classically the questions include what it is, or why, if culture depends upon it, or history, and whether it is good. There is a long discussion from the beginning of recorded history, like about cooking or clothing or building, and incidentally how can they avoid losing any more of that, before by writing, now by the internet. What are the long term effects? What are the misconceptions? How much is propaganda, or does that include advertising? Are utopias valid, or dystopias? Predictions? What about non-falsifiable hypotheses like the ancestor simulation? If nature is right, then why is humanity always changing the environment? Is tech between nature and society? Or does it have to solve all the problems? Are the primitivists right or would the population quickly revert to low levels of subsistence without it? Is it mainly for protection? Or does innovation motivate progress or economic growth? Why so many ideologies? If futurism was around a century ago, how come it was not smooth going since? What are all the types and how are those tracked? Who are the experts? What is the literature? What are the institutions? Are they progressive? What are the latest rules? How are those changed? Does it control the populace? Is it run by elite, or neoliberals, or collective intelligence? Or it dominated by the large organizations? Are cryptocurrencies manipulated? Could it use theories, like for engineering? Do the population demands exceed natural resources soon? Or is climate change existential along with nukes? Does cyber synthesize the dialectic? Is the internet of things easy to hack? Or does artificial intelligence spike off the chart? Or can genetic modification be perfect? Does nano dissolve everything? Or do they take out nature? Is change getting faster? Will it be democratized? Is aging a disease? Are treatments personalized? Can anyone be any way they want? Do they migrate to space? How are risks mitigated? Pick any tech for issues, like social networks, autonomous vehicles, drones, 3D printed counterfeits or arms, health costs, IT complexity, fracking, pollution, emerging fields, fusion, and so on. What is the right tech in any case? How about the proverbial unintended consequences? ",

            "answer_text": "I\u2019m not quite sure what you mean, but as far as the problems keeping technology from advancing and spreading, one of the main ones is money. It takes an awful lot of money to research, develop and advertise a new gadget, robot etc. Then, once you get it out on the market, you hope it sells and among other things have to deal with the fact that at your price point, a great many people will not be able to afford it. Yes, tech goes down in price gradually, but it takes time. For a while, only the wealthy will have your latest gizmo. ",
