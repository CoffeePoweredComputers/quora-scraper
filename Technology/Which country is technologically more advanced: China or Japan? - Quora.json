            "answer_text": "I don\u2019t think there can be any question that in terms of raw technological knowledge and expertise Japan is still, overall, way ahead, the legacy of 70+ years of world leading investment in education and research and design. China leads Japan in a few niche areas (for example possibly some manned space flight, some specific military technologies and specialist areas such as Chinese medicine related developments among others). Importantly China also leads in the production of software, Japan has some world class experts in programming, but has quite small numbers of programmers overall. China has many more and this also partly explains why China is becoming the leading AI producing country after the US. However it is only a matter of time before China catches up and probably overtakes Japan, just due to shear numbers (China has 10x the population of Japan). To catch up across the board might take as much as another 20-30 years though. It\u2019s obviously much easier to catch up in technology than to make new technology. China has been able to jump forward in technology by obtaining foreign tech by various means. On the one hand it has bought technology, it has sent students to study abroad and it has engaged in join ventures with foreign companies/organisations where part of the deal is usually some degree of technology transfer, on the other hand China has reverse engineered foreign products and captured weapons systems, and has obtained technology by espionage and hacking both of other governments and foreign companies (which most countries do to one degree or another - though genuinely probably much less so in Japan\u2019s case with it\u2019s strict controls on government agencies and particularly spying - since WWII there has been no functional equivalents of the CIA or NSA in Japan for example, whereas there most certainly are in China). This has, for example, enabled China to develop some pretty impressive next generation stealth fighters among other achievements. For these reasons the Chinese government and military contractors are probably further ahead in technology than purely private Chinese companies who might get sued if they used questionably obtained technology in their products. It\u2019s important to note that despite the public vitriol between the Chinese and Japanese governments, on the ground in China, there is massive cooperation between Chinese and Japanese companies and any number of joint ventures and associated technology sharing. Therefore Japan does not necessarily have to lose out in a situation where China catches it up in technology levels, such development may well be a win-win for both countries. ",

            "answer_text": "It\u2019s impossible to make a comparison because they aren\u2019t comparable countries, but pressed for an answer I would have to say China as the country has very good standards even in the most rural and poor areas. China also has more potential, whereas Japan is tapped out until they fix immigration. Look at a third country, the United States, for comparison. Extremely wealthy, advanced technology, excellent living standards\u2014horrible disparity. Japan is also a wealthy country in terms of assets, and there is far less disparity but only in comparison to the United States as the most extreme example of it. The shared experience of Japanese people is that of the poor. They live poorly. They behave as poor people behave. They\u2019re obsessed with ethnicity as status, with class, and they suffer for it. China has manifested a communist ideology within a capitalist system. They have rich and poor, but overall it\u2019s a country with a well managed lack of disparity. And it\u2019s amazing because it\u2019s so huge. China has a bigger population than all of Africa combined. It\u2019s a miracle of government. ",

During the Qin dynasty, the first emperor sent a team of top herbalists, chemists, biologists , scientists , 500 young boys and girls with a large to Japan looking for the legendary medicine that would make him immortal. The boys and girls were sent to make sure the search could continue. They stayed in Japan and the work ethnics and determination passed on. Further, during Japan's invasion of China, they used healthy Chinese to conduct many biological and chemical tests. For example , the victims were infected with various diseases and they would monitor the changes until the subjects died. They would also torture subjects in different subjects and record in various parts of the body and so long a person could survive. So, Japanese had many empirical data from live human subjects that could not have been obtained in a civilized world!. The most notorious Japanese regiment who was responsible for this war crime was the 731 . They were never brought to justice. In fact, the Americans got the research results in return for turning a blind eye to the atrocity committed . Naturally, the Chinese don't have the research findings . In those areas China is behind.

That would be a marvelous society in a truly powerful nation. ",
