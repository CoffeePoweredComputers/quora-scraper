            "answer_text": "Compared to what? It's not the literal cost of a lithium cell compared to a Nicad cell or NiMH cell that's important is it? It's the cost per Wh and then the longevity which gives you the lifetime cost. Let's say a premium 18650 Samsung cell which can hold 3250mah at 3.7v nominal so 12Wh costs \u00a32.95 so that's 25p per Wh. Then let's take a mid range NiMH cell from Ikea it's 2450mah at 1.2v nominal so 2.9Wh and \u00a31.38 so that's 47p per Wh. So the older type of battery is more expensive for each unit of energy it stores. The lithium cell is cheaper per watt hour. Yes the Nimh cell is a bit easier to handle and more resilient to not being treated carefully and it probably has got a fractionally lower risk of fire, but it's more expensive. Yes, lead acid batteries are cheaper per Wh but they weigh 4 times as much and give less power over their lifetime, which can be shorter especially if you actually want to cycle them. ",

            "answer_text": "Despite Nickel costing 22,000 per ton and Cobalt 33,000 per ton. Very little expensive materials go into batteries. The cobalt content of a $10,000 Tesla battery pack is arround $170. The great expensive of batteries come in there manufacturing processes. For batteries to function properly particles have to be sized at the microscope level, formulas carefuly manged and lots and lots of energy inputed into the system expecily during the drying process of diffrent componets. The second source of expence is the packaging. Outside of a single unit battery in a cell phone or simular electronic device. Large numbers of cells are usualy bundled togather into modules and packs. Engineering and assembiling those packages cost as much if not more then the indevidual cells they house. So the answer is Lithium batteries do not favor a monolithic design. But the reality is for what you get there not that expensive. ",
