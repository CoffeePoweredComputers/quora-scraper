            "answer_text": "I don\u2019t know about 10, but here are some new shows that I like. Evil - I got this from the internet and it describes it much better than I could: Skeptical psychologist Kristen Bouchard joins David Acosta, who is training to be a Catholic priest, and a blue collar contractor as they investigate the church's backlog of unexplained mysteries, including supposed miracles, demonic possessions and other extraordinary. Bob \u2764\ufe0f Abishola - This is about a successful businessman who has a heart attack and is nursed back to heath by a nurse who is from Nigeria. He likes her and he does many things to win her over. Tommy - A NYPD high ranking cop becomes LA\u2019s 1st female police chief. She\u2019s honest, assertive (which most men think is aggressive), and fair. All Rise - A DistrIct Attorney is elevated to Judge. In her new role she sees the difficulties of transitioning for Prosecutor to Judge and the changes she needs to make. FBI Most Wanted - I have enjoyed the series FBI which debuted last year. It deals primarily with current cases where they are trying to find out who the perpetrator is. In this show they are looking for fugitives. 911 Lone Star - This also a spinoff to the show 911. This one deals with a New York City Fire Fighter who was in 9/11 and relocates to Austin, Texas to help with a fire station that went through a tragedy and was shut down. Lincoln Rhyme: Hunt for the Bone Collector - Police Detective Lincoln Rhyme is injured during the pursuit of a serial killer named the Bone Collector, leaving him a Quadriplegic. A few years have passed and after a dormant period, the Bone Collector resurfaces, leadings Lincoln to put a team together to finally find him. This is all I can think of for this year that I like. Hope you enjoy them. ",
