My fianc\u00e9 and I decided to take a step back a think, is it worth it? We enjoy having access to Netflix since we don\u2019t have cable but that\u2019s really the only reason we would need internet. We both have unlimited data on our phones so when we want to watch something, we just use an hdmi adapter cable and project Netflix from our phone screen onto the tv. It drains your battery pretty quickly so you have maybe an hour per phone but it\u2019s better than paying for a bad connection and watching the video buffer forever. We haven\u2019t been doing this very long (about two weeks) but so far since we have the unlimited data on our phones it\u2019s really not much of a difference. ",

            "answer_text": "The only reason I feel is that today everything in our daily revolves around communicative devices. We have to have internet today because that's just how the world stays in touch with absolutely everything! Otherwise, it wouldn't be that difficult to live without Internet. I've done it and loved it but my living circumstances at the time didn't depend on much social or cultural connection. I lived without Internet for the first fifty years of my life very well. We wrote letters to each other and we got excited each day anticipating what was in our mailboxes. We talked on the telephone for hours but would restrain from calling overseas because of the costs and sometimes not being able to get quality connections. Humans survive, technology does only because we humans want quick, fast ways to get stuff done. But today, all of our systems are computer-based so if our computers go down, so do we unless we tap into our basic creative communication skills and practice patience.  ",
