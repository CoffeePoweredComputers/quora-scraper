            "answer_text": "It really depends on the technology that is the best fit for a given solution. I'll describe a few technologies that are popular for transmitting small amounts of data over short ranges: NFC \u2013 Is a subset of RFID, and as a standard has been widely adopted for contactless payments, public transportation and is integrated in most modern smartphones (although Apple lags behind Android in this regard). It   is useful for storing data on passive tags which are activated when put in contact with a reader \u2013 so there is no need for a power supply within the NFC tag. It also works at a radio frequency that requires close contact between the tag & the reader.  This allows for additional security and control, for instance on a door entry card.RFID \u2013 Other standards of radio frequency identification tagging are possible outside of NFC, which can allow for proprietary data formats in a closed-loop system.  Also, using different frequencies can allow for longer ranges, as commonly used in shipping to track items in a warehouse. RFID RAIN is a standard for interoperability of devices to help enable the 'internet of things'.BLE \u2013 Bluetooth Low-Energy, or Beacons, uses another standard wireless protocol found in many portable devices.  The data sources require power to transmit their signal to nearby devices, but it allows for a greater range than NFC. There is less standardisation of the data format among these devices, and it is often handled at the software application layer \u2013 although devices are working to create standards for using 'beacons'.QR Codes \u2013 2D barcodes which require optical scanning to be read, but are also passive and the cheapest option to print at scale.  For consumer use, the drawback is that these are not supported natively by smartphones, and the interaction with apps is slower and clumsier than 'tapping' or 'swiping'WiFi, Zigbee, Z-Wave \u2013 In home automation, there are wireless protocols that fit in well with the WiFi that is already present in many connected homes. Using one of the standards allows for devices to be recognised by a home automation 'hub'.LiFi, Ultrasonic, Chirpcast, etc. etc. \u2013 There are lots of new 'over the air' data transmission protocols being devised in research labs and garages across the world \u2013 the key things to watch are trends in consumer adoption. NFC is a widely supported standard which is already present in many consumer devices, and there are many reasons to adopt an open standard over a proprietary standard, but that is another discussion.",

            "answer_text": "NFC or Near-Field Communication - a close cousin of RFID. NFC operates in the same bandwidth of high-frequency or HF RFID which is 13.56 Mhz. NFC can function both like passive RFID or active RFID, where-in the tag can simply bounce back radio waves it is beamed or actively emit radio waves towards the NFC reader using a small battery. NFC are common on smartphones today. The biggest problem or let\u2019s say drawback of this technology is that its reading-distance is extremely low (in the range of a few centimeters only). The Best alternative to this technology is RFID or Beacons. However, the best option as per my knowledge would be Beacons, as RFID also has low reading distance as compared to Beacons To find the comparison of each of the technology you can visit this blog - RFID, NFC, BLE Beacons ",
