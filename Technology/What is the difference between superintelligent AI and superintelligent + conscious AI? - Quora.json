            "answer_text": "Going by all the comments on Quora regarding consciousness and intelligence, it seems that many use these two very different terms interchangeably. Consciousness is the act of paying attention to signals; intelligence is pattern recognition. Of course they are related, they work together to make cognition occur, but they are two aspects of cognition and not to be conflated. AI doesn\u2019t really exist; what is going on with so-called \u201cAI\u201d is artificial in that someone is writing code to implement it, but it isn\u2019t intelligence because there is no one in the machine that recognizes anything, never mind recognizing patterns. There is no recognition because there is no cognition; cognition requires an attention and machines do not - cannot - have such a thing as attention. Only animals with brains can have an attention, because without it they cannot survive. Computers - machines - are not alive and do not strive to survive. They can be made to emulate the behavior of an animal struggling to survive by paying attention, but it is only an emulation and to conflate that with the real event is like talking to a store mannequin on the basis of its superficial resemblance to a living human being. We are fools because we love to be fooled. We pay big money to be fooled; not just paying money to see stage magic which we even know we are being fooled, but every form of entertainment is basically us being fooled by entertainers. Computers are lovely entertainment and we are fools who love to be entertained by them. That\u2019s fine, until we lose our common sense and talk nonsense like we do regarding computers, what they are, what they are not. ",

            "answer_text": "What is the difference between superintelligent AI and superintelligent + conscious AI?Let me see if I can explain it. AI: An attempt to mimic biological logic and reasoning using computational theory. This is only partially successful.Human level AI: An impossible type of AI.Superintelligent AI: An impossible type of AI.Conscious AI: An impossible type of AI.Superintelligent + conscious AI: An impossible type of AI.Machine intelligence: The broader class of non-biological intelligence of which AI is a small subset.Machine intelligence of human level: A theoretically possible type of machine intelligence.Machine intelligence above human level: A theoretically possible type of machine intelligence.Machine consciousness: A theoretically possible type of non-biological consciousness.There does not seem to be a distinction between the ability to process abstractions and consciousness. In other words, there is not any known theoretical method of processing abstractions without having consciousness. AI cannot be either conscious nor can it process abstractions due to limitations of computational theory. ",
