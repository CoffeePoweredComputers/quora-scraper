Transmitter: The power transmitter consists of inverter circuit,primary coil andControl unitCommunication unit.The inverter supplies the controlled AC power to the primary coil, and this control is regulated by the Control and Communication unit. This unit senses the Voltage/Current in the primary coil. ADC, comparator and PWM makes a feedback loop that controls the current supplied to the transmitter coil. Receiver: At the receiver side there is a rectification unit with takes the ac component from the coils and converts it to dc and supplies to the battery circuit of the receiver for charging. The receiver also sends the feedback signals back to transmitter through communication channel to adjust the current in the coils. Venkata Kusumitha's answer to How does wireless charging work?
