            "answer_text": "List of best zoom camera phones 1. Samsung Galaxy S20 Ultra Samsung Galaxy S20 Ultra is sensationally loaded when it comes to camera hardware. The main sensor has 108MP resolution and the 48MP zoom camera has a periscope lens assembly with 103mm focal length for 4X optical zoom. Both of these sensors have OIS. Samsung advertises 100x super-zoom, but the images at 100x are barely useable even with a tripod. You can still capture magnificent zoom shots for 8X to 10x zoom. 2. Samsung Galaxy S20 and Galaxy S20+ Samsung Galaxy S20 (review) and Galaxy S20+ don\u2019t have the same zoom chops as the Ultra, but they are a lot more manageable and are still surprisingly good with Zoom shots. The 64MP zoom camera supports 3x lossless hybrid zoom (of which only 1.6x is allegedly optical). Just as the main 12MP sensor, the zoom camera is optically stabilized. There is a lot to like about the Samsung Galaxy S20 and Galaxy S20+ including their excellent displays, software, and phenomenal design. 3. Huawei P40 Pro Plus Huawei P30 Pro was the first periscope-style zoom camera that we tried out and back then its zoom prowess swept us off our feet. Its successors \u2013 the Huawei P40 Pro Plus and P40 Pro \u2013 further improve the camera performance but are, unfortunately, missing Google apps support. The Huawei P40 Pro has not one but two optically stabilized telephoto cameras and you can get \u2018optical zoom\u2019 at two magnifications \u2013 3x and 10x. Of course, the hybrid zoom takes you a lot further. The regular P40 has a single 5X telephoto camera, and almost all other features remain similar. 4. Pixel 4 XL Computational photography is Google\u2019s expertise. Pixel phones have managed to stay ahead of every other phone when it comes to portrait mode, even with a single camera sensor. So, it shouldn\u2019t come as a surprise that the Pixel 4 and Pixel 4 XL can deliver remarkable 8X hybrid zoom using the extra telephoto camera. The 16MP secondary sensor has a 50mm telephoto lens and can deliver a 2x optical zoom. The Pixel 4 Xl goes beyond and can deliver good quality 8X hybrid zoom images. The lackluster battery, inconsistent radar gestures, and limited availability are drawbacks that can\u2019t be ignored, but Pixel 4 XL still has a lot to like. 5. OnePlus 8 Pro OnePlus continues with its 8MP 3x hybrid zoom camera on the 8 Pro (review). The 74mm equivalent focal length doesn\u2019t sound like much when compared to the top contenders, but the camera zoom works quite decent for medium ranges. The 8 Pro is a power-packed phone with a premium design, elegant software, and a smooth 2k 120Hz display. ",

            "answer_text": "According to reports and camera samples Huawei P30 pro has the best optical Zoom camera and company also showed their camera samples to their website and youtube channel. In this phone there are three rear cameras as 40MP + 20MP + 8MP and it is loaded with 5X Zooming capability. If you think its the best one wait for a while because Chinese company Realme also also trying to do something bigger than it by launching first 64MP camera phone in India very soon. Till than Huawei is the king in this field but you can also consider Samsung S10+ for features like 4k video recording. ",
