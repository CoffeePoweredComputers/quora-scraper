            "answer_text": "AI should be attached to a measurable significant business win. A lot of companies start with projects that begin with the phrase: \u201cWouldn\u2019t it be cool if\u2026.\u201d Those are typically bad projects to work on and should be avoided. We recommend stacking your 5\u201310 project ideas and writing a value estimate in dollars next to each. You\u2019ll find some are almost impossible to write any value estimate to (i.e. incorporating Pinterest into your search/user-persona). A few questions we encourage businesses to ask are: \u201cWhat would happen if you could QA everything?\u201d\u201cWhat if you could make your best employees 10\u2013100x more efficient?\u201d\u201cWhere are humans doing repetitive high volume tasks with unstructured data?\u201d We see great applications in manufacturing where automated quality checks can be added where line workers have been used. In many cases not only is the line worker augmented, their accuracy is exceeded. I can\u2019t publicly reference the customers using AI for line worker automation because they see it as being a key competitive advantage to their business. I can only say \u201csuper-human\u201d is the new normal and is almost expected. For public reference I can give two, HireVue and Chatbooks.I used to lead the data science efforts for Sequoia backed HireVue. HireVue offered digital interviewing services, but was able to leverage AI to help rank potential job candidates. They are leading their industry with some of the best-prediction capabilities ever seen. They also accomplished this with state-of-the-art adverse impact mitigation, where they could even block biased training sets from learning bias. Chatbooks is a scrapbooking company that is using deep learning on the iPhone to automate duplicate/similar photo grouping and best-photo selection. You can see their story here:  This is a guest blog I did for Data Robot a year ago talking about why most AI projects fail. If this is your first attempt at AI or automation you are walking on a thin tightrope. Hopefully my mistakes/experience can help increase your chances of success: Why Most AI Projects Fail If you ever have questions about AI do-ability feel free to reach out on LinkedIn/Twitter at @bentaylordata. It is more likely that you are NOT a fit for our services, but I am still happy to share experience/insight for your AI roadmap. -your AI missionary from Utah, -Ben ",

            "answer_text": "Remember when you used to call a customer service number and speak directly to a real, live human? It wasn\u2019t that long ago. Now, however, you almost always connect to an interactive voice recognition (IVR) system first. Advances in artificial intelligence (AI) have fundamentally changed customer service and business communications, and not just with IVR. AI is the ability of a computer to mimic human cognitive skills, such as learning and understanding. Although it\u2019s still in its early stages, AI is already changing the landscape of company communications. Today, businesses use AI to chat with customers, route calls, send emails, and more. According to the Accenture 2016 Technology Vision survey, 70 percent of corporate executives said they were investing more in AI than they were in 2014, and that number has been on the rise ever since. AI\u2019s Rapid Growth By 2020, Gartner predicts that customers will manage 85% of the relationship with an enterprise without interacting with a human. This is becoming possible because of advances in machine learning. Machine learning refers to the ability of AI systems to learn and improve automatically, taking in data through observations and interactions and adapting accordingly without being explicitly programmed. Essentially, machine learning models program themselves. Rapid advances in AI like machine learning are bringing many businesses new opportunities for growth and revenue. There are three main factors influencing this fast-moving space: Advances in artificial intelligence (AI): A wealth of computing resources and large data samples have pushed AI further and faster than we ever expected. Adoption of APIs and microservices: Development trends have moved away from monolithic applications. Now AI can understand a calendar, look up current inventory, and make updates in real-time. Adoption of messaging by businesses: Business-to-consumer communication has created new business cases for bots, which is driving even greater adoption of this technology. AI for Customer Support Artificial intelligence helps businesses engage with larger numbers of customers without sacrificing the quality of the interaction. For example, chatbots like those seen in Microsoft Skype, Facebook Messenger, and Slack enable businesses to respond to customer messages promptly and to increase the number of customers they can communicate with at once. While the customer feels like they are interacting with a live person, the technology has been programmed to answer common questions with automated responses. Businesses are using AI to offer customer support in other ways as well, such as natural language interfaces that allow customers to speak commands instead of pressing buttons, or intent extraction that analyzes a customer\u2019s intent. According to David Marcus, Facebook's VP of Messaging Products, \u201cBots can provide anything from automated subscription content like weather and traffic updates, to customized communications like receipts, shipping notifications, and live automated messages all by interacting directly with the people who want to get them.\u201d Benefits of AI AI offers multiple benefits to both customers and businesses. Among the most apparent benefit to customers is shorter hold times. AI can be used to help route callers to the proper destination quickly, skipping some \u2014 or all \u2014 of the traditional phone menu. For businesses, cost savings are a significant driver to the adoption of AI for customer support. While a customer service phone call costs a business $6 to $20 per call, automated calls cost an average of 25 cents. However, the benefits of AI extend far beyond the bottom line. When automated services take care of a portion of customer service requests, agents are free to handle more complex requests. This reduces customer frustration while continuing to reduce the load on each live agent, allowing operators to specialize and give better service. The Importance of Context Without context, artificial intelligence is just artificial. AI becomes intelligent with the input of data and context. Businesses need to have the right processes in place to properly feed data to their AI tools. On the flip side, AI provides contextual intelligence to contact center agents, such as personal data, interaction history, and other aspects of the customer journey, which helps agents perform better. The more an agent knows about who the customer is, what they\u2019re looking for, and what conversations they\u2019ve already had, the easier it is to provide better, faster service. Contextual intelligence saves customers from having to repeat themselves and ultimately contributes to excellent experiences. Tools like intelligent routing, phrase detection, call scoring, and intelligent redaction of recordings make contact center operations teams more efficient. When contextual intelligence helps customers resolve common issues without needing to speak to an agent, agents are free to focus on higher value activities. All About Bots Bots are software that lets a customer interact with a business through messaging. Bots are an increasingly common use of AI in business communications. While some bots operate on their own, many others support and augment a human agent that\u2019s representing the business. Bots provide automated responses based on message analysis using technologies such as natural language understanding (NLU) and intent extraction. Today\u2019s bots fall into the following categories: Chatbots can carry on a two-way conversation with a human. Personal assistant bots can answer questions and respond to commands, but they typically don\u2019t carry on a two-way conversation, at least as their primary function. You know them as Siri, Google Now, and Cortana. Notification bots are made of logic that lives in your chat room. They pop up now and again to update you with relevant information, but you don\u2019t necessarily chat with them. Command line bots use simple text commands to access services like checking the weather, ordering a car directly from Slack, or controlling an IoT device. The Hybrid Approach Ultimately, the goal of AI is to help customers have a more personalized and efficient experience without them even noticing. AI improves agent conversations by helping to anticipate customer needs and automate actions where possible. In cases where customers can self-serve, AI tools can help those interactions be more human. However, even with the advancement in AI technology, humans aren\u2019t going away from the contact center anytime soon. Human interactions are complex, as well as necessary for forming bonds and customer loyalty. Live agents working in harmony with AI, known as the hybrid approach, is the ideal scenario for most businesses today. With the hybrid approach, a human-assisted bot is a first-to-respond entity, and it falls back on a human agent if it doesn\u2019t know how to respond effectively. Facebook M and Clara are examples of this type of bot. The goal of the human-assisted bot is to fulfill requests using machine learning as often as possible. Bots can learn from human decisions, so they get better with algorithmic and data-driven decisions day-by-day, eventually reducing the need for humans to step in. Hybrid intelligence is a \u201cbest of both worlds\u201d approach and makes for an excellent way to deliver human-style communication at scale. AI and Xhorlali De Entrepreneur ChatBot Agent Unfortunately, most bots deliver a subpar experience to a human agent, meaning companies are left to balance higher costs associated with human support agents and the negative CSAT implications of a poor chatbot. It doesn\u2019t have to be this way. At Our Agency, we\u2019ve created Autopilot, a conversational AI interface, to bridge the gap between human agents and self-service bots. You can use our Autopilot Bot to build, train, sell, close deals and deploy: Bots that are intelligent. Bots that keep learning. Bots that can contextually handoff to a human. Smoothly transition a bot conversation to a conversation with agents in a contact center when necessary, passing along the full context of the interaction. Bots for every channel. ",
