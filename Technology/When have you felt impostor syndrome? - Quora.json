            "answer_text": "Interesting question, I must confess that while I first learned of impostor syndrome probably around 20 years ago, or more, I did consult a dictionary before formulating my answer. In my case, the answer is definitely never. However, like most things in life there is a continuum so I expect there would be some individuals who experience to a greater degree and others to a lesser. In fact, after considering your question, and I hasten to point out that I do not purport to be a medical professional, it does seem to me that imposter syndrome is a product of, or at least at its core largely driven by a very low level of self worth even self -hatred. I think it\u2019s also worth making the point that most of us, from time to time, particularly when faced with difficult and challenging situations have experienced fleeting moments of self doubt but, unlike those who are sadly afflicted by impostor syndrome, possess the psychological wherewithall to deal with and overcome these self defeating moments.

            "answer_text": " I felt it most acutely when I was pretending to be the managing editor of a small daily newspaper under the direction of an intimidating and slightly insane publisher who had lived in the town his entire life. I was 29, from a large city and trying out a new identity as a father, a husband and a respected figure in a small town. I was expected to crank out reams of editorials on topics I had no opinion about and little real knowledge (the death of Golda Meir, for example). I was also playing the role of \u201cboss\u201d for which I was extremely ill suited as an introvert. My wife was going through post-partum depression, and sleepless parenthood was eating us alive. We were also drinking to try to escape the trap we had built for ourselves. I only lasted a year, and it was the worst year of my life. It took me years to regain my self-confidence, which I had in excess prior to the move from a wonderful mid-sized college town where I felt I truly belonged and was most happy. The horror movie Vivarium is an only slightly exaggerated version of that year for me. I just wanted to die. But that year did clarify what kind of situation in life I was suited to. I had later experience where my job was threatened at a much larger big-city paper. But I was more knowledgeable and more determined not to lose it. We also had a union, which protected a lot of mistreated employees. I realized that the bosses were self-important geeks who had made life miserable for many of my colleagues. It became the most successful chapter of my career. After all that experience, I finally accepted that we\u2019re all phonies, bluffing our way through the workday and that most management is B.S. As philosopher Bertrand Russell said: \u201cOne of the symptoms of an approaching nervous breakdown is the belief that one\u2019s work is terribly important.\u201d ",
