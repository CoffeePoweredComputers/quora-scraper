            "answer_text": "Computer has made a very vital impact on society. It has changed the way of life. Hereunder are some hacks and tricks which can make your journey with computers more comfortable and smart. 1.Rename Subtitle File Same As Movie Name And VLC Will Load Subtitle Automatically Every Time You Open Movie.  Rename the subtitle file same as movie name (Kept in same folder) and you do not need to load subtitle everytime you play the movie. 2.Undo An Undo Just Press CTRL+Y (for windows). Ctrl+shift+Z can be used for both Mac and windows. 3.Delete One Word At One Time By CTRL+ Backspace.  4. Open Task Manager In Windows Directly Press Ctrl + Shift + Esc.  5. You Can Open File Explorer By Pressing Windows Key + E. 6.Use New Windows 10 Keyboard Shortcuts. Windows + A: Brings up the Action Center Windows + C: Brings up cortana Windows + I: Brings up the settings menu Windows + Ctrl + D: Adds new Desktop Windows + Ctrl + left arrow/right arrow:Switch between Desktops. 7. YouTube keyboard shortcuts  If you thought using the spacebar to pause a YouTube video was effective (except when focus is elsewhere and it doesn't work), instead try using K for pausing, while J and L will step backward/forward 10 seconds. M works for mute. Super handy. 8.Paste the plain text of what was copied When you copy text from any source, programs will usually include any formatting that comes with it. To paste this as plain text, press Ctrl + Shift + V instead of the standard Ctrl + V, and the system will paste unformatted text. This also works on Mac: Cmd + Shift + V. 9. Making sub and superscript text  If you need to make sub or superscript text (think exponents for superscript), press Ctrl + = for subscript and Ctrl + Shift + = for superscript. 10.Lock your computer instantly Sick of your \"friends\" going onto your computer at work or home and posting things on your Facebook/Twitter page on your behalf? It's certainly an annoyance, but an easy one to prevent. Windows + L will lock your system right away, requiring a password (if you've set one) to log in again.  Here are some more : 11.Ctrl+Alt+[Any arrow button] to rotate screen.  12.Windows+X and A to open elevated command prompt.  13. Chrome Incognito Using \u201cCtrl + Shift + N\u201d shortcut in Chrome will open up an incognito tab. This means Chrome won\u2019t remember the user\u2019s history and no one has to worry about leaving suspicions traces in case someone snoops up. 14.Snipping Tool You can start Snipping tool by clicking \u201cstart\u201d and typing \u201cSnipping Tool\u201d in the search box. The tool will freeze the window and enable you to take a screenshot of the whole screen or just a specific part.  15. GodMode Navigating through the control panel in Windows can be a bit confusing sometimes but we have a solution.You need to create a new folder and rename it to this: \u201cGodMode.{ED7BA470-8E54-465E-825C-99712043E01C}\u201d. Now, all the Control Panel settings and folders are available in one place.  So these are all the tricks and hacks I know. I hope you found them useful.

            "answer_text": "Hacking is about manipulating and bypassing systems to force them to do the unintended. Some hackers inflict terrible widespread damage and cause financial and emotional hurt. Victimized companies lose millions in repair and restitution costs; victimized individuals lose their jobs, their bank accounts, and even their relationships. With 'greatest' being synonymous with 'harshest', here is a list of noteworthy hacks from the last 20 yearsyou will certainly want to reconsider your own password practices. Ashley Madison Hack 2015: 37 Million Users The hacker group Impact Team broke into the Avid Life Media servers and copied the personal data of 37 million Ashley Madison users. The hackers then incrementally released this information to the world through various websites. The shameful impact to people's personal reputations has had ripples across the world, including claims that user suicides followed after the hack. This hack is memorable not only because of the sheer publicity of the impact, but because the hackers also earned some fame as vigilantes crusading against infidelity and lies. The Conficker Worm 2008: Still Infecting a Million Computers a Year While this resilient malware program has not wreaked irrecoverable damage, this program refuses to die; it actively hides and then nefariously copies itself to other machines. Even more frightening: this worm continues to open backdoors for future hacker takeovers of the infected machines. The Conficker worm program (aka 'Downadup' worm) replicates itself across computers, where it lies in secret to either a) convert your machine into a zombie bot for spamming, or b) to read your credit card numbers and your passwords through keylogging, and transmit those details to the programmers. Conficker/Downadup is a very smart computer program. It defensively deactivates your antivirus software in order to protect itself. Conficker is noteworthy because of its resilience and reach; it still travels around the Internet 8 years after its discovery. Stuxnet Worm 2010: Iran's Nuclear Program Blocked A worm program that was less than a megabyte in size was released into Iran's nuclear refinement plants. Once there, it secretly took over the Siemens SCADA control systems. This sneaky worm commanded over 5000 of the 8800 uranium centrifuges to spin out of control, then suddenly stop and then resume, while simultaneously reporting that all is well. This chaotic manipulating went on for 17 months, ruining thousands of uranium samples in secret, and causing the staff and scientists to doubt their own work. All the while, no one knew that they were being deceived and simultaneously vandalized. This devious and silent attack wreaked far more damage than simply destroying the refining centrifuges themselves; the worm led thousands of specialists down the wrong path for a year and a half, and wasted thousands of hours of work and millions of dollars in uranium resources. The worm was named 'Stuxnet', a keyword that was found in the code's internal comments. This hack is memorable because of both optics and deceit: it attacked a nuclear program of a country that has been in conflict with the USA and other world powers; it also deceived the entire nuclear staff for a year and a half as it performed its nasty deeds in secret. Home Depot Hack 2014: Over 50 Million Credit Cards By exploiting a password from one of its stores' vendors, the hackers of Home Depot achieved the largest retail credit card breach in human history. Through careful tinkering of the Microsoft operating system, these hackers managed to penetrate the servers before Microsoft could patch the vulnerability. Once they entered the first Home Depot store near Miami, the hackers worked their way throughout the continent. They secretly observed the payment transactions on over 7000 of the Home Depot self-serve checkout registers. They skimmed credit card numbers as customers paid for their Home Depot purchases. This hack is noteworthy because it was against a monolithic corporation and millions of trusting customers. Spamhaus 2013: the Largest DDOS Attack in History A distributed denial of service attack is a data flood. By using dozens of hijacked computers that repeat signals at a high rate and volume, hackers will flood and overload computer systems on the Internet. In March of 2013, this particular DDOS attack was large enough that it slowed the entire Internet across the planet, and completely shut down parts of it for hours at a time. The perpetrators used hundreds of DNS servers to 'reflect' signals repeatedly, amplifying the flood effect and sending up to 300 gigabits per second of flood data to each server on the network. The target at the center of the attack was Spamhaus, a nonprofit professional protection service that tracks and blacklists spammers and hackers on behalf of web users. The Spamhaus servers, along with dozens of other internet exchange servers, were flooded in this 2013 DDOS attack. This DDOS hack is noteworthy because of the sheer scale of its brute force repetition: it overloaded the Internet's servers with a volume of data that had never been seen before. eBay Hack 2014: 145 Million Users Breached Some people say this is the worst breach of public trust in online retail. Other says that it was not nearly as harsh as mass theft because only personal data was breached, not financial information. Whichever way you choose to measure this unpleasant incident, millions of online shoppers have had their password-protected data compromised. This hack is particularly memorable because it was very public, and because eBay was painted as weak on security because of their slow and lackluster public response. JPMorgan Chase Hack, 2014: (76 + 7) Million Accounts In the middle of 2014, alleged Russian hackers broke into the largest bank in the USA and breached 7 million small business accounts and 76 million personal accounts. The hackers infiltrated the 90 server computers of JPMorgan Chase and viewed personal information on the account holders. Interestingly enough, no money was looted from these account holders. JPMorgan Chase is not volunteering to share all the results of their internal investigation. What they will say is that the hackers stole contact information, like names, addresses, email addresses and phone numbers. They claimed that there is no evidence of social security, account number, or password breach. This hack is noteworthy because it struck at people's livelihoods: where they store their money. The Melissa Virus 1999: 20% of the World's Computers Infected A New Jersey man released this Microsoft macro virus into the Web, where it penetrated Windows computers. The Melissa virus masqueraded as a Microsoft Word file attachment with an email note 'Important Message from [Person X]. Once the user clicked on the attachment, Melissa activated itself and commanded the machine's Microsoft Office to send a copy of the virus as a mass mailout to the first 50 people in that user's address book. The virus itself did not vandalize files or steal any passwords or information; rather, its objective was to flood email servers with pandemic mailouts. Indeed, Melissa successfully shut down some companies for days at a time as the network technicians rushed to clean their systems and purge the pesky virus. This virus/hack is noteworthy because it preyed on people's gullibility and the current state weakness of antivirus scanners on corporate networks. It also gave Microsoft Office a black eye as a vulnerable system. LinkedIn 2016: 164 Million Accounts In a slow-motion breach that took four years to reveal, the social networking giant admits that 117 million of their users had their passwords and logins stolen back in 2012, to later have that information sold on the digital black market in 2016. The reason this is a significant hack is because of how long it took for the company to realize how badly they had been hacked. Four years is a long time to find out you've been robbed. Anthem Health Care Hack 2015: 78 Million Users The second-largest health insurer in the USA had its databases compromised through a covert attack that spanned weeks. Details of the penetration are not being volunteered by Anthem, but they do claim that no medical information was stolen, only contact information and social security numbers. No harm has been yet identified for any of the compromised users. Experts predict that the information will one day be sold via online black markets. As a response, Anthem is providing free credit monitoring for its members. Anthem is also considering encrypting all their data for the future. The Anthem hack is memorable because of its optics: another monolithic corporation fell victim to a few clever computer programmers. Sony Playstation Network Hack 2011: 77 Million Users April 2011: intruders from Lulszec cracked open the Sony database at their Playstation Network, revealing the contact information, logins, and passwords to 77 million players. Sony claims that no credit card information was breached. Sony took down its service for several days in order to patch holes and upgrade their defenses. There has been no report that the stolen information has been sold or used to harm anyone yet. Experts speculate that it was a SQL injection attack. The PSN hack is memorable because it affected gamers, a culture of people who are computer-savvy fans of technology. Global Payments 2012 Hack: 110 Million Credit Cards Global Payments is one of the several companies that handle credit card transactions for lenders and vendors. Global Payments specializes in small business vendors. In 2012, their systems were breached by hackers, and information on people's credit cards was stolen. Some of those users have since had their credit accounts defrauded with dishonest transactions. The signature system of credit cards in the USA is dated, and this breach could have easily been reduced if credit card lenders would invest in using the newer chip cards that are used in Canada and the UK. This hack is noteworthy because it struck at the daily routine of paying for goods at the store, shaking the confidence of credit card users around the world. follow and share. ",
