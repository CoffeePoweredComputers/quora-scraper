            "answer_text": "A lot of aspects of FDR\u2019s (Franklin Delano Roosevelt\u2019s) \u201cNew Deal\u201d would be ruled unconstitutional if enacted today. As they were then, only no one challenged their enactment. The two which I personally thought Donald Trump would reimplement in some form or another \u2014 or at least try to \u2014 as part of keeping his campaign promises, were: PWA/WPA (Public Works Administration/Works Progress Administration) \u2014 These organizations were involved in the construction of public works, such as roads, bridges, and schools.As part of these projects, a lot of the works were what we would consider \u201coverbuilt\u201d.Read that as: not providing an ongoing source of maintenance income, as they required minimal maintenanceMost which were not intentionally demolished are still standing, and still in active use today, requiring only minimal upkeep.CCC (Civilian Conservation Corps) \u2014 This program existed primarily to provide unskilled labor jobs for 18\u201325 year old single men, and was later expanded to 17\u201328 years of age.Most of the people in this program were either dustbowl survivors, or veterans of WW I.The CCC did most of the build-up of infrastructure, and later maintenance, of U.S. National Parks.They also did the grooming of the U.S. National forests, building fire breaks, fire roads, and watch towers, which were later taken over and maintained by the National Parks Service.I think that any PWA/WPA program put in place today would be problematic, as any \u201cinfrastructure renewal\u201d would be as well. The problem with \u201cinfrastructure renewal\u201d projects is that, if they are done correctly, they need only be done once, because civil engineering projects should always, always, always be \u201coverbuilt\u201d. There is a PWA-build Federal Building that is still in use, which is quite famous, because they had to move the entrance from the first floor to the second floor, since initially the entrance was at street level, rather than requiring the use of stairs. The building is so heavy, it has been slowly sinking into the ground, but that has not impacted its structural integrity, and since it\u2019s still level inside... \u201coverbuilt\u201d.  I think the CCC would be a total non-starter. First, almost every project that the CCC completed during its tenure would be rabidly opposed by environmentalists. Even though those environmentalists whose homes burn every year in Southern California, and Washington, and Oregon, in \u201cwildfires\u201d that would be easily preventable through use of CCC techniques. I think also that they would be viewed as sexist, and as discriminatory based on marital status, and age. And that discrimination claim would be largely true: the program was to warehouse soldiers returning from WW I until they could \u201ctrickle out\u201d into the rest of society: it was intended to fade out due to attrition.  So while I personally think it would have been a good idea, the people it would have benefitted most would have screamed the loudest. I also think than any PWA/WPA style program has a limited shelf life \u2014 perhaps a decade \u2014 before those jobs are gone. While that\u2019s better than the DOL (Department Of Labor) definition of a job \u2014 at least 30 hours a week for one year\u2026 yeah, you wonder why \u201cjob creation\u201d numbers are positive for every president, but people are still out of work? \u2014 it\u2019s a short term economic bandage , at best.  So the short answer? Untenable. ",

            "answer_text": "I\u2019m only going to answer this from a narrow angle, specifically about job training. The benefit of job training is something that, as a Democrat, I took for granted for a long time. But when you look closely at the places where unemployment and underemployment are the worst, one of the things you see (at least I did) is that there tend to be severe limitations in the general area. Take Maine, where I lived most of my life. There used to be huge numbers of people employed at paper mills. But one after another, the paper mills closed. In small towns, which Maine has a lot of, a large percentage of the able-bodied population would suddenly be out of work. But the thing was, they were small towns, not near any big population centers. Often there wasn\u2019t even a community college within less than a 2-hour\u2019s drive. And there weren\u2019t a lot of businesses except for mom-and-pop stores, small engine repair shops, things like that. Even if people got themselves trained, there was nothing to come back to work at. People are resilient, and I firmly believe the vast majority want to work, but there\u2019s got to be work for them to do, where they live, for enough money for them to live on. Add to that, not everybody is suited for every job. Can a man who\u2019s worked in the mines for years turn into a car salesman or an IT specialist? Maybe, maybe not. Maybe he\u2019d absolutely hate it. This is such a tricky issue, I honestly don\u2019t know what the solution is. I\u2019m sure job training is a great idea for some people, but there have to be other answers too. I\u2019ll let someone else tackle the issue of whether something like the New Deal (as your link pointed to) could be used today. Personally I don\u2019t think we have that big a problem right now (thank goodness!), although it would be awfully smart if we did get going on the infrastructure. ",
