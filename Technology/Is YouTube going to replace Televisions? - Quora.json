            "answer_text": "No more than any of the other internet-based video delivery services, although they\u2019re trying to be a major player on their user-uploaded cat video base. The word \u201ctelevision\u201d has become something of a humpty-dumpty term, meaning whatever the user wants it to mean. If you want to restrict it to broadcast channels arriving via antenna or cable, you\u2019re welcome to, but if you\u2019re one of those who says \u201cI don\u2019t watch (ew, ick) television, I watch Netflix, Hulu, YouTube, whatever\u201d you need to come to terms with the fact that the technical platform that delivers Friends and South Park to your eyeballs is pretty much irrelevant to whether you \u201cwatch television\u201d or not. \u201cTelevision\u201d is much more meaningful when it\u2019s defined as \u201ca service that delivers commercial video content to viewers\u201d - and doesn\u2019t get into a pointless VHS/Beta level of argument. And no, having no commercials doesn\u2019t make the content non-commercial. On the other hand, the best definition I\u2019ve been able to formulate is this: \u201cTelevision is an audiovisual marketing medium that shows less\u2010overtly-promotional content part of the time..\u201d Which again has nothing much to do with whether it\u2019s big-four broadcast material or torrent flow on a hacked iPad, \u201cad free\u201d or shows discrete commercials, or any other outdated notions of what constitutes \u201ctelevision.\u201d ",

            "answer_text": "YouTube was an early example of a platform whereby people could access videos online. The quality is variable and there are constant issues with copyright. So, although it\u2019s a good place to look for old music videos and excerpts from longer movies or TV shows, it\u2019s much less reliable as a replacement for television. That said, other viewing platforms like Netflix are certainly changing viewing patterns drastically. Over time we are indeed less likely to rely on scheduled programming to watch entertainment and educational television. The old-fashioned channels may have an edge in terms of being the first to show dramas that they themselves commission (like \u201cThe Bodyguard\u201d) but that\u2019s about it. Still, it\u2019s likely that TV will evolve, just as radio has. It\u2019s still the best medium for visual news. And we must also remember that people in many parts of the world have neither the equipment nor the bandwith nor the money to watch anything other than free to air channels. ",
