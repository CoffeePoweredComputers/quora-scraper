            "answer_text": " Credit image: Credit Recently technological giant has been on the news after they were denied access to supply their gadgets to the United States of America and some rumors even suggesting Google was also going to be exempted on all its devices. Trump administration restricted Huawei from doing business with any export industries in America, and the supply of the firm among other organizations. The administration made it clear that Huawei firm poses a significant threat to the national security of America. Huawei, which was a well-established firm which competed competitively with Samsung and Apple had signed many 5G contracts with countries in Europe and some in the Middle East. However, it seems the ban imposed by the Trump administration is likely to affect their business adversely on the rollout of 5G. An imposed ban has made it challenging to buy essential parts from the use of suppliers who are core in the implementation of 5G, and this will lead to its deployment, especially in China.  Hope it helps, OKportal Technology ",
