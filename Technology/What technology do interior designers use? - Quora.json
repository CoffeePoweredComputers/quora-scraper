            "answer_text": "The idea of using AR and VR technology in Interior Designing is simple: completely immersing the user in 360 degrees of visual content to create the impression that the user is in a completely different environment. It is achieved through either VR specific devices, such as Oculus Rift or HTC Vive, or VR head-mounted displays (HMD), such as Google Cardboard and Samsung Gear VR, that turn mobile devices into VR devices. Using VR for interior design produces staggering results. Instead of drawing, explaining, or imagining what a room may look like, people can now put on a VR device and literally walk through different iterations of their future living room. This allows people to see it from every angle, get a sense of the feng shui, and feel assured of what they\u2019re going to invest in.
