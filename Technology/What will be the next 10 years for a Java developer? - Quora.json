            "answer_text": "I am a student of humanities, did my PhD in English literature. I do not have a Maths background; I stopped studying Maths when I was in 10th grade. I was a journalist for six years, before I moved into the wonderful world of computers and programming (for reasons I do not want to get into here). Yes, I have absolutely no programming background. And no, I didn't start with Java. I gave myself an year to even scratch the surface of programming world, just to understand if I would fit into it or not. I took an year off from work, and joined computer courses. I started with C and Unix, learning at the same time fundamentals of programming and trying to understand some essential algorithms. I finished the course in three months, but I have to admit, it took me good six months before I could even make sense of any of the stuff I had studied. Once I was done with C and Unix, I did a few courses in Oracle (SQL and PL/SQL) and Visual Basic - both of these courses I did pretty well, unlike in C and Unix. I also did a course in SQL Server. This was for another six months. These courses and the time I spent on my own to improve my knowledge gave me a pretty good insight into nuances of programming, front end frameworks and the world of databases. I then spent 3 to 4 months trying to apply the knowledge I had gathered - I did a project (unpaid, as an intern) using VB and Oracle. These three months was a harrowing period, but definitely time well-spent - I realised during this time, application was very different from just gathering knowledge. Learning a programming language is very much like learning a language - it is easy to build the vocabulary and understand the syntax. What actually counts is putting it together, and using the language appropriately. These three months on the project helped me realise how to do this. I was, of course, fortunate to be helped in the process by some very helpful friends. It is only after laying a proper foundation did I decide to learn Java. I learnt Java - just the basic syntax for more than a month. I do not agree that 2 weeks is sufficient to become proficient enough to write programs. In my experience I have realised that it takes more than a month to even understand some of the concepts and apply them. And the learning never ends. I believe, you will continue to learn and refine your understanding on the job. But just to be able to be confident enough I would say one should give it at least 3 months. Sure, you can jump into Java directly; but I feel that just being exposed to C and Unix made it easier for me to grasp some of the concepts and nuances of Java. I have to admit I cannot program in C, while I have been working on Java (currently as a senior software architect in a top-notch organization) for almost 15 years now. There are courses online and books offline that claim to teach Java in 21 days. I would say, don't fall for it. You may still learn the syntax in 21 days, but that is not the same as learning a language. If you really want to understand the language you will need at least 1.5 years - to go from nothing to someone who can actually develop an entire application in Java. My estimates may be very conservative, but I would rather err on the side of caution. Finally, I don't believe you need to have a Maths or an engineering background to become a software programmer in Java. Your background doesn't really matter. What you need is dollops of common sense, a logical mind and the determination to work really hard. All the best. ",
