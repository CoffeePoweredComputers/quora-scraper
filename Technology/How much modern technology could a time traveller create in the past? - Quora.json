            "answer_text": "Very little, during his lifetime. There\u2019s a vast gulf between theory and practice, and there are several layers of intermediate technologies between then and now. It\u2019s a tools-to-make-the-tools situation. I know I couldn\u2019t build, for example, a steam engine myself; how well is it going to work if I have to describe one to a member of a society which has only started to figure out gears and hasn\u2019t gotten to ball bearings yet? That said, someone with the right education could introduce a number of ideas and relatively simple technologies which could over time revolutionize technological development. Here are some ideas about what someone could usefully introduce in antiquity: The scientific method. The idea of trying to disprove ideas and celebrating your failure to do so, but it\u2019d put natural philosophy on a firmer footing.Measurement technologies. Good designs for a clock escapement and glass thermometers would provide the right tools to make good use of the above.Clear glass. Renaissance Venetians started making glass clear enough to use for good optics. It\u2019s less a question of technique and more a question of the right locally available materials, so all it really needs is a decent map and knowing to use that sand right there.Forced-draft furnaces. The Romans didn\u2019t know that if you push enough air through a smelting furnace, you could melt iron, and that cast iron could be cooked down to make homogeneous steel. Once they\u2019d worked out designs, this could be a huge boost to industry. Best to talk to them about forestry management at the same time. Deforestation was already an issue because the metal industry ate up so much wood; this would only make things worse.Electromagetism. Magnets were a known phenomenon, but not particularly useful. The next step would be to to show how magnets could be used to make more magnets, and then how magnets combined with wire and motion could be used to make lightning. Tiny bits of lightning, to be sure, but lightning nevertheless.And there are some new ideas and refinements to existing technologies to throw in here: germ theory, saddletrees and stirrups, seed drills, improved gear designs, calculus, metal plows, suspension bridges, fractional distillation, atomic theory (and an explanation of why alchemy just won\u2019t work). Those are things where the idea itself or a not-too-detailed description will probably be sufficient to get someone going, or at least limit the dead ends one might go down.These are all very much plant-a-seed ideas. There\u2019ll be a significant amount of trial and error in taking those ideas and actually making them work experimentally, let alone implementing them on a large scale. The time traveler is unlikely to see most of these ideas bear fruit, but maybe his grandchildren or great-grandchildren might see Roman skyscrapers and electric street lights. ",

Remember that most of the main machinery we have developed over the last century or so was handmade. We often forget that there was a time robotised industry didn't exist and many fine tools, objects and machines were handmade. I would take a longer time and maybe not look as flashy as what we have now, but it would be possible. ",
