For that you get very good snapdragon 636 processor and 4000 mah big battery. In comparison asus zenfone 5 with same hardware but with apple rip off notched display if you liked it cost rm 1300 @ 317 us dollars @ 279 euro with smaller 3300 mah battery. Heck, even value nokia andeoid phone with same hardware nokia x6 cost more than redmi note 5 pro, about 231 $ @ 203 euro. Secondly, good build quality, even low end smartphone from xiaomi have ips display, at least 16, 32 or 64 gigs internal and huge battery. My mi max 2 have 5300 mah battery and lasted at least 3 days use normally. Even entry level redmi 4x have 4000 mah battery\u2026 However, if you live in u.s. or europe, western market coverage is still nil\u2026 warranty issues will arise if you import it from china\u2026 value price will also drops by shipping cost\u2026 So, choose other brand if you live west  ",
