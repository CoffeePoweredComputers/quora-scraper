            "answer_text": "Perhaps you missed the \u201conly\u201d as in only with solar energy. Pretty much every good out there requires some electricity to be made and that electricity can at least be partially provided by solar. However even if you could produce 100% of your electricity with solar, there\u2019s still the process heat part. Many industrial processes require heat. For instance producing pure enough silicon for solar panels require melting the silicon ore. Producing gasoline require heating the oil. So as phrased the answer is yes. But I don\u2019t think that this question as phrased is very useful. ",

            "answer_text": "Most solar factories I have seen use these days solar panels to generate their own electricity but just a few of them are probably self-sufficient. They need their own solar installation for testing their own products, as a good marketing tool for several reasons and to generate own electricity. These days could be theoreticaly the whole supply chain needed for solar energy generation powered by solar energy, if it uses some kind of battery or hydrogen storage or any other kind of smart energy supply for days with higher supply needs than current energy production.
