            "answer_text": "Thanks for the A2A, Deepak There are many differences between smartwatches and smartbands. The choice of which to buy differs from person to person and their usage. Smartband are usually fitness bands, used by fitness enthusiasts, athletes and people who involve in constant physical activities. Smartbands are sleek and slim, and are mostly light in weight which makes them easier and comfortable to wear.Some Smartbands also display calls and notifications. Some of the popular smartbands in India are the Xiaomi Mi Band series, Samsung Gear Fit Series, Fitbit watches and Honor Band series.  Smart watches can be called as mini smartphones. They are bigger than a smartband and have a lot more functionality. It is worth noting that most smartwatches also track our activity like fitness bands. However, unlike smartbands, smart watches are expensive, bigger and comparitively heavier, and they resemble a normal watch. Smartwatches show calls, SMS\u2019s, app notifications and other reminders. Some smartwatches which have mic functionality also allow users to answer calls through the smart watch. Some of the popular smartwatches in India are the Samsung Gear \u2018S\u2019 Series, Samsung Galaxy Watch, Apple iWatch Series, Huami Amazfit series and other manufacturers like Fossil, LG, Casio, Fitbit, Garmin and Huawei.   Which one do you use? I have used many smartwatches and smartbands. I currently use the Amazfit Bip and Xiaomi Mi Band 3, and they are providing excellent results. Both devices provide more than 20 days of battery life and have good functionality.  Hope it answers your question. Cheers! Aadith Sukumar ",

            "answer_text": "Because smartwatcheshave a more complex operating system and features, plus the fact that they have a bigger and better screen, interactivity is much more smooth and advanced than the device than on smart bands. Notifications are also better on smartwatches than on smart bands. ",
