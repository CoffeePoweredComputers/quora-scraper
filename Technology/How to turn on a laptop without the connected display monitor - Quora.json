            "answer_text": "When you turn on your laptop, it will automatically turn the screen on, there is meant to be a display and it will always be turned on unless the connected display is faulty or happens to be disconnected. The question you ask isn't defined enough to understand the reasoning behind it.  Lcd cable is in the picture. If you want to start a laptop without the display coming on, you will have to disconnect the Lcd connector on the motherboard, or if you are using external display, disconnect it. Like I said at the start, it isn't clear from the question why and what exactly you are trying to accomplish but put simply, if you don't want a display, make sure it's not powered/connected. Motherboards dont have an option to turn a display off without you disconnecting the hardware. Go here to have a look at a disassembley of a laptop : LCD screen cable Hope this helps. ",
