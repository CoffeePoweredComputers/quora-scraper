            "answer_text": "The G in 5G means it's a generation of wireless technology. While most generations have technically been defined by their data transmission speeds, each has also been marked by a break in encoding methods, or \"air interfaces,\" which make it incompatible with the previous generation. 1G was analog cellular. 2G technologies, such as CDMA, GSM, and TDMA, were the first generation of digital cellular technologies. 3G technologies, such as EVDO, HSPA, and UMTS, brought speeds from 200kbps to a few megabits per second. 4G technologies, such as WiMAX and LTE, were the next incompatible leap forward, and they are now scaling up to hundreds of megabits and even gigabit-level speeds. 5G brings three new aspects to the table: greater speed (to move more data), lower latency (to be more responsive), and the ability to connect a lot more devices at once (for sensors and smart devices). The actual 5G radio system, known as 5G-NR, won't be compatible with 4G. But all 5G devices, initially, will need 4G because they'll lean on it to make initial connections before trading up to 5G where it's available. 4G will continue to improve with time, as well. The upcoming Qualcomm X20 modem will support 4G speeds up to 2Gbps. The real advantages of 5G will come in massive capacity and low latency, beyond the levels 4G technologies can achieve. That symbiosis between 4G and 5G has caused AT&T to get a little overenthusiastic about its 4G network. The carrier has started to call its 4G network \"5G Evolution,\" because it sees improving 4G as a major step to 5G. It's right, of course. But the phrasing is designed to confuse less-informed consumers into thinking 5G Evolution is 5G, when it isn't. How 5G Works Like other cellular networks, 5G networks use a system of cell sites that divide their territory into sectors and send encoded data through radio waves. Each cell site must be connected to a network backbone, whether through a wired or wireless backhaul connection. 5G networks will use a type of encoding called OFDM, which is similar to the encoding that 4G LTE uses. The air interface will be designed for much lower latency and greater flexibility than LTE, though. The standard will work all the way from low frequencies to high, but it gets the most benefit over 4G at higher frequencies. 5G may also transmit data over the unlicensed frequencies currently used for Wi-Fi, without conflicting with existing Wi-Fi networks. That's similar to a technology that all the carriers except Sprint are currently launching, called LAA. 5G networks are much more likely to be networks of small cells, even down to the size of home routers, than to be huge towers radiating great distances. Some of that is because of the nature of the frequencies used, but a lot of that is to expand network capacity. The more cells you have, the more data you can get into the network. So 5G networks need to be much smarter than previous systems, as they're juggling many more, smaller cells that can change size and shape. But even with existing macro cells, Qualcomm says 5G will be able to boost capacity by four times over current systems by leveraging wider bandwidths and advanced antenna technologies. The goal is to have far higher speeds available, and far higher capacity per sector, at far lower latency than 4G. The standards bodies involved are aiming at 20Gbps speeds and 1ms latency, at which point very interesting things begin to happen. Who's Launching 5G When? AT&T has proclaimed that it will be first with mobile 5G when it launches a network in 12 cities by the end of this year. While it hasn't given details, we think this will be \"millimeter wave\" 5G, which requires dense networks of cells that don't reach very far (say, about 1000 feet each), but deliver extremely high speeds. AT&T's rollout could be slowed by a lack of 5G phones available before 2019, though. Qualcomm has said that 5G phones will be available in 2019, but not before then. AT&T said in early February that it would launch not with phones, but with a \"puck\" that observers are assuming is a mobile hotspot. Verizon is starting out with a fixed 5G home internet service launching in three to five cities in mid 2018. Sacramento will be the first city. This will use home routers with fixed antennas that Verizon will be able to supply, getting around the pesky phone problem. Presumably, this will offer gigabit internet to compete with local cable companies, but you won't be able to tote it around. 5G home internet shows one major advantage over 4G: huge capacity. Carriers can't offer competitively priced 4G home internet because there just isn't enough capacity on 4G cell sites for the 190GB of monthly usage most homes now expect. This could really increase home internet competition in the US, where, according to a 2016 FCC report, 51 percent of Americans only have one option for 25Mbps or higher home internet service. For its part, Verizon told us there wouldn't be 4G-level data caps on home 5G service. 5G home internet is also much easier for carriers to roll out than house-by-house fiber optic lines. Rather than digging up every street, carriers just have to install fiber optics to a cell site every few blocks, and then give customers wireless modems. T-Mobile is taking yet another approach. The company is building a nationwide 5G network on the 600MHz band starting in 2019, with full national coverage by 2020. The low-band network will be supplemented by millimeter wave in large cities, which is the sort of 5G AT&T and Verizon are building out. The speed of a wireless network is tied to how much spectrum you can use for it. Because T-Mobile is only using an average of 31MHz of spectrum at 600MHz as opposed to the hundreds of MHz that millimeter wave networks will use, its low-band 5G network will be a little bit faster than 4G, but not multiple gigabits fast. It will still have the low latency and many connections aspects of 5G, making it usable for gaming, self-driving cars, and smart cities, for instance. In cities, the millimeter-wave network will be super-fast. \"Are we going to see average speeds start to move up by tens of megabits per second? For sure,\" T-Mobile CTO Neville Ray said. \"We would love to see average speeds triple, or move to 100Mbps, but that's a journey that's going to take time in the industry.\" Sprint is preparing to launch 5G smartphones early next year, potentially at Mobile World Congress in February, the company's CTO said. Sprint's 5G will be on the 2.5GHz band, which will give it similar coverage to Sprint's existing 4G LTE network; in fact, it will use the same cell sites. While reports recently surfaced of a federally owned nationwide 5G network, they were quickly shut down by the FCC.

            "answer_text": "First off the number of phones that currently support 5G: 0, ZERO. They have not built the phones because the build out is less than 5% complete. Texas, Wyoming, Sacramento, Miami, Dallas, Seattle,Denver and Washington DC are currently being used to test equipment by your favorite and mine, Verizon. Samsung is playing RF detective in their home town of Seoul Korea. They are practicing with CAR to X 5G which means level 5 autonomous driving cars. The FCC auctioned off the 5G spectrum of millimeter wavelength at 28, 37, and 39 GHz. For phones this does not means better cellular coverage inside of buildings, mmWaves Do Not travels trough walls easier than better than 4G bandwidth. Expect to hear about 10 Gbps at the most 5 Gbps while in motion, ie. driving download speeds. Inside buildings phone to phone file transfer rate of uber fiber 1 Gbps transfer rate. With clear line of sight to local cell towers. All 5G modems will have fallback 4G, 3G and 2G backwards compatibility and in-building performance reliability demands older, longer wave radio waves in order to penetrate through walls, to an extent as I\u2019m sure you all have experienced one time or another. The full realization of the Internet of things is dependent upon a full wide spectrum of radio waves operating on 5G allowing for communication between handset and device such as your smart doorbell, your interior lights, you\u2019re smart HVAC, garage door opener, smart refrigerator and everything else that you have on your smart network will work seamlessly and with less glitches on an upgraded 5G system. That is what the 5G consortium wants us all to believe. The proof will be in the delivery after the build out which will include four times the existing antenna bass that already exists. And yes there is pushback from some in the general population about more Antennas remitting millimeter energy into the general population. Something that some people need to investigate further. Qualcomm has tested a new modem chip, The Snapdragon X50 5G Modem. \u201cHello, World!\u201d: Snapdragon X50 5G modem makes its first 5G data connection [video] | Qualcomm  Isn\u2019t Cute! It\u2019s a tiny chip that\u2019ll blow the doors off a Ferrari like it\u2019s standind still!  This is what happens when have your phone in your hand and your talking and driving. ANY QUESTIONS! Just because we are going to be able to download a 4K movie in 20 seconds doesn\u2019t mean we have to watch it right away now do we? I love Qualcomm just as much as next person and I love Apple just as much. These X50 5G modems WILL be available in 2019. Not 2020, not 2025. Ask Tom Legere, CEO of T-Mobile, he\u2019s been pushing for 5G for awhile now. He and Deutche Telecom the parent company of T-Mobile, bought up Billions of dollars worth of 5G frequency spectrum for the sole purpose of building the First And Biggest 5G Network Coast to Coast and personality I think he has a pretty good chance of being that guy to do it and his T-Mobile ads will only get more audacious.  I love this guy! He tells AT&T and Verizon to drop their rates because They\u2019re ripping off Americans! And if you don\u2019t do it I\u2019ll take your customers and pay for their transfer charges and I\u2019ll give them new iPhones! You assholes! Yes he swears at them on his website. Go to T-Mobile and watch an ad of two. Cell Phones | 4G Phones | iPhone and Android Phones | T-Mobile Also on their website is the Whiteboard Wednesday with the Profit himself Marcus Lemonis who gives a 5 minute business lesson that\u2019s easy to digest and implement in your own business and help you become more profitable. And the best part, it\u2019s completely free! That\u2019s all for now, I\u2019ve gone way overboard on this one. Any more 5G cellar related q\u2019s just reply to the answer or DM me. Take Care, Be Well, Stay Blessed! Terry Edited 9/14/2018: 5G millimeters waves are less powerful and have less penetrating ability through walls. My apologies. ",
