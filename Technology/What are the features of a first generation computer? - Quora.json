            "answer_text": "The first generation (1940\u20131956) used vacuum tubes. Examples are ENIAC, UNIVAC I, IBM 650, IBM 701 etc. According to this list, there were 104 different vacuum tube computers produced between 1942 and 1963. The early relay computers could also be included here (Z3, Harvard Mark 1). They filled large rooms. Punched cards and paper tape were used for input and output initially. 80-column punched cards had already become a standard decades earlier through the use of unit record equipment, primarily manufactured by IBM, which could do sorting, collating and tabulating before computers came along. Punched paper tape was already in use by teletype machines. Line printers, also used as output from mainframe computers, had been used earlier along with punched card equipment. IBM 026 keypunch, introduced in 1949:  Magnetic tape was first used to record computer data in 1951 on the UNIVAC I, and was quickly adopted by IBM as well. Magnetic tape was used as both an input medium (punched cards would be copied onto tape off-line, and then input to the computer much faster than using a card reader), and as a storage medium, much like USB drives today. Densities started at 200 six-bit characters per inch, equivalent to about 2 MB per 7-track 1200 inch long reel. This gradually increased, so by 1973 one could record 170 MB on a 9-track 2400 inch reel at 6250 characters per inch. UNIVAC I, with tape drives in the background:  First generation computers had clock speeds of several hundred kHz to a few MHz. The UNIVAC I had a 2.25 MHz clock. Initial first-generation computers had very little internal read-write memory. ENIAC had none, except for its 20 10-digit accumulators. Other early computers used combinations of electrostatic, mercury delay line, and drum memories. The Whirlwind (1951) was the first use of core memory - a whopping 128 bytes.The IBM 701 (1952) still used 72 Williams tubes, each of which stored 1024 bits (same as 128 bytes in today\u2019s computers), for a total of 9 KB of memory. It rented for $12,000 a month! A later model, the IBM 704 (1954) had 18 KB of core memory. Although very early first-generation computers were programmed in machine language, and later many were still being programmed using assembler, high-level languages were also used. FORTRAN was first introduced on the IBM 709, Lisp first implemented on the IBM 704, and COBOL was available on the UNIVAC II, all first-generation machines. ",
