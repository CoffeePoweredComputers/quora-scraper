            "answer_text": "The technology for fixed satellite connections has mostly apex\u2019ed, I think we might see more Ka-band satellites coming in and bringing more bandwidth but other than that it doesn\u2019t seem likely that there will be big advances there. Also the market for those is being eroded as land-line/fibre broadband roll-out improves and mobile broadband reaches deeper in to rural areas. I think for mobile internet via satellite constellations things look to be advancing with IridiumNEXT and that should make things much faster for those that want to be mobile. I like what O3b are doing and while it is niche, it sets a good foundation for getting internet services to more people. I think as their business grows they might be able to fund innovation around increasing their market potential. I am worried however by the proposals by OneWeb and Elon Musk. Satellite internet cannot compete with land-based and terrestrial RF broadband infrastructure. The economics don\u2019t add up for them to be able to. So the potential customers for mobile satellite broadband are limited and the costs are relatively high. I cannot see terminals costing less than $500 and yet we are talking about a service whose largest demographic aren\u2019t always able to afford new shoes. Oh sure the minerals industries, agriculture, military, government, etc they all want that kind of service. But the segment isn\u2019t huge and Iridium already has a head-start. Either they will kill Iridium (which would be a shame) or they will bankrupt themselves in the process of getting to critical mass, or both. Investment wise? Invest carefully, there will be ups and downs. Career wise? It isn\u2019t a dead end for sure. ",

            "answer_text": "There are probably several usage cases supporting several discrete customer segments: Large rural areas in developed countries can be served using new Ka-band (26.5\u201340 GHz) satellites, like the ViaSat-3 birds slated to launch in 2019 with over 1 Tbps of total capacity per satellite. These will use geosynchronous orbits for predictable uptime, at the expense of higher latency.Lower-bandwidth users in less-developed countries can be served by minisats, potentially in the range of 17\u201323 Gbps of total capacity per satellite. These will use low-Earth orbits for lower latency, at the expense of predictable uptime.Military and certain enterprise customers can be served by visible light communications (430\u2013770 THz) via laser relay, like EDRS\u2019 SpaceDataHighway. These may allow for higher end-user bandwidth and greater physical security, as the beam diameters are far small than those of Ku- and Ka-band systems.Rural retail subscribers will likely remain on usage-capped plans, while enterprises, militaries, and governments would tend to purchase dedicated bandwidth or SLA-backed usage plans as a fail-over/load-balancing strategy. Satellite Internet will likely remain uncompetitive with wireline Internet for most urban residential usage cases. ",
