            "answer_text": "Using the commonly accepted definition of \u201cdrowning\u201d as suffering respiratory impairment, and eventually death, from inhalation of a liquid\u2026 Infected, but still-living beings (28 Days Later, The Crazies, etc.) would eventually drown; if they didn\u2019t retain enough self preservation instinct to hold their breath, or surface for air. If you\u2019re talking about \u201cghouls\u201d or walking corpses (Night of the Living Dead, The Walking Dead, Return of the Living Dead, etc), they would not drown. They may or may not take in water, causing them to sink to the bottom; but there would be no asphyxiation. One would THINK that oxygen deprivation would cause damage to the brain, and disable the corpse as much as any bullet or blunt force trauma. But if we suppose that the brain has ALREADY been deprived of oxygen for an extended period, from a lack of breathing and a lack of functioning circulatory system, we are left with the assumption that some unknown force, other than oxygen, is fueling brain cell activity.

            "answer_text": "It depends a lot on whether the author/creator wants them to swim or not. In World War Z (Book), as I recall, the zombies could basically walk under water much like the skeleton pirates in the first Pirates of the Caribbean movie. In Fear the Walking Dead, our group survivors encounters zombies floating in the water. This makes sense to me, as dead bodies do float (as evidenced recently, unfortunately, by events in Rio). Those floating zombies are still dangerous and try to bite when humans are near; the water doesn\u2019t seem to stop that. It seems to me that if there was to be \u201caccuracy\u201d here (and I put that in quotes because hey, we\u2019re talking about zombies) the zombies should float since they are dead bodies. But if an author wants them to sink, I\u2019m sure a plausible reason could be given for that. ",

            "answer_text": "Hi Joel, this will depend on what type of apocalypse we've gotten ourselves into. There are many types but as most likely, I'm sure The Walking Dead does a pretty good job at portraying the ideal and most realistic zombie. But to answer your question, there's a few scenes that I can remember from past episodes in TWD where the governor(a antagonist in a sense) tied a zombie to the bottom of a lake. He stood above on the surface watching it try and reach him. It was not drowning or choking because it was already dead, it purely wanted to eat him. Zombies are essentially dead beings unless of course like we discussed before we have a different type of apocalypse. ",

            "answer_text": "I guess it all depends on which zombie apocalypse you're reading or watching. I'll answer based on Robert Kirkman and his comics and series The Walking Dead and Fear the Walking Dead. Yes, they are just as dangerous in water as they are on land. The don't swim as the living would but they just float along until they encounter something living and then tear it to shreds. If you're interested in seeing how walkers function in water watch episodes 1-4 Season 2 of Fear of the Walking Dead. ",
