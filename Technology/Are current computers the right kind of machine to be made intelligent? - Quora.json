            "answer_text": "I maybe straying a bit off topic but still....I dunno about current computers but the current Web is definitely the right kind of thing to be made intelligent and you can leverage upon it to make your machine intelligent. What would be really cool is that if you could devise a way to perform all your intensive and exhaustive calculations and computations to make your machine intelligent on a Cloud platform and get the results back so that your machine can manipulate and access them to become really smart!.....and Voila! there you have a simple yet very intelligent machine !Hope i didn't stray too far off.....

            "answer_text": "Yes and no. All computations that have been observed so far in human brains can be reproduced on computers. Yet some researchers in artificial intelligence consider the Von Neumann architecture as a computational and architectural bottleneck for artificial intelligence. For example, IBM's SyNAPSE project aims to design computing chips that map closer human brain functions. ",

The holographic-like method the brain uses for memory recall is one of the areas that may challenge current technology. Progress is being made in quantum computing, a technology that holds the potential to perform the highly parallel functions that are likely needed. ",
