            "answer_text": "Some developing countries like India are now labelled as emerging markets and there is an increasing consciousness of research to improve the country\u2019s brand, driving education to set higher levels of attainment. Many of the developing countries are Islamic states where education has a religious bias and there is inadequate scope for creating a band of academics who would contribute substantially to the research efforts of those countries. Black African countries and other nations with despotic leaders pay little attention to the quality of education in their countries. Zimbabwe was once prosperous, she is now reduced to penury so professionals leave for greener pastures and develop their skills in the developed world. Venezuela sits on the largest oil resources in the world, is in a sorry state and by the time she comes out her pathetic state, oil would not be a strategic commodity, research in the development of alternatives would have considerably reduced her worth. The developed world however, focuses on increasing productivity, so constant and continuous research is essential and that is epitomised in the educational curriculum. ",

            "answer_text": "I have taught in four countries. Teo \u201cdeveloped\" and two \u201cdeveloping\". In the latter we had no resources no books, no equipment, crowded classrooms (in my first school, we sat on the ground under a tree, before we were able to find somewhere else). Struggles to find the money for fees, students being sent home because they had not paid their fees for three weeks - particularly girls, as it was (wrongly) thought boy's education was more important than girls. In the other two countries, resources abound students take them for granted, and waste inordinate amounts of time complaining. ",
