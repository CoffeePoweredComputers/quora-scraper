            "answer_text": "Your fears are totally valid but........ A Short Story:-I had the same fears before buying Micromax Canvas HD (A116).  I was in Third year of my college life, I made up my mind that I will buy Canvas HD. My friends thought I am taking a big risk trusting Micromax. Yes, it was a risk but to my relief it turned out to be an excellent phone. People actually came to my room to check out my phone and after reviewing it for several minutes (i.e playing Subway Surfer to check if it runs smoothly or not) gave the verdict its better than wasting your money on Samsung Grand etc. By the end of the semester my roommate also bought one.  Going Back to the question....   I would advise the following points:- 1.  Buy Micromax only if your budget is between 5K-10K. Because above 10K you have many better options such as Xiaomi, Motorola etc, above 20K OnePlus, HTC etc and so on. 2. Buy from an e-commerce website such as Flipkart, Amazon etc with 30 day replacement guarantee. You can return it if you don't like the phone.  3. You can trust Micromax because it has a brand image to protect especially after going ahead of Samsung. Even if the phone turns out to be faulty then don't worry that's what point number 2 is for.   4. Read the reviews before making any decision and check for the after sale services.  Conclusion: Micromax is a good company that is why Asin is marrying Rahul Sharma. What I don't like about the company is they haven't been bold enough to start developing their own products, but that has nothing to do with this question.  You can totally buy Micromax its Nothing Like Anything. ",
