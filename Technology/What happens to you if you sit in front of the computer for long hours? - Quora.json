            "answer_text": "It is advisable to take leave of your seat while in front of the computer after say 25 to 40 minutes. Go away and take a look at the environment, walk a little, enjoy nature for say 3 minutes then return. Staying too long glued to your seat in front of a computer may cause eye sight problems. You may develop short sight. If you are using a CRT monitor without shield, you may be also exposed to low level emissions of the CRT tube; though this is not so serious, it can cummulate. In addition, seating too long is not good for your heart. Walk a little every once a while to get some circulation going and some oxygen into your lungs. Furthermore, seating too long may reduce your mental acuity as your body may begin to slow down and get drowsy in addition to other effects. ",
