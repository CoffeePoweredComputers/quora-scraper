            "answer_text": "Yes and no. Every movie you see is in actuality a large amount of pictures shown in rapid enough succession to trick your eyes into seeing one continuously moving image. That much is 100% correct. What isn't right, is the part about photos. Videos shot with cameras are basically bunches of photos if you reduce them down to their still images. However, there have also been entire movies put together with animation, a process where an artist either draws the necessary images by hand or uses a computer to create three-dimensional models.  What, did you think that Disney actually took pictures of a mouse in order to make Mickey's cartoons? ",

            "answer_text": "Yes it is. fps (frame per second) refers to the amount of \"frames\" or pictures that get swapped across a single second on a video, have you seen those old film rolls used on the cinema? where the entire roll is pictures? like that, but virtually right now. 24 pictures per second is the minimum necessary for the human brain to recognize the series of pictures as a video, and as a result to reduce costs, movies have used that standard even on this day and age. However, the more pictures per second you add, the more \"smooth\" the video will look. 24 fps vs 12 fps sample.  30fps vs 60fps sample  Thank you, Hope that answer your Q ",
