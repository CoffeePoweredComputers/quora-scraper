            "answer_text": "Yes, there are alternatives.  But first think about how does a signal get from the Internet to you - it has to travel over something.  What are two somethings most homes have?  Phone lines and Cable TV lines.  Therefore, they're the two most prevalent. Alternatives would be some other kind of line - like fiber which Lee Nelson mentioned.  This is being deployed to some municipalities, but it's very hit or miss.  I live in a large metropolitan area - we don't have fiber.  Lee is a \"rural telco\" and they are deploying fiber.  Fiber Optic cable is capable of \"tremendous\" amounts of bandwidth as he mentioned but is expensive to deploy - so providers would have to lose a lot of money to put it in, or charge a lot of money to its users - which is why it's pretty uncommon.Other alternatives would be wireless.  Wireless signals will be some spectrum of electro magnetic radio waves - microwave, infrared, radio, etc.  Radio is more commonly known in their marketing terms \"wifi\" and \"wimax\".  However, terrestrial radio (land based) is limited by signal strength, with line of site being preferred.  Other radio connections would require a satellite to bounce the signal off of.Hope this helps. ",

            "answer_text": "I take some exception to the comment \"cable TV and line phone companies will continue to interfere with the development of video streaming services\".  I work at a rural telco that is also an IPTV service provider.  We offer DSL speeds up to 26Mbps (downstream to the user) with 6Mbps being our most common offering.  Additionally, we offer Fiber to the Prem.  I live in a community in rural Montana with less than 700 residents, but we all have fiber to our homes running at GigE (1000Mbps) speeds. On Fiber, we offer the same Internet speeds that we offer on DSL, in addition to bandwidth for IPTV and VoIP.  A typical IPTV subscriber is getting around 18Mbps of service from us.  This is becoming common in rural and independent telco markets.  If 2Mbps seems like a dream to you, then that is a problem with your service provider and the technology they are using, not a problem with the phone company industry as a whole or with available technology.
