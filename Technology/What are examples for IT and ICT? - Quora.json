            "answer_text": "IT and ICT are often used interchangeably by those in the computer industry, but these terms are different in definition. IT stands for Information Technology and ICT stands for Information Communication Technology. The difference between IT and ICT is the concepts that the terms cover. ICT is simply a specific area of IT. The concepts covered within ICT are part of the IT industry but not all IT concepts are covered by the term ICT. It is important to remember this when using the terms both professionally and academically, especially when referring to specific concepts that may fall under one term but not the other. ",
