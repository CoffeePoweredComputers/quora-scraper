            "answer_text": "Instructional technology has many advantages, but the most important is its ability to transform the teaching and learning process. By transform, we mean that it allows both teachers and students to do what they were unable to do before. Examples are indeed numerous, including the realtime response systems mentioned by Olivia De Hennin in another response, though there are many more substantial examples. The problem we tend to see with the use of technology in education - and the reason it is not having the impact we want - is, as Kevin Wilcoxon points out in another response, that people tend to simply replace what they are already doing with technology, rather than understanding and taking advantage of its affordances.

            "answer_text": "Technology is a tool. As such, it can be used wisely or poorly. Much of the instruction using technology is just delivering the same old methods in electronic form. For instance, lecture has proven to be the least effective form of instruction. Yet, everyone wants to put their lectures on video. ",
