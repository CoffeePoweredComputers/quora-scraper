            "answer_text": "I think it's not phobia, just an uneasy feeling that, \u201csomething's not right with that person\u201d. So the context is, of course, computer-animated human. We know it's not real. But as it gets more and more human-like, subconsciously we start to measure what we see against our concept of how a human should look like/act. And at this point in time, computer-animated humans still have some imperfections. And that causes us to think, \u201csomething's not right with that person\u201d rather than \u201cwow this animation is so lifelike\u201d. And that's why animation powerhouses like Disney, Pixar, and Dreamworks purposefully designed their characters with \u201ccartoony\u201d qualities: To stay away from the uncanny valley. ",

            "answer_text": "Most people have not been exposed to situations that might have an Uncanny Valley effect. Where it does happen, it\u2019s more an impression that \u201csomething doesn\u2019t smell right here\u201d \u2026 it seems a bit weird. For now, the Uncanny Valley idea is not a term about a widespread and psychological phenomenon, it is a somewhat subtle idea about aesthetics and feeling, circulated among technologists and especially, designers. They have different sensitivities than the general public. ",
