            "answer_text": "What\u2019s my opinion on an all electric Hummer?  The Irony I find it interesting how 15 years ago a Hummer being driven in certain parts of town were so looked down upon as being environmental polluters, to now see them about to be resurrected and transformed into the apex boutique luxury electric brand, the ultimate symbol of both luxury and enviro-consciousness while being the new crown jewel of the GM portfolio! When GM re-ramps and rolls out its iconic and now sacred all terrain monster, not only is orange the new black, but Cadillac becomes the new Oldsmobile, and Hummer becomes the new pinnacle brand of General Motors. My only disagreement is that Cadillac should be selling Hummers too not just GMC. I just hope GM learned their lesson from Cadillac and not make the same mistakes. Let me explain. The Dilemma There was a time when the pinnacle luxury brand of the Auto House got first digs at new technology. At VW Group it isn\u2019t Bentley but Audi who was once in charge of technology as that torch was passed to Porsche. But all these brands have good reputations I could see why VW is willing for the brands to share. For Ford it was always Lincoln. And for GM it was for Cadillac. Not anymore. When Ford was making plans for the first full production all electric Ford vehicle, they knew the BEV truck could not be a Lincoln as tradition would call it. Instead it had to be something else unique about Ford that they decided to subbrand Mustang. Smart move, although I couldn\u2019t completely understand it until I saw the vehicle with my own eyes at the LA Auto Show. Then I got it. And Hummer too. For the same reasons why Mach E couldn\u2019t be a Lincoln at first is why GM\u2019s first full production all electric vehicle can\u2019t be a Cadillac. It had to be something else, and because the Lincoln and Cadillac brands are burnt out toast with butter, both makers had to be creative to search elsewhere for a unique brand. Ford\u2019s solution was to make Mustang a luxury performance brand with a portfolio so far of two vehicles. GM has four brands and while they\u2019ve done a phenomenal job elevating GMC from a brand that once supplied body frames for school buses and dump trucks into a luxury step-in brand next to Oldsmobile, for years, decades, they pissed all over Cadillac and GM with guilt knows it did. They regret it. And GMC is not luxurious enough. GM needs a brand to sit on top of Cadillac. GMC can hold the seat for the boutique like it once did with Hummer, but the boutique must brand itself on its own. GM went searching. The Search: The Car Dating Connection I\u2019m so glad the mad lab doctor of car batteries and love, Dr. Scaringe, CEO of Rivian, saw right through GM when they went flirting with each other on dates about two years ago. Dr. Scaringe was either briefed by his peeps, or knew as a car nut well enough about what GM was capable of doing to acquisition brands: Olds, Saab, Cadillac, Opel, Holden, Vauxhall, I could go on. Besides having a great battery technology company, the handsome young Clark Kent mad lab doc has the right vehicle in the right market at the right time. Rivian truly is where Rolls Royce once was 100 years ago when they were building both cars for the rich and power plants for everything else, a high tech company it was considered at the time and still is. Almost like a gigalo, a really smart one, he even took GM\u2019s money as an investment. In the end with a charming smile, the doc said, \u201cthanks, but no thanks,\u201d and walked away from collaboration even a possible one day merger. Smart move. The fit would be better with Ford, but here\u2019s the reason why both went to the doc to make Rivian a boutique brand. Why a Hummer If you were going to Orlando Disney World and landed at the airport with a Hertz reservation for a Chevy Impala but could get a cheap upgrade to a Cadillac Sedan D\u2019Ville, wouldn\u2019t you prefer the Cadillac? And for many of us that would be the first time we\u2019ve driven a Caddy to experience that floaty boulevard ride and the supple leather or velour sofa seats. It truly is like going to see Mickey Mouse from and in your living room! But once your done with it would you want to buy one? What\u2019s so unique about a Cadillac? Everyone can drive one you can even rent one at the airport? That was the problem with Fleetwood and Town Car, even the iconic Lincoln Continental. They became car whores. When was the last time you saw a Bentley Continental at Hertz? Bentley is an Auto House, not a house of airport ill repute! That was the problem with Ford and GM. So after decades of volume and fleet sales and airport rentals, and awful build quality through the 80s and 90s, no one wanted a car from the first Ford Motor Company, that\u2019s Cadillac by the way. When the two Henrys, Ford and Leland, clashed, one went to make another Ford, then a Lincoln, that\u2019s Mr. Ford, and the other, Mr. Leland, took Ford and made a Cadillac. Got it? Now back to Hummer.  Hummer is useful to GM once again because electromobility now excuses Hummer from being a pig brand, and they desperately need a boutique brand to sit on top of Cadillac. With Tesla Cybertruck, and Land Rover, Bentley, and Rolls Royce soon to be there, and with Robert Bollinger\u2019s boutique monster truck and Rivian already entering the market, a new electric pickup truck and utility segment is emerging in the $75,000+ price point. Expect moderately equipped to range from $80,000 to past $150,000+. This segment will have the best equipment to go all terrain and most of them will have ranges beyond 300 miles. They will also go boutique with camping, terrain, towing, hiking, bicycling, ATV equipment blah blah blah to fill and enhance your adventure. In a brown or blackout you can plug your truck in to have power for the house or for a dead BEV battery. You can even go to the Home Depot and look like you know what you\u2019re doing. And you can still drive the kids to school as they tell you drop them off in front, not the back, as even you will look cool too!  What This Means for GM: Cadillac is the New Oldsmobile An electric Hummer brand is a game changer for both electromobility and GM. This debut truck will use the same frame used for Escalade and GMC Sierra/Yukon and Chevy Silverado/Suburban. This takes the pressure off of my girl Escalade, as she now has options to go upmarket if GM still wants her to, or use Hummer to go upmarket and compete with everyone else. Cadillac brand with Escalade now becomes the default Oldsmobile and from my generation, that is not a bad place to be. Cadillac proves that being on top all the time ain\u2019t all that! Long before there was such a thing as a Lexus or even a Jaguar in a driveway, if you lived in suburbia and had a Mercury Marquis Brougham, or a Chrysler Newport convertible or Imperial or New Yorker sedan, a Buick Electra 225, or an Oldsmobile 98 Regency Brougham in your driveway, it meant you were doing well. This is where Cadillac now is. She\u2019s an old girl. She is such a part of Americana she deserves this place for the ages. We should not be so quick to get rid of Cadillac. Trust me on this, America. There was a time when Rolls Royce was the crap brand with 6 cylinder no auto or a/c, no full power, tilt, cruise, this was back in the 1950s. It was Cadillac that started V8, auto, air, full power, tilt, and cruise. It now passes the gauntlet in electric form to Hummer. Ironically Hummer was once there too when she was shown the door to the Land of Car Brand Extinction. Not many brands return. If orange is the new black, these young kids will find contrition in Cadillac as they climb the corporate ladder. They almost did in the 2010\u2019s. It\u2019s now up to GM to nurse her back to some state of health she once had. And Hummer of all brands, can help her. Cadillac can become the even greater Oldsmobile. And we don\u2019t need Cutlass or Vista Cruiser! Escalade, XT6, and XT whatever will suit us fine for Wally Wagons.  The Ironic Most Important Feature of Electric Hummer And finally, the most convincing reason why electric Hummer makes for a compelling choice as a resurrected brand: I don't care how rich or poor you are. Nobody likes to spend $100+ a tankful for their Hummer or Escalade, regardless of vintage. Can you imagine owning the same Hummer or Escalade that regardless of model year in gas version is a $100 tankful but the electric version will cost pennies on the dollar every 400 mile full charge. Amazing. I just better not see not one Hummer at the airport car rental counter that we sadly saw with Cadillac. I say give Cadillac a break. She shouldn\u2019t be there either. That\u2019s what Buick and GMC is for, let them do airport transfers! Just my two cents. I hope I served you well. Safe driving.

            "answer_text": "The Hummer re-spin as an electric is not wise. The styling of the Hummer is that of a brick with even harder edges. That means the energy wasted pushing air out of the way at highway speeds will be greater, which in turn means the range will stink compared to the battery cost. In the face of self-driving the pickup truck concept is done. The bed will be one vehicle and the cab will be a separate self-driving vehicle. The people carrying cab will be smooth riding legally and safely going 180 mph. The bed autonomous vehicle will haul up to 10,000 pounds of objects and the suspension will be matched to the heavy loads perfectly. The traditional pickup truck that shares the frame has always been a poor compromise between carrying the load and bouncing the dentures out of the driver and passengers. Connecting the failure of the Hummer to electric is possibly a repeat of the EV1 where they had an almost EV and managed to add just enough bad design decisions to make it publicly fail then go away. They should offer an Edsel all-electric at Ford for all the same reasons. This new Hummer has no real attachment to the military diesel Hummer other than the text font. If GM wanted to help they would make pollution free vehicles that solve traffic congestion. ",
