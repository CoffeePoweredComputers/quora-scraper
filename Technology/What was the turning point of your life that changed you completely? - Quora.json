            "answer_text": "My life changed last Sunday, August 4, 2019. A little background first\u2014I\u2019m kidding. I am as verbose as they come on Quora. Here\u2019s a lot of background first. My paternal grandfather, Virgil Stephen (nicknamed Big Steve) had polio in one of his arms and had limited use of it. That didn\u2019t stop him. In the short time I knew him, he was always attentive to his grandchildren. He had created toys out of nothing but a few boards, other scrap toys, and old aerosol cans. One of the toys is a handmade wooden box truck with wood wheels. Supposedly, my dad learned to walk by pushing that toy truck. I have it as one of my prized possessions. My paternal grandmother meant well and did the best she could but I didn\u2019t have the same relationship with her. In about 1975, our family was driving from our small Iowa town to the nearby county seat for my dad, Richard Stephen (nicknamed Little Steve) for a doctor appointment. As we were turning the corner at one of the major intersections, my mom and dad noticed the doctor turning and heading the opposite direction toward our town. We all thought it was a little odd but not so much as to be alarmed. As we headed south on a major two lane US highway, we came upon an accident of a produce box truck and a maroon colored car crashed up an embankment. I commented that it looked like Grandpa\u2019s car but my parents weren\u2019t sure. My dad had been a city councilman for our small town. He had been deputized and had ridden shifts with both our town police as well as several county sheriffs deputies. So, as we were slowly going past the accident, my dad stopped to ask one of the deputies about the accident. The deputy almost looked like he had seen a ghost and tried to move us along with the rest of the traffic. We proceeded to the doctor appointment. I don\u2019t remember some of the other details until my dad came back out to our car. My dad never cried as long as I could remember. He got in the car and said something about the fact that I thought the car in the accident was Grandpa\u2019s car. It was. My dad explained the following: As my dad went into the doctor office, they immediately ushered him into one of the rooms. After a wait, the doctor arrived. The reason the doctor was heading to our town was to try to tell us that Grandpa had been in the accident and had died as a result of the crash. The driver of the produce truck had to switch gas tanks as the primary tank was low on fuel. Instead of stopping to do this, he thought he could do it while traveling 55\u201360 mph. He had a jacket or shirt covering the tank switch. While reaching down to move the shirt and find the tank switch, the driver took his eyes off the road. In that instant, his truck crossed the center line. My grandfather, Virgil Stephen, couldn\u2019t react in time and died in the crash. I lost my Grandfather that day without being able to say goodbye or that I loved him. My grandmother continued to live in her home several years until we had concerns for her physical and mental health. She moved into a retirement community near the nursing home in our town. Call it the home before the home. We noticed over time that she was losing her memory or things just weren\u2019t quite clicking like they used to. An example was that she knew to reheat leftovers on the stove but not that she should take it out of the Tupperware container and put it in a metal pan. Gradually it progressed to the point she needed to move to the nursing home. Her physical health had its moments but lasted better than her mental health. Basically, she had Alzheimer\u2019s disease. It was tough for me at the time in high school to deal with this. How do you talk to someone that can\u2019t respond. Some days you see a glimpse that they react when they\u2019ve remember who you are and others they are just a shell of a body living only in the physical sense. Despite the safeguards the nursing home had in place, my Grandma would find ways to wander away. One time, my high school baseball team arrived back at our school from a road game. One of the police or firemen stopped before we could get off the bus and asked if we would be willing to help. The officer explained that someone had wandered away from the nursing home and they wanted our help to drive around town searching for the person. I asked if it was my Grandma and the officer confirmed it was. I didn\u2019t have a car at the time so I rode with a teammate. Before that, I advised the officer to get an ATV and check the fence rows of the bean fields west of the nursing home. Yes, the nursing home was at the edge of a rural town with fields next to it. Eventually, they found her at the far end of a field, basically unscathed except for a few scratches. Eventually, her health declined and she died of Alzheimer\u2019s. Some may argue that Alzheimer\u2019s isn\u2019t the official cause if death and they may correct. It could be heart attack, stoke or something else. Yet again, I had a grandparent die without me being able to tell them goodbye. Now back to why my left fe changed on August 4. My dad became a successful businessman despite no college degree. He worked in the lumber and construction industry. He pounded nails on construction crews, managed lumber yards, sold prefabricated homes, and eventually built his own successful home inspection business. He knew how to work the realtors, their admin assistants, etc. to build business relationships. He became the top home inspector in a market of 130,000 people and sold it 20+ years later. About the time he sold the business, he was diagnosed with early onset of dementia. I have started to see his memory fade. He\u2019ll tell the same story multiple times\u2014I know we all do over the years, just not multiple times in a day. Last weekend my parents flew from Iowa to visit our family in Chicago before our kids went back to school. We had a good weekend and it was great to see my parents interact with my kids. While navigating through O\u2019Hare\u2019s TSA security lunes\u2014they can be harrowing for even the most experienced traveler\u2014my dad was stopped because he just has a paper ID. With the change in security for state drivers licenses, they are now issuing a paper copy immediately and then printing a more secure copy centrally and mailing it. Unfortunately, my dad hadn\u2019t yet received the plastic copy yet. A TSA agent proceeded to start asking my dad questions about his ID to validate that it was his. Here\u2019s where my life changed. My dad couldn\u2019t remember his own birthday or the year he was born. He knew the month but not the day. He\u2019s know that he was 75+ years old d but that was about it. I knew this day was going to come. But not then! Not there! I\u2019m can be stubborn, emotionless just like my dad and don\u2019t show emotions often. I am writing this with tears streaming down my face. Unfortunately, I know that this tends to be genetic or hereditary. My day will come where it hits me too unless a dramatic breakthrough is found in the next 20 years. Multiple concussions in sports don\u2019t help, either. I can only hope that a cure is found before it impacts a fourth generation in our family\u2014my children. I will start scheduling more trips to Iowa to visit my parents and say goodbye in the best way I can while my dad still remembers me and spend as much time with my wife and family while I can remember them. For TLDR, didn\u2019t get to say goodbye to grandparents. Grandfather died in car accident, grandmother died of Alzheimer\u2019s. Father has dementia and couldn\u2019t remember his own birthday. I see signs that dementia or Alzheimer\u2019s may already be impacting me. Cherish every moment with your family. ",

            "answer_text": "My parents\u2019 divorce I hesitated at first to put my response here because it got quite long and it is not nearly as exciting as some other responses that I\u2019ve read. ButI still put it in here, because sometimes, even minor things, can form a big avalanche, which will in a more slow way change everything completely. About this time last year I was taking a break in between two badminton games when my phone rang and I saw \u201cDad\u201d on my display. I knew immediately what it was about. My parents almost never call me except it was about something really important. Prior to his phonecall the relationship between my parents had been increasing in tension over the last two years. Coming home felt like the cold war to me. My mother was either crying or had red puffy eyes. My father usually sat uncomfortably in his chair and talked about work without my mother showing any sort of interest. When I asked if I could help or do anything my mother would say:\u201d That\u2019s nice of you but I can\u2019t talk about it\u201d I was almost 21 at the time and felt that I was old enough to get to know what was going on. But I never did and the situation started to almost annoy me. I kind of even wished they would divorce. Then I had to choose between studying at a university close to my hometown and one at the other edge of my country and I choose the later. Moving out wasn\u2019t easy because I moved from one uncomfortable place to another. To save money I lived in an apartment which I shared with a family of three people, four dogs and two cats. I was as scared of the dogs as they were of me and it was for all of us a very uncomfortable experience. But at the time, going \u201chome\u201d was just as uncomfortable, so I made university my new home. I practically lived in the library, always studying, studying, and studying. In a way, going to university set me free from one cage and put me in the next one. I also had another cage which was language. My mother tongue is German but I studied at a French University. My French at the time was still very standard and basic and I wasn\u2019t always able to understand my peers. With difficulty I tried to explain how lonely I felt, how difficult it is and that I just would like to be able to live at a place without four dogs barking at me every time I do a move. But my friends were busy with their own problems and at some point I just stopped even trying to talk about my feelings. At this time, my badminton training was my personal highlight of the week. I saw my friends (not the same as in Uni) and we had a great time. It was at that time that my father called me. He said that he is sorry for not fulfilling his duty as a parent and that he and my mother are going separate ways from now on. He said that it is not our fault and that the reason why they are going to divorce is certainly not because one of them had cheated with another partner. I said that it\u2019s okay, things like that can happen and that I am happy when they are happy. And I meant what I said. I still think that going separate ways was the best solution for all of us. My father said that the divorce was because of \u201cirreconcilable differences\u201d. I thought that this meant that after 38 years of marriage, they simply could no longer stand each other\u2019s quirks anymore. My father had always been a very conservative person and my mother slightly more open to new information, so that maybe this could be the point of no return. But I could not have been more wrong. For everybody this divorce was a big surprise. I had seen it coming but even my brother who still lived with my parents had been very surprised. Apparently he and my father cried for about an hour when he told my brother it was over. The following week I got a text from my godfather telling me how surprised he was since my parents:\u201d Had always treated each other with so much care and goodwill\u201d. This is how everybody including us children saw the relationship of our parents. I always saw my parents as the perfect couple and perfect parents. They treated us equally, didn\u2019t love us any more or any less when our school marks weren\u2019t the best. I saw my family as perfect. Unlike many other teenagers I never rebelled against my parents or their values. Today, I think that was a mistake. Being difficult and making trouble is a way to find your identity. Maybe you can do that without causing a bit of trouble and being \u201cannoying\u201d but I think that without this rebellion I missed an opportunity to gain independence. Well, at the time I was bullied at school and it would have been difficult to also causing trouble at home. I simply couldn\u2019t afford not having my parents\u2019 back. Fast forward, a bit over half of a year later at the beginning of this summer, I finally got my parents to tell me, my younger brother and my older sister, why they actually split up, divorced, got their own paths. It had been bothering me that my father would tell me stuff like:\u201d You know when we had \u201cdifferences of opinions\u201d and we talked it out, I thought it was over. But your mother, is bringing old stuff again and again.\u201d So, I thought: \u201cOh, mom\u2019s being difficult because of her menopause\u201d I wasn\u2019t mad at her for that, but I just thought, she could no longer put up with him, he would still love her and wants to be with her. This is how my father also informed our neighbors. I didn\u2019t know at that time, how important his image was to him, that he even had to inform our neighbors about it \u201cSo that they don\u2019t get the wrong idea\u201d. On the other hand, my mother said things like:\u201d I thought it\u2019s going to be hard for me to look at family photos, but it actually isn\u2019t. Because he did it back then too. He lied to me from the very beginning of our marriage. He is not the man I thought he was. The man I married has never even existed.\u201d This beating around the bush really angered me. I considered myself old enough to get to know what actually caused this breakup. I never actually considered a \u201cit is simply not my business\u201d as an option. I think, I should have been more respectful to my parents but I am still glad I know the reason now. We gathered around a table and my father started to talk first. We agreed that every parent would share their viewpoint, so that there would be no fight. Not that we expected a fight, because my parent simply never had one in front of us, but just in case. My father introduced his mini speech by saying that whatever he says today, he still wants us to see him as our father. \u201cI hope you guys can still love me and I hope you can promise me that\u201d He looked at us, awaiting our response. I don\u2019t exactly remember how we reacted but I think I said something like that he would always be our Dad no matter what. He then continued by saying:\u201d I spend a lot of time with myself, looking at pictures and when one is busy with himself the significant other might feel like they are being betrayed. And then, your mom has even caught me red handed and she had enough\u201d After he had finished, I was left confused. I thought to myself:\u201d Wait, so he had watched porn and my mom felt betrayed? How is that possible, it\u2019s just porn? What\u2019s the big deal? Guys watch porn, so what?\u201d Then my mother started to speak. She said:\u201d I want to clarify certain things here: Your father had been watching porn, or however you want to call it, multiple hours a day. At best, we had sex once a month, sometimes it was even once a year. I am not prudish, I would have liked to have more sex, but your father said he isn\u2019t in the mood because he is stressed out because of work, because of finances, because the children are noisy etc. I tried to handle everything, do as many task I could, hoping he\u2019d feel better and we could finally sleep with each other. But then he lost himself in front of the TV screen again and again. I was waiting in bed, and he would masturbate in front of the TV, then go to the toilet, then go back to the TV and start all over. \u201c After that talk a lot of things broke in me. They didn\u2019t break all at once. But, gradually the image I had of our family life, of how our life was structured, what my father said, why he said certain things\u2026the more I started to think, the more things came into my mind, and I started to question everything that had been deemed as \u201cnormal\u201d in our family. Maybe this connection between what happened between my parents and my life is not as obvious to others as it is to me but this rupture in the perfect image I had, caused questioning and eventually lead to the rebellion I never had done before. I analyzed the countless racist, homophobic and sexist jokes, comments and remarks my father made frequently. That they might not be an expression of love, or a preparation for our future in the \u201creal world\u201d how he called it. Why he didn\u2019t want to be seen with my mother in public. Why he felt the need to flirt with other women. I started to challenge the way he socialized. I questioned the fact that he was always so tired and prone to stress. That his boss has always been an asshole (he would call him \u201crams\u2019 testicles\u201d, I have to admit that this expression just makes me laugh, every time he says it.) That it had always been him talking about his problems. In all those years my mother never talked about her problems, or her feelings. My father always insisted in eating together lunch and dinner. He would then talk about his work and when he was finished, our dinnertime was over. I realized how important the TV was for him. He would literally watch TV all the time. He came home, watched TV, ate dinner, and watched TV then go to bed. No doubt, my father\u2019s live was and is hard. But being addicted to pornography only made it worse. Apparently there is a link between pornography and intolerance. I have read about this in several articles. Intolerance had been a very central aspect in his life. Whoever did not fit his point of view was shamed, silenced, laughed at and ridiculed. It could be someone from outside or someone in our family. My father had been the central voice in our family regarding what values we had to believe in, how we have to be, what it means to be a woman, what it means to be a man. His values were very conservatives, and as I already mentioned, racist, sexist, homophobic and much more. Half of a year later I still continue to question practically every move I make and every thought that I have. I think it is important to question the beliefs and worldviews we have. My father rarely does it. And when he does, it is to justify his actions. Me, I had changed my life completely. In order to find out who I am and what I want, I started caring about my diet, I started eating more healthily, I stopped wearing makeup, I get up early in the morning but most importantly, I started to actually listening to people. Whenever someone would talk to me about a certain thing, I try my best to stop worrying about what to say next or just immediately reject others ideas and worldviews. I started to inform myself about sociological issues and feminism. I started listening to Ted Talks. I started a psychotherapy regarding my social awkwardness and phobia that I have. I also started to read about vulnerability and that being vulnerable and using vulnerability is not the same thing. My father saw himself as weak and expected us to do the same. He could not be strong, so we had to be strong for him. I realized that no one can think for you. It helped me to look into the mirror and accept me as who I am. I took a closer look to how I had lived my life until this point and I realized that I relied too much on others\u2019 opinions. When someone said to me that I was a certain way I took it like a fact. But in the end, you have to be happy with who you are. You are the only person that needs to be happy with yourself. Ask yourself if the person you are now, is who you really want to be. No one else can take this burden from you. Hold yourself accountable for who you are and who you want to be. This is what I learnt. No one else can live my life for me, no one can think for me and no one can justify my actions for me. There is much more to it, but it is really difficult to put it into words. I want to say that no one does bad things because they are bad people. My father too, is a victim of the system he grew up in. At times, I feel bad for him that, the only way he saw to compensate his troubles, was by watching porn. But what I do feel is very important, is to frequently reflect on your own behavior. Lastly, I want to say that intolerance can be very damaging. First of all it will make your life very poor and nerve wracking, secondly it\u2019ll make the life of the people around you a lot more restricting. Some might leave because of that, others, like me, try to convert to these values and completely loose themselves. I am glad that through such a breakup, I was able to finally revalue what is important in my life, and who is the person I want to be with. I blindly followed the path my father had seen in me. Sure, at times I rebelled, like shaving my hair off, or even moving out, but in the end, the cage he constructed and I accepted was and still is, in my head. I am my own cage. Thanks for everyone who made it this far. ",
