            "answer_text": "There are so many good answer here, but allow me to share my humble opinion in this subject. I believed this question deserve an answer but it would be 2 part. Lets look into:1. How effective is Elliptical machine for losing weight 2. Why am I not losing anymore weight 1st one: How effective is Elliptical machine for losing weight Honestly it is quite effective. Before I started Muay Thai boxing, I used to use this machine as my choice of cardio. It really help me burns off some fat as i move almost more part of my body especially the legs when doing the exercise. A good read is How to Use the Elliptical for Fat Loss. I think most equipment in the gym has its own place and time. So I don\u2019t think the problem here is with the equipment 2nd: Why am I not losing anymore weight I know how you feel and I was once dishearten by the result I am getting as well. I would spend hours on the gym and hit it hard every time on both weight and cardio (and I was slightly injure too from pushing too hard), but I am just not losing more weight. What going on here? This is when I start to realized what I did wrong. I was working too hard, and I diet too long. I didn\u2019t even get a break. And that\u2019s what you need to do. What? A break? Yes that\u2019s right, what you need is a break from all this. Just take a short break like a week of doing nothing. No going to gym and pushing too hard, and no diet that makes you miserable. Once you have your break, then only come back with a fresh mind and body, and start all over again. Or you can deload your workout for a week before pushing hard the next. See this: Deloading 101: What Is a Deload and How Do You Do It? Things you need to remember about losing weightDiet is 80% of your success. Instead of diet too hard and expect seeing fast result, maybe its time to see diet as a long term goal. This way you won\u2019t be miserable. Make it as a lifestyle and you will have fun. Don\u2019t go diet feeling miserable because honestly, that\u2019s the worst and you won\u2019t last long with it. See this: How do you quickly and effectively lose weight in a healthy way? Last advice is be patience and enjoy the process instead of forcing it through. No point doing pushing hard only to give up half way through. ",

            "answer_text": "That depends on what you are trying to be \"efficient\" with. If you're trying to lose some weight with the least amount of daily time devoted to working out, then high intensity intervals are the way to go. But if you're trying to lose a significant amount of weight with the least amount of calendar time elapsed, and you're willing to put more time into daily workouts in order to do this, then you need to work on building endurance. You're going to need to find settings on your favorite machine that push you hard enough to be burning a lot of calories, but not so hard that you burn out before you get to your target time for the day. I managed to lose a very large amount of weight -- 100+ pounds in one year, using the elliptical as my primary form of exercise. Machine programs and setting vary by manufacturer, but I'll describe what I did in terms of the machines I used most often. These were Precor machines, with adjustable ramp angle and resistance (both ranging from 1 to 20), and a bunch of preset programs that varied one or both of these settings over the course of a workout. One of the programs is called \"Fat Burner\" and it holds the ramp angle steady (the default is 10) while varying resistance over a range of 10 (i.e., by default from 2 to 12) during a 20 minute cycle. It starts you out at the lowest resistance, builds it up a bit over five minutes, then reduces it for five minutes, then builds up resistance over the next five minutes to a higher peak, then reduces it again. When I first started using the machine, I lowered the ramp angle to 6 and worked out for about 20 minutes. The next day I went for 30. Every few days, I tried raising the ramp angle and seeing if I could still last the same amount of time I had the day before, and then a few days later I would try going another 5 or 10 minutes at the same settings. Over the course of six months, I worked my way up to 60 minutes (or longer on weekends) with a ramp angle of 16. I also moved the resistance setting up a bit so that it ranged from 4 to 14, but I found that allowing it to go that high reduced my endurance too much. My pace also increased dramatically over time. I did this at least four days a week, and usually five or more. That's one of the real keys to being efficient about the exercise component of a weight loss program. The more days you commit to working out, the more it becomes part of your routine so you're less likely to slack off. Also, avoiding multi-day breaks between workouts makes it easier to sustain your gains in cardio-vascular capacity from one session to the next, and that in turn will help you keep improving both your pace and endurance, buring more calories in each session.
