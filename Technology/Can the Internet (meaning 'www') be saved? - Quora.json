Typing in cache: and the URL will often show the last saved copy of a website. However, it is Digital Library of Free & Borrowable Books, Movies, Music & Wayback Machine that is responsible for trying to save copies \u2014 even if just blurbs \u2014 of the Internet. There are websites like Wikipedia that make their entire library available for download \u2014 and actually encourage anyone to come download a copy and host it somewhere for backup purposes. ",
