            "answer_text": "The following text is to support Tarun Mehta's answer[1] by citing Tesla\u2019s official reasons and end with my own guesses on fringe benefits that are not mentioned here yet. An attendee at 2014 Energy Storage Symposium[2] had asked JB Straubel[3] a similar question after his keynote presentation - \u201cCould you comment on the religious and philosophical divide in the world between 18650's[4] structures and things that look like pocketbooks or cereal boxes?\u201d To which he replied[5] \u201cTo this philosophical divide on form factor of cells, it makes no sense to me. I think people are totally hung-up on the shape and size of the cell, for no good reason. For lithium battery what matters is what's inside the cell. I haven't talked a lot about an 18650 just because it really doesn't matter. At the volume levels, we are working at and the scales, you need to be focused on materials\u2019 cost and the overall performance parameters of the resulting cell, well safety and thermal. We have looked at that pretty deeply and done the best optimisation we can think of starting from and physics principles and came to a inclusion that with today's technology for cells a relatively smaller form factor is a pretty good optimization for safety, for thermal and cost reasons. I don't think that's exactly an 18650, it is probably a little bit bigger than that. I think cylindrical is probably what still makes sense from cost point of view. So there's a lot of little drivers here. But it shouldn't be some philosophical debate right or wrong, this or that. Some other applications that have much higher power to energy ratios will move towards different form factors and different cell construction methods. The auto industry and the bigger OEMs are, I think, really falling in love with the bigger form factors because it seems like it some how makes the problem simpler but it just moves the complexity inside the cell. So they don't have to think about it. There are just as many parts and interconnects inside of a big cell as there are in a collection of small cells. So it's kind of not really good reasoning to imagine that somehow that has better reliability if you just have a hundred bolted connections in a car instead of a whole bunch of interconnects between small cells that\u2019s made at the modular and pack level. I can narrate that for a long time but it seems that it has actually somewhat quietened down. 3\u20134 years ago this was a really intense debate, it\u2019s kinda off dropped away a little bit.\u201d Thermal characteristics of cell from architecture design view: Quoting Elon Reeve Musk[6] from the video shared below- \"The problem with a big battery cell is that the thermal pathway in a worst case scenario is very long. Say, if there is a hot spot in a battery, can it get its heat out? If it is deep in a cell, it can't do that. It is also so hard to thermally condition the cells. The life of the pack will be dependent on not the average temperature but the worst temperature at any point in any cell. So you want to really even the temperature out. That is why Tesla is fan of having lots of small cells and then actively cooling each cell to keep the temperature even and make sure that if hot spots does develop, there is a very short pathway to the cooling system and it can take care of it. And you also want to make sure that it is passive propagation proof i.e even if the active cooling system fails, and you get a thermal runaway in a cell, that thermal runaway then can't cascade into neighbouring cells and you (avoid) the thermal domino-effect. It's not super complicated. So.. If you have big cells, you want big gaps and ideally you don't want big cells. If you do, you want big gaps. Small cells small gaps. I mean... \" Other fringe benefits: To build an all electric car of extremely low centre of mass, the Li-ion battery pack, which gets heavier and voluminous proportional to the required range and torque, needs to be assembled on the floorpan[7] of the car. So the battery pack's thickness is limited by the design of cabin's inner floor height from the ground. If the cabin's floor height is increased, so is the centre of mass of the vehicle. To make this plausible, the cells needs to be smaller in height, or at least flatter cells of large horizontal sizes oriented in a way that can be accommodated in small height. Li-ion 18650 small size batteries already being a cheaper commodity, I guess, Tesla opted for it rather than use a custom made larger flat cells that anyway has thermal characteristics that are harder/expensive to control (as explained by Elon in above video). Tesla\u2019s Model S & X cars but not Roadster have flat battery pack integrated into the chassis and sits below the occupant cabin, lending the car a low enter of gravity that enables outstanding road holding, handling and thereby decreasing risk of roll-over.The large battery pack spread on the floor-pan gives structural rigidity to the vehicle, hence increasing probability of protection of occupants in-case of T-bone collision[8]. So the shape, size and placement of the battery packs in Tesla S & X was cleverly chosen to improve the safety[9] of the vehicle rather than merely considering it as energy storage space, which in turn partially at least influenced the size and shape of cells to be used in the pack. The size of small cells used in battery packs of future models: Tesla already has a foresight[10][11] via Gigafactory[12], which by 2020 is expected to produce Li-ion cells totalling 35 Giga Watts per year. This would enable them to mass produce a new form factor that is optimal by performance, safety and cost for an electric vehicle (as hinted by JB Straubel in the video above and Tesla blog post) & Stationary Battery Packs[13] rather than the old size 18650, by taking advantage of economies of scale and controlling production process flow efficiently from procuring raw materials to manufacturing cells to assembling them into modules and packs.

            "answer_text": "My best guess is that Tesla chose to use small batteries for logistical and financial reasons rather than for performance. Laptop batteries are already mass produced and are widely available. They are going to be much cheaper than buying large custom batteries. Performance-wise, fewer bigger batteries are a much better option than many small batteries, but I'm sure Tesla knows what they are doing :)    I did a lot of design work before converting a motorcycle to an EV early this year.  It turns out that there are a lot of advantages to using fewer bigger batteries, as opposed to many small batteries.   1)  In the process of selecting the perfect battery I asked myself this very question: more small or fewer large? I collected data for a set of 30 different deep cycle lead acid batteries to compare their rated performance with respect to their weight and volume. I found that as battery size increases, so does the battery capacity with respect to its volume and weight. This is because small batteries use more material in their case. (large objects have higher ratio of volume/surface-area than small ones do)   As a battery gets bigger, its capacity, volume, and weight all increase. But the capacity per unit weight or volume also grows. So a given 12v battery will both weigh less and take up less space than any two given 6v batteries of the same capacity combined in series.  Below I've provided two graphs that show this. Because the trend line goes up from left to right, bigger is better.     In EV design we are limited on how much space and weight we have available for the batteries. If we use fewer bigger batteries, we can have a greater total amp-hr capacity within our space/weight limitations. This results in more performance advantages.  2) The larger the capacity of the battery bank, the longer it will take to discharge the batteries for a given load. Due to the \"Peukert Effect\" as battery discharge rate is increased, the relative usable capacity decreases. This means that an 80 amp-hr battery pack will give you more than twice the usable power than a 40 amp-hr battery pack.  3) If you were to consume the same amount of power from a large and a small battery, the smaller one will have a greater depth of discharge (DOD) percentage. Using 20 amp-hrs from a 40 amp-hr pack will give you a DOD of 50%, but it would only be a 25% DOD from an 80 amp-hr pack. Battery life is shortened the more deeply it is discharged in each cycle, so increasing the battery bank capacity will increase the usable life of the bank. This is more clearly illustrated in the graph below.    4) With respect to regenerative braking, more capacity brings advantages too. When using a regen-brake, you can only recover as much energy as you can safely cram into the batteries in a short period of time. The larger the battery bank capacity, the higher the safe recharge rate, and the more energy you can recover from regenerative braking.  5) Whats even worse for small cylindrical batteries is that they take up even more volume because of the small spaces between batteries. No matter how you stack them, there will always be empty space between them. See link: Circle packing 6) Lithium batteries are temperamental and so require charge/discharge controls for each individual cell. More batteries = more charge controllers.  7) If an individual cell is damaged physically or electrically, then it really really sucks to locate and replace that one cell in a stack of hundreds.  ***There are a couple performance arguments to made for many small battery packs. It will be easier to control their temperature due to their larger surface area. They will also be easier to stack in unique ways to distribute weight and make use of small spaces in a vehicle chassis.   But despite all of the above, it still makes a lot of sense for Tesla to use the laptop batteries for availability and cost reasons. Designing and testing all new large capacity batteries costs big bucks. Better to go with the tried and true. ",
