            "answer_text": "You must have heard about Navaratna companies like ONGC etc. ONGC, Shipping Corporation offer best pay packages, as far as I know. Compared to Central Govt pay structures, the remuneration of such 'Ratna' companies are better. But then, at one point of time, employees of Air India/Indian Airlines used to be the Maharajas but now you see, they are not in a position to make payment of salary on time. Same is the case with another 'Mini-Ratna' : BSNL - running in huge loss. However, overall, depending upon the cadre/position ofcourse, generally speaking PSU employees are better paid . Again, as I said , if you look forward to IAS or allied services, undoubtedly they are far better comensated , compared to any other PSU official. ",
