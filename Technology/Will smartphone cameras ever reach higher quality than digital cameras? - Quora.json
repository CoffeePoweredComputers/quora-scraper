            "answer_text": "Can a phone camera ever reach the quality of professional cameras? I am in the never-say-never camp. I have no actual idea, of course, but I\u2019ve seen a lot of things happen in 78-going-on-79 years. The technological progression of pretty much everything has advanced by leaps and bounds. Yesterday\u2019s pipe dream is today\u2019s reality. When I went back to school for formal education in commercial photography my mentors liked to joke that what all photographers ultimately wanted was to be able to load film between their ears and blink. It was funny, and true. In the early 1970s we were trained with massive Speed Graphic cameras using 4x5-inch sheet films.  I cannot imagine what my mentors would think about modern digital photography. They were all WW2 veterans, some of whom had gone ashore on D-Day with cameras like Weegee\u2019s. Personal computers were just hovering on the horizon. Electronic calculators were 4-function and very expensive. The mere idea of digital photography was so far-fetched it wasn\u2019t even discussed. A mobile phone that doubles as a camera? You are joking, right? Yet I consider today\u2019s digital photography to be very close to being able to capture anything in a literal blink. The reason we were required to use the big-as-your-head cameras was that size mattered. The 4x5 negative needed only 2X enlargement to make an 8x10 print, with plenty of room for cropping. The smaller the negative the more enlargement it needed to get to the standard 8x10, exacerbating grain, unsharpness, anything undesirable. I've come to realize that size still matters, though less and less. My first digital camera was a point-and-shoot with a cell-phone-sized sensor and 7MP. I was so impressed with what it could do, producing only JPEGs, that I stuck with tiny sensors and JPEGs for longer than was smart, but I loved the convenience of pocketable all-in-one cameras. It\u2019s quite recent that I have moved up to APS-C \u201chalf-frame\u201d cameras and all-raw capture, and now I wish I hadn\u2019t resisted for so long.  I can go out with nothing but my compact A6300 with the 16\u201350 kit lens and be as inconspicuous as I ever was with a P&S.   \ud83d\udc46 But these are examples of what I can do with just that combination. So, what about phones? At present, I don\u2019t like them. I always have mine and occasionally, reluctantly, use it as the camera-I-have-with-me, but I find them awkward to hold, don\u2019t like being stuck with a wide-angle, never use so-called \u201cdigital zoom\u201d which is no such thing, and find the state-of-the-art computational gee-whiz to be glaringly obvious. BUT\u2026 considering that I was trained on massive press cameras, we\u2019ve come a long way baby, and it ain\u2019t over. I will probably not live to see the next photographic paradigm shift but it\u2019s coming, and I strongly suspect it\u2019s going to come to smartphones first because you have to be blind not to see that\u2019s where the market is. I think will always be a market for \u201creal\u201d professional cameras, but once it was thought there would always be a market for Speed Graphics. Wet collodion, anyone? ",

            "answer_text": "No smartphone camera will ever come close to the image capturing capabilities of the worst DSLR ever made. Sure, somebody will show you a landscape picture they took with their phone and an equivalent they took with a professional camera, and ask you to tell them which is which, and it will be hard to work out unless you know what you\u2019re looking for. This kind of comparison gives a very false impression of reality, as it\u2019s rather the equivalent of having two friends go for a drive together, one in a light family car and the other in a race tuned Ferrari, with the understanding that they would stick to backstreets and obey all traffic laws. Then, when they both arrive at the destination at the same time, saying the cars\u2019 performances are equally good. If you deliberately choke the Ferrari\u2019s performance to one the light family vehicle can keep pace with, then of course the performance is going to be comparable. In almost any other situation though, the Ferrari will leave the other car standing. ",
