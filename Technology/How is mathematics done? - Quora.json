            "answer_text": "How is mathematics done? Excellent question! First, let's look at what mathematics is: the study of structure. All of math starts from axioms, or statements that we take for granted as true. If we can't say that anything is true, we can't prove anything. You can never hit the bottom, because anything you say in your proof you also have to prove. One good example of this is trichotomy: mathematicians take it for granted that if we have two real numbers a and b, then either a<b, a>b, or a=b. This seems obvious to the vast majority of people, which is a good thing because in general you want people to agree with your axioms, or at least accept them. It also isn't true of all types of objects that mathematicians deal with: as soon as you make those numbers complex, for example, the notion of \u201cless than\u201d and \u201cgreater than\u201d disappear. It also should be noted that not all axioms are virtually universally believed to be true (for example, the Axiom of Choice). Now, and this is where the really interesting part happens, we can say \u201cas long as you accept our axioms, you also must accept [insert mathematical statement here]\u201d. And the reasoning backing that statement is called proof. All of our proofs make use of axioms or known results, which were themselves from axioms. Thus, mathematics allows us to study structures defined only by first principles and derive results that are often interesting and profound. Notice that nothing about mathematics involves numbers. In fact, the more abstract a statement is, the better, because that means it has a larger use case. This is why in higher mathematics people often study mathematical objects like \u201cgroups\u201d and \u201cfields\u201d, whose properties are taken as part of the definition of the object (although these are, in a way, also axioms). So how do we actually do all this proof thing? I'll assume for the purpose of this question that you are asking about creating new mathematics, not simply applying know results. If you are, there's a whole different answer on critical thinking waiting for you, but you should phrase your question as \u201cHow should I approach math problems?\u201d Mathematics is a gigantic field of study, so researchers typically pick an area of focus and a subtopic they want to study, and then follow the scientific method. They make observations, form hypotheses (usually called conjectures), test out ideas, and rethink their ideas. Today, mathematics is advanced enough that it usually takes multiple people to find a new significant result. There is one slight caveat - instead of just experimental data, mathematicians need logical proof. If they can't come up with such proof, they usually leave their idea as an open conjecture, which may be proven or disproven in the future by others. Finally, they report their results and proof, and after peer review by fellow mathematicians, it is added to humanity's body of knowledge of mathematics. That sums up a basic overview of what mathematics is and how new contributions are made. This answer is quite broad, but so are mathematics and the approaches used to study it. I hope that helps. ",

            "answer_text": "Let\u2019s do a proof by contradiction. Suppose for the sake of contradiction, that mathematics is done. That is, there are no more advancements to make in the subject of mathematics, in any capacity whatsoever. This would mean there is no research being done in said subject. Well, a quick glance at arXiv.org e-Print archive and clicking on any of the multiple areas of math that get published to that website shows us that there are new preprints of upcoming papers being submitted. This is a contradiction to the assumption we made (mathematics is \u201cdone\u201d) hence finishing the proof. Q.E.D. Edit: Oopsie. I misread the question. I thought the original question was \u201cIs mathematics done?\u201d Hence my original answer. How is mathematics done? Here\u2019s how I like to do math: Step 1) Feel great. Maybe this is a bit weird to say, but if I have a stomach ache, headache, am feeling stressed, tired, or sick, I am not ready to sit down and do math. In fact, I won\u2019t want to do math because I won\u2019t be able to focus and I just don\u2019t feel well. So before even opening a book or folder, make sure you\u2019re feeling well and if you\u2019re not, do whatever you need to do to feel better (this applies to being in a highly emotive state too. I prefer to be in a emotionally neutral state so I am not going to let my mind wander). Step 2) Eliminate distractions. In a similar vein to the previous step, you need to be able to sit down comfortably and concentrate on the work at hand. So usually I turn on my bose speaker and play my study playlist (aka, my classical music playlist) and then go put my phone in my room on airplane mode. Not even on do not disturb, airplane mode. This way I am guaranteed to not have a phone call interrupt my music emanating from my speaker and any notifications I receive will not ding, so I have no distractions. Additionally, for eliminating distractions, I like to keep a clean work (and living) space. This is probably just a personal thing, but I can\u2019t focus if I have something else on my mind, like how disorganized one of my binders is, or how dirty my kitchen or living room is. So I\u2019ll clean before I do math so that way, there is nothing on my mind other than math. Step 3) Sit down and work :) Pretty simple, now that I\u2019m comfy (for me, this involves wearing sweatpants and a hoodie), everything is clean (including you!\u2014though again, maybe just a me thing), there are no distractions, and I have calming yet studious music playing softly in the background, I am ready to sit down and give my homework and notes my full attention. I usually do this for two to three hours, take a break, and if I made good progress, I\u2019ll call it a day, but sometimes I\u2019ll take an extended break and then get back to it. I have my first algebra test this Friday, and I\u2019ve already begun studying, but tomorrow and Thursday are my big days for studying. I\u2019ll be studying about 6 hours each day. Same for my Analysis test a week from Friday and the same will be true for my Topology exam, whenever that is (date hasn\u2019t been set yet\u2026 reeeeeeeaaalllyyyy hoping it isn\u2019t in the same week as Measure Theory, but I might have my hopes a bit high).
