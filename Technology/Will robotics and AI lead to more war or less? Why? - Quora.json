            "answer_text": "Human nature being what it is, robotics and AI, in my opinion, will lead to more war. And not only more war but also more lethal. The reason: Robots and robotics means machines are doing the fighting. Instead of the loss of blood and limbs, the result will be loss of hydraulic fluid, wires and metal manipulators. There will be less human suffering and guilt. And AI only adds more ingenuity to waging war. This has been the evolution of warfare. The most elementary is man-to-man combat. And then the formation of armies and strategic thinking, such as Sun Tzu\u2019s The Art of War. As the pace of war speeds up and the horizons of war continues to expand beyond visual borders into electronic ones, it is not a far jump to having AI determine strategy and tactics. War is a test of strengths and wills. Whomever will have the best robotics and AI shall succeed in this quest involving the combat of arms, by they human or electro-mechanical. ",

            "answer_text": "Neither. It\u2019s just a technology, like breeding seeds, or root watering systems, or aircraft, or plumbing. Technology doesn\u2019t \u201clead\u201d anywhere. It provides opportunities to do things previously impossible or too expensive. Period. YOU are responsible for how it is used,YOU decide if it makes war more or less likely. In and of itself, technology can always be used to create resources and opportunities for peace. Or war. ",
