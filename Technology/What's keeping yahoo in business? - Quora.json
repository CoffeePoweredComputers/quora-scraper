            "answer_text": "Is owned by Verizon so Verizon is funding and keeping it alive. Yahoo is still a fairly high traffic site.. from people still using Yahoo mail (which I still use) and with Yahoo search, Verizon can collect people's personal data and make money off it just like what Google, Facebook, and Amazon does. A lot of rural Americans and old people still use Yahoo.. Yahoo used to be very big back in the day and those old folks still have it as their default homepage. A big thing with Yahoo too is Yahoo News, weather, sports, and fantasy football. So there's still a lot of activity on Yahoo and a lot of people still use it (especially older rural Americans). Verizon just announced their Yahoo Mobile discount cellphone plan.. same thing as Metro PCS, Cricket, Virgin Mobile, Boost Mobile, etc. Verizon is now joining the cheap budget cellphone network business\u2026 it's important to know these budget MVNO cellphone networks are not as fast as their parent company networks and speeds will be throttled.

            "answer_text": "Yahoo! as a company no longer exists, so it's not technically still in business in its original form. Verizon purchased all of the assets except for a few which were held back (most notably the Alibaba stake and the patent portfolio, although there may be other assets in there that I\u2019m not aware of) and merged it with AOL (which they already owned) and changed the company name to Oath, and now Verizon Media Group. The company which owns the held back assets was renamed to Altaba, and the assets which Verizon bought like Yahoo Mail, Yahoo News, and Yahoo Finance continue to live on as web/mobile properties owned by Verizon Media Group, which is owned by Verizon.
