            "answer_text": "Theoretically speaking, an AMOLED LCD display has zero brightness when displaying a black area, this is, a black dot in the screen blocks all light.  This is true, and is one of the pluses of AMOLED technology. The consumption is smaller due to that as well. Black areas are not lighted so yes, you can infer it is shut down on that area. Of course the overall consumption is bigger but has nothing to do with this topic. That does not mean that the software shuts down such pixels because a black area needs to be displayed. It may be the case that your phone (I also own a 1020) has a common software for the display with some other that does not use AMOLED, at least some parts of it. This can happen. However, and despite I am no expert in LCD software, I do believe that what you see is the effect of having some other areas not black in the screen. When I am looking at a glance screen, I do see all in black but the time and notifications that I see in some grayish color. The rest, so long as I can say, is completely black. It is easy for the naked eye not to tell your brain about uniformity in blacks when you are also looking at some other areas that are not black at that moment. Do not worry too much about it. An AMOLED panel has benefits and also some very niteresting drawbacks. Please consider this: in the industry, whenever a technology is absolutely better, all makers tend to adopt it as soon as they can. This is not happening for AMOLED panels, and for good reasons. AMOLED is more like a marketing thing. It is damn expensive and makers only use it for high-end cells, not for all cases for sure. You can make a very nice 4K panel without ever considering using AMOLED. As well, when you use AMOLED, you have to pay Samsung or LG or someone else. This is not that critical, but has to be considered. But back to your question. The answer is YES, an AMOLED display shows a black area by not letting any light to go through the correspondant pixels. Any inconsistency you can find on that behavior is not due to an AMOLED panel being defective. Alas, there are many AMOLED qualities as well. It may be the case that for 1020 not the best of the best was used, and it was for the 930. The 1020 was a very expensive piece of hardware because of the awesome camera. You will not likely see this again soon. So keep your 1020 clean and neat! I also do and I love the phone. I do not own any other one, I am using my 1020 for everything. ",
