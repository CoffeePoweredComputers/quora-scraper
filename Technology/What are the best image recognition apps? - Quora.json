            "answer_text": "It depends on the purpose. For example, optical character recognition for extracting text from a receipt is probably best done with a speciality, vertical app.  Whereas general purpose image recognition, something like Google Goggles, is much different.  Although, I think Goggles has been pulled from Google Play. As far as I know, there are no \"really good\" general purpose image recognition apps for search.  I spent a long time doing image recognition for brand promotions and retail marketing, our apps always had to be trained on specific images/products. That's the way it works for all of them, so far.  That said, I bet that in the future things like genre detection get better at helping to categorize, sort and aid in what appears to be general purpose image rec. ",
