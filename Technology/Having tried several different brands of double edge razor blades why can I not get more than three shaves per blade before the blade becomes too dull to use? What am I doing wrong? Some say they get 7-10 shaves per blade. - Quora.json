            "answer_text": "It's not that the blades are probably getting dull it's that they are either getting clogged or getting a soap build up on the blade. I switched a long time ago from double edged and triple edged razors to the old 1940's clamshell design safety razors. Now I get more shaves from a blade the. I care to think about, and closer shaves too. If things become clogged I can open it up and rinse it out, I can adjust shave closeness all kinds of nifty stuff. And when my blade seems to be getting dull, I merely take it out and wipe the soap scum off it and it's good to go. Eventually i do need to replace blades but a 10 pack is i think under a buck I think ( that's how long it's been since I needed to buy blades.) The double edge stuff is the scam of the century. ",

            "answer_text": "The first thing to do is to look at your prep. Shave after showering, and at the sink first wash your stubble with a high-glycerin soap (examples: Pears Transparent Soap, Whole Foods 365 glycerin soap, Clearly Natural glycerin soap, Musgo Real (or Ach Brito) Glyce Lime Oil soap). Rinse partially with a splash and than apply a true lather, taking your time before the first pass. \"True lather\" is what I call a lather made with a shaving brush from shaving soap or shaving cream and water. Almost all men who have tried both true lather and canned foam agree that, in terms of shave quality and enjoyment, it goes like this: Worst: cartridge razor + canned foam Better: DE razor + canned foam Better yet: cartridge razor + true lather Best: DE razor + true lather Work the lather well into your stubble before the first pass, which is with the grain. Then rinse, relather, and do a pass across the grain. Then rinse, relather, and do a pass against the grain except in any areas in which you tend to get ingrowns. In those areas, do the third pass across the grain in the other direction. You don\u2019t mention what razor you\u2019re using, and that can have an effect.

I shave head and face every day, getting 4 or more shaves with these brands (short list): -Astra SP -Gillette Wilkinson Sword -Bolzano -Some Treet brands (which I have not used) Also remember the quality of your shave depends on your blade/razor combination. Your task is to find the right blade with the right razor for YOU. ",

            "answer_text": "You may not be doing anything wrong. Some people are lucky enough to have whiskers that arent as tough, and are easier on blades. But make sure your prep is good, make sure to shave after a shower or soak the face to soften the hair. At the same time, practice makes perfect and that can tease a little more life out of blades. But I will say that 3 shaves from a blade still is less expensive than cartridges ",

That will soften the beard hairs and that will help extend the life of the razor by using it on a slightly softer target (I usually just douse m yu face with hot water in the shower. Same effect.). Good luck. ",

The ones I use cost about $.10 a blade so it\u2019s not worth the hassle of trying to determine is it sharp enough and when to change it just easier to change it every day but that\u2019s just me. ",
