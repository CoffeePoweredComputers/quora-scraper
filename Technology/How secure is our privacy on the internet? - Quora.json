            "answer_text": "Internet privacy is a subset of the greater world of data privacy that generally covers the use, collection, and storage of Personally Identifiable information (PI). Internet privacy is concerned primarily with how PI is exposed over the Web, through tracking, data collection, data sharing, and cybersecurity threats. Today many people make the mistake of leaving a large Digital Footprint increasing the chance of exposing PI or making it more easily accessible by cybersecurity criminals. In my opinion you should consider anything you do online on a non-secure and/or public facing website (including social media) as OPEN GAME \u2013 meaning your information is not private. Even on secure websites, if you enter your credit or bank card information, sign up for an account, give out your email, fill out a form, post on social media, or store pictures or documents in cloud storage, you are releasing personal information into cyberspace. If those services are compromised (which more and more are getting hacked into everyday) your information will be exposed and others will have access to the information you provided which you may have considered private and protected. Your PI may be shared in ways you don\u2019t expect or are unaware of. I work with businesses in the Princeton NJ & Central NJ area to help reduce cybersecurity risks including leaking of PI. If your business needs help in this area check out my Cybersecurity for Business site. If you\u2019re an individual concerned about protecting your information online as well as tips to keep your home cyber safe, I would suggest checking out the US CISA Home & Business site which is an excellent resource. Hope this helps! ",

            "answer_text": "If you are an active user of social networks, Google, messaging apps, smartphone, and laptop, actually, your private data are already stored in so many databases, that it's better just to say that there is no any privacy on the internet. Did you know that some apps even collect info about you which they don't really need? And then they sell this info to other companies hunting for it. GDPR is helpful from one hand. You can ask all the services that store info about you to delete it and start a new life. But from the other hand, let's have a look on Facebook, you can download all the info they store about you, but the same will be available for the fraudster who hacks your account. I just put up with the situation and keep calm. Actually, it's not so harmful if you are not a terrorist, politician or movie star. But what if someday you'll become one? Philosophic question. Anyway, always be careful with the info you share on your social networks and other public services not to become a doxing victim one day, not to give the hackers any info they can use for social engineering of phishing against you, and not to help the robbers to find out when is the best time to rob your house. Just be wise and try to leave as little info about yourself on the internet as possible. ",
