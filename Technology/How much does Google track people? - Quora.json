            "answer_text": "Pretty hard to answer and the question is very relative. I will assume you want to know, how they track employees? You can assume that as many employers in the US you have privacity as long as you use corporate assets. NDA explains it all. But I have seen as a contractor the moment we used our google mail account to send emails with attachment to a non google account, security paid us a visit and we had a conversation about best practices. They also implemented a system coorporate wide to ensure that people do not leave the computer unlocked and unattended and they know who do it. A few people were fired for not following or sharing links to internal youtube presentations staged with that purpose. In conslusion, I am sure there are many stories outhere about how google tracks productivity, nothing I can confirm as true. In the surface Google is a very relaxed environment to work at, but at the same time they are very serious about security and they manage it pretty well. Still confidencial information leaks, which is their primary objective. if the question is how google tracks people in general. Google mines your habits when you search google, or when you use a device particularly android devices, chrome browser and their apps. The majority of the data is non intrusive. I would not be concerned about how much data google gets from me. I found Facebook, and Amazon more intrusive than google, even though google has a much more intimate relationship within everything I do online than anybody else, including the OS. ",
