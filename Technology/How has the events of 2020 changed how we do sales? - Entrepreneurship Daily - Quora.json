            "answer_text": "Amazon has destroyed millions of traditional retail businesses over the past decade, similar to how Walmart destroyed small town businesses with their massive growth into more rural areas with their superstore concept. So this trend has advanced the death spiral of traditional retail and is the final nail in the coffin now that consumers have been forced to turn to online purchasing for the most part. Just as with Amazon, once people get comfortable with ordering online, they become normalized to online shopping. We are all creatures of habits. Online internet shopping is now full circle and with the benefit of instant rebate coupons being applied to orders so easily, as well as the low price guaranteed shopping sites, no one will be visiting traditional retail shopping stores in another few years. Just look at all the major mall anchor store bankruptcies, the list is growing daily, Sears, JC Penny\u2019s, Macy\u2019s, Neiman Marcus, Lord & Taylor, never mind dozens of the center mall support franchise stores, they will all be gone by the end of this decade. Malls will be converted to Amazon distribution centers is my guess. ",
