            "answer_text": "Every technology needs improvement. Consider some examples. Mobiles: We do need mobiles which can be automatically charged when we keep them on our desk and smartphone battery lasts for at least 4\u20135 days easily.Computers: We do need computers which can easily be controlled by our voice commands/ thoughts or iris movement. We also need natural language based programming languages.Health devices: We do need low cost personal dialysis equipments, permanent pacemakers, pain free diabetes control implants and health monitoring beacon capsules to name few things.Teaching Aids: We do not teaching aids which help students to follow some DIY instructions to learn basic to higher education courses.Election Machines: We have not been able to invent a fully trustworthy election machine which becomes a gold standard in all countries.Home Robots: Low cost robots for day to home tasks of cooking, cleaning, serving, washing, purchasing etc. are still a subject of fictional films.Televisions: Televisions still produce dumb 2D images. 3D television without special viewing aids are still a dream to be true.Directed Sound: Producing directed sound which heard by specific targets in some space is still a long desired goal.Muti Terrain vehicles: Vehicles that can easily run in multiple terrains will keep on improving. vehicles that can swim, that can fly, that can climb stair, that can pass through dense jungles will keep on getting developed.List is endless. These were just some on the spot thoughts. ",

            "answer_text": "1: For decades there have been oodles of flying cars - one particularly famous model owned by an equally famous film star. These vehicles were seen sometimes in Popular Science etc. MY 40kg 2-seat TRICAR with a small engine-prop + ultra-light weight folding wings etc would easily qualify - especially if wings were ultra tiny LANIER slat-wings or cloth wing. Since early 1970s I have studied & published re ultra-stable LANIER micro-wing 1929 planes that takeoff & land in 20m, & travel as slow as a runner or very fast - meaning no airport needed! Many were built in 1930s by & to be flown by STUDENTS. 2: Most EVs are nowhere near ECO-friendly because they are usually still massively coal-fired. You should NOT make a successful EV to be or look like an ICV. Also: Compared to our non-produced TRiCAR, TESLA hysteria has seen no more REAL BENEFIT progress since 1895 EVs. Here are some of their massive problems: compared to our TRiCAR, MANY THINGS (are quoted to) SUCK RE TESLA which is too BIG for an EV; its about 40 times too heavy; it\u2019s horsepower is 100s of times too much like a clunking race car where 1900s big cars had 4 to 8 hp though our TRiCAR has a mere 1/4 hp with 8 gears; battery cost over 100 times more than ought at $5,000 after 500 charges which could be not much more than a year reportedly for some drivers; total vehicle cost about 35 times too much + I read about scores of TESLA faults to be or not to be fixed, unlike none on TRiCAR for over 26 years. EVs should have small bike wheels like ours which have a strip of tough tyre material between inner tube & tyre for puncture protection. TESLA has a mass of computer junk & we all know how unreliable that can be & can you sue them? We need no charging points; instead a 46-watt home or carried Solar panel soon charges its battery, or charges 2 replacement batteries, if not mains charged, 1 being an extra for range. For emergency, TRICAR easily carries a reclining patient, or our folded long-range Chinese FREEGO micro electric K scooter. ",
