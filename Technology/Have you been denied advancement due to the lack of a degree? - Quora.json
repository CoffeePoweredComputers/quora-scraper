            "answer_text": "Intriguing question and from my personal experience it may have been the case of being denied advancement attributable to too much intellectual wherewithal. I had requested to move my day off for my four day work week from Friday to Monday, that was no problem. The problem came when I requested to take one day of vacation for 14 weeks - (I had more than enough vacation) in order to take Stat 235 (Measure Theory) at UC Davis. I did not ask for mileage from Ukiah to Davis not had I asked for tuition reimbursement - I simply asked to take the vacation that I had already accrued. My supervisor stated \u201cHe would have to ask Steve (my former supervisor who had retired) about it - two weeks went by no answer so I asked the Director for permission which she gave. I had no sooner asked the Director & returned to my office when My Supervisor stated \u201cHe had asked Steve about it - answer from Steve I would not do it the perception would be bad\u201d I responded I had gotten approval from the Agency Director - to which he stated \u201cIf she said it was okay, then it is okay by me.\u201d Even stating that he had me promise this would be the only time that this would occur - to which I readily agreed trusting Dr. Roussas's opinion even the first Quarter of Measure Theory would be sufficient to dissipate my conceptual blocks. To this day I am highly skeptical that he even asked Steve. I think he wanted me not to take the class so that he would not be without his brain two out of the four days in the work week. He supposedly quoted Steve saying something to the effect that the Analysts are unique personalities and something to the effect that one should keep them right where they are (an implied don't move them up). Paired with the other quote, I believe that I constituted too much necessary intellectual wherewithal and there would be no support given for promotional opportunities within the Agency. ",

            "answer_text": "When I first came home from Vietnam I went to a local power company to apply for employment. My skills, other than driving a duce n a half were minimal as to what would apply to civilian employment. I was set down and given placement and aptitude test. I was always good at putting things together and taking them apart so at the end of the day they placed me in engineering. I was then put into a advancement course where I would take in house classes at work. Visit other departments with OJT and homework with correspondence work to be mailed in and graded. This went on for five years and at each six month interval you would be required to take a test and if completed successfully with a passing grade you would be given a raise and advance to the next step. A suit was brought against the company saying it was discriminator to non white employees so it was done away with and they went to requiring a degree to be employed as no more HS people no matter how qualified would be hired. This place me as a HS grad in the unenviable position now being a second tier employee even though I did the exact same work as college grads with less compensation. No longer were HS grads given promotions and we were left behind. I worked as a power line designer for the next forty years designing and building power lines while my college fellow employees were given advancement and corresponding raises. The funny thing of all this is that during the nineties all the middle management of my company which now mostly included the college people who were advanced over the years were let go and what remained. Yep, the HS people who built power lines were still there doing the work and we were retained as an asset the provided wealth and function to the company. Most of the affirmative action, equal employment, college basket weaving grads were let go, retired or down sized out leaving actual workers in place. So, all being said I was able to retire with forty years, and I am still called in to work storm trouble when there is an emergency or hurricanes. All well that ends well as my grandMa used ta say. But it still grates on me that I watched less qualified people get promoted and raised in statues just because of a piece of paper that was for all practical purposes, worthless. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes. When I finished my tour at DARPA, I was in an excellent position to move on to a number of other jobs in research. I interviewed at Stanford and ultimately selected them despite the fact that I was not offered a faculty position. Early in my career I earned a MSE degree and was faced with the decision of what to do next. I decided to go for a second Master\u2019s level degree, this time in Computer Science and related topics. Why? At the time, I was not expected to end up in a university research laboratory and did not want to spend the extra time and effort to get the PhD. I should also point out that there was a two foreign language requirement at the time and I was not good at languages - a mental block. So, instead of a faculty position at Stanford, I settled for a Senior Research Scientist position. This was not a major problem for me and I built the job into what worked for me. It bothered me a bit to not have faculty status, but at least I didn\u2019t have to attend faculty meetings! I had my research programs (that I shared with faculty members), I had my students, and Stanford allowed me to consult part time. I\u2019ve known people without a PhD who received a faculty position at major universities, but those were unique situations and individuals who were exceptional. If I had it to do over, knowing what I know now, I probably would have gone for the PhD. It is a credential that is valuable for the rest of your life, even if you do not end up in a university. ",

            "answer_text": "Denial of all kinds of things have been normal for me. It has been life experience. Once I was fairly easily upset about it. All that got was the initiating people felt justified because I was \u201cunstable\u201d. OK. Somewhere along the line I started to push back. All that got was justification to continue the denials because I was \u201cunstable\u201d. Eventually, I learned that: 1.) Bullying and abuse of others is a normal part of most other people\u2019s way of life. 2.) Anything I might do was preordained to fail in achieving a semblance of fairness. 3.) I wasn\u2019t alone. I learned very early on that I was never going to win any beauty contests or pretty baby events. I learned that others will take from others whatever they want to take and will be backed up by others of the same mind. And, not just me. In my perception, anyone who is perceived as a potential victim will be regardless of ethnic background. That is one reason I won\u2019t support something like black lives matter. I see it as using one community of this country as an excuse for wealthy and well funded Caucasian individuals to hide behind masks to bully and abuse everyone else, including those they claim to matter. By destroying businesses and income producing opportunities for people they are denying others the dignity of supporting their families and communities. They are just an extension of my experience on a broader scale. My counter was to work to develop my knowledge, skills, and abilities. In my mind I had to run to catch-up with others in whatever endeavor I was involved. If I was awake I was trying to catchup. If I was asleep I was trying to catchup. To this day I seldom sleep more than 4\u20135 hours a night. I know I\u2019m a workaholic, a habit I have not been able to even mitigate. Prior to getting my first degree I found it difficult to get work because I lacked \u201cexperience\u201d. Eventually, I started to acquire experience and run into other excuses. I was told I lacked skills, lacked this or that, told I wouldn\u2019t stay with the business, that I didn\u2019t have what they wanted, etc. I chose to push on to get my first degree. My first degree, Agricultural Economics, had limited application in the locality where I lived, Nevada, so I was told I was \u201ctoo smart\u201d for lots of positions I applied. I was also told I didn\u2019t have the \u201cright\u201d degree for the job. It was just another excuse. Eventually, I opted to ignore the degree on applications. I got a job in heavy construction. I really liked the work and was working my way up in the company. I applied for a position the company wanted to give to a favored individual. But, I had seniority. I got the position on a temporary basis and was given a two-week training. Some of the older workers told me normally people got three months training for the position. Following a three month hiatus I was instructed to fill the position full time for three weeks. I did. Because I had the mentality I do I was successful in performing the job. Because, apparently things were set up for me to fail, the management was caught off guard because the job was done as was supposed. The manager started to investigate and discovered not only had i a degree but that I had run for a political office. He came into the field, sat behind me while I was working, and never said a word for three hours. I had no idea what was going on, nor did I ask. I just assumed my work was being evaluated, which it was, and continued on as I had. After three hours he said in a statement, \u201cYou have a degree.\u201d I sucked air. I was going to get terminated for not disclosing that on my application. I replied yes, sir. \u201cYou ran for public office.\u201d Again, a statement. Yes, sir. \u201cYou are only the third person in this company with a degree. The others are in San Francisco. That explains why you did the utility man job.\u201d After a few minutes he got up and left. I spent the rest of the day expecting termination, the next day, and the next. Then I started receiving highe level jobs filling in for other employees who were absent. I continued working there until I was injured in an industrial accident. But, for a while I was concerned I would lose a job because I had a degree. In reality, and relative to your original question, degrees are not necessarily relative to any job. Some technical degrees are more vocational training and are necessary to get your foot in the door for what might essentially be an apprenticeship program. Most other jobs are on the job learning where if you have a high school education you\u2019ll do fine in the entry level positions. Demands for degrees are primarily to self eliminate applicants, and to identify people who follow instructions and jump through hoops. There might be a sub culture relative to politics relative to degrees, e.g., the liberal tendencies of some high tech companies. You might be able to get a job with or without a degree if you exhibited liberal compatibilities. That\u2019s speculation on my part. If you exhibit individualism you probably couldn\u2019t get a job there if you were heralding the second coming, degree or not. ",

            "answer_text": "Sort of. After getting out of the Navy I was asked to apply for a position with the Radiological Health office for the State of Ohio - this was based on my 8 years of experience in radiation safety in the Navy\u2019s nuclear power program. So I submitted my application, went for some interviews, and waited. And waited. And waited some more. Because I hadn\u2019t yet completed my undergraduate degree, and the guy who ran the Environmental Health Division (which Rad Health was a part of) acknowledged my experience and the recommendations of the guy who would be my boss - and of his boss - but he didn\u2019t want to hire someone who didn\u2019t have a degree. I waited for 6 or 7 months before the fleshy-headed mutant was finally talked into bringing me onboard - and then he swore he would never again hire anybody who didn\u2019t have a degree. Funny thing - I stayed in that job for a few years and then got a much better job offer so I turned in my two weeks\u2019 notice. I can\u2019t really say that this cost me the chance to advance, although I\u2019m pretty sure I would not have been considered for a higher-level position had I not finished my degree. But as it turns out, I wasn\u2019t there long enough for this to be an issue. But - funny story - my second-to-last day there I was on a conference call with the fleshy-headed mutant; it was about a radioactively contaminated site in Cleveland that we were trying to get cleaned up. I had to handle most of the questions because he didn\u2019t know anything about it. Afterwards my boss came up to me and said \u201cI just talked with Roger - he said he hadn\u2019t realized how much we were going to miss you until yesterday.\u201d But that\u2019s in the past - aside from that one job I\u2019ve never had a problem.

            "answer_text": "Your other respondents seem to have had a unique problem of being overqualified in some way. Mine was the opposite. Perhaps mine was more in line with what your question was getting at, opportunities lost due to limited school education. For years I devoted myself wholly to the job of intelligence work, while some of my peers spent much of their time studying for promotion tests or doing school work on the job. At promotion time some of them, though only nominally skillful at intelligence work, were promoted in rank because of their school certificates and test scores. It irked me to say the least! I had been made Production Chief of 42 intel analysts due to my talent and commitment to the job. But because I spent all my time DOING the job and not getting paper certificates I was left behind. We discovered the reason why when the promotion board visited the unit to describe their selection process. The promotion board consisted of two Colonels (officers) and one Chief Master Sergeant (enlisted). The Colonels were looking to promote high performers, which made sense, but the CMS steered them towards promoting people with documented education to \u201cencourage the enlisted ranks to improve their education.\u201d Like they say about the Peter Principle, people are often promoted to the level where they are totally incompetent, then stay there because they can\u2019t move up any more. Or as I\u2019ve heard it, in any cesspool the really big chunks float to the top.  ",

Now, the equipment were: Tractors D-9 dozers, through all kinds of cranes, fork lifts, air compressors, lathes, Anti gas area/space purifying equipment, wire ropes, welding rods, armored plats, Bridges to cross water obstacles like the cross of the Suetz canal during the 1973 war, all kinds of electronic devices that are used to repairs of all kinds of electronic devices and more of these kinds. What ever you imagine. Not tanks, no bombs, no weapons. no canons. no cars and or trucks. Nothing that may kill people. So, with such qualification I never had a problem to fit into any job I wanted. this is to teach you that never stop learning/studying as the more you learn the more you see how little you know as the technology spread all over and it is very interesting.

            "answer_text": "Yes. When I attended shitty diploma mills (Wright State - PhD Psych and Fordham - MS Psych), I was restricted from higher paying work assignments/internships due to my forced academic standing. I was also informed by local associated employers (when I was seeking summer work at the time of enrollment at Wright State) that I wouldn\u2019t be considered for simple work due to the lack of the official degree. I assumed a basic level of intelligence and professionalism from faculty members employed within the formal edu sector. However, after attending 2 diploma mills (Wright State - PhD Psych and Fordham - MS Psych) after being misled by breaches of contract and blatantly false advertising, I would have to say these ppl are complete idiots. When I attended, the main admins/faculty were: Wright State - Valerie Shalin, Deb Steele-Johnson, Kevin Bennett, Gary BurnsFordham - Andrew Rasmussen, Donna Heald, Eva Badowksa, Monika McDermottThese ppl should be outed and fired. Tenure DENIED. The programs were rampant with legal offenses. When I expressed concerns about the WSU program, my advisor (Bennett) threatened me against leaving\u2014he said \u201cNo one will accept you, not after the Psych 105 Lab fiasco.\u201d (See below links). I ended up getting an MS at Fordham, but the former/current faculty had obviously been speaking with each other. How low these idiots will go to save their own incompetent a$sses. Pathetic!

They came about from the GI Bill, so no financial loss. But did have the benefit of more knowledge. The two best bosses I have had, one at Procter & Gamble, and one at PepsiCo, did not have a college degree. One was a department manager, and one a regional VP, who was there when PepsiCo bought the restaurant company. The P&G boss never got beyond department manager. He retired early as P&G\u2019s retirement plan, which made even young hourly workers millionaires. The PepsiCo boss was removed from the position. His replacement was a friend of the owner of the company, who was the worse boss I ever had. He had no degree but knew the right people as he was an older man. I left for a higher VP slot. My advice is get at least a 4 year degree. If you don't have a 4 year degree you will not ascend unless you have a friend pull you up. And with the lack of a degree, it usually shows in lack of finesse and smarts. But, you never know, if you are a master politician like the aforementioned terrible boss, you may do okay until that connection leaves. ",

When his company was bought out by an Indian firm, the guys came in and started laying people off. My Uncle was the only one who knew how the software worked for the company, because he was the guy who wrote it. But, he was stuck because he had to train a replacement and then they were going to let him go. He had no choice but to train his guy, because he had no formal training and could not get hired anywhere else. he is now in the process of moving out of the posh neighborhood he lived in and back east to a crappy repugnicunt area. I also know of a guy who had trained as Cal Poly, who was hired in his junior year to work during the summer to rewrite all of the COBOL code the firm had into C. They had to start form scratch because no one knew the COBOL language. ",
