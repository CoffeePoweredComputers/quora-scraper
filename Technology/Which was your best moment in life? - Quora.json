            "answer_text": "Hello! quora users. This is based on friendship and one of the best moments of my life. Hope you enjoy this. There were high and low going in our friendship. By the way, it is proceeding even better now. Picking out one of my best moments of life, Iam quite excited and have started to pen down few words to portray that limited moment that will rest for the entire of my life in memories. I can't forget that day as everyone was exchanging good views and wishes, simultaneously granting access to the new year. On that day, I was scrolling feeds and perceiving status on the phone. It is around 1 o'clock when a notification popped up. Uncertainly, I tapped. Hey! I was on high, it was 'her' text. It is true that it's been a long time we never conversed. We baded each other and the conversation had picked up its speed. Though, it's fascinating to predict one's expression and purification of consideration to pay back a good return. We even can't get rid of these activities, anyhow. But I agree that I'm unaware of what she was going to ask that day. Her serene texts made me tilted more towards the screen. She asked if i was busy. I replied in negotiation and urged her to tell the matter. She was a quite nervous, I realised. But hesitatingly, she put down all the worthy texts that she would have typed earlier and stocked for the right time. Worried about the texts on the screen, I went through that. Without a consultation to my mind, I responded positively. Ridiculous! Na. I can assure you that she might also be amazed with my quick reply. Actually, she needed my help on some uncertain circumstances. I was attentive as well as grateful to her choice. These type of situation barely come where you have the opportunity to develop the emphasis of your friendship. Bearing the famous proverb in mind -\"A friend in need is a friend indeed.\", We discussed how to accomplish the task and agreed to meet at a fixed place and time. On the other hand, I had considered to meet her in person before. It was exceptional. Isn't it,? Incidentally, to meet her in person was not the prior decision at the time but to solve the issue. Forwarding... I rushed as I was late and reached the exact place ASAP. I came to know that she had already arrived there early waiting on the messy street. I could recognise her hesitant face and the same was mine. I felt that tranquility dissipated the surrounding in that noisy street. We baded each other with a beautiful smile on both the faces and started walking down the streets, briefing towards her home. It was a pleasant walk. Regardless of being engaged in mind, she initiated, \"Have you faced any problem in the way?\". \"Do you really think so?\", I replied confidently counterasking her question and then said, \"No, not at all.\" She gave me a magnificent smile. We moved further and shared the outline of the things happened after school. I desperately wanted to grip that priceless insights for the rest of the time. But the melody moment was going to be dull, I knew. Considering the foremost reason of the meeting, we decided to call that a day. After fixing the stuff, we intended to leave. The flavour of excitement turned tremendously unfair when she asked to leave with a vivacious smile on her face. I earnestly wanted to turn the insignificant situation into celebration but couldn't. I simply gave her a pretending smile back as agreement. She directed towards her way and I turned towards mine. The constant festival of appreciation faded away into the twilight of obscurity. I reached home and recieved a thanksgiving notification. I welcomed her. I was actually glad to come useful to the person I intended. This remains one of the best moments in my life. We are still in a way to make our friendship the eternal one. If you like it, please upvote to enhance my skills by appreciation. Thanks! ",
