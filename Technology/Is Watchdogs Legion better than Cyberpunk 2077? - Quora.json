            "answer_text": "I usually do not compare two unreleased game. But if you insist\u2026.. however I won\u2019t be comparing them straight ahead. I\u2019ll just explain the two games and will leave that deciding part for you. So, Cyberpunk 2077 will be coming in November and Watchdogs: Legion in October. One might think that both of them are based on a futuristic world so we\u2019ll get a similar gameplay, but in reality both of them has different ideologies. I\u2019ll start with Watchdogs: Legion. Watch Dogs: Legion  WD: L is the 3rd installment of esteemed WD series. All the previous games are based on same plot: A big city/ country is being controlled and manipulated by a tech giant and its handful of people. A group of hackers and activists goes to free the citizens from the vile grasp of the company. By the looks of it, WD:L ain\u2019t no different. However they do have a twist in their new game. We will be able recruit anyone and that NPC will become a playable character. Which means that will give us much more versatile gameplay. Which really makes this game interesting. Heard each of the character will have a origin story. So, if those stories are unique and not similar to each other, it will definitely be one of the best game releasing in 2020. Also each character will be having a somewhat unique stats, which I think is quite cool. Now comes the most anticipated game of 2020, Cyberpunk 2077  [Due to the success of Witcher 3, and its quality as a AAA game, CDPR is already one of the most hyped studio. And after announcing Cyberpunk, fans went crazy. Even after delayed many times, the hype didn\u2019t went cold, in fact it worked as a positive vibe for gamers around the world.] The game will feature a futuristic city, Nightcity. Where power is everything. Due to numerous faction and overly political environment, the game is probably far more complex than we think it is. And also there is more than one outcomes for missions(some quests even has seven different outcomes). They said even your approach may decide the outcome of the mission. Also gameplay is more versatile. In fact probably more than WD:L. In case of WD:L you have the choice of choosing different paths for your quests but here you can be, from a pacifist to a blood thirsty mercenary - everything. Until now whatever we\u2019ve seen, I can conclude that it is truly \u201cplay as you see fit\u201d. I guess there\u2019 no need to drag the article further. I hope by now you have a fair idea about both of the game world. Now it\u2019s up to you to decide which is better. cheers ",
