            "answer_text": "I think Neuralink is the most exciting bit of news I\u2019ve seen from the entirety of human experience. Sounds like overstating the case, I know. But see if you can follow me. I don\u2019t believe a person is a body, or a brain, I believe it\u2019s an operational database, a bit of learning AI, if you will. It happens that all such AI has thus far been resident in organic \u201cwetware\u201d but I personally believe in something that in other times might have been called a soul\u2026 but I don\u2019t believe it as some metaphysical entity, rather, I believe it as a manifestation of operant software. Which I\u2019m not wording well, but hopefully you see what I mean. I think, therefore, that there\u2019s no reason that we couldn\u2019t run that same AI in a different piece of hardware. We don\u2019t know how to go from \u201cmy brain\u201d to a computer, but there\u2019s no reason to think it can\u2019t be done. But how do you get there? We sure as hell don\u2019t know. Here\u2019s my thinking, though. What if you augment my brain. Once upon a time, this meant composing a poem and telling it to other people. Then it was the written word. Then it was books. Then it was voice recording, and photography. Then movies, silents, then talkies. Keeping a diary, a journal. That\u2019s become blogging, and then live blogging. And note taking, tons of note taking. But it\u2019s also an abacus, a calculator, a spreadsheet, ways to augment your ability to do math. A mirror, a lens, a telescope, binoculars, microscopes, eyeglasses, contacts. Neuralink expands on that \u201cprosthetic for your brain\u201d idea, but more directly. Start with simple \u201ccell phone\u201d type operations. Then consider entering virtual space directly, ala World of Warcraft or Second Life, or what a lot of people are doing now, holding meetings virtually in Red Dead Redemption rooms. As we\u2019ve seen with Smart Phones, when you have the technology, you find more and more ways to use it. Those short term goals are all admirable. And important. And useful. Which is part of why this is a good idea. But not why I think \u201cmost important idea ever.\u201d  So what if eventually I get Alzheimer's, but we\u2019ve managed to figure out how to store up some decision making, some memory triggers, some, well, of the executive function that lets me be me, in the machine I\u2019m neuralinked to. Move more and more of \u201cme\u201d into the cloud. What if, eventually, so much of \u201cme\u201d is in the cloud that when I get a service interruption, the router crashes or wifi goes out or whatever, but the \u201cme in the clouds\u201d doesn\u2019t notice. If I can discard this meat puppet, then there\u2019s no reason I can\u2019t live forever, there\u2019s no reason I can\u2019t make backup copies of \u201cme,\u201d there\u2019s nothing to stop me downloading into a robot body to explore Mars or Mercury or Titan or Pluto, or sending myself in a lightweight probe that takes a few decades to reach a nearby star, or well, anything. Including playing World Of Warcraft. Or participating in virtual meetings with you groundlings. Will it work? No. But that\u2019s Elon\u2019s whole approach to everything. Build it anyway, then test it, then learn from the mistakes and build a new better one that doesn\u2019t work either, repeat repeat repeat. Sadly, I may well be dead before we get to the level I hope to eventually see this at. But not necessarily. And if I\u2019m right about how it goes, it\u2019s not the \u201cimmortality but only for the few at the top\u201d scenario, it\u2019s cheap and plentiful and anyone can participate. I don\u2019t have the money, or I\u2019d be funding this myself. There\u2019s nothing more important, and yes, that also includes Elon\u2019s Starship project. ",
