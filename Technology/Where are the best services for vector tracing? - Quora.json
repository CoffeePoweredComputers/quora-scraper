            "answer_text": "Hi, it's a nice question. I think the best vector design software is illustrator. But if you want to trace any design, you should use the \u201cvector magic\u201d software. But here is some problems. You can't get the proper result when you trace a complex graphic. But when you trace a simple graphic in \u201cvector magic\u201d, you will get better result than illustrator. Thanks, have a great day. Shahadat Hossain Design Artis. ",
