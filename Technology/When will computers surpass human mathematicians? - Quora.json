            "answer_text": "This is a little misleading\u2026 Computers aren\u2019t technically better than humans at chess (although I suppose that sounds hard to believe), they just beat them in timed chess matches because they work faster. The algorithm programmed into the computer isn\u2019t \u201csuperior\u201d to the way the chess master thinks; in fact it\u2019s vastly inferior. The computer just has an edge because it can store a large amount of information, and can process this information much faster than a human can. Besides that, the concept of a computer beating a human at \u201cmath\u201d kind of implies that math itself is a contest. If what you really want to know is, how long until a computer can beat a human at a math contest, then take the first pocket calculator ever invented, and see if the fastest human calculator ever can beat it in a multiplying contest. I guess my basic point here, is that computers aren\u2019t really smarter than humans in anything, although it may at times seem that way. They\u2019re just faster, and that makes them seem smarter.

But the intentions always comes from humans. We pay the electricity bill. Computers having free will and produce interesting math, is not in my crystal ball. Not that it will never happen, but its not around the corner. The problem has to do with computers lack of understanding, well.. anything. Computers can beat the worldmaster in chess, without knowing what chess are. The same with the game Go. Roger Penrose in his book The Emperors New Mind, talks a lot about computers lack of understanding and even proves that mathematical understanding is non computable and therefore beyound the grasp of computers. Not everybody accepts his proof or share his point of view, but the fact that computers are nowhere near waking up, gives him a +. ",
