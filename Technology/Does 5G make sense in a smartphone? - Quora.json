            "answer_text": "Its priorities! If you want large database info. Input and output YES. If all you do is text and talk NO. FOR at least the next year for so the 5 G system is in the conction stage and the present services are limited in geographical scope, i.e. if you live close to a 5 G cell site then your in go for it. Do the research to see if your travel itinerary matches coverage then the new phone cost is justified The new T Mobile 600 mhz 5 G service has a larger geographical footprint but slower speeds slightly faster than 4 G so is it worth the cost of a new phone??? Once the merger is complete T Mobike -Sprint and the new Dish Network all 5 G system is built ( hopefully within 3 yrs???) And Verizon and ATT impliment 5 G then 5 G life in America going to be informative and exciting WOW . For now just go visit S. KOREA and you can see how 5 G works as well as the new OTA TV system ASTC 3.0 LIFE IS GOOD. ",

Of course if I told you 15 years ago that watching movies and TV on your phone would be common, that online shopping threaten most shopping malls, and telemedicine would be a thing, you likely wouldn't have believed me.
