            "answer_text": "Oneplus Nord is a good phone when it comes to features and specs. Only downside is the higher price which is also justified when you consider the fact that it supports 5G. Oneplus Nord is essentially a Oneplus 7t with 5G with Oneplus 8 Camera Sensor. If you are willing to spend that much money you can go for it or you can buy similarly designed realme phones but they dont have 5G ",
