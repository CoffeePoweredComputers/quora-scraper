            "answer_text": "They affect our choices a lot. Media are giants in today's society, no generation today wasn't born with the media as a background noise. I don't use the word noise pejoratively, but to show the extent to which we were all conditioned to have the media around since babyhood. We all learned to live with them, and more often than not, we learned to trust them at first glance. I wrote on another question how we all have internalized the reflex to trust whatever is being told to us in a professional, assertive tone, and under the banner of an institution such as a TV Company or a newspapers. I have also added on that question that the media aren't inherently a bad thing, but that it is our system that make them so. No matter which country you live in, Western or not, there is a high probability that the media aren't telling you everything, consciously or not.  And the problem is that since we trust these media, and that the youngest of us will usually trust them even more, we are almost raised with the ideas they pertain whether we like it or not. It is up to us to educate ourselves, to read through different sort of media, to compare articles of different organizations that are in conflict on the same topic, etc... we need to form our own opinion, because as to this, I can tell you without a doubt that children, teenagers and even adults, trust the media to tell them how to live and how to think.  Even the most transparent media aren't completely impartial, nor are they almighty. Media today shape culture more than it should : we become accustomed to take for a fact everything it throws at us whether we might agree with it or not after reflection. Things such as gender roles, what you should do of your life, what you should wear to look beautiful, what you should not do so not to look like a looser, etc... not to mention the harmful stereotypes it pertains on certain minorities or about certain topics. Media are no longer an option for anybody, we must think for ourselves as a reflex or they will influence us invariably. So the question no longer is : how do media influence us? But mostly : what part of existence the media do not influence us about?  A much trickier question to answer.   ",

            "answer_text": "It affects me. Perhaps not as you might expect. I have very little exposure. I regulate my media intake. I read (online) newspapers for news, not blurbs but comprehensive reporting that relies on investigation, review and analysis. I subscribe to reputable sources from across the ideological spectrum. Some things I read disturb me. That\u2019s a good sign. If I don\u2019t get disturbed then I am not paying attention. I do not watch any network television. It\u2019s mind poison. I have watched 1 minute thirty seven seconds of reality television in my life. I know that because it was provided in an article I was interested in. Even that brief exposure reinforces my impression that reality tv is mind killing drivel, made for the stupid to keep them stupid. I do not use social media. I ignore advertising and am exposed to very little since my tv habits minimize it. I listen to satellite radio stations that don\u2019t advertise (much). I never buy books on the bestseller list. I do go to well reviewed restaurants but I often wonder why. I have no allegiance to any team sports, particularly pro teams since the point of team sport is tribalism and merchandising. Neither are attributes that interest me. Media affects me inasmuch as I have sharpened my personal skills to the degree that I\u2019m somewhat inoculated against it. When exposed to it, my immediate sense is to reject it. The upside? I know myself. I\u2019m not the product of advertising and propaganda. I am free from being influenced by entities that benefit from cultivating lemmings. I\u2019m particularly gratified that my methods prevented me from ever considering a pathological liar and turncoat, a grade B reality TV celebrity as a viable leader of my country. Those methods continue to inform me of that. ",
