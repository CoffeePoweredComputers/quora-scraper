            "answer_text": "First off, it's always ok. But in deciding which route to go, there are a few things to keep in mind. Users will be most familiar with .com,.net, .org domains and will associate .com and .net domains with commerce. To which degree this may affect an editor's, poster's, commenter's decision of linking a given domain is a matter of debate at best. But human perception is undoubtedly influenced by a constant weighting of normal vs. abnormal by thresholding a stimulus against a set-point. This way of human perception affects the overall context of any decision making process. If it is worth considering depends on the context, and if your gut feeling is telling you to lean towards a certain domain-extension then by all means, go for it. Here is what Matt Cutts, a senior engineer at Google, had to say about its effects on SEO:  .info, .biz, .com, .org, .net, .name domains differ significantly in price, whose appreciation or depreciation is largely controlled by the free market. See the Internet Domain Name Index.General Top Level Domains /gTLD carry with them buyer/user intent, which will slightly affect the overall standing within the SERPs, but the choice of gLTD is insignificant compared to the weight of even one strong/credible ingoing link.Contrarily, Sponsored Top Level Domains, which are generally not accessible to everyone do significantly impact a a site's search engine score.Country Code Top Level Domains such as .us, .ca, .uk, .in, .ir will will significantly affect the ranking of a site among the national search results, unless the user searches internationally. Of much greater significance is however the detected language and character-set of the site's content, to which the domain points to.",

            "answer_text": ".com is still your best bet.  That being said, these days, domain choice is as much about branding as it is about SEO. If you can cleverly construct your brand name using it, almost any top level domain will do the trick.  What you should really pay attention to in this case is how long that name is. It is often better to get a shorter name with an off-brand top level domain, than to go through gymnastics to try to get a .com.  Personally I don't like .net, but that's just because it seems like the choice you made when you couldn't find a .com. More importantly, there is a really good chance that people will end up going to the .com version of the site, which can be awkward depending on what's sitting there. ",
