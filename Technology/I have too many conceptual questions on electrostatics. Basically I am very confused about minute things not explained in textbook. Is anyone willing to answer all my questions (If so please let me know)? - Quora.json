            "answer_text": "Thanks for A2A. Why don't you take out some time to google each term that you find confusing? Google will get you to some interesting animation sites even for some electrostatic topics. Some YouTube videos lucidly explain terms, ideas, mechanisms. I don't think if you do this exercise, you will still remain with any residual doubts. You can switch to Griffiths\u2019 for your actual study. Griffiths\u2019 style is conversational and fresh. Good luck \ud83d\ude00\ud83d\udc4d ",
