            "answer_text": "5G is still a long shot in India, as Government is yet to auction the 5G spectrum, where different telcos can only work on 5G technology after the allocation of the 5G spectrum. Getting a spectrum license and setting up the hardware for 5G and running internal testing and public rollout of the 5G network will take at least 6 months (might take up to a year, depending on the difficulty in the deployment of the 5G network.  It is safe to say that the 5G rollout in India will take at least six more months, and the first generation 5G smartphones are expected to cost a bomb in comparison to a 4G smartphone with similar specifications. If you are planning to buy a premium smartphone (do not expect to see a 5G smartphone under Rs 30,000 at least until 2020), then purchasing a 4G smartphones does make sense, as you can enjoy the latest technology at your fingertips, except for the 5G network.
