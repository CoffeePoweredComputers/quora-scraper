            "answer_text": "Hello, There are tonnes of websites offering free software for trial before you made a purchase. Even, many of these 'trial' software is suitable for a limited or personal use computer, so you don't need to buy a paid software for your home computer or a laptop. As per my experience, below are the best and trusted sites to download paid or free software. www.download.zone (New and small website but gives easy and simple download link) Product reviews, how-tos, deals, and the latest tech news (they have a lot of other popup videos to promote their other downloads) FileHippo.com - Download Free Software (Limited description) Descarga de Apps para Android - Descarga, descubre, comparte en Uptodown (Difficult to find a download button) Install or Update Multiple Apps at Once (Old style website) http://Alternative.to (Not much information other than showing options) This is my opinion, maybe your experience is different than mine. Cheers! ",

But first check their developers and support. This way you will protect yourself from malware and ads. I know a good software giveaway site can be hard to find. One good one I\u2019ve used is Giveaway Club, I haven\u2019t had any issues with it. ",
