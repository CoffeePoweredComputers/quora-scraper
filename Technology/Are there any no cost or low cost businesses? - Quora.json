            "answer_text": "Business is something which requires capital if you want to do it seriously, and if you want to do big, but there is nothing wrong with starting low and safe side but the opportunities you have here also diminishes with your risk. So let us take a look Low Cost Businesses took a boom due to the digital economy created, you can start a business in an instant and cash in profits. Service based You can create a Service Firm which can mean anything ranging from Accounting,Consulting,,.. etc , You can easily setup a website to cater your services, if you can\u2019t even afford a website you can create an Instagram page to consult you(Not a good choice if you are catering professional services) You can set this up offline only if you can afford an office space, If not doing it online is best as you can really reach out to huge potential customers. Remember always look for your niche ,don\u2019t follow the crowd. My cousin is great in making greeting cards, so I suggested her to make it a business, she instantly created an Instagram page and deployed it. You have to look for a service which you can provide exceptionally. If you don\u2019t have any special skill or have capital to hire. Then you are welcomed :) let us take a look at next kind of businesses you can do.(These kind are my favorite) Disrupting Supply chain Look for opportunities near you, and disrupt the chain. Let me tell you an example You can see a product near you which the local vendors are selling at a High Price and now trace back the way the product is distributed look at the chain, look at places where you can barge in and get the product for cheap and you can start selling it online or anyway you wish. Regarding the capital you have to get the product from vendor on credit. That\u2019s the best shot you got. I really suggest one to look for low level products to import directly from china, you can make deals with them through alibaba and start on low quantities(there you go so low cost) I would like to tell you one thing I didn\u2019t spoon feed any specific kind of business because you need to think that for yourself which suits your needs and your market and your capability. Just go out there and look,capture, disrupt the market. ",
