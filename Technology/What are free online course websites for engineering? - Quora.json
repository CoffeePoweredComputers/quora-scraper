            "answer_text": "Why you want to learn engineering ? Is it for academic interest ? or Is it inquisitiveness on an engineering subject ?For earning a qualified certificate, one does need to attend a college or University (full time or part-time)If it is out of academic interest there are many say Electrical Engineering Portal is an excellent resource of practical articles on electrical engineering. similarly Siemens have a an education portal. Schneider also has an portal (need to google it)The difference between an Engineer & a Doctor is engineering is all about analytical reasoning (like a telescope), whereas Doctor is all Diagnostic (microscope). Unless you have that analytical mind, one cannot be a true engineerThere is a wealth of free literature on practical aspects of engineering - say Metallurgy (refer to American Society of Metals - ASM Handbooks) available on Scribd - Read books, audiobooks, and more & other google free resources. They have plenty of practical information written in simple manner which can be learnt through self studyEngineering is always better learnt under a tutor to grasp quickly. (ignoring the calculations part).One can learn practical applications of engineering & its principles in about TWO years, by reading these published books and become a knowledgeable engineer on - Electrical, Instrumentation, Mechanical, Chemical.. provided you have some good tutor to guide you through.",
