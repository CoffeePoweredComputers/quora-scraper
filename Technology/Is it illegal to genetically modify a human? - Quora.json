            "answer_text": "The answer depends on what you\u2019re genetically modifying and where you are. Gene therapy, which modifies somatic cells (cells that are not involved in reproduction/the modification will not be passed on to offspring), is widely legal and subject to normal regulations that would apply to any new drug being tested on humans. Human genetic engineering, such as cloning humans, changing embryonic or germ cell genes (\u201cdesigner babies\u201d) and other technologies meant to genetically modify entire humans from birth are more complicated. Here is a link to a table that summarizes the regulations in most countries as of 2007. In the United States, there are no federal regulations covering human genetic modification of this kind, but the NIH will not fund any study that genetically modifies human embryos. ",
