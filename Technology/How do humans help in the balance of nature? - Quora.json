            "answer_text": "They don't help much currently and their arguments for \u201csaving the planet\u201d are often void of sense. The best I heard of late was that cattle poo is destructive to the environment, so numbers should be decreased by outlawing meat! Let's assume it's true for a moment. Would it be better to use hazardous chemical fertilizers and genetically modified seeds than using natural and organic seeds and fertilizer - poo? I learned about the ecosystem and how everything works in interrelated cycles in elementary grades at school. Isn't it taught anymore or is this more \u201cscience\u201d proven wrong since? Fact is I know it isn't wrong because I have actually seen it work in practice. But we have become so fixated on ideoligies and activism that even \u201cscience\u201d is set against science and then we wonder why parents object to their children being immunized? So even environmental activists often do more harm than good, due to emotionally charged rhetoric and not providing real, common sense solutions. We need to balance nature earnestly, but despite our supposed tremendous intellectual capacity we're not doing very well at it? ",

To accomplish this, \u2018creation\u2019 is the fundamental desire of all the creations and like \u201cfeeling-tones\u201d attract so that emotional energy units [EE\u2019s]develop. EE\u2019s vary in size and move in space, not through space. In simple words, \u201cfeeling-tones\u201d balance both the human mind and nature. Humanity has been really hijacked over the last 300 years by empires, control and wealth. Indigenous people around the world remained in balance with nature and Love/Light. The darkness of greed has expanded intellectual intelligence at the expense of feelings and emotions. Modern man and his science now see\u2019s reality as a mechanical construct of atoms, heat and pressure. He happily destroys as much as he can with his big machines and eats whatever moves. People are awakening around the planet. Because of our unique bellicose nature and potential great compassion, we have brought ourselves to the brink of destruction so that our great compassion can be ignited. This will temper our bellicose natures so that we can become a great asset for nature and our universe, which is the solar system. We are beginning a new cycle of consciousness into the fourth density of love and light. We are a new type of creature and we will learn very quickly to regain our respect for planet earth and her unique beauty and nature. She is like the most beautiful woman you could imagine with battle scars around her body and a vivid scar across her brow. She is a loving and devoted amazon mother and we all better grow into young adult warriors of love and light pretty quickly. As children we have given her a pretty hard time and she loves us for it. That is what unconditional love is. ",
