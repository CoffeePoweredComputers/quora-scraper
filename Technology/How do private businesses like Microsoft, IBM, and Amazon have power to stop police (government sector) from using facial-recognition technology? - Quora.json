            "answer_text": "There are several considerations at work here. Firstly, each FRS is proprietary and licensed to the firm that crafted it. If the license is suspended for any reason, the software is no longer supported. All a lawyer defending a client who was drawn into a criminal case on the basis of a FRS-generated ID would need to do is point out to the officiating judge this one simple fact, and the case would (or should) be dismissed instantly. Secondly, each FRS typically has its own proprietary data format, and the database of corresponding facial data-arrays is maintained by the manufacturer. All a vendor has to do is unplug the database server(s) that maintain this dataset, and the rest of the world can go whistle. Thirdly, if a client is discovered to have independently made an unlicensed copy of their portion of the FRS database and continues to use it after the vendor pulls the licensing, then that constitutes criminal fraud, violation of license provisions, Contract Violation, Intellectual Property theft, and possibly a few other charges of note. I\u2019m sure a lawyer would be delighted to brief you on all the many reasons this is a bad idea. ",

            "answer_text": "First off, these companies are using this as a marketing tool. Second, the media raises issues with these systems but fails to mention that it\u2019s the companies that created them who are responsible for fixing them before they are deployed. While proprietary software and systems can carry use restrictions, to include how or where the creator allows end users to use it, this whole thing is more PR than actionable. IBM, Amazon and other companies created these systems and marketed them to to government, taking millions of dollars for research and development- yet they don\u2019t mention the systems have shortfalls or error rates that make them dubious. While the current state of facial recognition software applications is neat stuff, it\u2019s not a panacea and still has work to be done for it to be reliable enough for truly effective uses, particularly in the public safety domain. With the reports of error rates and other issues in the news people are naturally concerned, but what the news fails to report is that the issues with these systems and responsibilities for them rest squarely with the developers- the ones who created the systems in the first place.
