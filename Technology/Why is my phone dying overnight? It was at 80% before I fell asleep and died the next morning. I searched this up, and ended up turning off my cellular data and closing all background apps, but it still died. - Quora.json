            "answer_text": "If you are leaving your phone on, disable the WiFi connection so it doesn\u2019t continually search for WiFi as this will drain the battery faster. I also suggest that you keep the phone connected to the charger over night. That way you will always have a full charge in the morning. If your phone still discharges too fast you will have to replace the battery. Unfortunately with most modern cell phones, battery replacement is not a simple task and you may have to return it to a manufacturer\u2019s rep to get the battery replaced. Unless you have an expensive Iphone it may be more cost effective to simply buy a new phone. ",

            "answer_text": "Often times, a cell phone will drain it\u2019s battery while fruitlessly looking for a Wi-Fi spot or cell tower to connect to. The effort takes much more energy then transmitting to an existing hotspot. Depending on where you live, or where the cell phone is, you might want to turn off your phone at night. ",
