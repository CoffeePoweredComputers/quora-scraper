            "answer_text": "Google's biggest threat is Baidu. On the 20 year timeframe, if China rises and America declines, Baidu could easily displace Google. They're the only company that can. Baidu has all of the same expertise Google has in search, data centers, and AI. If China grows in importance, this will naturally improve Baidu's position. Google faces a revenue threat to its display ads from voice and AI searches, which may dramatically reduce the number of ads it can serve. But Google is the market leader in AI, so it will probably be able to transition its revenue source to AI if needed. Other than Baidu and AI, I see no threats to Google. Facebook has a much less steady position. It isn't clear that social media is actually a net benefit to its customers, particularly in its present form. Facebook is full of angry political rants and misinformation. Instagram is a bit better but is transparently a status competition that people may tire of. There is a ton of latent demand for something better. A startup may come up with some new paradigm that fixes those problems and knocks Facebook and Instagram out of the lead. Or people may simply decide to stop using Facebook and Instagram. This is a real threat even within the next 5 years. Facebook has WhatsApp and Oculus Rift as backup plans, so it won't go away completely. But WhatsApp never made much money and probably never can, and it's not clear that VR will ever be more than a niche market. So there is a very real possibility that Facebook could see an order of magnitude drop in revenue in the next 5\u201310 years. Edit: I'm being consistently told in the comments that Baidu is not very good and not a threat to Google. So perhaps Google will reign unchallenged. ",

            "answer_text": "The failure to realize that they can\u2019t control what people want to see in their feed. Let\u2019s take Facebook first. How easy can you reach a feed that\u2019s 1 month old? Through various data science tests Facebook has found out that filtering does decrease advertising revenue. Because if I have good filtering, I can reach more easily companies I need \u2013 hence they have less incentive to try to get to the top of my feed. Hence less revenue. The same is with Google, 90% of people don\u2019t scroll through first page. What if Google built a sophisticated search facets that can enable us to filter, refine and analyze the result set \u2013 to pinpoint the most relevant result? It also will decrease revenue. So I believe that company that realizes a sophisticated filtering and focuses on giving humans more choice to find what they need \u2013 rather than try to maximize the revenue of the advertisers \u2013 this will be the company that will have a chance in taking down these giants. Because now, we consider Google and Facebook as the only truth. But I think that just as in real life \u2013 you don\u2019t trust the first person you\u2019ve spoken to. In the digital world, through the advances of AI we\u2019ll see more engines that provide us with information and choices. Hence the power that Google and Facebook now have will diminish \u2013 because it is not in the human nature to prefer to be manipulated by 2 companies, rather than to have the options and choices.

They have dominant market positions in search and social networking. Many have tried to beat them and failed. Microsoft spent billions on Bing Search to compete with Google search. It failed miserably. Google spent billions on Google+ to compete with Facebook. It also failed miserably. Many have tried to compete with Amazon 9n eCommerce, and failed. These are \u201cwinner take all\" markets. The dominant leader can't be beaten by traditional tactics. The real threats to Google, Facebook, Amazon, Apple, or Microsoft are legal blunders, or government intervention on antitrust or privacy issues. These companies would not knowingly violate any laws. The risks are too high. The problem is that the laws of hundreds of countries are different, confusing, changing all the time, and contradictory to each other. It is nearly impossible to figure out the legal meaning of these vague and aggressive laws. Complying with one countries laws could mean violating another's. ",

            "answer_text": "facebook seems having hard time to attract the generation Z and young milennials because the plattform is perceived as the source of hoax news perpetuated by the older people (older millenials, gen x, and baby boomers). Facebook has tried to mitigate this by implementing facebook stories, which have a mixed result it seems. I think the younger generations will prefer to stay in instagram as the social media of choice since the contents are really focused visuals and it discourages people to post political rants. at some point I expect instagram\u2019s active users will outnumber facebook, and it will replace facebook as the social media of choice for the marketers. at the moment I don\u2019t see any companies can disturb the status quo, but we can never tell, who knows if a super app (such as wechat) will become successful in the future and dethrone the king of social media?

Logically, if someone will change the status quo of mobile attention market, it will shake the economic basis of the duopoly. I believe, it will be the combination of new blockchain-based attention economy players like Brave and yes us (IM+ social browser is preparing a reverse ICO to build a decentralized self-serve attention platform with social influence score). With tokenized micro-payments these players will give the attention economy back to people, and the role of Google and Facebook will gradually decrease. ",
