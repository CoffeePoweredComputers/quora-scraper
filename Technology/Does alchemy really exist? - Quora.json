            "answer_text": "Have you ever witnessed a butterfly hatching out of a caterpillar? That is pure alchemy. It is happening all around you. Alchemy is transformation. Have you ever seen a dedicated frog with no heartbeat come back to life when it rains? Google it. Life emerging from a dead frog. Have you ever heard of thr biological transformation of the elements, like chickens creating calcium from another element? Google it. Chickens don\u2019t eat much calcium, yet they lay eggs. How would you explain that without using the term transmutation (alchemy). It certainly ain\u2019t chemistry. The soil converts aluminum to zinc. Transformative enough for you? How about the transmutation of elements using bacteria, coming out of Russia? Yeah, they\u2019ve got smart scientists that are not as restricted in research as American scientist are. http://www.currentscience.ac.in/Volumes/108/04/0636.pdf Alchemy has been known to be around us for many years. It\u2019s an accepted phenomenon. We know so little about the elements around us and how they behave. Did you know that fusing an electron with a proton could create a neutron. We don\u2019t even know what a neutron is. So, don\u2019t listen to those chemists who think they know everything. They are just scratching the surface. How about we get serious about physical chemistry and figure out what a neutron is. There are too many established naysayers and not enough innovators. Many of these established scientists don\u2019t even go in the lab anymore. Yet they control the purse strings for grant money. Boy, talk about a fraudulent distribution of money. ;-). That means a big NO for funding microbial transmutation of elements. Cheers ",

            "answer_text": "Alchemy was the practice of transmutting one substance into another, or of creating one thing from the combining of other elements. Most famously, this was a quest for turning common metals into gold.  If we define gold as a yellow, soft metal, then yes, alchemy really \"existed\" and some alchemists were even successful. Mind, they didn't create real gold, just alloys that had the same appearance.  Note, another goal of the alchemist was the creation of an homunculus; that is, the creation of a human-like creature without the use of sexual reproduction. A few alchemists claimed to have been successful, but despite the prestige, such an achievement would have granted not a one ever allowed others to see the creature. Thus, it is believed that they failed miserably on this account. ",
