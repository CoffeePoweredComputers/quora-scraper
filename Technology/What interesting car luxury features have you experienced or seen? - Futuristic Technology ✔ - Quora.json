            "answer_text": "ANSWER CREDIT Shahaab Sherwani Got a couple! Some of these are downright stupid, while others are actually useful, but all are interesting to say the least.  BMW has this (comical) gesture control feature. You twirl your finger in front of the screen to raise and lower the volume, gesture right and left to go through menus, and so on. It sounds cool, but works terribly, especially the volume control, much easier to just give us a dial to turn!  Volvo has paid quite a lot of attention in creating a sound system that actually sounds good (even to audiophiles). They have different sound stages, and one is called driver centric. So it\u2019ll focus on giving you, the driver, the best audio quality and honestly, I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s a gimmick or not but it sounds phenomenal. You\u2019re just so absorbed into the music, everything is so clear and punchy and deep. It\u2019s really cool  Land Rovers steering wheel controls are interesting because the buttons change depending on the menu. So, let\u2019s say you\u2019re in the default menu, if you look at the left set of controls, you\u2019ll see you can change the volume, change the radio station, activate voice control and make a phone call. But let\u2019s say you in the settings menu, the buttons will change from volume controls, to up, down, right and left arrows! I\u2019m not sure how they pulled this off, maybe there are little individual LCD screens behind each button? Either way, a very nice feature indeed It\u2019s a cool idea and honestly it works well, for me at least  Another Land Rover one (though many other cars may have this as well)! Depending on where you sit, looking at the screen from different angles will show you different things. So the passenger can watch a movie, while the driver sees a completely different view! Pretty neat stuff  Now, I don\u2019t entirely know how Tesla pulled this off, but it\u2019s real neat. Look, there are no visible air vents. That one strip is the massive air vent, and you control the direction of the air, up, down, right or left, by the infotainment screen in the middle. A bit gimmicky? Yeaah kind of, but it\u2019s cool  Aston Martin had a $25,000 option of including their proximity watch in 2006. The watch had a transponder in it, just as your key would, so you could simply wear the watch, walk up to your car, start it and drive away (without having the key). The watch looks cool, not sure if it\u2019s worth the price of a brand new Mazda 3, but then again, I don\u2019t live that lavish so I can\u2019t make those judgement calls!  Mercedes granite interior trim. Yup, that exists  Mercedes built in perfume dispenser. Itll cycle the smell of your choosing through the HVAC, cool idea and honestly, it\u2019s a good idea. I just wished it didn\u2019t cost an arm and a leg.  Okay this isn\u2019t anything special but I\u2019m really liking this new trend of metal speaker grills. They look SOO cool. And this is how the Bose system looks like on the Mazda 3. Certainly not considered a luxury car but a cool trend nonetheless.  Lexus and their cool as hell glass interior trim. I absolutely adore this, this has got to be the nicest trim you can have in a car. Looks stellar, especially with that leather and hand folded fabric triangle pieces!  Rolls Royce and their star headliner. The ceo of the company I work for has a Phantom and the stars on his headliner reflect the night that his mother was born. Yes, if you ask Rolls Royce nicely enough, they\u2019ll research the star pattern for you on a particular night in a particular location and custom make the headliner for you. Insane right?  Diamond. Headlights. !!!!!! On the Lykan hypersport. .
