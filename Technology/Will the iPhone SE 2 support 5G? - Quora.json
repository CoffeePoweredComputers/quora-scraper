While yes there has been some speculation in the past week about it happening, it\u2019s very unlikely as the iPhone 7 will be dropping in price so low in the next two weeks, an iPhone SE2 wouldn\u2019t make sense and further complicate Apples\u2019 iPhone lineup. So think of the iPhone 7 as an \u201cSE2\u201d. ",
