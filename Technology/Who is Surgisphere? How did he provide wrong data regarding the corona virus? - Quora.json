It provided data, subsequently found to be unreliable, for studies of COVID-19 that were published in The Lancet and The New England Journal of Medicine in May 2020 then retracted on 4 June 2020. The Lancet study had earlier influenced the World Health Organization to halt global trials of the drug hydroxychloroquine to treat COVID-19 The dataset from a claimed 1200 hospitals had errors, including the listing of an Asian hospital as being in Australia, and no indications of how Surgisphere could collect the data, and was widely criticised. As a result, on 28 May over 200 researchers and doctors from various countries published \"An open letter to Richard Horton, editor of The Lancet, regarding Mehra et al,\" stating \"Both the numbers of cases and deaths, and the detailed data collection, seem unlikely. Science Magazine said critics had pointed out many red flags in the Lancet paper, including the astonishing number of patients involved and details about their demographics and prescribed dosing that seem implausible.

Critics identified anomalies in the data. They doubted that a tiny firm like Surgisphere, with a scant public track record in AI, few employees, and no publicly named scientific board, could convince hundreds of unidentified hospitals in dozens of nations to share complex, protected, and legally fraught patient data.
