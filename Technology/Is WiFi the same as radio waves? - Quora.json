            "answer_text": "Wi-Fi is a set of standards for local area network communications that makes use of radio frequencies - but not FM radio frequencies. The modulation and coding differs substantially from FM radio as well, as Wi-Fi trades coverage range for higher data throughput. Below is a comparison: AM radio: 535\u20131,605 kHzCB radio: 26.9-27.4 MHz (1,000 times higher than kHz)FM radio: 88\u2013108 MHzWi-Fi: 2412\u20132484, 3657\u20133693, 4910\u20134990, 5030\u20135875, or 5850\u20135925 GHz (1,000 times higher than MHz)The associated wavelengths of each signal are: AM radio: 602-1,809 feetCB radio: 35 feetFM radio: 9\u201311 feetWi-Fi: 2\u20135 inchesThis leads to differences in antenna size:  CB whip antennas  Wi-Fi antenna ",

            "answer_text": "WiFi is radio, Anything above infrared is radio waves, that is under 300 GHz. They vary hugely on frequency, AM radio is about 1 MHz, FM radio about 100 MHz, TV is about 50\u2013700 MHz, Mobile phones about 1\u20132 GHz. WiFi is about 2\u20135 GHz. As a general rule higher frequency allows more data to be transmitted but it does not transmit as far as lower frequences. ",
