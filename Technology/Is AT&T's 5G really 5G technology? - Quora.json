            "answer_text": "No it's not really 5G. Here is an excert from an article published on Tom's guide Web site. 5GE, or 5G Evolution, is merely AT&T's name for its latest and iteration of LTE, which utilizes specific technologies, like 256 QAM, 3-way carrier aggregation and 4X4 MIMO that will play a role in 5G's ultimate development. 5GE is available in 400 markets and counting.

In fact, other carriers like Verizon and T-Mobile already have it too, have for years and simply call it LTE Advanced. Mobile insights firm OpenSignal recently published data from speed tests comparing 5GE to rival networks' LTE, and found that AT&T's service was actually slower. The 28.8 Mbps result from 5GE trailed Verizon's 29.9 Mbps and T-Mobile's 29.4 Mbps. We tested AT&T's 5GE network against T-Mobile and Verizon's 4G LTE networks and found that 5GE downloads were consistently slower than 4G LTE in New York City. Even in ideal circumstances, 5GE should merely provide speeds averaging around 40 Mbps. That's a hair faster than AT&T's current 37.1 Mbps average that we recorded when we conducted our nationwide test of the fastest wireless networks in the U.S. last summer, but still well behind Verizon's 57.3 Mbps.
