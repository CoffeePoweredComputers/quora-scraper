            "answer_text": "The short answer is \"yes\". In most materials electrons are moving when electricity is being conducted. In p-type semiconductors a material's lattice is doped with small amounts of atoms with fewer electrons than the atoms of the bulk of the lattice and holes, which are places where an electron is not present, do the conduction. Also there are some materials in which positive ions can be conducted, see Beta-alumina solid electrolyte. Inside the battery being charged ions will be conducted between the barrery's electrodes, but the input to the battery is electrons. ",
