            "answer_text": "A killer robot is a fully autonomous weapon that can select and engage targets without human intervention. They do not currently exist but advances in technology are bringing them closer to reality. Those in favour of killer robots believe the current laws of war may be sufficient to address any problems that might emerge if they are ever deployed, arguing that a moratorium, not an outright ban, should be called if this is not the case. However, those who oppose their use believe they are a threat to humanity and any autonomous \"kill functions\" should be banned. ",

            "answer_text": "If you go just by the name, it means any robot that can kill. However, the term \u2018Killer Robots\u2019 is specifically used for autonomous robots that can fire a weapon without a direct input from a human being, and potentially kill. Such a robotic system can be implemented in a drone, ship, tank, submarine, aircraft or any other robot for that matter. The difference between killer drones and \u2018killer robots\u2019 is that, at present, the drones don\u2019t think for themselves. A human operator is behind it and the command to fire the weapon is given by a human. IF they drone could automatically determine whether to fire or not, and then fire itself (without any input from a person), then that robot would be called a \u2018Killer Robot\u2019 A very good and detailed article you can read to get to know more about such systems and robots is here: Autonomous Killer Robots Are Here To Stay - Chex Technologies. In it, they have detailed what are they, what do different countries and reseachers think about such systems, and who are the people against these killer robots and what is their reasoning. If you need to know anything more specific, don\u2019t hesitate to ask :) ",
