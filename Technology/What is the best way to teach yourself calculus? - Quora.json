            "answer_text": "By teaching yourself Calculus you will be joining an elite society of those who wondered enough about the way things work to defy the 'wisdom' of friends and family alike, and to undertake what many would say is impossible: an effort to deepen one's own understanding of the universe and its workings. Teaching yourself calculus is a great idea for so many reasons. It will allow you to be \"ahead of the game\", when the competitiveness of college courses takes all of the fun out of learning calculus. If you don't wish to take calculus at a university or college, you will be learning one of the supreme achievements of human ingenuity, one of humanity's greatest cultural accomplishments. Also, you will be sharpening your knowledge of the basics of the mathematics of technical people of all kinds. You have already accomplished the first step: believing that you can learn anything you set your mind to. In my philosophy, the first step to solving any problem is believing that a solution exists and that you can find it. You are well on your way. In this era of readily obtained knowledge through the internet, the question almost becomes \"How can't you teach yourself calculus?\" For a quick internet fix, (and this applies to anything you want to learn these days,) 3 main sites come to mind: Youtube, Google, Wikipedia. Find a video presentation you can relate to, then dig in to an online article. View some example problem sets at Khan academy, try out some others, then check your answers at Wolfram Alpha. Watch complete lectures at MIT's open courseware, or from a whole host of other colleges and universities, all free! I would be remiss not to tell you to open a book, however. James Stewart's Calculus is probably the Cadillac of all the text books. As an independent learner you may not want or need such a big, expensive text book right away. The great list of popular calculus self-help titles is mostly absent from all but the best bookstore shelves these days, but they include: \"How to Ace Calculus: the Streetwise Guide\", and Eli S. Pine's \"How to Enjoy Calculus\", along with many, many others. When you learn Calculus, don't stop there! Roger Penrose's \"The Road to Reality\" will take you from basic math to quantum gravity, the LEX foundation's \"Who is Fourier?\" takes kids from arithmetic to Fourier analysis, and I personally am indebted to Robert B Ash's \"Calculus Tutoring Book\", as well as his excellent, free, online introductions to abstract algebra, real, and complex analysis (including answers to all problems in the text). The only thing you need to make it as far as you need to go is the confidence to believe that you can and will understand anything you want to!  ",

            "answer_text": "I taught myself calculus at 12 by reading a book, \u201cUnified Calculus\u201d which presented simple ways to do calculus, not proofs with rigor. I already knew much about trig, but learned about hyper-trig and log/exp while working through the book. I figured it out as I went along. When I was in high school, I convinced the teacher I knew Algebra 2/Trig by taking the final exam and using identities he had forgotten and had to look up in the back of a text book. If you are a natural at algebra, you can do calculus much more effectively. It is critical to be able to solve for specific unknowns so that you can derive the formulas for ln(x) derivative, for example. If you look at terms such as (a+b)^2\u20134*a*b and have to figure out how to expand it, you may not have enough time to complete a calculus test, where you have to perform lots of algebra. When I took calculus in high school, we used Leithold\u2019s text, which showed the eps-delta proofs as the way to proving calculus. This is not helpful to a new student that needs to learn HOW to use calculus, not WHY calculus is valid, in my opinion. It made the hurdle unnecessarily high for many students, when what they really needed was some basic calculus to do Physics problems with integration and differentiation, so that the ideas of position, velocity, and acceleration would be viewed as s,s\u2019, and s\u2019\u2019, which would integrate (see what I did there) the concepts involved in motion. The idea of a line integral for Work done, the integral of vector Force dotted with differential vector dr along the path, made vector calculus an essential method to solve problems in engineering and physics. Solving all of these types of problems certainly made it easier for me to setup and solve the problems that I came across later on. I did take Analysis 18.100 at MIT, that is the correct place for eps-delta proofs, and ended up with enough math classes to qualify for a math degree, but I wrote a thesis in the Physics Dept and got my degree in Physics. You might also ask yourself if Newton and Leibnitz were self-taught in calculus. ",
