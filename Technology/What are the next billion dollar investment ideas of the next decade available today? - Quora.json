(GPUs - Graphics Processing Unit) Answers like Francisco Fonseca\u2019s, answer here (Francisco Fonseca's answer to What are the next billion dollar investment ideas of the next decade available today?) have stated things like Artificial Intelligence are the next billion dollar investment ideas of the next decade. Cryptocurrencies are also famous for making people millions in a few years. This is true. However, there is one highly important investment that is about to explode over the next decade. This one investment will empower Artificial Intelligence, Cryptocurrencies, and other amazing technology. In fact, many huge investors and investing firms have already clued into this and started investing in this amazing investment. In fact, Bill Gates said this could be potentially a trillion-dollar industry! What is this amazing investment? Graphics Cards. In cryptocurrency mining, artificial intelligence, gaming, and other heavy tasks, the graphics card is incredibly important. Currently, Nvidia leads the graphics card market. Nvidia\u2019s Graphics Cards have been on extremely high demand in 2017 and 2018 because of the crypto-mining craze. In the past few years, many companies have been created to mine cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin & Ethereum. In fact, look at the picture below.  That is one crypto-mining room. All those small things on the shelves are Graphics Cards. By the way, this is also a relatively small crypto-mining room, usually the shelves are much taller. \u2026and there are tons of shelves. \u2026in tons of extremely long rows And that is ONLY part of one room actually, you don\u2019t even see the full room in the picture!  Guess what? There are multiple rooms like this too! Guess what? This is only 1 building, most crypto-mining companies have way more than 1 building at a crypto-mining centre.  Guess what? This is only 1 centre, there are multiple centres like this worldwide for each of the tons of different crypto-mining companies! Still remember those Graphics Cards I was talking about? Nvidia\u2019s newest model is the \u201cNvidia GeForce GTX 1080 Ti\u201d. It costs $699 USD. You can\u2019t even imagine how much money Nvidia is making. In fact, let\u2019s look at how much Nvidia\u2019s growth.  It went up over 108% in the past year! That\u2019s more than doubling it\u2019s worth! You can clearly see how Nvidia has much potential. Conclusion: Graphics Cards (GPUs) will be big in the next decade, and Nvidia is leading the innovation.
