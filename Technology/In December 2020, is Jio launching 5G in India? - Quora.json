            "answer_text": "No Jio is not launching 5G in India in December 2020. Even in the best case we can see 5G in late 2021 not before than that. This is because 5G spectrum has not been sold by government till now so Jio or any other carrier don\u2019t have 5G spectrum with them. Even if they have spectrum they will have to do field trials, set up infrastructure or upgrade current infrastructure which in best scenario will take 6\u20138 months. So you can think of 5G only when auction of 5G spectrum is done that too after 6 months of the auction. ",
