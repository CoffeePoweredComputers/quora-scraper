            "answer_text": "Not really. Each SIM card is unique, with a unique ID. This ID is mapped to your mobile number. So when you get a \u201cduplicate\u201d SIM, it\u2019s not really duplicate - but the network is set up to recognise it and allocate your number to the new SIM ID when you activate the new SIM in your phone. The old sim is now dead, and will not be recognised by the network. You can\u2019t have the same mobile number on two SIMs like this. (There is actually a mechanism for sharing a number across two SIMs but it\u2019s for uses like an iPhone and an Apple Watch with cellular being attached to the same account; you can\u2019t use it on two phones) ",

            "answer_text": "No, from a number of perspectives. Each card has a unique \u201cburned-in\u201d serial number called an Integrated Circuit Chip ID (ICCID). It cannot be legally cloned. Far more importantly, cloning a SIM card is illegal and unethical - depending on your purpose of doing so. If it is merely to fix/replace a broken SIM card, or something like that, and you are trying to retain your numbers, contacts, etc., then you can just transfer your service (phone numbers and all) to a new card from that same carrier for a nominal fee. And far less trouble. Yes, the ICCID will be new (since it is unique to the new card), but all the other information can be transferred so that you will not see any disruption of difference. ",
