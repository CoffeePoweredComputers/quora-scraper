            "answer_text": "With current technology you will have to have a bezel of some sort because the device needs a frame to protect the components and the edge of the glass is part of that. On tablets you also have bezels because people need to hold the devices and they typical hold them on the edges as tablets are too big to fit in the palm of most peoples hands. ",
