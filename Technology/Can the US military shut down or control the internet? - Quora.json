            "answer_text": "Total shot in the dark here but in theory anything that is wired infrastructure could be shut Down (hacked or bombed). Sure, they can shut down parts of the internet or its infrastructure, but it\u2019s gonna be hard for any person or organization to shut down the whole internet. And for that matter would you want to? The internet is infrastructure. It\u2019s like a bridge or a road or a power plant or a runway. It\u2019s useful to the opposition. It will be useful to you, and it\u2019s just another thing to rebuild after the conflict. Then there\u2019s the other way to think of it. It is information. Do you jam and spoof? Do you modify existing websites and social media to a information warfare purpose? Do you attack a regime by mitigating the media of a hostile government and establish an internet / social media equivalent of radio free Europe? in short yes the internet or parts of it can be shut down and controlled, but it\u2019s also a question of the acumen of who\u2019s internet you are trying to kill or control.

That would be a lot of effort. No one group has control on the internet though. Governments regulate. The internet is a random anamoly. If it got shutdown at some point, somewhere else there would be an initiative to open it up. (Anonymous?) ",

            "answer_text": "The Internet was designed as a battlefield network, and to be fault tolerant - to route around damage. You can take out large chunks of the Internet, and the system will rout around the holes. However there are weaknesses, and a cleverly designed attack might be able to take advantage of them. The. Internet is very US-centric, so if someone were to require all US Internet carriers to shut down, it is entirely possible that the Internet would fragment. But the place which would suffer the most harm would be the US. Effectively, the US could do Sampson - pull the temple down in its head. But I do not think that it could do so without inflicting more harm on itself than anyone else. ",

            "answer_text": "Technologically it's trivial.  Most internet traffic goes through a small number of routers, so all you have to do to shut down the internet is to blow them up. Legally it's hard.  The only situation I can imagine it happening is if the US comes under some massive attack in which the President orders the internet shut down. ",
