            "answer_text": "Well, Jonathan, this is very bad science and a disgrace that so many people are still in the dark ages. Why don\u2019t we take a survey of Catholic priests to determine if the Earth is flat? A survey of Japanese educators, however carefully conducted, is not a scientific method. Actual scientific method is open to any potential cause and tries to narrow down the causes by eliminating those that can be shown not to be involved in a significant way. Studies have actually shown that cellphone usage and reading do not have any measurable effect on refractive errors. There is also no mechanism postulated for how that would work. In order to have myopia, the eye must grow longer than it should. Exactly how is a Smartphone supposed to make the eye grow longer? No one has put forth a serious mechanism for that. We don\u2019t know what causes myopia. We know there is some hereditary component and some environmental component. But what in the environment? GMOs? Growth hormones in cows? Artificial sweeteners and preservatives? Less outdoor time? Not much of this has been studied. Outdoor time does seem to have a murky relationship which is not consistent among studies. If you are serious about this question, then please look at my detailed answer here: Bill Otto's Answer to What causes myopia and is there a cure? ",
