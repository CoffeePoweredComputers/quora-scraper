            "answer_text": "Simply put, it sucks. I love Google and wanted desperately to have Fi. It would cut my cell phone bill to about \u2153 of what I pay Verizon. In the month I was with Fi, I never received a phone call, just voice mail notifications. When attempting to place a call it could take as long as 2 minutes to find an open channel on the tower. If I was driving, the call would disconnect at handoff. The data was like dialup. I had to switch back, if rather pay triple for a working plan. Fi uses the \u201cB\u201d carriers, T-Mobile and Sprint as an MVNO. So starting out poorly. How a cell phone works is a tiered system: First responders and militaryPostpaid contact accounts with carrierPostpaid roaming from other carriersPrepaid accounts with carrierMVNOsThe MVNOs are buying time on the network, but appear last. Have the worst connection reliability. I would not use an MVNO if it were free. By the was, I had installed apps to better manage the towers and connection and still could not reliably use the phone.

            "answer_text": "Google Fi utilizes the nationwide networks and towers of three major wireless carriers: Sprint, T-Mobile and US Cellular. When using Google Fi, as long as the user is within range of at least one of these three networks, there will be no coverage drops or interruptions, as the technology behind Google Fi allows for seamless coverage. Each of these three carriers provides coverage in areas where a Verizon signal is either weak or non-existent. So, although both Verizon and Google Fi have excellent coverage nationwide as a whole, Google Fi provides the best coverage overall, and at highly comparable 4G/LTE data speeds. ",
