            "answer_text": "I just read the first three answers. I found that although they are not actually wrong the don\u2019t answer the question that I think you are asking. I feel that you are asking about a device called an Access Point. Lets start with a basic training of networking. A home or even a business network starts with receiving a connection from their Internet Service Provider (ISP). The connection from the ISP gives one address. Every device that wants to connect to the internet needs its own address. The way to solve this is with the router. What a router does is take the one address from the ISP and creates many more address. A standard router can produce 256 address. Where you run into problems is if you need more than 256 addresses or if you need connections that are too far away from the router to connect. You can expand a network a few different ways. The two main ways are using an Access Point or a Range Extender. Here are the main differences between these two devices. An Access Point needs to be connected to the router via a cable. The you can connect to the Access Point using the exact same name and password as the you use with the router. (This is how most large networks are set up. A good example of this would be if you connect at work, in a hospital, a college campus, or other place where you have one password that works all over the facility.) A range extender does a similar thing. The two biggest differences are that the range extender connects to the router via WiFi and the other difference is that the range extender needs a different SSID which often uses the same SSID with an added \u201c_EXT\u201d. A range extender is what is most often used in a home that need to extend their WiFi range to other parts of their home. You will find that many people use the terms router, access point, and range extender to mean the same thing. But, you can see by my explanation above that they are very different things. ",

            "answer_text": "The original question was \u201cWhat is an Access Point\u201d. That question was (foolishly) merged with \u201cWhat is an internet access point?\u201d. There is no such thing as an \u201cinternet access point\u201d. An Access Point is the WiFi part of a WiFi router. Enterprises typically don\u2019t need WiFi routers - they need lots of Access Points. They don\u2019t need ethernet switch (Level 2 router) that make the multiple LAN ports appear to be on the same network as the WiFi devices, nor do they need the NAT router or DHCP server in the same device. If anything, all that extra stuff complicates their networking designs, not simplifies it. When trying to diagnose WiFi problems at home (or a small office situation), it helps to remember the design, much like when diagnosing other problems. (i.e.: if a table lamp doesn\u2019t work, you look to it\u2019s components to see if the problem is there. Bulb, or switch, or whether it\u2019s plugged in to the wall, etc.) ",
