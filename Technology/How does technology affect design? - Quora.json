            "answer_text": "Now a days both tech. and design is co related as where tech. goes design followes like the smart phone you are handling now or the tv you are watching and yet not wondering that these thigs used to be more heavy as for tv there were big jumbo size CRO tubes and for cellphones they were more like police wakitokies lol . Yet as the generation changed so came the need of design and looks with it and thus came the term comfort,sleek,roboust and so on such kind of words and as for my openion there is a keep bonding as the modern generation is trying to develop their capacity to design and make products and to appreciate the complex relations between Design, materials, manufacture and marketing. Technology plays the role as the people need to acquire a broad range of subject knowledge and draw on disciplines such as mathematics, science, engineering, computing and art and by minimizing the threat level in taking risk by technology designing becomes resourceful, innovative, enterprising . So there are courses offerd in this manner like so called D&T courses which helps you to make the bonding and so on . Hope this helps Regards ASD ",

For eg due to technological development we can have 3d views 4d and even 5d views that proves that we can have a look of our designs in all perspectives which finally leads to more thoughts and result in more creativity.
