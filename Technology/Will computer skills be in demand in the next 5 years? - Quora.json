            "answer_text": "Yepp. Computers aren\u2019t going anywhere, if anything, they will be in more demand than they are today. This doesn\u2019t only apply to people in the IT field, but to almost every worker. Take my dad as an example: He\u2019s a school principal who worked most of his life as an elementary school teacher. We bought our first computer in 2003, where he started the tortuous procedure of learning how to use a computer. In the beginning, he did stuff like printing a page, correcting it with liquid paper, scanning it and working on the digitized version. After a while, he learned how to use image edition tools and saved lots of time. The thing is, after a couple of years, he became pretty good at using the computer, and now he can do almost anything he needs with it. At the time it didn\u2019t look like such an important thing, as most of the education system still used paper documents for most tasks, but in the last years they digitized everything, and now using a computer is a must. Currently, half of the teacher population can use the computer, but the other half is still in need of gaining computer literacy. This leaves you with half of the teachers who are not adapted to work properly on the current system, and that\u2019s a huge issue in many schools. So, that\u2019s the current situation of teachers in a small Central American nation, if you extrapolate the example for other areas in the following decades you can get an idea of how important computer literacy will be. Learn computer skills, my dad is very happy he did it on time. ",

            "answer_text": "No one knows for sure, but if they are in demand now, then its a reasonable indication that they will be in demand in the near term. However, if your looking at this only to get a well paying job, I\u2019d suggest you first look into yourself. Do you really want to be a techy? It can be boring and tedious, may have lots of meetings, not everyone is cut for it, deadlines, crunch times, hours/weeks staring at a monitor, trying to figure out why your code doesn\u2019t do what you think it should\u2026just to find out that your code is wrong, one of your steps in code is wrong, your approach is wrong\u2026or the framework your using doesn\u2019t support that feature! ARGH!!!! And you ask about 5 years time, what about 30 years\u202640 years. Don\u2019t pick a career because some idiot like me, said it should be a good career. Remember, using a baseball analogy, your swinging the bat at a pitch that may be a curve ball, make your swing count! ",

Some jobs such as The Medical field in Stem cell research, Energy Consultants, Memory Surgeons, Veterinarians, Dentists, Pharmacists, Pile-Drivers, Cost estimaters, Brick masions, Stone masions are just a few I see for future demands. Especially as people age n retire. ",
