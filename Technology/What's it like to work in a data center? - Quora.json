            "answer_text": "The best part is the autonomy.  DC techs are like Sargents in the military.  they are given a task and left to devise solutions based on; documented process (when that fails) past experiences (when that fails)  Peer chat rooms (when that fails) -- the internet (when that fails) -- trial and error.   The request form above is to just do your magic, very few folks outside the data center have even seen your servers.  Just like how fireman take extreme care of their stations and trucks, you take care of your center and servers.  Give people a tour of your data centers and they will have the same look that kids have when they go to a fire station....  no idea how this stuff works but it sure looks neat. ps... you will never be able to give a tour of a Google, Amazon or Apple data center -- so get a job at Facebook. The facts:24/7 shift coverage (pay usually increases by 5% for each Swing/Grave)YahooAmazon, rackspace, net2ez -- most cloud providers because they have paying customers 8/hr coverageGoogle, Facebook, Entry level jobs:\u2022 most people come in as temp (try and buy) workers.these pay between 14-18/hr depending on the regiona person will work these jobs between 4-11 months before being hired full time (relative to there being an opening with the full time team in that period)\u2022 few people care about certifications but they do show interest and willingness to try.\u2022 Aptitude can be determined by a 45 minute interview pretty easily.\u2022\u2022 what was the last computer you built\u2022\u2022 what is your favorite OS and why** can you work in an environment where you have spoken to no one in person in 8 hours\u2022\u2022 we would slam a blade server on the table, point to parts and ask \"what is that\" Perks:not as good as working at corp, you are lucky to get a desk.  As the team grows your work environment improves (12 or so people usually warrants free food and video game consoles).   I can expand on any of these if you have more questions. g ",

There is quote that goes \u201cBE CAREFUL WHAT YOU WISH FOR. BECAUSE YOU MIGHT GET IT\u201d. I did projects that I'm proud of, projects that the people of my country depend on. Not everyone gets as lucky as me. Thanks to the almighty. Believe me my friend, There were moments when I was SWEATING in that cold for the extreme pressure from my top management. I was in such a team, and I was enjoying every moment of learning and exploring the world of servers except the below cons. You should always be available on call 24/7You should be ready to sacrifice holidays and weekends.You should be ready to lift calls during a family dinner and stay on for a period of 1 to 2 hours.You should also be ready to lift heavy weights upto 30 kgs (In order to replace hardware components)You should be ready to bear the cold : AC rooms having temperatures ranging 6 to 15 Celsius (in India)You should be ready to take all the pressure from the top management for the hardware failure that happened without your fault or influence.You should be accountable to 5 or more teams on call while you are working on the hardware in that chilled environment.An Unplanned Outage can strip your self respect in front of 20 people.An Unexpected mistake can kick you out of your jobI have moved to CLOUD team, and life has never been so much exciting.

A Data center designed for a cloud service provider as well as supplying substantially distinct services, security requirements over a completely private data center. This would be the server as well as storage equipment that run program and store data. A data center network system is imperative to the continuity of every day operations. With data center we are collecting far more data along with source and it is necessary for organizations in order to successfully store along with manage that data. It will save you your data which includes customer information, intellectual property, and other business-critical data within data center. ",

            "answer_text": "They are not all cold.  The low temperature used to be the standard, but now more facilities are raising the ambient temperature and improving thermal management in the overall data center design.  This lowers the operating cost significantly and makes it much more comfortable to work in.  It can also allow for lower fan speeds which decreases the noise.  Its surprising how much of the noise comes from the CRAH units.  When utility power is interrupted there is often a lull before the generators kick in when it will get very quiet, then the CRAHs turn back on and the volume goes up again.Some people can't handle the isolation in a data center, but some people like myself enjoy it.  Not being able to see outside does bother me.   One facility I worked in I had access to the security video feeds and would keep a window up on my laptop with a view overlooking the parking lot so I could know what it was like outside.There are really two different types of data centers.  There are the hosting facilities that will be an assortment of different cages with small groups of cabinets or racks.  Then there are the large volume facilities like those operated by Rackspace, Google, Amazon, Facebook, etc... These data centers have hundreds of cabinets in each room, laid out to optimize power and cooling distribution. ",

In a busy datacenter the cold row is really cold and the hot row is really hot. Going back and forth between them might be stressful for your health and pretty annoying. It's highly recommended to be physically fit, servers are not designed to be lightweight and lifting them 6-7' from the floor turns out to be a challenge if you don't have a (pretty expensive) \"rack lift\" device.Other than that it's a fun job for anyone who wants to stay close to the metal.
