            "answer_text": " Just like other networks, 5G is the most talked about topic in 2020. It uses multiple cell locales that isolate the domain in categories like (area) and send encoded information through radio waves. 5G networks will make use of an encoding method (OFDM) that is similar to the encoding of 4G LTE. 5G isn\u2019t only about the lightning-fast speed or just binge-watching 4K on Amazon Prime. It is more about a stronger signal strength in crowded areas, basements where the network is compromised. Losing connection will soon die because 5G supported mobiles list is growing. These phones will have a better signal strength whether its a crowded area, building or driving in the mountains. All 5G Smartphones Price Hike It\u2019s no surprise that all the 5G smartphones are currently pricier than the average 4G handsets. This is mere because the technology is still new, but it will change in 2020 because more handsets will be using the 5G chipsets and components. They are coming with the MediaTek Dimensity 1000 5G SoCs and Snapdragon 765 that have 5G integrated features that increase the price instantly. Manufacturers need to create a small distinction among the chipsets where the Snapdragon 765 supports mmWave frequency bands only while the MediaTek only supports sub-6GHz. The low tieing 5G handsets will have different frequency capabilities and the data speed will vary enormously. Among the few Qualcomm is attempting to streamline 5G mmWave handset development through new components but still, the 5G market will only offer sub-6GHz List of New 5G Phones in 2019 5G is being carried forward in 2020, while there were plenty of high-end phones that came with 5G. These phones include: Samsung Galaxy S10 5GLG V50 THINQHuawei Mate XXiaomi Mi Mix 3ZTE Axon 10 ProOnePlus7 Or OnePlus 7TSony 5G PrototypeMotorola Z3OPPO R15Huawei Mate 20 X 5GNOKIA 10 are among the few.Very few of the Android manufacturers are unable to address the upcoming 5G era. Portable gaming may set to benefit from 5G but the Razer series phone can\u2019t seem to add any official statements. While some companies are proactive, Blackberry, Acer and multiple other companies can\u2019t really contemplate the 5G trend. It is a probability that the company \u201cessential\u201d paves way to incorporate 5G for its advertising but that seems to be like a long shot. The important question lies in understanding whether users can benefit from 5G or not? Even when 5G will be made available. Most of the areas that will be provided with the coverage will include metropolitan areas. Does that mean you should live in the urban areas? That\u2019s not yet feasible. But before you chose any smartphone, make sure you cross-check the carrier whether they have mmWave deployment or not. We hope that in 2020 the price of 5G phones decreases so that more users can avail of its services. ",
