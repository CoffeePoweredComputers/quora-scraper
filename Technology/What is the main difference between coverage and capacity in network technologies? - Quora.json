            "answer_text": "Coverage refers to how large the geographical area or space is covered, i.e. room, house, floor(s), building(s). Meaning you can connect to the network within that geographical area. Capacity generally refers to the number of individual users, devices, or the bandwidth of the connections at one time, simultaneously. If you think of these terms as applied to a road, Coverage refers to where the road goes and capacity refers to how many lanes the road has. ",
