            "answer_text": "You are shooting at a target. All your shots are grouped closely together, but they are 5 inches from the bull eye. That is high precision and low accuracy. Precision is the measure of repeatability. Accuracy is a measure of how close you came to your target. Resolution is totally different. Resolution is a measure of ones ability to distinguish two separate objects that are separated by some angle. Like seeing there are two stars and not just one. If you see a dark wire against a bright sky, that is contrast. Being able to see there are actually two wires is resolution. ",
