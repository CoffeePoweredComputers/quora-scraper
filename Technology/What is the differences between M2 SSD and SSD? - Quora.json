            "answer_text": "SSDs. Mature established technology makes this drive a bit more expensive than an HDD below 1 Tb. This drive is the size of a credit card but about 3 mm thick making this card easy to stash anywhere inside the PC case. The SSD is fully protected against dust and sticky finger. Every new PC has at least a 500 Gb SSD.   M.2 This drive has a restricted placement and must be plugged into your motherboard. It does not replace your HDD or cheaper SSD but is used for keeping your operating system and start up programs. SSDs must be plugged into a special PCIe adaptor plug between your Graphic card slots or under your chip set cover. The M.2 is 10 times faster than a normal SSD because it uses a more direct pathway to your CPU and bypasses the South Bridge. M.2 sticks are about 1.5 times the cost of a normal SSD and they will likely be the same price as an SSD by next year for the memory.   New SSD technology to replace the M.2 underway. Enter the PCIe that plugs into a graphics card slots. These drive are designed to move hundreds of thousands of files in just a few seconds for LOD scalable gaming as found in Lumberyard based games. Your motherboard better have at least 3 PCIe slots on it.   ",

            "answer_text": "M.2 is a form-factor that includes either SATA or PCIe (usually NVMe for SSD). A \u201cnormal\u201d SSD is a 2.5\u2033 SATA device. For devices that are both SATA, performance will be comparable in either form-factor, though of course every particular design performs somewhat differently. Specifically, SATA devices max out at about 550 MB/s. When the M.2 device is PCIe and provides NVMe, it\u2019s still a block interface, but is quite a lot faster than SATA. (Which, after all, originated in the spinning-disk world, where neither lower latency nor higher bandwidth were needed.) NVMe performance is still limited by PCIe, but devices can perform at up to a few GB/s, and have substantially lower latency than SATA. From the OS/driver perspective, SATA (usually AHCI, actually) and NVMe are not profoundly different: the latter is more of a logical extension providing the ability to express more in-flight transactions, as well as consuming fewer CPU resources.
