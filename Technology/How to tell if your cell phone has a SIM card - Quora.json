            "answer_text": "If it connects successfully to a mobile network it does have a SIM card. The SIM card is your passport to the network. Without the identification data and security algorithms on the card no network access is possible. These data and algorithms are never copied to the phone memory. The SIM card includes a processor that is powered by the phone to execute the authentication process. If you have a very recent model and cannot find a slot where a SIM is inserted your phone might have a so-called eSIM, a protected memory on the phone that holds the SIM data. It must be loaded and activated through a WLAN access. ",

            "answer_text": "There should be a hole with a tray cutout around it.. if you insert a needle or something pointy into it, it'll eject the SIM tray. Pretty much all phones now have SIM cards.. some phones back in the day had CDMA which is now discontinued and no longer used. So most likely your phone has a SIM card slot. If it's a basic phone, most likely it's underneath the battery which you can remove the back battery door. ",
