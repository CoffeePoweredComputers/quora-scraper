            "answer_text": "It depends which aspect of Star Trek you are considering: multi-racial team in charge of a ship? doneaccess to vast amounts of knowledge through computers? donetablet / smart phone communication devices? doneall species of the galaxy being humanoid, capable of communicating through the same vocal frequencies and having the exact same body type and size? unlikely.Now, as far as warp engines go, we are not sure it is physically possible. The purpose of science-fiction is to project people in a slightly different reality and encourage people to consider these realities as viable futures. Look at how many things were considered science fiction when Jules Verne wrote about them, and how many came to be true. ",
