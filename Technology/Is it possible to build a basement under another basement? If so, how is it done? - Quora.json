            "answer_text": "Well Normally you dig out the basements first and build your foundation from your bottom up. If you try to excavate another level down you would have to make sure the home is secured and can not shift or sag. This could be done similar as the move homes from one to another location. They open the foundation walls and slide I-beams across the house next those single I beams get connected and a sort of trailer frame is build. next all I Beams will be jacked up to lift the home of it\u2019s foundation. Usually it is done through a (hydraulic system ) To guarantee same pressure on all points. So with something like this in place I can imagine that you could excavate a full basement or more. either way, In the end you will have to poor the appropriate size footer and build up the foundation. After that is all done the frame can be lowered and removed. One more thing: If it be me\u2026I would poor concrete walls for my foundation instead of building it up with block. Hope this helps\u2026leave a responds ",

            "answer_text": "It can be done but would be very, very expensive. Among the things you would have to do is make a way to get some small but useful digging equipment into the existing basement. Then you would need some method of underpinning your existing basement walls and other supporting structures. Finally, you would need a method to remove the spoil. Let\u2019s just say it is a very expensive way to gain extra space. It would be cheaper to get a new building with a sub basement if you really need one. ",
