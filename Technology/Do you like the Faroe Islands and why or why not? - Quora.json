            "answer_text": "I love the Faroe Islands, and I am going to list a few reasons below It is not too hot.Lovely landscape. I like the stark nature and how green those islands get in the summer.The people there are great! Everybody I spoke with was very nice to me.Very little crime. In fact, the Faroese are so trusting that they don\u2019t even lock their houses at night. This reminds me of Norway back in the good old days, when people didn\u2019t have much to do besides visiting eachother. If your neighbour needed help with something, you helped out without expecting payment for that.It is a bit expensive to get hotel rooms, but I would gladly live in the Faroe Islands.I tend to come back to the folks living in the Faroe Islands, so I am going to close off this answer with another story from my visit. We were a group of ten people that were supposed to take an early plane home. This was in a weekday. So, we did what we would have done here in Norway, and arrived at the airport 2 hours before our flight was supposed to leave. The only problem was that the airport didn\u2019t open for almost an hour. It was rather cold, wet and windy this spring morning. One of the people in our group took a walk around the perimeter of the airport and found some random Faroese guy that worked with something else on that airport. He presented our problem to him, and the Faroese guy went \u201cOh, no problem. I\u2019ll just unlock the airport so that you can wait inside.\u201d And he did, and left to continue with whatever he was working on. So, to reiterate: This Faroese guy just let us in and left us to our own devices, thinking nothing about security measures or anything. He just implicitly trusted us. The people working at the terminal started arriving half an hour later and didn\u2019t question our presence there at all.",
