            "answer_text": "I am from Guatemala so I would say come here! However, I would suggest you look at the following five things before starting a company in any country or city:  Talent: Make sure you have the right access to talent. Depending on the type of startup that you are starting, you will need people (co-founders or team members) with different skills sets. Make sure the human capital is there and you can access and afford it. Space: From personal experience, make sure you work for the first couple of months in a co-working space. It might be expensive in some places but will allow you to quickly connect with the local community and better understand how to build your strategy. Regulatory environment: As an entrepreneur, you will face many challenges; sometimes even failure. Do some research in how easy and quickly you can create and dissolve a legal entity. Also talk with people about how to employ people and make sure your abiding by local laws.Culture: Some countries/cultures are risk-averse by nature. Not just in launching startups but also joining and working for them. This can create additional hurdles in attracting the right talent, getting new customers and finding early adopters. Capital: Having the right resources and access to capital can provide you with a tremendous advantage as an entrepreneur. Make sure you are able to access angel investors or cash locally. Most VC funds or institutional investors do not always feel comfortable investing cash in international startups. Hope that helps! ",

More generally, there are some decent startups in Sweden but none of them have made it big.  Also Israel, as Ganesh Iyer points out.  And there is a small area around Cambridge, England, where there regularly there are a few startups.   Pretty slim pickings, eh? ",
