            "answer_text": "The latest technology trends in software testing. 1. Big Data It played an essential role in a variety of business sectors including technology, healthcare, banking and many more. Big data testing will address several issues and results in the efficiency of processing, and the rapid import of data. 2. Machine Learning test suite optimization, search for unique code checks, improving the log analytics etc. In 2020, machine learning is going to come up with new concepts while helping in various aspects like test suite optimization, search for unique code checks, improving log analytics, etc.. 3. DevOps Development DevOps has become a widely accepted solution for organizations that are willing to shorten the software life cycles from development to delivery and operation. 4. Test Automation There seems to be a trend of transition to automatic verification of various processes and code as every enterprise wants to get maximum benefits from the product. Test automation solutions will help you attain high-quality outputs with the help of automation. 5. IoT Testing Another challenge for IoT testers in the upcoming years lies in strategies. According to the World Quality Report, 34% of respondents said their products have IoT functionality, but their team still can not find out the most proper testing strategy. 6. Block-chain Testing Block-chain is improving financial transactions in a far better way. It also brings along few security challenges as well. To address these security issues, next-gen block-chain testing services will be carried out that are specifically designed for more productive Block-chain apps. 7. Cyber Security Testing With the digital evolution on the hype there comes many security threats. As cyber threats can take place in any form and at any moment, testing for security will be a popular topic this year. ",

            "answer_text": "\u00b7        Integrating QA through agility and TCoE: QA is seeing greater integration into business through setting up agile testing teams and Testing Centers of Excellence (TCoE). Though agile development teams have been around for a long time, agility in testing is still nascent. With the continuous pressure to quickly deliver software, businesses are investing time and money into setting up a TCoE with the objective of reducing CoQ, increasing test effectiveness and generating more ROI out of testing. From 2011 to 2014, the number of operational TCoEs has increased from 4% to 19% and is expected to increase further in the future.\u00b7        Big data testing: \u201c70% of enterprises have either deployed or are planning to deploy big data projects and programs this year\u201d          \u201c75% of businesses are wasting 14% of revenue due to poor data quality\u201d. So bid data testing is still a challenge for IT industry.\u00b7        Greater focus on new technology: New technologies like SOA, cloud and mobile testing are on the rise. According to 2013-2014 world quality report, mobile testing has seen a rapid rise from 31% in 2012 to 55% in 2013. Yet 56% lack comprehensive mobile testing procedures. By 2015, almost 36% of software will be hosted in the cloud but businesses still lack the necessary infrastructure for cloud testing. \u00b7        Higher Automation Levels: With agile testing teams and growing number of TCoEs, and due to high pressure to reduce the time-to-market, testing teams are trying to adopt automation wherever possible. This is not just in regression but also in unit testing and load testing.\u00b7        Greater focus on security: System robustness and security has always been a top priority but with growth in social media and mobility and need for software that can be integrated to multiple platforms, systems are becoming more vulnerable. There is a pressing need to ensure enhanced security, particularly in applications handling sensitive data. \u00b7        Context driven testing: Another effect of the spread of social media, localization and mobility is the result of devices that, though diverse, are still tightly integrated in terms of software and usage. It is challenging for businesses to maintain central hubs of hardware, middleware and test environments necessary to comprehensively test them. \u00b7        Continuous Integration testing: Under this methodology, testing is done in small increments in a production like environment with code integration happening at frequent intervals. This kind of testing helps the tester to detect problems early, measure the effectiveness of a change and determine whether it actually meets end-user expectations.\u00b7        Independent Software testing: With increased focus on QA, many businesses are relying on specialist QA organizations to provide testing services. This is largely due to the expertise that specialist QA organizations bring to the table, including TCoE capability. Hence partnering with them helps the business to circumvent the pain of finding skilled QA resources and setting up a mature QA, both in terms of process and technology. ",
