            "answer_text": "NO. you must purchase more expensive 5G phones. NO. Rural areas will not be helped with new antennas. 5G is unnecessary. It\u2019s misrepresented by marketing, and so costly it requires the strong arm of federal government. #1 - Requires new phones. Present (4G) phones will not work. #2 - Requires new federal imminent domain on communities.#3 - Requires 5 times the antennas plus cabling (infrastructure) #4 - Requires more antennas that cover smaller areas. #5 - Offers no rural bandwidth improvement. (fiber fixes this)#6 - Language translation no better than 4G.#7 improves the advertising platform on your phones. Faster, for advertising, video, gaming and porn. We use 80% of internet services for advertising, video, gaming, & porn. Think of federal imposition of local cooperation as subsidizing a technology to replace a working technology. This will push utilities, municipal government, 911, and other community resources. Rural area need fiber cable, not more antennasRural areas need fiber cabling for faster internet, not more antennas. Local towns need solid fiber strung to their location. Antennas will not improve internet speeds. Farms, and more isolated areas lose services as the new antennas will not cover the distances of 4G. Coverage areas for 4G will be lost in remoter areas. 5G is not helping rural north america. It force you buy into the network as 4G is dismantled. Most of present bandwidth increases are from advertizing, marketing, and \u201csit on your house\u201d uses.

            "answer_text": "Where 5G implies new forms of wireless (e.g. LoRa, millimetre wireless) then of course the phone in your pocket now can't work that way, and never will do, since it doesn't have the hardware built-in. However, 5G implies a new type of core network that probably will be used to support existing cellular devices, but this will be via existing 3G/LTE/WiFi radio. There may never be a \"5G smartphone\", as such, because 5G may be more important in application areas that are not yet well-served, for example the Internet of Things, Intelligent Transport Systems, wireless backhaul and application areas not yet conceived using millimetre wireless. So the answer is emphatically no, and paradoxically yes. ",

Credit image: South Korea to launch world's first national 5G networks In addition, the way we use today's phones will not require the fastest data speeds offered by 5G. The current 4G LTE networks are more than enough for all the videos and streaming music you want to play on your phone. Verizon, AT & T, Sprint have promised 5G devices for the first half of 2019, while T-Mobile announced that a national network will be launched in 2020. The 5G will offer faster data and longer battery life. However, the availability of the network will be limited in 2019 and it is possible that the Apple iPhone does not support it before 2020. In addition, you may not need the fastest 5G, depending on the network. How do you use your phone today?  OKportal Technology ",
