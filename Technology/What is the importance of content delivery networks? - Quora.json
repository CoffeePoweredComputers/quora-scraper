            "answer_text": "Content Delivery Networks are important because users and site owners prefer fast sites. CDNs speed up the Internet, mainly for static web content and video, and save bandwidth by pushing the content to the \"edge\" closer to the user. This works because a big part of Internet content is static files that don't change.  This is why the big Internet companies, like Google with YouTube, either have their own CDN networks or hire the services of specialist CDN companies. Another benefit is for the site developer. The web server can focus on generating dynamic content and processing APIs, instead of serving up this static content. With cloud hosting services, even small developers can use CDN to their advantage. ",

It's cheaper for the website, which saves on bandwidth, rack space, power and cooling. The configuration and hardware are still provided by the CDN. the advantage is a distributed, fault-tolerant and faster architecture.  CDN traffic might stand for 30% of total traffic in a given moment for a large SP. ",

The CDN copies the pages of a website to a network of servers that are segregated at geographically different locations, caching the contents of the page. When a user requests a webpage which is the part of the CDN will redirect the request from the originating site's server to a server in the CDN that is nearest to the user & delivers the cached content.
