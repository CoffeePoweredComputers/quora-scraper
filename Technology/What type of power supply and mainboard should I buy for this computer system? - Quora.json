            "answer_text": "As Alexandros said, there are online calculators that help you figure out the minimum power rating you need on your PSU. Or you can research the parts for their rated power consumptions and calculate the minimum yourself. Either way, make sure to have a buffer between the calculated minimum and the power rating of your supply (25% is good, especially if you plan on upgrading later on). Keep an eye on the rated efficiency; higher efficiencies are nice, but they don't necessarily save you loads of money.The main things you need to keep in mind when you're searching for a motherboard is the CPU connection type (LGA 1150) and the memory  clock speed (you need to match it to your RAM sticks). Also, since it looks like you're building yourself a gaming computer (and thus have some money to spend), I'd recommend investing in an SSD as well as an HDD, and dropping the RAM to 8 GB (as far as I'm aware, the only reason you'd need more than 8 GB of RAM would be for intensive video editing or similar programs).

            "answer_text": "Buy a mainboard that is LGA 1150 compatible. Prefer one with the latest Z97 chipset. Buy a trustworty brand like Gigabyte or Asus. As for the PSU you can use online calculators to calculate the load that your parts create. Then buy a trustworthy brand of PSU at least 25% more powerful than your calculated load. As far as I know the best ones are made by Seasonic. Here is a calculator (but there are others too, just google it):eXtreme Power Supply Calculator ",

            "answer_text": "As it is a 1150 socket processor and a K series one you better buy a z97 board to make the best out of it, although you might need an aftermarket cooler for that if you plan on overclocking. For motherboard take a look at ASUS/MSI, they are good at making these stuffs. If I were you I might have bought the Asus Z97 Pro gamer. For power supply any good 650W will be enough for this, However I will recommend a thermaltake toughpower. ",
