            "answer_text": "The main reason that IBM did so extraordinarily well in the \u201850s, \u201960s and well into the \u201970s was that it was the only game in town. There were other players in the emerging IT industry, to be sure, but they in terms of market share and revenues they paled in comparison to Big Blue. There were other reasons, of course. The firm\u2019s early entry into the tabulating business, as far back as the 1890 census, meant that the companies that eventually became IBM had longstanding and trusted relationships with their customers in government as well as industry. Governments, in particular, had and continue to have an insatiable appetite for the technologies needed to operate very large and complex programs. At the same time, the company\u2019s emphasis on marketing and sales professionalism gave it tremendous edge over its competitors. When customer executives met with polished, highly professional IBM marketing reps they very quickly came to trust their recommendations. Others in the industry followed suit, but customers quickly learned the truth of the saying that \u201cnobody ever got fired for buying IBM.\u201d ",

            "answer_text": "IBM made a lot of innovations at the time and more importantly made it accessible to the average user or home. They did not impede the clone environment, which further enhanced the acceptance of a desktop computer by the consumer (you and me). Many other factors further enhanced the desire and need to bring the desktop computer into the work place and the home. Probably one driving factor was improving productivity. ",
