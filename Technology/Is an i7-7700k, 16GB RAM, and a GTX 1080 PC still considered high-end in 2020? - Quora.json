            "answer_text": "Nowadays, high-end starts at i9\u20139900 (or equivalent) and at RTX 2070 Super (or equivalent). 16gig of RAM can still be seen in high end PCs because right now, 32 is just overkill for any game on the market. A flagship PC for medium-end would be i5\u20139600k, GTX 1080-ti (or RTX 2060 Super) and 16 gig or lower of RAM (and that\u2019s already in the upper part of medium-end PCs). A low-end PC would be any 4th gen (or around) processor with a GTX 960 or 850m and between 4 to 8 gig of RAM (anything below 4gig of RAM shouldn\u2019t even be considered a PC). So yeah, your setup is fairly medium-end. ",

            "answer_text": "With those specs it is still a pretty solid system for gaming and editing etc. However, in my opinion I would classify it as a medium to high-end spec PC as with the current generation of components such as the CPU and GPU the performance gap is quite high even though the system is still good for 1440p gaming. A PC at the top of the high-end spec would be something around a Ryzen 9 or an intel i9\u20139900KF etc. with a RTX 2080 Super or 2080Ti with at least 32GB of DDR4 memory. ",
