            "answer_text": "Important are well defined haptics threshold of firing key and as less noise as it can be. I prefer Logitech brand for keyboards, mouses, and computer cameras. Just tried many and each was good. Best of all, come to retail store and put your fingers on them. Best keyboards often are not cheap and same time less fancy ones. You might look at K840 if you like old click-click mechanical keyboards (instead of modern rubber pad ones) I currently use K750 and i am so happy. K120 is still very usable and reliable apart from being so cheap. ",

I can tell you what I like, which is: low key travelsoft touchSo my favourite keyboard for feel is this: Kensington K72357US Slim Type Keyboard  I suspect that if you liked the feel of a Morse key (I have not had the pleasure of trying one), I would start with testing out mechanical keyboards, which have a high key travel and a clicky feel. Here is one example, but there are many out there: Logitech G710+ Mechanical Gaming Keyboard with Tactile High-Speed Keys - Black (920-003887)  ",
