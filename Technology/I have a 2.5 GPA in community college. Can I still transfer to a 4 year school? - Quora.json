            "answer_text": "College admissions depend on a number of things, but for transfer, GPA is going to be a big factor if you have completed 12 or more credits because you will be considered a transfer student. In this case the college won't look at your ACT/SAT score but rather things like GPA. Also, keep in mind, if your low GPA is based on having some grades lower than a C, those classes probably won't transfer even if you get accepted so you would have to re-take them. The best way to boost your GPA and avoid this issue would be to re-take a few classes in which you got low grades and get much higher grades the second time. You should probably start by visiting the college's webpages for admissions to see what the admissions requirements are and then apply if there isn't anything precluding you from doing so. Understand that with that GPA, you probably won't be accepted directly into one of the programs you mention without showing some additional success first.  ",

            "answer_text": "The competition to get into 4 year institutions is tightening. You need to start getting serious about life. For the rate of technological change is geometric in its progression. Consequently one must create the change, learn to surf it or become chum in its waters. Eric Schmidt, the Chairman of the Board of Google recently said at the Econ summit in Davos, that we should expect to see structural unemployment globally of around 10% for well into the forseable future. That means stiffer competition for jobs. Further, if you are an American consider this. In India, there are more honors graduates than all the graduates in the US combined. So who do you think employers are going to hire? Because people from India are flocking to the USA. Thus you are competing against everyone else in the world, not just the people at your J C. Consequently, you must up your game regarding your GPA. Toss out the video games, the bong and the beer. Because the future is going to be quite intense.  Focus on that which fires you up, change your major to that and hit the books. Don't be satisfied with with less than your best effort. Become a expert in something. ",
