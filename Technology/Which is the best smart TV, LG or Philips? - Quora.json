            "answer_text": "Straight forward this one !! After owning several Phillips TV's and 2 LG's, I can fully confirm that LG are a bag of dog Sh*t !! The last LG I had in my possession was of a 'premium\u2019 nature and it was terrible. It made movie special effects look like a computer game. After spending \u00a380 in phone calls to LG to try and improve the picture quality, I gave up !! I returned the LG and exchanged it for a Phillips. This was the second time this has happened in the last 4 years !! I currently own a Phillips 4k fifty inch that I bought for under \u00a3500. And it's great. If you're looking at a Phillips, check out the models with 'Ambi-light'. You'll get a very immersive experience whilst watching movies. Please please please stay away from LG. GOOD LUCK !! ",
