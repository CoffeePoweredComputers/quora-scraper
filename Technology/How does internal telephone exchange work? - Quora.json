            "answer_text": "I presume when you say \u201cinternal telephone exchange\u201d - you mean a PBX or private branch exchange. This is more in reference to with legacy landline than today\u2019s cellular communications. PBX were a electro-mechanical device that effectively grouped a table of phone numbers or telephone identifiers so that it could operate more effectively and efficiently with each other (those on the list). For instance, there was abbreviated dialing - eg the ability to ring another # with just a couple of digits instead of all 7 or 10+ digits. The ability to pick-up another line - remotely, or to transfer or bridge others in the list. All while using your phone normally to receive and make calls to the rest of the world. IF you didn\u2019t want to purchase or lease PBX, the service was called CENTREX which was software in the central office of your telephone utility. Today cellphone are ubiquitous and most of these internal telephone exchange services are obsolete but can probably done with some expert software definitions. ",
