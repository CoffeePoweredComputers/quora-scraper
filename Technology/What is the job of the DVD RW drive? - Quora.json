            "answer_text": "It writes to DVDs of course. There are essentially two capacities of optical disks in the DVD \u201cfamily\u201d. Single layer disks can hold around 4.7 GB. Double Layer disks can hold 8.5 GB. Movies have a special format that can be played in conventional DVD players. Long movies, or movies with lots of extras, usually require the double layer disk. If the program allows it, complete movies can often fit on the single layer disk. There is a different type of DVD, the \u201cdata disk\u201d. This can hold virtually anything. The files look like any random collection of files. Computers can use them for all the usual purposes, but if you put a data DVD in a DVD player it usually acts like there is nothing in the drive. Data DVDs look like blanks to a DVD player. There are variations of the DVD RW format usually presented as DVD-RW or DVD+RW which I have never understood. Look it up. Sometimes older DVD writers are picky about which formats they can write to. More recent devices are likely to be able to write to just about any valid format. ",

            "answer_text": "Since my response was requested, a DVD RW drive is a digital video disk re-writeable device. Its purpose is to allow the user to playback DVD movies, read data from data DVD disks and \u201cburn\u201d data or movies onto DVD disks. Also, because of the technology involved, all of the DVDRW drives I have encountered will also allow the user to do the same with CDs. Technicians have other uses for them, but that\u2019s beyond the scope of this post. ",
