            "answer_text": "Let\u2019s look at a graph:  See a trend there? It\u2019s the growth in technology relative to time. This will be a generalization. There is no way to grab every piece of data and write an answer less than a thousand words. But here\u2019s what you need to understand: Technology is growing at an accelerating rate, and I don\u2019t mean Moore\u2019s Law, which dealt with computer transistors. What makes this graph exponential is a logical cycle of technology and humanity. As technology advances, it improves our lives and lets us get closer to maximum working efficiency. We don\u2019t need to reinvent the wheel. Because our efficiency advances, we have more time to do innovative work on technology, meaning that technology improves, and this improves the cycle. And that isn\u2019t the only relationship. Humans make technology. Technology, in turn, helps us to make more humans by providing us with more food. More humans means more technology and the cycle continues. The invention of fertilizer alone was revolutionary. More than a third of the people alive today would not exist without it, because it provided the food needed to support them. Carl Bosch Is Why You Are Alive and the Gulf of Mexico Isn\u2019t (Even though I know people hate clicking on links, there is one of the main sources I used) \u2026 So, how do you profit from this?  Funnily enough, you\u2019ll profit from this without doing anything. Technology will keep making your life nicer and easier, and it\u2019s doing this because you like to buy useful stuff. If you\u2019re an investor, innovative companies like Tesla or Apple will be excellent buys since they should continue to grow. The internet companies like google, paypal, and related companies are excellent buys. For you, though, as a person and not as an investor, the best thing you can do is to buy things you like. Buy a cool drone, or a new iPhone. But whatever you do, don\u2019t add to the fake \u201ctrends.\u201d Fidget spinners, silly bandz\u2026 they don\u2019t add value to your life, and they slash at the technological curve. Why would you watch \u201cThe Emoji Movie\u201d when it\u2019s practically an hour and a half long advertisement? You will decide the future, and you don\u2019t need to be the next Elon Musk to do so. You\u2019re doing it right now. ",

            "answer_text": "Revolution in Digital marketing : Before the internet, marketing was very different from what it is today. Print advertising, direct mail, and traditional media were the only options companies had for getting the word out.  Today, of course, things are much different. In 2018, spending on digital ads was projected to surpass traditional advertising for the first time, with digital media spend reaching $100.8 billion. We all know that things are changing quickly, and digital marketing has rapidly adapted to new mediums and customer demands over the years. With that in mind, what does the future hold? Where will digital marketing go in the next five years? While it\u2019s impossible to say for sure, here are a few projections for what will be important in the coming years. Voice Search:  Although the mobile revolution has shown no signs of slowing down, one thing is absolutely true: it\u2019s much harder to type on a phone or tablet than a keyboard. It also takes more time to type something than to say it. Enter: voice search. Smart devices equipped with \u201cpersonal assistants\u201d who respond to voice commands like Siri, Alexa, and Cortana are on the rise for good reason. People love the convenience of being able to place an order, check the weather, or set a reminder. As Barry Schwartz notes in a recent expert round-up on the future of digital marketing, \u201cExpect voice search to be a huge area in the near future.\u201d Some estimates suggest that by 2020, more than half of searches will be conducted using voice search. Marketers will need to adapt to this new search method by writing in a conversational tone and anticipating the kinds of keywords people will search for using their voice. It won\u2019t so much affect the marketing itself as the way content is considered and written. Artificial Intelligence and Virtual Reality :  People love novelty and quickly get used to new mediums. Video is now a staple, but virtual reality (VR) is a rising star in marketing that will really come into its own in the next few years. Immersive experiences help people connect on an emotional level, which is key for increasing brand loyalty and sales. Artificial intelligence (AI) will also play a larger role in the future of marketing. It can be used in many different applications including image recognition, personalization, chatbots, and enhanced pay-per-click campaigns. Smart marketers will begin to invest in this technology now, in order to stay competitive in the future. Brand PR Will Become Essential :  Generation Z, which will soon control much of the spending power in the United States, is a socially-conscious generation that demands more from brands than just great products and services. They want to purchase from companies that are ethical and care about improving society and the world at large. Customers are acutely aware of issues like climate change, social justice, poverty, and income inequality, which is becoming a larger issue in the United States every year, with just 1% of the population controlling 40% of the nation\u2019s wealth. Younger buyers are concerned about these issues, and will direct their dollars to companies that pledge to help find solutions. In order to cater to these buyers, companies will need to focus on brand PR and get involved with a social or environmental cause to help their local and global communities. Some of the world\u2019s richest people are already getting involved with these kinds of initiatives, such as The Giving Pledge, which people take to signal that they plan to give away the majority of their wealth to benefit current and future generations.  Continual Focus on Consumer\u2019s Wants & Values : Marketing is always about what the customer wants, needs, and values. That\u2019s not going to change in the next five years. You can\u2019t sell products if you don\u2019t know what your customers want or what their problems are. Marketers will need to understand their audiences on a deep level so they can serve those needs. Even More Targeted Advertising : Online advertising is an uphill battle, because we\u2019re less tolerant than ever of popups and other types of digital advertising. Marketers will continue to focus on creating more targeted advertising to create the kinds of emotional reactions that sell products. Emotion-based campaigns, like the Dove \u201cReal Beauty\u201d campaign and Google\u2019s \u201cFriends Furever\u201d were some of the most successful online ad campaigns because they were created to elicit an emotional response in their target audiences. Storytelling is a Constant in Marketing : No matter where digital marketing goes in the next few years, good storytelling will always be a key component of effective marketing. Marketers need to keep on top of trends as they change, but keeping the audience\u2019s needs top of mind and creating content that speaks to that audience\u2019s emotions are always key. Digital marketing is an ever-changing landscape that requires creativity, curiosity, patience, and a willingness to try new tactics. ",
