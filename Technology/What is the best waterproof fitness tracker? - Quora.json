            "answer_text": "Different strokes for different folks. Below are a list of suggestions for varied user groupings. Although our recommendations aren't binding, we are certain you will be content with atleast one of the suggested fitness trackers. So without further ado, lets begin with: The Self-starter Such a user does sport just every once in awhile, but they still really want to know if they move enough and sleeps soundly. Counting calorie consumption and monitoring vital signs are essential to them. The self-starter really wants to motivate themself to live healthier and improve their performance in everyday life. What they are really looking for is something that is ideal for everyday use and comfy to wear. Recommendation: A mid-priced model that does not have any display is generally fine. The collected data will end up being analysed retrospectively with the inclusive app or smart phone or computer. Consider these: FitBit Flex 2 and or Xiaomi Mi Band 2 Pros: It's easy to use and uncomplicated, waterproof, so you'll be able to use this while swimming and track how good your dips in the pool are going. Software is fun to use, device light and comfy. Cons: Battery life not so great, charge very slow Amateur Athletes The amateur athlete trains regularly, usually between 2-3 3 times a week. During this time period}, they are distracted from stress and strain of everyday life, so they train, simply for fun. When tracking the training data, the main factor usually is that the athlete motivates themself. The accuracy of the measurement data is definitely of utmost important. Recommendation: For hobbyist athlete an inexpensive model (optional with pulse measurement) is adequate|enough in any case. Consider these: Garmin VivoSmart 3 or Polar Loop 2 Pros: Water-resistant to 50m, Five-day battery life, Heart rate monitoring, Automatic rep counting, Smartphone notifications etc Cons: No GPS, Design plain, movement sensing hit and miss Ambitious Athletes An ambitious athlete also desires higher measurement accuracy and an excellent device that's comfy to wear. Furthermore, many athletes attach importance to an in depth, extensive evaluation of the training data . Among the essential features a relatively long and durable battery life is a must. Recommendation: With a slightly higher spending budget, a model with integrated pulse measurement and the option to pair a upper body strap are suitable. If the athlete still desire additional GPS, an exercise computing device or a sports activities watch is more suitable. Consider these: Garmin VivoSmart HR or FitBit Iconic Pros: If you're looking for a fitness focused device that can tackle running, weight lifting, swimming and much, much more? This is it. Dedicated workout programs and Fitbit Pay are among the other highlights of the Ionic. Comes with a variety of fitness options, bright display Cons: Interface a bit slow, limited apps Professional Athletes They put an especially large focus on measurement, accuracy and a very high level of ease and comfort. Furthermore, an extended battery life and simplicity are a demand, the cost of acquisition play a fairly subordinate role. Recommendation: For the professional athlete certainly a high-quality model, with a specialist training accompanied application and training computer to monitor heart rate measurement and a GPS function is best suited. Consider these: Garmin VivoSport or Polar Range Training Computer M430 Pros: Thin fitness band, comfortable to wear, built fitness apps directly into the Vivosport with both strength training and cardio options available. And there's a VO2 Max sensor that should also be able to supply you with an accurate reading of your fitness age. Cons: Small display In conclusion, There are so many different brands and designs out there which haven\u2019t been tested and reviewed, yet it might be much better than the devices mentioned so take your time, certainly don\u2019t rush into the newest hippest tech gear that makes all kinds of unwarranted promises\u2026we will be launching our review website soon that will hopefully give you a much better insight into these and more\u2026 ",

            "answer_text": "It is a must to go for a fitness tracker that is waterproof. Not only will it protect itself from sweat while you are exercising but also from an accidental splash of water on it.  There are different ratings that tell you about how much waterproof your fitness tracker is. For example, my PlayFIT 53 smart health & fitness band has an IP68 rating which makes it completely dust & waterproof. It is protected against complete, continuous submersion in water up to 1.5 metres. That means it is completely sweatproof and even you can use it while you are taking a shower or in your bathtub. But using it while swimming will be wrong. It has other amazing features too which I am mentioning below: Compatible with both Android & iOS devices Fast and stable Bluetooth 4.2 It has an advanced heart rate monitor Sedentary Alert for motivating you to do exercise. Step Count Monitoring Function with target completion reminder & Calories burn tracking Extended battery life of 7 to10 days on a single charge Sleep tracker to track your light & deep sleep stages. Helps you control music player & camera remotely Supports 14 sports modes like Walking, Running, Cycling, Skipping, Badminton, Basketball, Football etc Call and notification alert for SMS, WeChat, QQ, Facebook, WhatsApp, Twitter, Instagram, Messenger, LinkedIn, Email, Calendar, Skype etc. ",
