Wire Color Coding I am reluctant to answer this but in residential 120VAC wiring in the US, the answer would be no. White is neutral. Red is either the other phase of the 240 volt mains into your house, or sometimes, inside the house, after the breaker panel, white is neutral, black is 120, and green is ground. Colored wires blue, yellow (try to avoid red, although I\u2019ve seen it used) indicate that that wire is switched somewhere, so it's the black hot wire to a switch, then the \u201con\u201d side of that switch would have a colored wire leaving it, feeding the switched outlet, or ceiling light, or whatever. In DC wiring, red is positive, black is negative, and grey or white is ground. ",

Seriously, this question does not have enough facts for a good answer, but if I assume you are talking about house wiring then NO do not connect them together! In normal house wiring the WHITE is the neutral wire connecting to the neutral buss at the breaker panel and the RED would be one phase of a 240 Volt 2 phase circuit with a black wire being the other phase and the bare or green wire the earth ground going to the ground buss on the breaker panel.
