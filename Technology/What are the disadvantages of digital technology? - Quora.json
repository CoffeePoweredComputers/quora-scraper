            "answer_text": "One of them is that it s addictive ! Specially things like smart phones. Am other disadvantage is the quality of what ever hardware or programs, it seems that nothing last very long compare to and old tv or a turn table compare to a cd player , a lap top and especially a phone. IT all seems to be made not to last and replaced quickly. One thing specially is the music quality between a vinyl and a digital recording, i ll give it to you that there is less scratching but there is less \u2026.. sound. It s just not the same. A digital watch will never stand up to a mechanic self winding watch. Digital is all , quick cheap not that easy and i would say fragile. ",
