            "answer_text": "If you are trying to set up a broadband connection at home, you need to use a standard Ethernet cable. You would need to plug in the cable or DSL modem to the port on the router where it is marked WAN or Internet. You should connect the other end to each computer on the hub. If you already have got the connection from broadband providers, you need to open TCP/IP control panel and configure your router. You need to open a web browser and access the router settings by entering the name and password from the manual. You should not keep it as default if you want to avoid other siphoning your data. The configuration would depend on the type of IP address you have - static or dynamic. Also, you need to make sure that you are using the current version of the firmware. This will help you to stay protected from potential attacks. After you have done that, you need to restart the computers for the settings to take effect. ",
