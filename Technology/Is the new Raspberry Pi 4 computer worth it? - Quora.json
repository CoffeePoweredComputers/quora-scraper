            "answer_text": "Only if you want the extra RAM. I tried the the RaspberryPi3 but had problems running out of RAM. It ran into swapping if I started too many worker threads in a program I am testing; the second case was trying to use the Pi3 as a light weight desktop where it took 16 hours to swap between browser tabs. The Pi4 has USB3 so using an SSD looks practical and also having GB Ethernet would be a big speed up as the previous versions (2,3) only had 100M on a slow interface (around 25M I think). I have used Pi2 as vnc client, but it is rather sluggish, hopefully with Pi4 this would be much better and offers the possibility of good performance for remote rendering a VM desktop over GB lan. ",

            "answer_text": "There are several possible reasons: Its a real, honest-to-God computer for $35 - but pay $55 and get the 4GB RAM option.It runs a really cool optimized version of Linux (Raspbian) that is fully Free Open Source (FOSS). This means that you can get and experiment with the source code for everything. I especially recommend looking at the source for Pixel (desktop environment) to learn how a really simple DTE works. It is a very nice way to learn about the Linux OS and to see some great examples of application software.It has a full-featured General Purpose IO (GPIO) implementation that is very useful for designing home projects, controlling your home, etc.It can be packaged easily into a cheap standalone for POS business uses - my doctor\u2019s clinic uses it for sign-in.Its great for a kid\u2019s experimental computer",
