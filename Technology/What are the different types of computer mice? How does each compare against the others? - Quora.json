            "answer_text": "Different Types of Computer Mice Mechanical Mouse (or ball mouse) - a mechanical mouse has rubber or metal ball on it\u2019s underside. When the ball rolls, mechanical sensors inside the mouse detect the direction and move the pointer on the screen of the PC. This type of mouse requires a flat surface or a mouse pad to work efficiently. One of the drawbacks of the device is that it is more prone to attracting dust. Optical-Mechanical Mouse - is same as the mechanical mouse except that the sensors used in it are optical and not mechanical. The device is a combination of optical and mechanical technologies, wherein, the ball is present but the mouse movement is detected optically leading to more accuracy. Laser Mouse - is the new generation mouse with two necessary components \u2013 light emitter and light detector. A laser mouse uses laser as the light emitter and has a precise scanning of mouse movement. You will find a laser mouse ranging anywhere between 1000-5700 dots-per-inch (DPI). Optical Mouse - An optical mouse also has light emitter and light detector but it uses LED as the light emitter. It generally has lower DPI than laser mouse and users might find difficulty in using the device on black or shiny surfaces. Blue-Track Mouse - The latest type of mouse, it is based on Blue Track Technology that enables the mouse to track efficiently on any surface, be it a granite, counter-top or a carpet. The blue beam in mouse is a combination of image sensor and pixel geometry & is four times larger than the average laser beam used in laser mouse. It generates high-contrast pictures of the surface for an exceptional tracking accuracy. ",

What you want to know are what alternatives to mice there are, like trackballs.alternative mouse - Google Search Mostly I have used a pad and stylus myself.  It has the advantage of being able to use a coordinate system instead of the cumulative drag method of mice. You have to set the preference, but once you do the active surface represents the monitor screen. Used to be a great cheat for shooting games that simulate kick by changing cursor position. ",
