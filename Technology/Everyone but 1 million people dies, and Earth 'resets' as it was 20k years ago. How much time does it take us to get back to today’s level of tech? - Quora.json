            "answer_text": "It\u2019s been estimated[1] that the minimum population needed to maintain the present level of technology is at least 100 million. You allow the Earth to \u201creset\u201d as it was 20k years ago, which simplifies the situation with mining and food production. You don\u2019t need 1-mile-deep mines above the Arctic Circle and sophisticated refining plants that extract the metal from ore that is 0.5% copper by weight, because you can find rich deposits of all major minerals just below the surface everywhere you look. You can easily feed large numbers of people through fishing because oceans are suddenly full of fish (you\u2019ll probably even want to legalize whaling). That still leaves you with 998 other subfields and occupations for which you can\u2019t find enough people any more. With only 1 million left, and assuming that 90% of them don\u2019t die within the first few years due to the initial shock caused by supply line disruptions, and if they are strategically located in the same place and have appropriate skills, they should be able to stabilize at somewhere around the 1950s level of technology. We\u2019re basically talking tuktuks with 3-speed manual transmissions and hinged windows instead of Toyota Camrys, blimps instead of airplanes, gas-stove cooking instead of microwaves, etc. Most of the computer technology would be lost, but it may be possible to keep a single semiconductor foundry running at a severely diminished capacity on a shoestring budget, cranking out chips at something like 800 nm process (early 1990s level of tech). Getting back to today is mostly dependent on their ability to reproduce. If they crank fertility to the limit, they should be able to reach requisite numbers in about a century. If it\u2019s 1 million randomly selected from 7 billion alive today and the Earth is completely reset (all existing structures and artifacts are gone and they are starting Survivor-style, in the jungle and just with clothes on their backs), that\u2019s harder. You can forget about the semiconductor foundry: the few engineers you end up with are going to have their hands full figuring out how to build and run iron foundries. How many people in your random 1 million are even going to know how to make paper? Still, with proper organization, they should be able to go steampunk within 20 years (it\u2019s either that or revert to hunter-gatherers), from which point it\u2019s 100\u2013150 years till modern level.

            "answer_text": "I suspect it would take only a few generations to return to the level of sophistication and societal organization we had in, say, 1900. The thing you have to remember is that science and technological knowledge would not perish, because the vast majority of it would survive in written form. Those who survive would be able to pass along their understanding of the way societies function. But for a while there, things would be mighty bleak. Many science-fiction writers have explored this concept, and there even is a television program right now that uses the premise for laughs \u2014 \u201cThe Last Man on Earth.\u201d One of the best versions of this tale, in my opinion, is one of the earliest \u2014 \u201cEarth Abides,\u201d by George R. Stewart, published in 1949. Disease wipes out nearly everyone \u2014 so what happens? Our hero, Isherwood Williams, is hiking alone in the California mountains with his rockhammer when pandemic sweeps the world. A snakebite and a difficult recovery confine him to his cabin, and he misses the turmoil as just about everyone drops dead and civilization expires. When his health returns, he drives across the country and discovers just how empty the continent has become. He meets stragglers, some of whom are well-equipped for survival, and others who are unlikely to last the winter. He returns home to San Francisco, where rats roam the streets, and then the wild dogs that eat them. The power goes out within a few weeks \u2014 even hydroelectric dams and the power grid need maintenance. Eventually survivors join him and form a small community, a couple dozen within a few years. Ish finds a mate \u2014 and soon he recognizes they can\u2019t survive much longer on the leavings of a dead society. As the windswept city decays, they move out of town to farm country. They read everything they can about agriculture, relearn the skills most everyone had in the 19th century. As the story ends, Ish is an old man; his mate has died but the community has prospered and grown. The young have taken to hunting with bows and arrows, and one of the few artifacts of the old civilization that remain in common use is coinage \u2014 because a nickel or a quarter can easily be pounded into an arrowhead. Ish worries that his attempt to teach younger generations to read will not take hold, because that is the key to restoring civilization. He passes his rockhammer to a younger man who can lead the community. Earth Abides is a remarkable story. It recognizes concepts that became widely accepted only years later. Ish is a student of a new science called \u201cecology.\u201d He questions whether the old civilization is worth restoring. At one point he finds himself wondering how long it will be before anyone composes a symphony again \u2014 and he realizes that just about everyone with that kind of specialized artistic knowledge is now gone. Perhaps the new civilization that will come will devise an entirely different way of expressing itself. Perhaps future generations will dispose of our notion of \u201ccivilization.\u201d A theme that runs through the book is that the environment is more resilient than man himself. Within a few years the forces of nature that humanity thought it had mastered begin to reclaim the earth. Wildlife and forests and fisheries rebound while cities burn and cars turn to rust. Hence the title, drawn from Ecclesiates: \u201cMen go and come, but Earth abides.\u201d (And if anyone cares about the parameters of the question, it wouldn\u2019t take long for the natural order to revert to the conditions that prevailed 20,000 years ago.) Ish\u2019s isolated pocket of humanity recognizes its smallness and vulnerability, and its citizens understand they need to cooperate and police themselves if they are to survive. Communication has broken down, and Ish\u2019s community has no idea what is happening on other continents, or even a few hundred miles away \u2014 not that it matters a whit. Their first job is to ensure their own survival. In the years since I read that novel, I\u2019ve sometimes wondered \u2014 what happens next? The community continues to grow, certainly. It spreads and takes over the best farmland of the Central Valley. Eventually it establishes contact with other, similar communities. Maybe there is conflict, but I doubt it \u2014 everyone will be focused on survival, and there will be plenty of resources for all. And eventually I suspect a semblance of civilization would take form. The Internet would die the moment the power goes out. Forget that. Much of the knowledge we have amassed over the last 20 years would be gone. But the books would remain. Heck, old printing presses and mimeograph machines still could be used. And once these older forms of communication are revived, it wouldn\u2019t take long for technical schools and universities to be established. Odds are they\u2019d be a bit like the earliest universities we saw in this country, focused on teaching people to read and write, and on the practical trades necessary to ensure progress. Within a few generations, the population would have dramatically increased, and civilization once again would be on the ascent. It might be a hundred years or so, though, before anyone has the luxury again to contemplate particle physics. There are really only a few things I think George R. Stewart got wrong. Even in 1949, when he was writing, we had ham radios \u2014 shortwave signals can span the world. Yes, these things require electricity, but portable generators (and now solar panels) could provide juice. Fairly quickly someone would establish a broadcasting station. Radio would unite the world, even if the oceans became difficult (impossible) to cross. Second, I don\u2019t think reading would die out, even if literacy declined. I remember that by reading to both my sons at a young age, they picked up the skill even before they entered kindergarten. It\u2019s not that tough to pass that knowledge along. I also think people would quickly come to understand that knowledge really is power. And third \u2014 this really isn\u2019t something Stewart got wrong. But it does demonstrate the difference between the world of today and the world of 1949. At one point in the story, one of the characters mentions how much he loved going to the movies, and how crazy he was about Dorothy Lamour. And of course, the irony is that no one will ever know who Dorothy Lamour was, after a few years have passed. By the time anyone figures out how to run a movie projector again, the film will have rotted. But if this worldwide disaster were to occur tomorrow, that certainly wouldn\u2019t be true. Think of all the millions of DVDs, DVD players and television sets that would survive. Odds are that in every one of these isolated communities of survivors, every night would be movie night, and there would be a constant reminder of the world that came before, and the world that might be re-established. Stewart seemed to conclude that our old ways would be forgotten and civilization would have no meaning; that reading would become a lost art and knowledge would turn to dust. He also seemed to think the loss might not be so tragic. You know \u2014the old idea that our pride in our accomplishments and advancement is a conceit, and that forces mightier than we are eventually will win. These thoughts were perhaps more common when the horrors of World War II were a recent memory. But in this new world, this kind of thinking would seem silly. Of course people would be interested in advancing their condition. It is a fundamental element of human nature. So give things a hundred years. We still might not have a functioning Internet, but it wouldn\u2019t be that far in the future. The key thing is that enough people would have survived to pass their knowledge on to future generations. It took 100,000 years to build our civilization, but it wouldn\u2019t take that long to rebuild it. BTW, I can\u2019t praise this \u201cforgotten novel\u201d highly enough \u2014 and I might add that while it was never made into a movie, you can also find it in the form of a two-part radio drama aired on the series \u201cEscape\u201d over CBS in 1950.
