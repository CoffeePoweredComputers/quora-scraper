            "answer_text": "Charles K. Kao wrote the first paper outlining the use of fiber optic cables for data transmission in 1966 for which he won the Nobel Prize. But in his paper he noted that best glass he was able to test still had an attenuation of 600dB/km to 200dB/km which made his glass practical for only 150 meters in the best case scenario. He theorized that the attenuation could get as low as 20dB/km by removing iron impurities. Then in 1970, Drs. Robert Maurer, Donald Keck, and Peter Schultz at Corning glass works doped a silica glass fiber with titanium and demonstrated a loss of 17dB/km. This proved to be the first fiber made to have any practical use, but just barely. Corinng spent the next couple years refining their process and using different methods of drawing out the fiber and using different materials for the doping until they were able to help create the first telecommunications link over fiber in 1975.

            "answer_text": "In 1952, UK based physicist Narinder Singh Kapany invented the first actual fiber optical cable based on John Tyndall's experiments three decades earlier. Difference between Optical Fiber and Coaxial Cable The computers and other digital devices transmit the information from one to another device in the kind of signals and with a transmission media. The transmission media can be basically categorized into two types guided and unguided. ",
