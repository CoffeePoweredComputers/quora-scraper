            "answer_text": "Technology is a tool; it can either be used for good or ill. Discovering how to split atoms to cause a nuclear chain reaction can either be used to provide energy to entire cities, or it can be used to blow them up. Silicon Valley is the single most powerfully innovative culture in the history of the world. The technologies produced there have disrupted entire industries, almost overnight. But the technology can be used either for good or evil. People use Facebook to report to their loved ones that they are safe during a hurricane. Other people use it to stalk their exes, or to spread fake information to sway elections. The problem is that disruption is regarded as inherently positive, when in reality there are unforeseen consequences of using these technologies that aren't. The germ theory of disease has enabled scientists to develop cures and vaccines that have demonstrably improved the lives of millions of people. However, part of the reason WWI was such a horrible conflict is the use of biological and chemical agents to kill the enemy. I think the main takeaway is that the ethics of using technology does not always keep pace with the technology itself. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, absolutely, by definition. To answer this question, I think it\u2019s instructive to look at a couple of definitions of \u201cprogress\u201d (mine are from Google Define): forward or onward movement towards a destination.development towards an improved or more advanced condition.Now, in light of this: Science strives to learn more and more about the world. A scientific breakthrough is exactly a movement toward this destination, a more advanced state of knowledge. Technology is about applying knowledge to find solutions to problems, to advance toward goals. Certainly, better technology gives people better means to achieve their goals. Better mousetraps and all that. Again, this is the definition of progress! I suspect the question really means to ask if progress is always an advancement in the right direction, for whatever you may want to define \u201cright\u201d as: Greater happiness and less suffering for humanity, more money in Jeff Bezos\u2019 bank account or global domination. The answer to that question would depend on whether you presuppose that most people and their goals are good or evil. ",

            "answer_text": "Always. To know something newhas never been less than a good thing. If I understand your question correctly then perhaps you\u2019re conflating knowledge or advances in technology as having not benefited mankind. Perhaps, though you\u2019re confusing understanding or knowledge with its application or the combined problems of politics/human behaviour/misapplication of that knowledge. That\u2019s a seperate thing entirely. You can\u2019t cherry pic knowledge. You have to accept that some things you\u2019re going to like and some things you\u2019re not. Some things help. Some things don\u2019t. You don\u2019t know what won\u2019t help unless you understand what it actually is you\u2019re looking at. ",

Our empathy seems to degrade, and other societies who can't afford the same technological advances are left in the dust. It's cool to move forward, but we leave many things behind: including people.

French writer Jean Giono tells how his father said the same thing, more or less, but in quite different words. As a ten-year-old he ran to his father, a shoemaker, and said, 'Look, father, in the newspaper, there's a plane now that goes three hundred kilometres an hour.\u2019' 'So what?\u2019 replied his father. 'When they get off the plane, they still can't talk to each other.' ",
