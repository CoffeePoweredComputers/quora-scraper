            "answer_text": "Obviously, individual radiologists daily experiences are going to vary from person to person based on individual expertise and the group the individual practices in.  I will offer a few experiences from a selection of my own work days.  I believe it will be somewhat generalizable.   On a recent day,  I was assigned to interventional radiology (IR) and also a CT list.  I performed several procedures (2 myelograms, 1 liver biopsy, 1 abscess drainage and 3 joint injections).  I'm not sure who my audience is so, I will explain each of the procedures.  In all procedures, the patient's history of illness/ indication for the procedure, laboratory data and possible contraindications should be researched.  Prior imaging should be studied to determine the best approach. Myelograms are specialized studies in which a lumbar puncture is performed and iodinated contrast is injected in to the cerebral spinal fluid surrounding the nerve roots and spinal cord.  This is typically followed by a CT scan of the area of interest e.g. cervical spine or lumbar spine, etc.  Flouroscopy (a type of live x-ray) is used to guide the puncture.  After the injection, the CT images are scrutinized and an interpretation rendered. A liver biopsy can be targeted towards a specific lesion e.g. mass or can be a non-targeted biopsy in any part of the liver usually to try to determine why a patient has elevated liver enzymes.  The radiologist uses ultrasound (US) or CT to guide the needle to an acceptable location.  Images are obtained, samples sent to pathology and a procedure note is dictated. Similarly, an abscess drainage uses imaging (usually CT or US) for needle guidance in to a pocket of pus to drain it and facilitate healing.  Arthrograms use fluoroscopy to guide a needle in to a joint and inject contrast for further imaging or medicine to reduce pain and inflammation. Prior to, between and after these procedures, I would go to my office and work on interpreting and dictating reports on about 30 to 40 CT scans.  These might be of any portion of the body to include the head and spine, chest, abdomen, pelvis or extremities. At my current institution, each of the radiologists is assigned one or more services to cover for the day.  These include plain films (x-rays), IR, CT, MRI, US, fluoroscopic procedures, mammography and nuclear medicine.  For the most part, in each of these rotations, the radiologist looks at imaging most of the day and renders an interpretation by way of dictating a report.  The report goes out to the provider who ordered the study.  Also, a radiologist often answers phone calls from clinicians about imaging of various patients and directs technologists and ancillary staff in the performance of the imaging and procedures. In some groups, there is a large list of imaging studies and procedures which have been performed or need to performed and several radiologists all tackle \"the list\" with each radiologist interpreting whatever studies they can and performing any procedures, they can until a specified time or the \"the list\" is completed.  A particular radiologist (usually on a rotating basis) is then assigned to cover any studies after usual business hours and on weekends.  This is called taking call.  Sometimes a nighthawk service (teleradiology) will take care of the after hour studies. In large academic institutions subspecialists will only interpret imaging having to do with their individual specialty.  For example, neuroradiologists will only read neuroradiology exams which include imaging of the brain, spine and head and neck regions.  Furthermore these exams are only read by neuroradiologists.  Likewise, body imagers would read all of the body exams and musculoskeletal radiologists would read all of the extremity exams, etc.  I would say that the majority of radiology groups employ radiologists who interpret a broad spectrum of studies and might employ several subspecialists who also read across other specialties but provided consultation to other members of the group as needed. Sorry for the long winded explanation. ",

            "answer_text": "Radiologists are board certified physicians (MDs or DOs in the U.S.) who are trained to interpret medical imaging and perform image-guided procedures (also termed minimally invasive, non-surgical, or \"interventional\" procedures). 1. Interpretation:Examples of imaging that radiologists interpret include x-rays, ultrasounds, CTs, MRIs, and various nuclear medicine studies (cardiac stress tests, PET, etc.). It's often surprising to patients that their CTs, MRIs, x-rays, etc. aren't interpreted by the surgeon, internist, or other specialist which they see and speak to at clinic or the hospital. While the physicians you typically see in the office or hospital are the providers that usually ORDER these tests, in many cases, they are not the physicians who formally perform the imaging interpretations. Some subspecialist physicians are fairly adept at interpreting studies within their respective fields, but that's a different discussion.  The reasons that radiologists, rather than the ordering physicians, perform these interpretations are numerous, but generally include:1) The complexity of imaging modalities (especially newer modalities such as MRI), which require months or years of dedicated training2) The subtlety of many radiologic diagnoses, which require looking at hundreds or thousands of examples to become proficient3) The breadth of pathology within the human body, which can manifest in hundreds of ways throughout different organ systems (this prevents, say, an orthopedic surgeon from being adept at finding a blood clot within a pulmonary blood vessel, which they don't regularly know the anatomy of) So, radiologists train exclusively at finding these abnormalities on a day-to-day basis by looking at hundreds and thousands of examples. Although there are some cases where the same physicians both order AND interpret their own studies (cardiologists, for example), this is often limited to specific organ systems (cardiac and some vascular studies). 2. Image guided procedures (\"Interventional radiology\"):Image guided procedures are medical procedures performed under CT, ultrasound, fluoroscopic (real time x-ray), or other live imaging guidance. Training in minimally invasive procedures is a part of every radiologist's training, although the breadth and complexity of the procedures a particular radiologist will do with depends on his/her own training and experience.  In current practice, certain common procedures are taught in residency, and further training is obtained in fellowship, one of which is interventional radiology. There are a wide number of image-guided procedures that interventional radiologists are trained to perform, including treating tumors through blood vessels or by using thin probes (in order to avoid larger surgeries which require much longer recovery times), stopping bleeds through the blood vessels without the use of surgery, unblocking arteries or veins, draining infections, performing biopsies using ultrasound/CT guidance, etc. There are literally dozens of procedures which are performed, and for a more comprehensive list, feel free to visit the interventional radiology wikipedia page:Interventional radiology ",
