            "answer_text": "Here\u2019s the first two steps I highly suggest for anyone interested in the negative effects of the overuse of technology to take: 1. Watch the movies The Terminator and Terminator 2: Judgement Day. 2. Watch the TV series \u201cTerminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles This will show you where our world is headed if we don\u2019t take some common sense steps regarding terminating research into artificial intelligence. Research into artificial intelligence is highly unnecessary and it allowed to continue, will at worst, result in the extinction of the human race, and at best, \u201conly\u201d make life an absolute nightmare for future generations. This is stuff that won\u2019t directly affect me; I\u2019m not taking the time an effort write this for my own benefit, since I won\u2019t still be alive by the time the full scale destructive effects take place. For those of you who have children and grandchildren and don\u2019t want them to have go through the hell that artificial intelligence will unleash on their world, you owe it to them to take those first to steps I described above. These are entertaining movies and a fascinating TV series, as well as being highly informative so even if you consider it a task to do what\u2019s necessary so you\u2019ll be adequately informed about the potential of artificial intelligence, it\u2019s an exciting, interesting task. The fate of the human race is at stake, so watch what I told you to watch, and watch it carefully. They are early warning signs you\u2019re morally obligated to watch if you care about the fate of the human race and they may be the only early warning signs you get. ",

            "answer_text": "See the very first step is to stop the overuse of the technology. In daily life we are too adict of technology that you are asking this question through the technological help and people (mee to) are replying, it is the overuse. We are too addict of it that the things which can be done directly we are using machine as a mediator for even that, just to satisfy our habit of being addict or to show that we are modern or to reduce our daily efforts which even adverse our health. Just reduce unnecessary use of technology you'll automatically get negative effects reduced and believe me there is no alternative option . ",
