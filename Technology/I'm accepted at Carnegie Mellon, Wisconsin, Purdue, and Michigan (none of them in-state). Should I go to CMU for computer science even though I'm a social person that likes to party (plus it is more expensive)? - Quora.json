            "answer_text": "Short answer: Choose CMU. Honestly, getting out, being more social, going to parties, etc. is going to mean stepping a little outside of your immediate circle. As much as I\u2019ve gone out and had drinks and stuff with software professionals, your average CS student won\u2019t be doing keg stands anytime soon. CMU still has fraternities and sororities and there will be plenty of students out to have a good time, not to mention the fact that you\u2019re a half mile from University of Pittsburgh so you\u2019ve got that many more students out and about in the area. CMU is an extremely big name in CS. Even if your end goal is just graduate, get a job as a software developer at some company, and look for a good job, CMU will help a lot. It\u2019s as close as you can get to an automatic interview in this field. That may come with some extra work, but honestly, either you\u2019ve got a knack for the subject or not. If I\u2019d have taken my Washington courses at a one-off, no-name school, I still have to learn basically the same shit, and pass basically the same test. What you do get with CMU is a group of world class instructors, some of the best PhD candidates (who are also TAs/tutors) in the country, and an alumni network that can be extremely helpful. And you can still go party! That\u2019s kind of what I\u2019m driving at. Pick a school, any school. If you\u2019re good with the CS work, you\u2019ll have time to go have fun, and you\u2019ll be branching out from your major anyways to go and meet people. Even a super party school like Central Washington University would\u2019ve allowed me to lock myself away, completely geek out on CS stuff, and not be partying at all. Conversely, I got into all sorts of ridiculous shit with a buddy of mine in public policy because I took electives that exposed me to a variety of new potential friends. Like everything in college, you get out what you put in. Some places have slightly more an edge than others, but you have to capitalize on opportunities! ",

            "answer_text": "Getting admitted to CMU for computer science is pretty much winning the lottery. Not going would be throwing away a winning lottery ticket. The other schools need a strong application but are not nearly as impressive. I am actually not sure why CMU SCS, being so competitive, admitted you when you admit you are more of a party person. They reject lots of kids who devote their whole lives to studying to CS. So my guess is they must have seen something special in you. Maybe you don\u2019t see it in yourself yet. Or maybe they are wrong. In any case, this is a once in a lifetime opportunity. If you are serious about studying CS, you should go to CMU. If for some reason you get to CMU, and you find you hate your CS classes, then you can switch into another major. That is better than going to another school that might have a softer CS program than CMU\u2019s (pretty much any other CS program), because if CS is really what you\u2019re passionate about, and it\u2019s what you see yourself having a career in, then you owe it to yourself to dive deep. That\u2019s the quickest way to find out if it\u2019s what you want to do a career in. Most people don\u2019t get the opportunity to go to a CS program as rigorous as CMU\u2019s. For most people, they either have to go to graduate school or work in industry for a couple decades to learn how deep the rabbit hole goes in CS. And if you do switch out of the CS major at CMU (or just hang out with other majors), I am sure you will find plenty of social kids in the humanities and arts there. Remember that CMU is good for other subjects besides CS. But even in CS, I am sure you will find some social kids at CMU. They just might be more of the \u201cgeeky social\u201d kind, preferring board games, roleplaying and making robots as hobbies, to say going to bars or frat parties. Pittsburgh also has a big college scene because it has more than one university. CMU kids may party a bit less than Pitt kids, but you can ultimately find whatever social life you\u2019re looking for in that city. At least, you can find whatever you would find in Ann Arbor (Michigan), Madison (Wisconsin), or Lafayette (Purdue). In fact, Purdue is a great school, but from what I have seen, its city is more boring than Pittsburgh for social life. And not it\u2019s not quite in the same league as CMU for CS. Madison and Ann Arbor are big college towns I haven\u2019t visited, but I doubt that they have much if anything Pittsburgh doesn\u2019t. Neither even has a major airport, and Pittsburgh does. Obviously, all these places pale in social life compared to NYC and LA. If you really care about social life, you should have applied to Columbia or USC. Then again, if you\u2019re looking for that extra geeky social life that\u2019s very non-NYC, then CMU may actually be better for that because it\u2019s nerd HQ there. My point is that unless CMU is going to put you into massive debt, I can\u2019t really think of a reason to choose any of the other three schools over them, unless you want to be a humanitarian and help someone get off of CMU\u2019s waitlist. Worst case scenario, CMU made a mistake admitting you over the next guy on the waiting list, but that\u2019s their bad not yours. ",
