            "answer_text": "I started learning this stuff as a junior high schooler. My friend Kip Musatt was building robots, in junior high school and not assembling pre-designed kits either, his own designs, with Sinclair 1000 Z80 microprocessors. He\u2019s worked for Intel for decades now. Another couple of friends of mine were writing assembly language for a Commodore 64. I was writing assembly for my Apple IIc, Motorola 65C02 processor. Desire. Curiosity. Creativity. Grit. Make something cool. Show it off to your friends. When I was in high school they didn\u2019t even have any computer classes, but they had a computer room and we were there, chronically. Later I spent more time at home with my awesome computer.  Your friends play games. Pathetic. You could make games. Dig in. Learn stuff. Then you take the technical knowledge and be of service to people who will pay you well for it. Or even better figure out how to be of service to others with your knowledge and skills, without working for other people. Do me a favor though. Just don\u2019t take your extraordinary born talents, cultivate them, and then work for the military, helping people to murder other people. That\u2019s not being of service. ",
