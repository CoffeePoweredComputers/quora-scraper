            "answer_text": "What do you want to \u201ccopy\u201d? Do you like the way it works and want to copy the code, design or the content (images, videos, etc.)? You can\u2019t copy someone else\u2019s backend code unless you have access to it. If you are thinking of copying the code of a website that you have already created for one person/business and use it for another business, that should be ok. These can be considered themes or templates. If you are thinking of copying the visual design of a website that you have already created for one person/business and use it for another business, make sure both parties know and ok this. If you are thinking of copying the visual design of a website that you haven\u2019t created, then that can be ok as well because the end product generally looks different when finished, thanks to the different images, messages, textual content, etc. If you are thinking of copying the images, textual content, etc. from one website and use it for a different website, then don\u2019t. That is not legal. ",
