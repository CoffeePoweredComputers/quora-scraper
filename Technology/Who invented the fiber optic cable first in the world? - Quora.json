            "answer_text": "I got to start working in 1982 on the world's first long haul single mode system, MCI's MAFOS (Mid-Atlantic Fiber Optic System) between Washington DC and New York City. No one really knew a thing about splicing this stuff back then and a bunch of us were going to figure it all out. The equipment and techniques were truly primitive. It was hugely difficult. We had two cable vendors: NT (Northern Telecom, pre-Nortel) and Siecor (pieces of Siemens and Corning). The NT cable and its fiber were terrible and terrible to work with. The Siecor cables and their were a polar-opposite to the NT stuff, and quickly became the standard of high quality network cable, and our favorite. A couple of years later we used a bunch of AT&T fiber cable (part of some corporate settlement), and it was way better than the NT cable, but still a far sight from the Siecor cables. So, I can't say for sure whose was first, but Siecor was easily made the first good fiber and good fiber cable. They also made the best fiber fusion splicer, too. ",

            "answer_text": "Approximately ten years later in the mid-1850\u2019s Irish inventor John Tyndall performed a similar demonstration using water fountains. These early experiments led to the development of television when Scottish inventor John Logie Baird demonstrated the transmission of moving images at the London Institute in 1925. In 1952, UK based physicist Narinder Singh Kapany invented the first actual fiber optic cable based on John Tyndall\u2019s experiments three decades earlier. Thirteen years later in 1965 two British research scientists, Charles Kao and George Hockman working with Standard Telephones and Cables discovered that attenuation of fiber optics was caused by impurities in manufacturing. If the attenuation could be lowered sufficiently, they theorized fiber optics could be used as a practical means of communication. The attenuation barrier was broken in 1970 by four research scientists working for Corning Glass Works (now Corning Inc.), Robert Maurer, Donald Keck, Peter Schultz, and Frank Zimar. ",
