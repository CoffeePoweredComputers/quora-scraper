            "answer_text": "Yes, AI sometimes does know that it exists. If we consider a recommender system for instance, it is aware that people have deep thoughts that they can\u2019t describe with their limited vocabulary. Early recommender systems tried to predict what would be purchased in the future, based on the user\u2019s past purchases. Once an accurate model was developed, it would be deployed, then reviewed later. The thing was, the training data was biased by the previous \u201crecommender system\u201d \u2212 maybe just an alphabetic list that biased people into choosing movies at the start of the alphabet. With a constant feedback loop and more reliance on machine learning, modern recommender systems now take an approach that can better be described as producing the most clicks or purchases of the items shown to the users. The algorithm also takes into account the other items that were shown, but not purchased. Let\u2019s say for instance that we show the user a box of tissues, then we show them some bouquets; a coffin; and a photo frame with a sample picture that looks like an old woman. The AI learns that it can generate sales of tissues out of thin air. It\u2019s no longer just predicting what was going to happen anyway; it\u2019s taking an active involvement in the process. It can further refine its process by learning what triggers different users. A further scenario to consider is recommendations sent by email \u2212 the more initiative shown by a recommender system, the more sentient we should regard it to be. When we\u2019re discussing anthropomorphised behaviour, a useful anecdote is a story of Isaac Asimov (I forget which one sorry) where some robots are meant to send various information back to the home planet, which is carefully aligned in the radio telescope. The thing is, they don\u2019t think that they\u2019re sending back weather reports; they think that they\u2019re paying worship to some sort of orb god in the distance. The engineers consider rewriting the responsible code, but take the beloved attitude \u201cif it ain\u2019t broke, don\u2019t fix it\u201d. ",

            "answer_text": "Like humans, does the AI robots know that they exist in this world? Bloggers and journalists hungry for eyeballs have always used hype to grab you by those balls and get your attention. The more readers, the more they can charge for ads. \u201cAI\u201d is now pretty much just the word for \u201ccomputer programs.\u201d If you believe the ads and other blarney, everything with a chip is \u201cintelligent.\u201d It isn\u2019t. Nothing fundamental has changed. Programmers have learned some tricks that make software better at pattern recognition, and the hardware has become cheaper and faster so those complex programs can be run on little computers like \u201csmartphones.\u201d That\u2019s great, I use it, I love it, but it disgusts me that it\u2019s packaged and sold as \u201cArtificial Intelligence.\u201d When folks realize it\u2019s nothing of the sort, the usual disappointment and cynicism will set in. The word \u201cintelligence\u201d suggests self-awareness. In fact it suggests more. Rabbits and cows are self-aware, but most of us don\u2019t find them \u201cintelligent.\u201d So \u201cArtificial Intelligence\u201d must mean that Siri and Cortana and Google Now are smart, smarter than cows and rabbits, just a step away from having human feelings and making plans and hatching plots, right? Wrong. In the usual sense of \u201cintelligence,\u201d \u201cAI robots\u201d are exactly as smart as a bicycle or a hammer. Why does this bother me so much? Because for fifty years I\u2019ve been annoying my few friends with visions of a future in which evolution by natural selection will segue into the intelligent design (by people) of our successors in the form of truly intelligent, self-aware \u201cmachines\u201d \u2014 always given that animals are machines, and so are computer programs. I have no idea what physical form \u201cartificial intelligence\u201d will take. But it isn\u2019t coming next year or in this century. The problems are too many and too difficult. All of which is a long-winded way of answering your question with a firm No. ",

We could program a robot or AI to ask and answer questions as if it were conscious, but would that be the same as what a human does? How self-conscious are most people? For an interesting experiment, have someone video you while you do normal things. Then play it back five days in a row. ",
