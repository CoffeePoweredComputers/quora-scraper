            "answer_text": "That is not yet completely clear. The 5G modem and other parts are right now significantly more expensive than the LTE parts, but these are early days and production is low. As well, this will depend on what other parts the device is packaged with. Does it have new and better processor? or camera? or display? These are expensive parts as well. An example is the new range of Galaxy S20 phones from Samsung. They are listed at about 32% more than the items they replaced, but they also added a wide range of features including a breakthrough camera sensor, a new processor and better screen, etc. And of course, it is a brand new item still in limited production. All of that said, we will likely see 5G phones at a relatively wide range of price points as the market needs that to serve on the networks. So, the items will appear across the value range and more will come as the market and production rises. 5G phones won\u2019t be the cheapest soon, but there will be affordable models. ",
