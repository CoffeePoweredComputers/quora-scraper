            "answer_text": "A2A Technology is not my area of knowledge, however IMO the question is too simplistic and therefore largely subjective without any defined boundaries. Technology is the application of scientific knowledge for practical purposes, especially in industry. It is not limited to IT or software. It goes from logistics to manufacturing to military equipment. Nor is it innovation per se. One can invent many things but if it not widely applied in either industry or bought by consumers it is a failure. Historically in during the 1900\u2019s Japan has been very successful in developing high quality products in primarily two areas - consumer electronics (music, TV, cameras) and automobiles. Over time they have became market leaders in foreign markets. Interestingly, take the case of automobiles. Where US manufacturers were dominant until the 70\u2019s and had been very innovative. Yet Japanese manufactures (who did not focus on innovation) came to dominate domestic firms, because they focused on reliability. If not for US government intervention to stop the flow of Japanese made cars in later part of 1900\u2019s, domestic US car manufacturing would have been dead a long time ago. Domestically in China, Japanese branded cars have a better reputation compared to domestic Chinese brands. It will be up to Chinese car producers to up their game, if they wish to compete. In this context Japan built a reputation on quality for certain consumer products. As the world\u2019s factory \u2026\u2026 the numbers tell us that China is the world\u2019s largest exporter of technologically categorized products. It produces these products under domestic and foreign brands. China is NOT at the same place Japan is regarding exporting domestic products or creating international consumer brands. China has produced some top quality software for example in social media, that US social media would like to copy. However since it exists only in China, there is no exposure of the software outside China, therefore foreign consumers lack knowledge of certain things. In summary \u2026\u2026. Japan has developed a much better brand reputation in offering quality products that have a technology component. ",

            "answer_text": "If you are talking about product quality, it is clearly Japan. China can put together parts to produce cheaper smartphone or motorbike, but doesn\u2019t yet have underlying technology for cpu or engine. But as Stalin is (mis) quoted as saying, \u201cQuantity has a quality all its own\u201d. China doesn\u2019t really need to have technological edge equal to Japan or USA or Germany. They just need like 40~70% of technological capability to have edge against USA or Japan. However, issue with China is that, it never could handle its size in longer term. But that is historical question. It is not the same level of question as, say, whether there will be Apple Inc in 22 century. ",
