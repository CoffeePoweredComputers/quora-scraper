            "answer_text": " The Samsung Galaxy S20 is the best smartphone available right now. That covers both the S20 and the larger Galaxy S20 Plus, as there's very little difference between the two handsets aside from size and a couple of specs. They take the very best of what's on the smartphone market and put it together in a compelling package that we loved testing. Screen: Both these devices have phone screens that are a cut above the rest, and each is capable of a 120Hz refresh rate that will allow for far smoother scrolling and gameplay on your phone's screen. Battery life: The battery life on the Galaxy S20 and Galaxy S20 Plus isn't the best we've ever seen on a smartphone, but larger batteries than the S10 series allow these devices to last longer and it'll be enough for your day. Both devices come with wireless charging, and there's also a Reverse Power Share feature that allows you to top up your friend's phone too. Advertisement Camera: Samsung has improved the camera suite on the Galaxy S20 devices compared to the Galaxy S10. It may not look far better on paper, but larger pixels and improved software adds to the flagship experience. Mini verdict: The S20 and S20 Plus are packed full of the best Samsung has to offer, and it comes together to give you the best smartphone experience around right now. If we had to pick one, we'd go for the bigger screen, larger battery slightly improved rear camera of the Galaxy S20 Plus, but both phones deserve their best phone crown.

            "answer_text": "Apple iPhone 11This is probably the best smartphone in the market today with its 6.1-inch screen, dual-lens camera, and sleek and stylish design. It is powered by the A13 Bionic chipset which promises fast processing power with 4G RAM to support it too. The internal storage ranges from 64GB to 256GB which means that you will have more storage to play with. It has a decent battery life as well for its size which will last you a full day and then some with a single charge. This is a good option if your budget doesn\u2019t allow you to get the tri-lens camera from the 11 Pro. Image Source: Apple.com OnePlus 8 ProThe 8 Pro from OnePlus is another smartphone that ranks high on the list because of its superior specs in all Android devices today. One of its main features is its 120Hz, QHD+, HDR10+ screen which stands out. OnePlus has equipped it with top of the line hardware such as next-gen 5G connectivity and features like IP68 dust and waterproofing as well as wireless charging. What I like about OnePlus phones is that they are beautifully designed and easy to handle too. It has a superb battery life as well which is saying something for a mobile phone that has flagship specs. Image Source: Oneplus.com Samsung Galaxy S20 UltraSamsung has definitely put a lot of effort into creating the S20 Ultra thus making it one of the best smartphones that you will find today. What\u2019s impressive about this device is that it is equipped with 6.9 inches AMOLED screen and is the only phone that offers 100x digital zoom. It is a bit pricey but for a reason because this powerful device comes with an equally stunning battery which is at 5,000mAh. The only downside that I can think of here is that you will be spending a LOT, but it is going to be worth it considering the specs that it has. Image Source: Samsung.com Google Pixel 4Google smartphones may be a long way to competing with top-tier smartphones like the iPhone 11 and S20 Ultra by Samsung, but they do stand out because of their cameras. In Pixel 4, Google has introduced a second lens which means you will be able to take great shots even during the night. It comes with Face Unlock as well as Motion Sense which, although may pale in comparison to others, are still useful features to have since it makes your phone react using gestures. Image Source: Notebookcheck.net iPhone SE (2020)What makes this device stand out is the fact that it is Apple\u2019s entry to the mid-range tier which is a blessing for those who want to purchase an iPhone but don\u2019t want to spend a lot on one. Although it\u2019s compact size may leave you wanting more display surface to work with, this handy gadget is powered by the latest iOS 13 and a powerful processor which is the A13 Bionic. This means that its rapid hardware makes it easier to conduct tasks with this handheld device with 256GB internal storage at your disposal. Image Source: CSMobiles.com ",
