            "answer_text": "There are a lot of new Samsung phones. Assuming you're talking about the Galaxy Fold, yes, it's foldable. Basically the display is foldable, which means it's plastic and not glass, and that makes it kinda less durable. But the concept can't be implemented with glass, so it's not a con. As intelligent a company as Samsung is they've made a phone that Folds inwards, whereas, its Huawei counterpart folds inwards and has the same plastic screen which makes it prone to damage. The Galaxy Fold\u2019s form factor is better than that of Huawei Mate X, but we've recently seen the Motorola Razr, which is another foldable phone which has an even better form factor than the Galaxy Fold does, but it's smaller and a worse performer than the Galaxy Fold. Now, would I recommend any foldable phone over some other phone for that price? Well, not yet. These phones are very expensive and lack the feasibility and durability of a glass display, they lack performance wise and are also kinda fragile. There is a foldable phone that I'm kinda interested in though. It's the Samsung Galaxy Fold 2, which would be launched next year. It's gonna have a form factor like that of the Motorola Razr and Samsung\u2019s specs and quality. ",

            "answer_text": "Its obvious that you fancy Galaxy fold. Its okay, but trust me you will feel bad once they roll out the upgraded version sooner or later, because Galaxy fold in its current stage is a marketting bait, just to capture market sentiment and get real world test results. Look for yourself:  The crease is easily visible, which they gracefully hide in the advertisements. So to answer your question, yes Galaxy fold folds but leaves a crease which is hard to ignore once you hold that phone in your hand. Better wait for the next version which will look even better with more appealing feel to it. ",
