            "answer_text": "Marques Brownlee (MKBHD! One of the most popular tech YouTuber) had only 78 subscribers after posting 100 videos. Today he has over 5M subscribers on YouTube. Some might get success in few month for some, it may take years. Just never give up. You can break this guide up into 3 segments, 0-1,000 subscribers, 1,000-10,000, and 10,000+ subscribers a selfsustainable stage.  One thing that should be noted, is that luck IS a factor on Youtube, no matter what anyone says. For fast growth you need good original content which is widely appealing, however for the fastest growth you also need luck. Here you can read How to Make A Successful YouTube Channel 0 \u2013 1,000 Subscribers YouTube algorithms tend to result in a snowball effect for most channels; as soon as they see your videos are getting some attention, they will show them more often in their search results and similar videos, resulting in even more views and so on. That being said, the first thousand subscribers are most likely not going to be organic and you will need to seek out people in a similar way to what you would do for any blog or website. Search videos that your target audience are watching, and comment on those videos but don\u2019t spam. In addition, seek out communities on sites such as Reddit and Facebook, and start participating. Once again don\u2019t spam, aim on providing value. In addition to getting people to check out your content where you think it could provide extra value, you will learn more about your target audience.While doing all of this, make at least 1 video that you think is sure to trigger people once they find your channel. The reason for this is you need a convincing video as your featured video in order to trigger people to subscribe. 1,000 \u2013 10,000 Subscribers Now you\u2019ve attained a solid base of subscribers and videos, it\u2019s time to explore the options that become available because of it. The first interesting approach is to collaborate with other YouTubers. While having less than 1,000 subscribers might not give bigger YouTubers incentive to work with you, now that you have a decent audience people see the value in working together with you. Seek out YouTubers with a similar target audience and with a subscriber base of around 1k to 10k and connect with them, asking if they would want to collaborate some time. Now you might think the only way to reach the audience of your partner is by having a video on his or her channel, but having a video on your channel often results in them mentioning it and redirecting viewers, which results in more people checking out your channel. Another form of collaboration is featuring similar channels in the featured channel tab. This is nice as it will always pop up whenever someone views that particular channel, and it doesn\u2019t require a big time investment.Secondly, now you have more views coming in and more videos lined up, it\u2019s important to create a good environment for those who watch videos. That\u2019s where playlists come into play as they will get your audience to watch more videos similar the ones they are watching and help you maintain a structured channel that is easy to navigate. The earlier you start using playlists, the better. 10,000+ Subscribers Once you get to 10,000 subscribers you will maintain a steady subscriber growth on a daily basis as you continue to put out regular content like you\u2019ve been doing. At this point, you have a pretty good idea about your target audience and the optimal process of your channel. There\u2019s a lot of steps you can still take to stimulate the growth and quality even more, but here are some steps that are specific to channels that are in the 10,000 \u2013 30,000 range (I\u2019m assuming you don\u2019t need help once you get to 30k+). Apart from creating a community on social platforms such as Facebook and Twitter which I won\u2019t go into for the sake of staying on track, it\u2019s important to have a structured continuous improvement process. The good thing of having a significant amount of subscribers and views on a daily basis is that you will have a solid foundation for the extensive analytic platform which YouTube offers. What I usually do is go over statistics and optimize videos in which ever way possible. This can be improvements in terms publishing days or times, choosing popular subjects, different annotations, playlists and so on. The statistics YouTube provide are very detailed and useful for any sort of analysis. Here you can read more detailed (4k+ words) post on How To Get Subscribers On YouTube ",

            "answer_text": "In 2017, I committed to doing more video. Our Growth Everywhere channel has been getting bigger. We\u2019ve started doing these Facebook Lives on a daily basis, so that\u2019s basically one video every single day to Facebook and YouTube as well. We have one new episode of Marketing School going live every single day to the YouTube channel and then also one Growth Everywhere episode. Things are starting to pile up. We\u2019re getting more views all of a sudden and our subscriber base is growing. We\u2019re adding 20-25 subscribers every day. And that\u2019s just the beginning, because a lot of stuff that we\u2019re publishing is being auto-published and we\u2019re not optimized for TADs or for titles either. We can do a better job. Here are my top 5 tips for growing your Youtube channel: 1. Think in terms of playlists. You should be doing playlists every week because playlists can increase watch time and watch time is one of the primary metrics for growing your YouTube subscriber list. More watch time means they\u2019re going to be serving more ads in general, which means they make more money. 2. Make sure that you have the right tagging in place. You can use a tool like TubeBuddy to make sure that you have the right tags, and you can see how you\u2019re ranking for each tag (these are the things that people are searching for). If you want to rank for content marketing, for example, that might be one of the tags you use and it\u2019s going to show you how well you\u2019re doing. 3. Pay attention to is the thumbnail. You can use a tool like Canva to make sure that you have a good thumbnail because people click on good thumbnails (this is true for Facebook and YouTube). 4. Titles are really, really important. If you don\u2019t know how to write good titles, just Google Copyblogger\u2019s How to Write Magnetic Headlines post. Getting a good number of clicks has everything to do with your thumbnail and your title. If you can\u2019t entice people to actually click, you\u2019re not doing your job as a marketer or a creator. 5. Be consistent. I mentioned the fact that we\u2019re doing one new video almost every single day and one new podcast episode every day plus one longer interview podcast every week. We\u2019re aiming for this kind of obsessive consistency because we know it will pay off\u2014more and more people are going to talk about what we\u2019re doing. What I really like looking at, especially when you\u2019re first starting out, are the people who are Tweeting at you or emailing you to say how helpful your content is. As long as people are saying that your content is really good and it\u2019s helped them a lot, just keep going. Stay consistent. After the first year of Growth Everywhere I was only getting nine downloads per day. After the second year, I was getting maybe 50 downloads per day. After the third year, it went as high as 15,000 downloads in one day. It just takes a lot of time to get this machine going, but it\u2019s absolutely worth it. When I watched the Patriots come back to win when they were down 28 to 3, I kept thinking that this type of comeback is only possible with consistency. You\u2019ve got to stay persistent to make it happen. ",

            "answer_text": "Now a lot of people, when they start their YouTube channel, they find it to be difficult to get started. And why is it so hard? For one reason: YouTube doesn\u2019t appreciate new YouTube channels. Basically, YouTube doesn\u2019t rank your channel until you have about a thousand subscribers. Now as you continue creating videos, you\u2019re going to find that typically channels follow what\u2019s called an S-curve. It starts out very, very slow, and then before you know it, it starts to kick up quickly. This is usually because one of your videos starts to go viral and then that feeds more views to the rest of your channel. So it\u2019s almost like this exponential curve. Then finally, it starts to taper off a little bit, once you hit the peak of your market. Of course, depending on how big your market is, and your audience is, that could keep going up into the millions. Now remember when my first video when viral on my Sexy Confidence channel, that\u2019s basically what kick-started my channel, and that\u2019s what\u2019s gotten me to the 37 million or so views I have on that channel. So here\u2019s how to get to that first hundred subscribers. #1: Create a channel theme that would attract at least 100 subscribers #2: Create a release schedule and talk about it in your weekly YouTube videos #3: Specifically ask your viewers to subscribe and be part of the \u201cFounders Club\u201d #4 Monitor your YouTube analytics to see which videos will get you your first 100 subscribers #5: Make sure you add a YouTube Auto Subscribe Link in the description of your video If you\u2019re ready to start building a new YouTube channel and get your first 100 subscribers, then the most important thing you need to do is produce content that people would WANT to subscribe to. Create the content and follow these fives steps, and before you know it, you could have tens of thousands of subscribers following you and your videos. ",

            "answer_text": "It\u2019s frustrating. When people don\u2019t know how to grow their subscriber base in Youtube, they feel stuck, all the random things they could try to fix their problem seem endless, and they feel alone and overwhelmed\u2026 It\u2019s normal, it is human, and we all have to start small before we grow. So, here are 5 Great Tactics to Grow Your Youtube Channel in 2020+: 1. You have to snap people\u2019s attention as soon as they click to view your video.  When people are on Youtube, they are skimming the channels, just like when you are at home, watching TV, and frenetically changing channels, giving each just 3 seconds to convince you to stay. Some people call this a \u201cpattern interrupt,\u201d I call this: the most important part \u2014 You have to snap people out of the haze of going from video to video, and to snap their attention so they give you a chance. One of the best ways I have found to do this is to clap loudly as soon as your video begins. That\u2019s one of the best ways to wake people up and get their attention. 2. Ask people to subscribe in the first 30 seconds and last 30 seconds of your Youtube video.  In communication, people mostly remember the beginning and end of any video. What is in the middle will be a hazy memory within minutes. So you have to open strong, and end strong. And how to open strong and end strong if your goal is to increase your subscriber base? Simple: Ask them in a positive, value-adding way to subscribe now at the beginning, and remind them \u201cDon\u2019t forget to subscribe now\u201d at the end. Because people are less likely to do what you want if they don\u2019t know you want it. So make it clear, ask them to subscribe twice. 3. Tag Influencers.  When you begin your Youtube journey (or even if it had been going on for a while, but your channel is still small), your best option is to get the attention of an influencer, so they notice your videos, and recommend your channel. And one of the best ways to do this is to tag them on your very best videos, your very best content. When you tag them there, they get notified in a way that stands out: You\u2019re not one of the 1000s of the messages they receive, you are another fellow content creator tagging them to get their opinion and participation in your topic or video content. It may not work every time, but when it works, you\u2019ll see a huge influx of subscribers that will put a smile on your face. 4. Humanize yourself.  Youtube is a community. It\u2019s not a library. If people just want dry knowledge, they\u2019d open a scientific book or university textbook. But people on Youtube want to listen to the opinions, hear the perspectives, and see the content of other fellow human beings (It\u2019s somewhat what I specialize in, at StoryBonding). So, you have to be a human first, and a source for content and entertainment second. A few quick wins to get you started, is to make sure you do at least one small thing every video to come across as a real person: You can show your dog, play with your cat, talk about your kids, share a hobby you\u2019re passionate about, talk about your favorite music, or your devastation because your favorite team lost last week or your beloved celebrity broke up with the love of her life\u2026 There are many ways to do this, but thats\u2019 a simple way. Don\u2019t neglect this, because people Subscribe first and foremost because they like you and trust you. And people can\u2019t like a moving image on a video screen, you have to be a person. 5. Create videos on topics that are already popular. When you\u2019re starting, you don\u2019t know what videos people want to want. You don\u2019t know what topics they are interested in. So, you often will make videos on what you like. That can work in some cases, but often enough, it doesn\u2019t. Why? Because people are interested in what THEY want, not what is interesting to YOU. You are there to serve. There is an exception to this, a big one. But if your goal is to get a lot of subscribers, then you can safely ignore that exception and focus on what people want. Step 1 \u2014 Choose a topic you want to write a video about.Step 2\u2014 Search Youtube to see whether videos on the same topic get a lot of views.Step 3 \u2014 If there are videos with a lot of view on that topic, then you continue and create the video. If not, go back to Step 1. That\u2019s it. Simple and clear. Because sadly the biggest thing that causes people to feel overwhelmed and to not do what is needed is the lack of clarity: too many contradictory views, too much information, plans with a thousand and one steps. Use this plan. It\u2019s effective. It works. Do it. And when you\u2019re done, do it again. Then do it some more. Then, you will see the subscriber growth you\u2019re looking for. \u2014 Did You Like This Answer? Click Here To Find Even Better Content In My Quora Profile. ",

            "answer_text": "From first click to last, I\u2019m going to look at a complete YouTube subscriber strategy that uses our services to push you higher. Make no mistake, you still have to put in some work and create great content, but putting us to work for you will also truly help you reach your YouTube marketing goals faster. Let\u2019s not waste any more time, let\u2019s get your YouTube channel growing so you can be famous already!  UPLOAD YOUR FIRST VIDEOS AND ESTABLISH A BASE OF CONTENT We can\u2019t do anything until you upload your first videos. Yes, I know that\u2019s the hard part! Your content has to be up, and it has to be good, before anything can happen. Try a few videos out. See what type of content works for you. Most importantly, choose a genre, or topic, or style of video that you can keep uploading, often, for a very long time. Here are two early videos from two of YouTube\u2019s most famous users: Philip DeFranco (sXePhil back then) and Jenna Marbles:   Were either of those videos perfectly polished? Nope. Did they spend hours deliberating on every aspect of them? Nope. Did they have high production values like their current videos? Nooooooooooope. The key lesson here is that they knew what they were good at, and they got the content out there to see what people responded to. The Philip DeFranco show is now entering its 10th year, with Phil still doing his \u2018talking to the camera\u2019 bit, and Jenna is still being funny in her way. HAVE A GREAT VIDEO OUTRO This is a more advanced tactic, and I debated putting it closer to the bottom of this list, but it can\u2019t wait. Having a great video outro is one of the biggest things you can do to get views, and drive for more subscribers. Every good video outro has these three aspects: \u2981\tA call to action to subscribe with a YouTube Annotation popping up which allows people to subscribe with one click right there while your video is still playing. \u2981\tAt least one more video of yours to click on so that people can watch more of your content before they click away. The more content of yours they watch, the better the chance they\u2019ll subscribe. \u2981\tLinks, or URLS, or usernames for you on social media. Don\u2019t write off social media as your friends and followers there are subscribed to you via that channel. To see this all happening at once, here\u2019s a great example from one of my favorite (or should I write it \u2018favorite\u2019 for these Canucks) YouTube channels, Epic Meal Time:  To break down what you\u2019re seeing here: \u2981\tUpper left corner: A link to last week\u2019s episode of Epic Meal Time. \u2981\tBottom left corner: A link to a video of their other major cooking show, Handle It. \u2981\tUpper right corner: Links to subscribe to Epic Meal Time and Handle it, as well as their Original Gamer and Harley Blog\u2019s channels. \u2981\tBottom right corner: Links out to their online store for all things Epic Meal. All they\u2019re missing is their social media channels. If you watch the video though you\u2019ll see that they include those a bit earlier on. Considering how busy this screen is, I don\u2019t blame them. PURCHASE VIEWS FOR YOUR CONTENT Ok, you did the hardest part which was to create some content. Now that content needs to look good to all the new people who will be finding your videos. The quickest way to do that is buy views. My suggestion is to buy views from Boost Socials  Why is this important? Because of social proof. You can read a lot more about social proof in this lengthy article of ours, but I\u2019ll sum it up for you quickly: Social proof is a psychological concept which looks at how people react to large crowds. When someone sees a large crowd doing something they are more prone to think that what the crowd is doing is the correct way to behave in the situation. On YouTube, that large crowd is represented by the number of views the video has. Take this YouTube search as an example:  Now, you\u2019re a busy person. Which funny cat video are you more likely to watch with your limited cat video watching time? The one with 100,000,000 views, or the one with 100,000 views? Social proof has shown time and again that the video with many more views is going to be clicked on more often. When you\u2019re a new channel, with very few views, you struggle for longer, perhaps for years, until your social proof catches up with your talent. Buying views is your way to fast track your success. PUSH YOUR YOUTUBE SUBSCRIBERS STRATEGY INTO HIGH GEAR Don\u2019t wait long on doing this step after the one above. Now that people are seeing a few individual videos as worth their time, they\u2019re going to start seeing you as worth their time. And when they see you as worth their time they start thinking about becoming your subscriber. This is right when you need to already have a solid number of subscribers. Boost Socials YouTube Subscribers Tool is just what you need. Social proof applies just as readily to subscribers as it does to views, and you need to get a little bit ahead of the game or you\u2019ll always be getting subscribers below your talent level.  Which of these two channels is going to get your click? The one with 148,000 subscribers, or the one with 141? We both know the answer to that, and this is why you need to boost your subscriber numbers now. Using social media as part of your YouTube subscriber strategy Yes, we all know about social media and how it can spread pretty much anything. Your YouTube videos will, or course, be shared on social media often. First by you, then by your fans. But since we already took the steps above to push your views and subscribers higher, why not use that social proof on social media? Here are some examples pulled from Twitter:   All of these channels have had varying degrees of success with their YouTube subscriber strategy, but they have all realized one thing: Talking about how their videos or channel is successful helps build their social proof. Their followers know they\u2019re gaining popularity thanks to these tweets, and these followers will pay more attention to these channels now. While we\u2019re on the subject of social media, be sure to use good calls to action here. Pushing people to subscribe to you by simply telling them \u2018Please subscribe to my channel\u2019, especially while sending out a message about your success, will push more people to finally click subscribe. Calls to action need to be a big part of your YouTube subscriber strategy! USING SOCIAL PROOF ON YOUR YOUTUBE CHANNEL Just as you\u2019re going to use your newfound social proof on social media, you\u2019re going to use it on your YouTube channel as well. This will be in the form of \u2018thank you\u2019 videos which you create for your subscribers. They can range from simple videos like Markiplier, or complex best of/throwback type content like Rhett and Link:   Either way, this is straight-up a social proof video that\u2019s easy for your fans to share. Who doesn\u2019t like to share a video which is, essentially, saying \u2018look at this popular thing I\u2019m part of! Don\u2019t you want to be part of it too?\u2019 Understanding this point, and using it over and over again as so many successful YouTubers have before you, is the last YouTube subscriber strategy you need to know about. YouTube is not the type of platform which has one goal that you reach and then relax. It is constant, it never stops, as you always need more subscribers. Now get ready to create many videos thanking your fans, because you\u2019re well on your way to being famous on YouTube if you keep following these tips! ",

            "answer_text": "Gaining more subscribers can seem like a difficult task, but I\u2019ll share 10 tips to help you get your first 1000 subscribers. 1. Post Useful Content Consistently This is one of the most difficult things to do as a content creator. If you take a look around YouTube you might think that every video under the sun has been created and that is most likely right, but you can put your own spin on a popular topic. For example, there are many \u201cunboxing\u201d tech videos\u2026what if you created a \u201creboxing\u201d and talk about the various components of tech while you put it back in the box? The key here is creativity and that will certainly boost subscriptions. 2. Title of Your Videos Strategically One of the most difficult things is to name your video. You have the name in your head, but it may be something complex or too long. My rule is to keep it basic and use the YouTube autocomplete to name the video. There is nothing wrong with your video having the same name or something close to a popular video, as long as it\u2019s relevant. 3. Spruce Up Your Channel Design Most visitors first impression of you is from your channel and your design. This is where visitors interact and get to know what you are about. Create a engaging header and indicate your brand. On my channel, we were intentional about our design making it fit into our overall branding strategy. The key takeaway is to design with purpose. 4. Show Your Lighter Side Lighten up and laugh at yourself. Bloopers make you more human and show something different than an ordinary talking head video. Also, switch up the video and catch your viewers off guard so they don\u2019t know what to expect. 5. Achieve Real Views and Subscribers You can get a lot of views and subcribers this way , they\u2019re real subscribers but they won\u2019t always be worthwhile views . If you\u2019re going to purchase views , make sure you\u2019re actually getting real views , and that the views actually lasts . YouTube will filter out fraudulent views, subscribers and drop them , decreasing your watch time by however long the view was , and can even penalize your channel if they think you\u2019re buying bad views . I think you need help from THIS ONE. It provides a large amount of views and real active, non-drop subscribers for your channels I have used it, the result is very amazing. So, it\u2019s always my first choice to recommend to everyone. 6. Create A Custom Thumbnail I have seen my subscriptions and views increase by adding this step. I use impact font that is seen on many internet photos to grab attention and I format the photo using Adobe Photoshop. I usually title the photo thumbnail differently than the video because when people are scrolling through other videos to view, they can easily tell what my video is about. 7. Use Annotations Annotations are those annoying things that pop up during videos, but they can be a content creator\u2019s dream. I add annotations to every video and make it easy by creating a link for them to subscribe. This is extra work, but once you see your subscription rate increase you will continue to add them to every video. 8. Invite Subscribers This is really basic. At the end of every video ask viewers to \u201clike\u201d and subscribe to your channel. You should also tell them why they should subscribe, for example if you are a DIY Home Improvement channel I would say, \u201csubscribe for my DIY projects, tricks and insider tips delivered to you weekly.\u201d Remember, be careful what you ask for, because you might get it. 9. Be Yourself You are the best you\u2014you can be. Being on camera was difficult for me at first because I compared myself to others who are natural on camera talent then I realized, \u201cI just have to be me.\u201d Let your personality shine in your videos and I guarantee someone will connect with you. 10. Create An Engaging Channel Trailer With the new channel design, YouTube gives content creators a great opportunity to create a trailer to share what your content is about. Have you ever watched a movie without viewing a trailer? Not me, because you want to see what it is about. Keep your trailer under 90 seconds and show scenes from your other videos and provide a strong call to action of why a viewer should become a subscriber. ",

I\u2019m a web developer by trade and over the past year I have chosen to broaden my marketing to include video. I made a few videos early on, they were horrible. I left them up only so I can view them as a reminder and motivation to create better videos. I\u2019m slowly getting better at creating videos and have been trying to reverse engineer to algorithm. That\u2019s the coder in me. How to Get Subscribers? After my research and analysis, my findings fall in line with what\u2019s already known to be YouTube\u2019s Best Practices. Create high quality contentFor high subscriber count, create content that appeals to the masses. Gaming is extremely popular. To bad I\u2019m not a gamer. My mother never let me play, she said it would rot my brain. Now I\u2019m showing her YouTube Channels like jacksepticeye who is doing extremely well. I laughingly tell her, look mom, I could\u2019ve been a pro YouTube Gamer making millions. Missed Opportunities.Consistently create videos so your viewers and YouTube starts to notice you.Do 3 types of content. Under 5 min for quick videos. I call these Vid Snacks. Then create Medium Length Videos around 10 - 15 minutes long. I call this a sensible meal. Then create your long form videos that are over 50 minutes. This is your thanksgiving dinner. Always make quality a priority.Make sure your Titles are on point. You want to use natural search phrases. Like \u201cHow To\u201d. You can also use Google Adwords to get good search phrases or just use the YouTube or Google Search bar and start typing away until you come up with a term that has a lot of searches.Make your descriptions at least 1,000 words or more. You get up to 5,000 words so you can make it like a blog post.Use tags. They aren\u2019t as vital but they are there so use them.Make your thumbnail as visually appealing as possible.Share your videos on all your social networks and groups. External Embeds are important.Build your email list. This way you can control who gets notified. Don\u2019t only depend on YouTube to notify people.Analyze your content and analytics to find what works and what doesn\u2019t. High watch time is the most important factor. Find ways to keep people on your video as long as possible.Leave high quality comments on other YouTubers videos. No spam. This is for exposure and learning from others.Do collaborations with other YouTubers.Reach out to everyone you know both on and offline to subscribe to your channel.Advertising on YouTube with Video Ads can be helpful.Finally, create your own website/blog to go along with your channel. This will give you another way to connect with people online. Plus, it\u2019ll help you in both YouTube Search and Google Search. My channel is relatively new, since I just started last year uploading videos and already, my videos are ranking on page one of Google and YouTube.  Page One Results on Google   Page One Results on YouTube   While my channel is still small, it is steadily growing. YouTube is like a marathon.

            "answer_text": "I like to think of this as a general two-step process Step 1: Make your channel great Before you focus on truly gaining a lot of subscribers, you have to make your channel one that people would want to subscribe to. This sounds simple, but is something that is often overlooked, as YouTubers rush to promote their channel before fully developing it. Think of it this way - If you advertise your channel on a large scale, but there are only a few videos, all of the people who find it will not have much to explore. Many will not be interested in the small amount of content there is, and will simply click off and forget about the channel. Your goal should be to get to the point where, if someone were to find your channel, they would immediately subscribe because of the abundance of interesting content. Make your first priority the production of good videos, and save the marketing for the next step Step 2: Promotion Okay, now that you\u2019ve developed your channel into something interesting, you have to bring people to it. To do this, simply think of the most common ways that people discover new videos or channels. Recommended videos/Search results - This is not really in your control, unless you pay for advertisements to put your video at the top of search results. This is something that will come after you get a lot of views. Word-of-Mouth - Telling friends/family about your channel can help, but it will really only take you so far. Do not rely on this as a method of truly growing your channel on a large scale. Comment sections - This is often overlooked. Oftentimes if people see a funny or interesting comment in the comment section they will click on the channel who posted the comment (I have done this many times). To do this effectively, name your channel something relevant to the topic of videos you make, and comment on videos that are of the same topic. For example, if I make videos about investing, I can add \u201cInvestments\u201d or \u201cInvestor\u201d somewhere in my channel name. If I go comment on other videos related to investing, many of the viewers will see my channel name and possibly check it out (remember, if people are watching a video of the same topic, they are likely interested in that topic).

            "answer_text": "This is a question that all aspiring Youtubers ask themselves at some point. It can leave you frustrated knowing despite the long hours you put your channel is stagnant. The answer to the question is not as simple as you do this you get subscribers. As a YouTuber myself, I made plenty of blunders before I understood what works and what does not. Here I am sharing the tips that helped me build my channel from the 0 subscribers to my current position. 1. Select A Theme: YouTube Channels posting a variety of unrelated content, go into oblivion. A classic example of, Jack of all trades but a master of none.That\u2019s why, if you are new to YouTube \u2013 before doing anything, decide upon a theme. A niche which you are well aware of and comfortable with. Example: Engineering Classes, Movie Reviews, Sports Analysis, Vines, etc.2. Clear up the clutter If you already have a YouTube Channel and posted a few videos in it, this tip is for you. As you have narrow-downed your theme, it\u2019s crucial to remove old content which isn\u2019t related. Furthermore, remove poorly produced content or flop videos which should never have made it, in the first place. These videos make the audience lose trust in your brand. It is important to look consistent.3. Do your Back Ground Research I too, have been guilty of this mistake. Once I realised its importance, I used it to my advantage to understand m audience and what content works. Stalk your direct competitors and other popular channels, note down the topics they make videos about. Further, notice the reaction of their audience to it. This gives a wholesome idea about what topics generate interest; to make videos on. 4. Scripting You might think you can be Pewdipie and wing it on screen. But you shouldn\u2019t. A solid script guides you to organise your videos help you to uphold quality throughout your video. Include as many details as possible in your script: The main points that need to be deliveredThe exact words you need to use, in different situationsAll the actions you need to use, in different situationsVarious Images or Statistics that might be requiredVarious Call-of-Action (subscribe to the channel, click on the link, etc.)4. Ideal Mix of contents You may think every video you make will go viral and be a trendsetter. This may happen, but this is not a smart strategy if you want to grow your channel consistently.Use the 80-20 rule.It\u2019s wise to have 80% of your content Search Engine Optimised (SEO), (i.e.) Topical or Evergreen content. Basically, make content on what is trending and what the users are looking forFor the remaining 20%, you can make content \u2013 that you are genuinely passionate about, which no one else has thought about yet. Content which follows no patterns, just love.This will help you retain your identity and still grow your subscriber base. 5. Have a Hook Start like Sachin Tendulkar and Finish like Dhoni. 30% drop off in the first 30 seconds of the video and 50% in the first 30 seconds. You have a 30 sec time to catch the attention. Make a controversial statement, show an interesting part of the video or show the end product to hold the user. Start with Bang and end with a bigger bang. 6. Show personality Nobody wants a lecture or monotonous dialogue. Enough of that happens in school and college. You are not only selling your content also yourself. Be passionate and quirky and most importantly, natural. Take Bhuvan Bham, for example. He grew just because of his out of the box personality. Pattern interrupts are things that break the monotony and refresh the user. They could be a lame joke, funny background picture or filter. 7. Using the end screens: This is the number one tactic to help you keep the users in your channel and increase your session time. You might know many YouTubers who take 10 seconds before the end, to guide you to their next video; isn\u2019t it? This exactly is the End Screen. Whether you want to get YouTube Subscribers, point to your previous videos, promote your website or crowdfund a campaign; you can do it all here. 8. Tantalizing thumbnails Thumbnails are you first and best impression on the user. You need to stand out and attract the user. Use the colours Blue, Orange, Green and yellow as these work the best according to a study by Baklinko. 9. Intriguing Headline This has two benefits. It attracts users and also used to rank on Youtube. Your title must have your primary keyword and 1 or 2 power word and at least one emotional word. For example, let us say your headline is \u201c Best tips for the most effective Youtube strategy for young influencers\u201d. The keyword is Youtube strategy, and your power words are Best and effective, and the emotional word is young. 10. Using Contests and Going Live Going live helps you interact with your audience and adds to your accessibility. Contests will help you drive user engagement. These are some of the basic and most important mantras to remember. They will help in your consistent growth. Feel free to ask me any queries or tips you would like to know in the comments section.

            "answer_text": "I\u2019ve read a few of the answers for this question and they have a lot of good information on what you should do to get more subscribers, however, they are missing the point. By having a YouTube channel you are a digital performer and that means you need to do marketing. You need to think of yourself as a business. If this was a easy as just following a list of instructions then every business would easily become successful in the world but they don\u2019t. In fact most fail. They try to hack the system and copy everything and they just don\u2019t succeed. You need to ask yourself why you subscribe? Why do you click that shiny red button? Why do you want to know when a new video comes in? Why did you pick this specific person to be the one that you get information/entertainment from in that genre? This is what you need to be asking yourself. You need three things to succeed in marketing which will lead to more subscribers. Offer real valueTell the people that would be interested in that value(for YouTube) - People need to care about youThat is it. Simple to understand and difficult to execute. At the core of every success business this is what they are doing, even if it happened by accident. Offering real value may sound obvious and what you think you are doing, but are you really? Are you creating content that other people aren\u2019t doing? Other people may make gaming videos but do your ones feel different because of something that you do. Is your content worth the time the view spends on it or do you need to give more in less time? Point 2 is where you can start using all of those lists mentioned in the other posts because you need to get your content out there for your audience to find. The question you need to answer is who is your audience. Lots of people just create content and through it out there hoping it will stick. You need to take your quality and give it to people who want it. For instance if you are doing photography tutorials you need to find out where your audience is hanging out and that would be on all of the different websites they frequent. If you get your tutorial shared there then you will attract some of their audience while also giving them a great post. This is exactly what Peter McKinnon did and it jump started his channel. Point 3 is not always important in business. You can sell cheap stuff no one cares about and make a fortune. However, to succeed on YouTube you need to think like Apple. You need people to care about you. This is why immediately going to vlogging doesn\u2019t work because no one cares about you yet. I can get news from many YouTubers but I enjoy how Philip DeFranco does it so I\u2019m invested in his channel. You need people to want to spend time with you. This is the difference between a view and a subscriber. When someone subscribes they are saying that want to spend more time with you. I recommend re-watching your videos with friends and asking everyone if this person is someone people want to be friends with. They need to be honest because YouTube you isn\u2019t the same as normal you. There is no answer to question. The only solution is for you to think about these questions, answer them, and then act. I completely believe that if you are making quality videos that appeal to a group and you make sure that group knows about them then you will create subscribers. Create. Learn. Improve. Repeat. Good luck! ",

            "answer_text": "Getting more free YouTube subscribers is the best way to maximize your organic reach on the second-largest website in the world. #1: Clean Up Your YouTube Channel Before we get into the good stuff, it is important to do some housekeeping. While you may think everything your business does is flawless, you are not Beyonc\u00e9, so your audience might not think so... I know, I know, it\u2019s hard to swallow, but it\u2019s important to step away from your self and into the shoes of an outsider from time to time.Taking a hard look at your YouTube channel and re-evaluating what is on there will likely lead to the realization that a chunk of old content should be deleted\u2014whether it is outdated, poorly produced, or just a flop of a video that should have never made it up there in the first place. If you have something of this nature tied to your brand, it\u2019s going to immediately turn that lead off, and cause them to lose trust in your brand. Delete it and never look back! #2: Only Create and Post Highly Watchable Content Yes, I know this tip might seem obvious, but YouTube is full of clutter, so it\u2019s easy to feel like you can get away with posting sub-par content. Well, you can\u2019t! The only way to really stand out from the pack and grow your subscriber base it to create the best of the best content in your space. The key to accomplishing this is planning during pre-production. Here are a few ways you can do this better then your competition: Do Your Research Watch your competitors\u2019 videos, as well as videos in industries outside of yours, and jot down notes of the most intriguing parts. Rather then copying what your competition is doing, find a more creative way to do it better. For example, if I was in the gum business (or any other business for that matter) I\u2019d probably take a tip or two from my all time favorite YouTube commercial, The Story of Sarah and Juan. Check it out, and just try and tell me this didn\u2019t make you cry. #3: Execute Top-Notch Channel Trailers YouTube has this beautiful feature for marketers looking to grow their subscription base, called channel trailers. These are just as they sound, short trailers that automatically play when a visitor arrives on your YouTube channel page. This is the perfect opportunity to build your subscription base, if, and only if, you create insanely compelling content. These trailers need to be short (30-60 seconds), compelling, and most importantly they need to give your visitors a reason to stay. Do they need to be hilarious, beautiful, and emotionally charged? It will definitely help! What I really can\u2019t stress enough is the need for an impactful call-to-action that gives the viewer a reason to subscribe. Check out this awesome example from SoulPancake. Not only is the trailer the perfect length, it provokes motivational emotions, comedy, and ends with a very creative call-to-action. #4: Make Sure Your Videos Are Under 5 Minutes So, your videos are all 30-60 minutes because your digital engineering software is complicated to explain? Or perhaps you\u2019re in the law industry and believe the only way to instill trust is to include long video testimonials on your channel? While testimonials are great, long videos and YouTube do not go well together! Regardless of how complicated the product you\u2019re marketing is, your videos should never exceed 5 minutes. Why? Well, science. Study after study proves that online video viewers have a short attention span. I mean, did you forget earlier when I told you how 20 percent of viewers drop off within the first 10 seconds? In fact, HubSpot has found that the ideal length for videos on YouTube is a nice and concise 2 minutes. So re-edit those long webinars, and turn them into short, snappy clips. #5: Turn a Set of Videos into a Binge-Worthy Playlist Do you have a set of videos that go together? Perhaps you do a recurring weekly educational series, or you have a set of webinars around the same theme? Whatever it is, you should make that grouping into a YouTube playlist. This will allow your viewers to continue watching without having to manually search for and click into the next video. Why is this good for subscription growth? Well, it will keep people on your channel longer, and show them that you have a plethora of quality content. This will also keep your video content highly organized so your channel doesn\u2019t become a cluttered mess that turns users away. BuzzFeed Tasty does an awesome job at this. Check out their YouTube playlist page, which is grouped by different categories like, \u201cDinner,\u201d \u201cVegetarian,\u201d and my personal favorite because I despise dishes, \u201cOne-Pot Recipes.\u201d  ",

            "answer_text": "How to get free YouTube subscribers: 5 tips . Ask your viewers to subscribe I told you we\u2019re starting with the easiest ones first. Sometimes your audience just needs to be reminded. The big red subscribe button is omnipresent, but you might also want to point out the bell beside it that turns on notifications for your new videos. Simple. Does this tip seem too salesy to you? This is your reminder that you\u2019ve got valuable content, and you\u2019re just making it easier for them to keep up with the work you do. If you\u2019re already doing this, remember to demonstrate why your channel is worth subscribing to. And make sure you do it right when they love you the most (e.g., right after you\u2019ve provided new and useful information, or you\u2019ve made them laugh). Don\u2019t do it too much, or you\u2019ll risk turning people off. 2. End your videos by mentioning the one you\u2019re working on next Subscribing to a YouTube channel is an act of anticipation. Viewers who\u2019ve just seen what your brand is about are primed to want more, if you\u2019ve done your job right. Hyping your next video, and making it clear why it\u2019s not to be missed, is the most organic way to encourage people to tap subscribe. Of course, this requires having a good handle on your content schedule, and knowing what\u2019s coming next. (More on that soon.) 3. Interact with your audience and make friends If you form relationships with your viewers, they\u2019re more likely to want to keep watching your work. Respond to comments. Follow their channels back. Yes, it\u2019s exciting if a famous YouTuber comments on your video, but who knows who\u2019ll be famous next year. Form a community of peers and promote each other. (Yes, I\u2019m talking about shine theory. Also, once you\u2019re plugged in, your audience will provide you with plenty of free content ideas for your next video. Don\u2019t worry, you don\u2019t have to take all of them. Manage your YouTube presence using Hootsuite and not only can you upload and schedule videos, you can also add comment streams to your dashboard. That makes it easy to review, reply, and/or moderate comments on all your videos from one place. 4. Brand your thumbnails A thumbnail is a 1280 x 720px still image that acts as a cover for your video. And they are also your first, best chance to persuade people to click on your video. (Aside from your video titles, that is, but more on that later.) While some might advocate using the most \u201ceye-catching\u201d design (which seems to mean screaming red capslock over a man\u2019s shocked face and a picture of a\u2026 tomato?), one size does not fit all on YouTube. But we aren\u2019t here to earn cold views. To convert a viewer into a subscriber, take a look at your videos page. What does a new viewer see? Sleek, professional and consistent videos that imply an ongoing commitment to quality? Or a random mish-mash competing for attention? You want to aim for consistent branding in all your thumbnails. Use the same font, the same colour palette, or even the same frame composition so people know (at least subconsciously) that they\u2019re looking at a video from your channel. For instance, John Plant has built his survivalist Primitive Technology channel up to 9.9 million subscribers with understated, minimalist thumbnails. They\u2019re not loud, but they are consistent. And most importantly, they\u2019re clickable. 11. Release videos on a consistent schedule Many experts confidently cite a rule-of-thumb as to how often creators should post video to their channels. For instance: one video a week to start, increasing to 3-4 week as your channel grows. The theory is that more videos = more watch time from viewers. But prioritizing quantity over quality has drawbacks. If your goal is to convert viewers to subscribers, you need to focus on quality first, and consistency next. (Then you can start worrying about quantity.) If you upload videos consistently, then people know that more good content is coming, and they\u2019re more likely to tap subscribe. You can also use a social media management platform like Hootsuite to schedule your videos on YouTube for publishing later. Aditya \ud83d\ude00 ",

However, before you follow these simple action steps, you\u2019ll need to make sure you\u2019re already following these three principles for YouTube marketing success in your business: Be consistent: The \u201cone-and-done\u201d approach does not work on YouTube. If you want the views and the traffic, you need to be posting and updating your content consistently for best results. Upload new videos and share with your list and sphere of influence as frequently as possible. Provide value: If your video fails to provide any real value to the end user, don\u2019t be surprised when it doesn\u2019t get any real views. Each video needs to deliver your best content, your best-kept secrets and your most effective strategies. How can you raise the bar and provide more value in your videos? Be remarkable: Today, it\u2019s not enough to be posting weekly videos with your tips and content. Using your creative \u201cright-brain marketing approach,\u201d you need to convey your content in an engaging and entertaining format that separates you from the rest. In short, your videos need to be remarkable. The biggest sin in marketing is to be boring. How can your videos be the opposite of boring? #2: Use Annotations Annotations are the little colorful sticky notes that people paste all over their videos once they\u2019ve been uploaded to YouTube. Although this tool is often overused, a few strategically placed annotations can make a world of difference for your YouTube marketing efforts. Call-to-action annotation: Add a \u201cspeech bubble\u201c annotation directly under the Subscribe button to all of your old and existing videos. Click-to-action annotation: When you mention your call to action, add an image, graphic or \u201cbutton\u201c to the video and overlay it with a \u201cSpotlight\u201c annotation that links directly to your channel subscribe page. In short, your viewers can now subscribe by clicking an annotation inside your video. #3: Add a YouTube Widget and More to Your Blog If you already have a web property that is getting traffic, this is a great opportunity to leverage those visitors and get them to become subscribers to your channel. And they can do it with the click of a button. Once you start embedding your YouTube videos on your blog, there are two really easy ways to get more subscribers: YouTube Subscription Widget: By installing the YouTube Subscription Widget to the sidebar of your blog or website, you can make it even easier for others to find your videos and subscribe to future content. #4: Leverage Featured Channels Another simple method for increasing your reach and scooping up more subscribers is to strategically partner with other YouTube content-creators. Directly on your YouTube channel page is an option to add other \u201cFeatured Channels\u201d of those \u201cYouTubers\u201d you like and recommend. When you get other channels that have a similar audience to feature you, you can expect to see new viewers coming your way very quickly. #5: Consistently Interact When you start to understand that YouTube is a community, not just a place to host your videos, you will begin to see far more results when you interact with the other members of this community. One of the best ways to build a following of subscribers is to support others in their YouTube marketing efforts. Comment, like and subscribe as frequently as possible to other content-creators on YouTube, and wait for the reciprocation. Take a few minutes a day to find some new and relevant YouTube channels, pay attention to their content and leave real, genuine comments. It\u2019s a simple concept, really: the more you give, the more you get. #6: Create a Payoff Lastly, my favorite strategy for attracting new subscribers starts by creating a \u201cpayoff.\u201d There is something magical about posting your goals to the public. You want to lose a few stubborn pounds? Post it on Facebook! Do you fancy that special someone? Shout it from a rooftop! But what if you want more YouTube subscribers? Here\u2019s a simple step-by-step process of the \u201csubscriber payoff method\u201d in action: Identify your current subscriber count (e.g., 450 subscribers) Identify your subscriber goal (e.g., 500 subscribers) Pick something fun, unique or different that you will do once you reach 500 subscribers (e.g., a free giveaway, shave your head, do a crazy dance on video, etc.) Share your goal (and your payoff) with the world. When you share your goals with the world, people will jump on board to support you and help you accomplish your goals. This is a great way to spread your reach with little effort and have a fun time doing it. ",

            "answer_text": "Hi there, to increase number of subscribers for your Youtube channel , below are some of the easy ways you may try out: \u00b7 Create Engaging Content Channels and videos with higher watch time are more likely to turn up in search results and recommendations. So, you need to keep in mind that you have to value your viewer\u2019s time and deliver value right away while creating your content. FYI, tfirst eight seconds of your video is the most important. The click-away rate in those eight seconds is most. So, make sure that you start delivering information right away and don\u2019t put the important information at the end of the video. \u00b7 Schedule Your Videos The BEST thing you can do with YouTube is to make a lot of content and make it consistently. The frequency helps you retain existing subscribers, also helps you to attract new subscribers to your Youtube channel. The formula which all famous YouTuber follow is the 1*4 formula. Publish four YouTube videos every month. That breaks down into one video every week. It\u2019s an easy number to remember and you\u2019ll soon see the increase in youtube Subscriber. \u00b7 Create attractive Video Thumbnail Create an attractive thumbnail for your videos to increase click-through rate. Use relevant text and image in the thumbnail. A custom video thumbnail with a minor annotation will tell your users what your video is all about. Youtube offers a selection of thumbnails from three intervals of your video. These intervals are at the 1/4th mark, at 1/2 mark, and at the 3/4th mark. Choose the one that best illustrates what your video. \u00b7 Customize your Youtube Channel Craft Youtube Channel to create trust with your brand. Make the most of the YouTube channel bio and custom URL to finish up your channel customizations. Keep the bio short and to the point. You can always link to your website URL in the video description for a more detailed bio. Another important step in customizing your channel is to create an awesome introduction video. YouTube offers a great feature called channel trailers that lets you automatically play a video upon the opening of a YouTube channel. Your channel trailer is the first thing any visitor will see on your Youtube page. So, channel trailer is something you must carefully work on and constantly improve to keep visitors engaged. Try to give a quick, informative, and engaging introduction. \u00b7 Motivate your audience to Subscribe A simple link created for subscribing to the channel can increase youtube subscriber. The pro technique is to add a call to action button. If you\u2019re using a graphic to add a call to action, you can liven it up with a call to action annotation. Make sure to put it subtly it should not annoy your viewers. \u00b7 Interact with your fans Key to make a loyal fan base is to keep interacting with your fans. Interact with your audience, and listen to their requests in the comments section of your videos. Make sure you reply to each comment both negative and positive. It will increase your credibility and increase Youtube subscribers. There are more ways to increase subscribers other than those I\u2019ve mention. You may try and error for better result and if you would like to get a hand from others to increase your Youtube subscribers, I would recommend you AppSally. Hope that was insightful. Wish you best of the luck!  ",

            "answer_text": "As someone who's helped a channel grow from under 4 million subs to over 6.8 million in less than two years, here's what I've learned. Content is king. First and foremost, concentrate on doing something you love, and making your best possible version of whatever that is.Consistency. If you truly love the process of making your content, it will be easier for you to stick with it. It can take a lot of content to both gain, and maintain, people's attention. Whatever you're making, it\u2019s best if you can maintain a specific release schedule - e.g. every Tuesday at 10 - the YouTube algorithm rewards this.Make the ask; make it easy. Though it may seem obvious, don\u2019t assume everyone knows what you want. Ask your viewers to subscribe. You can do this at the beginning, or end, of your videos. Some people do both. Be sincere.End Cards. Utilize the EndCards function, which can make it easier for people to subscribe on mobile devices. It also makes it easier for people to watch the next video, or playlist, you might have queued up for them. It's important to understand the vast majority of viewers in North America, Europe, and Australia are currently watching YouTube on their phones.Engage. Find a way, where possible, to engage with your audience. People feel more connected if it's not entirely a one way street. Some people do this by including something to vote on at the end - a kind of \u201cwhat do you want to see next\u201d ask. Other people get involved in their comments section.Leverage Social Media. If you're not already doing this, social media is another great rescourse to both engage with your audience, promote your content, and ask for thing which may be important for you - likes, shares, and subs. It's also great for building a whole network of colleague, where you may become friends, or even collaborators on some projects.So build your content library, and find your community. A million subscribers won't typically happen overnight, so be patient and learn to enjoy the process. Good luck! ",

            "answer_text": "Thank you Devaraj for requesting this question. As a new YT creator, this question strikes only to those who seeks long term solution. Otherwise, most creators still play the outdated games of \u201cSubscribe for Subscribe\u201d and \u201cview for view\u201d. I\u2019m glad you\u2019re not on of them. Now let\u2019s address the real issue here. When somebody creates their new YT channel and publish their first few videos, and those videos receive only a few to no views, they think it\u2019s the YT SEO that they need to focus more on. While it\u2019s true for the most part. But they overlook their content of their videos. To make a video, they\u2019ll collect all the facts out there by watching other videos and may be few blogs and they\u2019ll use it in their video and publish it. It\u2019s a good approach. But what they\u2019ve missed is the connection with their audience. If you can narrate a story, better if from your personal life or from your circle, then you\u2019ll be able to make a connection. Because your story is different in spite of the facts being same. If you keep doing this with future videos, the engagement % will gradually increase. Increase in engagement will bring you real and active users. Tip #1 : Your channel might be a technical channel (for instance) and you talk about features in a DSLR. When making a video about the latest Canon DSLR, talk about why did you love it and your friend didn\u2019t. [It has to be genuine, you can\u2019t just fool your viewers.] People will be able to relate to your video and hit like. Few will leave comments and other few will subscribe. Tip #2 : Join and leverage FB groups related to your niche. Help the community as much as you can with your knowledge, if needed share your video link to them and if your video impresses them, there\u2019s a high chance of getting new subscribers Tip #3 : Add a playlist called \u201cChannel Update\u201d in your channel and talk about why you\u2019re doing what you\u2019re doing, what new content are you planning, inform them about your milestone, etc. And so many other things can be done. Just remember to \u201cCONNECT\u201d. ",

            "answer_text": "For those of you just starting out on YouTube, there's a lot involved. But you really need to hold your horses and remember to stick with the basics. I have a few different categories of videos. Devotionals, Inspirational, Travel vLogs, Fitness How-To, Supplement Reviews, Equipment Reviews, to name a few. All of these are sorted in categories, and arranged on the main page of my channel. I use EYE CATCHING and INFORMATIVE thumbnails. Along with a channel banner, that is attractive, and lets folks know where they are. The banner and logo is throughout ALL of my social media, videos and of course THIS website. Remember this important point. It's all about BRANDING. Note: there is a lot more to branding, this is branding 101 info above. Now back to the videos\u2026 The last 2 categories in the list, my equipment and supplement reviews, are the ones that get the most people watching! How do I know that? By my analytics and view counts. Knowing that important tidbit of data, I will focus on what is getting the most views hoping that I can encourage viewers to watch my Inspirational and Devotionals by having \u201cCARDS\u201d at the end of my video for them to click on and watch. After getting a number of videos produced, the key is to look at your analytics, see WHICH ONES are pulling in the most viewers, and HOLDING them. This tells you what *IS* and *IS NOT* working for you. Trail and error I am afraid! JUST DO IT! vLogging basics Get a digital video camera or use your cellphone to start, that\u2019s how I did it. See my recent equipment blog and video Setup vLog I did.  Then think of what and how you are going to shoot your video. What \"character\" will you be? This is your content. When it comes to YouTube the biggest thing of course is compelling content. Content, Content, Content! It of course starts with working hard, making outstanding content, great editing, compelling visuals, proper tags, descriptions and great thumbnails. HAVE A GREAT TITLE! Do a search on the subject you are doing and see what pops up in the search bar, this will give you some idea of titles to use. Then post on ALL THE SOCIAL media from the SHARE link, TALK to people, get on forums and post links to your channel in the appropriate discussion, find like minded people and network. have business cards with your channel on it. LEAVE THEM every where! You need to make sure that you are posting to at least 50 high volume threads a week, on multiple sites, you need to INTERACT with the viewers who post on your channel and OTHER social media sites too. Basically YOU NEED TO MAKE NOISE! Finally, Do some collaborations with others on YouTube, in particular channels with more subscribers than you. You are now on your way to developing an engaging channel and community of subscribers. But wait.... there's more....

I\u2019ve also experienced this kind of problem with my first channel about video games. I was really struggling with the first 100 subscribers and was always getting new schemes to get more subs. Let me tell you how can you get more YouTube subscribers: 1.Ask your viewers to subscribeThere might be people watching your YouTube videos right now that haven\u2019t subscribed to you yet. It may not even cross their mind to subscribe without you asking them. So if you want to get more YouTube subscribers for free, just ask! For example, in the intro of your YouTube videos, you can say something like: \u201cHey everyone, welcome back to my channel. If you\u2019re new here, please consider subscribing if you enjoy this video.\u201d It\u2019s as simple as that. 2. Make and announce a schedule of your videos If a user finds your channel and sees that your last video was uploaded 2 months ago, they\u2019re probably not going to subscribe to your channel. YouTube viewers want consistency. So, if you want to gain subscribers fast, your YouTube channel should be like a TV series where users can tune it regularly each week to view your content. Frequently uploading videos will help you attract a ton of new subscribers and help you keep the ones you already have. Start by uploading 1 video every week. 4 videos per month is a good amount of frequency to attract new subscribers and it\u2019s easy enough for you to manage as well. Once you decide on an upload schedule that will work for you and your audience, be sure to announce it in a video. Remember to be specific. Don\u2019t just say \u201cI upload every week,\u201d say \u201cnew uploads every Friday.\u201d 3. Complete Your Profile and Make a Channel Trailer Once you choose a channel theme, you need to attract your first subscribers by completing your profile and making a channel trailer. A channel trailer is a short video that you can upload to help viewers quickly understand what your channel is about. Plus, channel trailers are set to auto-play for users who aren\u2019t subscribed to your channel so it\u2019s a powerful way to turn viewers into subscribers.

            "answer_text": "How do we get subscribers on YouTube? I'm a Youtuber 10 years until now, from my experience to get YouTuber subscribers quite simple. Why do i say that ? There\u2019re various ways to get YouTube subscribers fast and easy. To complete reach it, I am going to tell you a few different ways, then understand all these methods well and use them on your YouTube channel and on other videos. If you use these methods well, you will be able to raise your YouTube channel in the fastest possible time. 1. Create Amazing Content Inspired content is the kind the viewers want, regardless of the niche because no matter how much support you are getting from paid advertisement, your efforts are futile if viewers does not find it compelling. To get the most out of your content, you have to determine your audience. Create the kind of quality that revolves around them. Know what they want, and you will know what you have to generate. Exciting content does not have to come from you all the time. There will come a time when ideas escape you. If you are having a hard time coming up with one, you can scroll through the comments section. It is a pool of many ideas. If not, engage the viewers to leave ideas because that is one of the ways how to get the most views on YouTube \u2013 creating content that your viewers suggest, because that means, that is something would be interested in. 2. Allow Embedding You must be generous with your video is you want to reach more people. That is gained through sharing, and it can only be done if you allow your video to be embedded. This gives your viewers the chance to share your content on their blog or on their social media accounts giving you more reach to audience that you may not have intended the video for. However, these are always a welcomed addition. To enable embedding, just head over to your creator studio and click advanced settings. Under distribution settings, ensure that a tick is on Allow Embedding, otherwise, this will not be possible. 3. Use Other Platforms to Your Advantage Social media is the single most powerful tool in this day and age. Its use could make or a break an internet personality\u2019s presence online. In effect, it is also one of the ways how to views in YouTube. What this does is give you access to audiences from across the world who you may not have from within your locality. Also, it gives you a better chance of getting an audience, especially with the varied niches that you might be into. All you need to do is set-up a page for yourself, and just share constantly the videos that you upload. Once you are big enough, sometimes, they do it for you. However, if they do not, you do not have to worry because websites or applications such as Hootsuite and Buffer can help upload them on platforms based on a set date. Remember that the only way to maximize YouTube is to remember that it was never a standalone platform, and that is its networking power. 4. Quality Over Quantity Quality should always be at the forefront of your channel. That is why it is a must to have compelling videos, otherwise, viewers leave just as soon as they see what you have to offer. Why is this important ? In today\u2019s YouTube algorithm, Watch Time is more important than views alone. This is the span of time that a person stays to watch your video, and the better the quality of your video is, the higher the chance of your viewers staying. You may also want to refer to other videos or channels within your niche. The platform rewards this with \u2018Watch Time Credits\u2019, which is again, credited to your channel. 5. Building a Network You cannot bring in viewers on your own. You need a community to back you up. Nurture a community. Engage with the audience. That is another way how to get more YouTube videos fast. It does not matter whether it is by simply giving a reply to comments left in your video or referring to another content creator within the same niche. You may even drop a comment if you think you should. Starting a conversation creates momentum, and that in turn brings out others who may have the same interests. As a result, the viewer counts rises. 6. It Starts with a Name You would think that a video platform has no use of SEO, but it does, and other than playlist names, sometimes, it all starts with a video\u2019s title. SEO is just as important in YouTube as it is in articles because, at the end of the day, people find results through a search engine run by an algorithm. That is why knowing the right keywords to use is a way how to get more views on to your YouTube channel. You can find the appropriate keywords to use through the suggestion box that appears when you key in the words in the search bar. You can also use websites, or applications, such as Google Trends and Google Adwords Keyword Planner. Also, you may want to keep your titles the lengths of 60 to 70 characters and use only those which relates to your video. Otherwise, YouTube will penalize your channel. 7. Optimize the Platform The internet is not somewhere you hide yourself. It is the place to expose yourself, and you only build yourself, and a community, if you let them know who you are and where to find you. Again, exposure is the key. That is why, if you can, add your social media platforms on your channel, maybe include your website as well if you have one. Experts also suggest that you enable other related content on the platform. Disabling \u2018Related Channels\u2019 is a common mistake that amateurs do. Not only does this deny the community of valuable content, but it also takes away your opportunity to be featured on the recommended page of YouTube, normally found on a viewer\u2019s home page. Self-promotion is never enough. It takes a community to build a brand. 8. A Strong Impression A first impression is not something you would expect in YouTube, but it does. This is through the use of engaging thumbnails which are the first things that a viewer sees when they log on to the platform. Long-time YouTubers would tell you to create customized thumbnails. This gives it more personality and would reflect your brand a lot more, identifying your brand without having to read who uploaded it. 9. Promote the Platform If you have not surmised it just yet, avoid promoting the videos alone. Promote your entire channel, and the platform instead. This can be done by adding a widget on your blog or on your website, if you have one. This gives viewers direct access to your channel with content that they may not have known existed, and see them devour each one, one video at a time. 10. Do Not be Afraid to be Human To show a human side every now and then is how you get more views on YouTube because viewers love a touch of vulnerability. Showing that you are human, and not just another person behind the screen is a way to make yourself relatable which is a strong marketing too in itself, especially today. 11. Grab the Trend Always a last resort, you can get the attention of many others by creating content that is currently trending online. Uploading your own version gets people curious, thus it converts into views. Always focus on what got you there, and that is the niche that you are currently in because that is your way of showing loyalty to those who made your channel what it is. ",

            "answer_text": " You can get more subscribers on Youtube by applying these following tactics 1. Create An Engaging Channel Trailer With the new channel design, YouTube gives content creators a great chance to create a trailer to share what your content is about. Have you ever attended a movie without viewing a trailer? I think most the answer is NO because you want to see what it is about. Keep your trailer under 90 seconds and show scenes from your other videos and provide a strong call to action of why a viewer should become a subscriber. Keep people coming back by putting some effort into your videos. Did you notice I didn\u2019t mention any technical details about lighting, audio and composition? This is because I assume you should know that already. The more comfortable you are on camera the more subscribers you can get. It may take a while, but you can do it. 2. Look for Co-Marketing Opportunities YouTube is a great avenue to co-market your brand with another company. Working with other has become a helpful strategy for many businesses trying to increase their audience size and YouTube subscribers count. Starting with smaller with brands specifically in your industry and maybe focus on those just getting into the game. If you build up a few co-marketing videos with other brands, bigger companies will likely be more willing to participate in your video series. 3. Promote with Subreddits Reddit users organize themselves into subreddits. These are communities based around a topic. Find 10 to 20 subreddits and tell people about your YouTube channel. If your content is horrible and not relevant to the subreddit, Redditors will make fun of you and kick you out of the subreddit. A good rule of thumb for marketing, though, is to only promote and advertise once you have an amazing product. Otherwise, as marketing legend Dan Kennedy puts it, \u201cmarketing only increases the speed people find out your product is awful.\u201d 4. Learn how to optimize your titles. One great way to do this is to give your videos offbeat names. This way, you\u2019re going to be getting a lot of people coming to your channel based on curiosity alone. But to get a maximum amount of views, you will also need to dive into the SEO part of YouTube marketing. Here are a few tips for optimizing your YouTube titles for greater reach: use the keyword in the title, use Google Adwords to identify what people are searching for on the web.Try to tackle videos with a perfect blend of high volume searches and low competition, don\u2019t make the title too long. Google truncates the length of the video down to 66 characters and adds \u2018YouTube |\u2019 before the video (taking an extra 10 characters). Your ideal video title should be no more than 50 characters, make the title descriptive. Give the audience a sneak peek as to what the video will be about. ",

            "answer_text": "Thing more satisfying than hitting a milestone with your videos. One important one is your first 1,000 subscribers. This is important because YouTube offers live streaming once you have achieved this milestone and you have an account in good standing (Since the publishing of this post there has been a change: YouTube now offers live streaming for free for verified non-profit entities. Instead of needing 1,000 subscribers you now need 100 subscribers.) Getting more subscribers can seem like a difficult task, but I\u2019ll share 10 tips to help you get your first 1,000 subscribers. 1. Post Useful Content Consistently This is one of the most difficult things to do as a content creator. If you take a look around YouTube you might think that every video under the sun has been created and that is most likely true, but you can put your own spin on a popular topic. For example, there are many \u201cunboxing\u201d tech videos\u2026what if you created a \u201creboxing\u201d and talk about the various components of tech while you put it back in the box? The key here is creativity and that will certainly boost subscriptions. 2. Name Your Videos Strategically One of the most difficult things is to name your video. You have the name in your head, but it may be something complex or too long. My rule is to keep it basic and use the YouTube autocomplete to name the video. There is nothing wrong with your video having the same name or something close to a popular video, as long as it\u2019s relevant. 3. Spruce Up Your Channel Design Most visitors first impression of you is from your channel and your design. This is where visitors interact and get to know what you are about. Create a engaging header and show off your brand. On my channel, we were intentional about our design making it fit into our overall branding strategy. The key takeaway is to design with purpose. 4. Show Your Lighter Side Lighten up and laugh at yourself. Bloopers make you more human and show something different than an ordinary talking head video. Also, switch up the video and catch your viewers off guard so they don\u2019t know what to expect. 5. Shoot In Various Locations I believe that shooting in various locations can lead to more interest. I understand that may not be possible or you may have a set, but try to change a background or even use a green screen. Like the clich\u00e9 says, \u201cvariety is the spice of life\u201d so mix it up with your backgrounds and locations. 6. Create A Custom Thumbnail I have seen my subscriptions and views increase by adding this step. I use impact font that is seen on many internet photos to grab attention and I format the photo using Adobe Photoshop. I usually title the photo thumbnail differently than the video because when people are scrolling through other videos to view, they can easily tell what my video is about. 7. Use Annotations Annotations are those annoying things that pop up during videos, but they can be a content creator\u2019s dream. I add annotations to every video and make it easy by creating a link for them to subscribe. This is extra work, but once you see your subscription rate increase you will continue to add them to every video. 8. Ask For Subscribers This is very basic. At the end of every video ask viewers to \u201clike\u201d and subscribe to your channel. You should also tell them why they should subscribe, for example if you are a DIY Home Improvement channel I would say, \u201csubscribe for my DIY projects, tricks and insider tips delivered to you weekly.\u201d Remember, be careful what you ask for, because you might get it. 9. Be Yourself You are the best you\u2014you can be. Being on camera was difficult for me at first because I compared myself to others who are natural on camera talent then I realized, \u201cI just have to be me.\u201d Let your personality shine in your videos and I guarantee someone will connect with you. 10. Create An Engaging Channel Trailer With the new channel design, YouTube gives content creators a great opportunity to create a trailer to share what your content is about. Have you ever attended a movie without viewing a trailer? Not me, because you want to see what it is about. Keep your trailer under 90 seconds and show scenes from your other videos and provide a strong call to action of why a viewer should become a subscriber. Keep people coming back by putting some effort into your videos. Did you notice I didn\u2019t mention any technical details about lighting, audio and composition? This is because I assume you should know that already. The more comfortable you are on camera the more subscribers you can get. It may take a while, but you can do it.

            "answer_text": "Are you wondering how to get people from YouTube to your website? Are you looking for ideas to move people from watchers to clickers? Keep reading to learn how. 1.\tPost new content regularly It's the same as on Facebook or Instagram, and regular YouTube interaction keeps subscribers from forgetting you. If you only post 1 video and wait for the followers to come to you then it is a silly idea! Conversely, if you regularly share videos that interest them, engaging your followers will have a reason to press the Subscribe button on your channel. No need to share too many and too many videos, you need to choose a regular and regular video submission strategy. Video content must also be attractive, practical and innovative so that users do not feel bored. 2.\tFocus on the first 10 seconds According to statistics, 49% of readers read only 111 words or less on the site they visited. For video content sharing, getting noticed with the viewer from the very first moment is extremely important. According to the statistics, a perfect video will have a duration of about 2.7 minutes. Therefore, your task is to entice viewers in the first few seconds. 3.\t Call to Action Strategy A call to action is needed for a YouTube video as this is the opportunity to turn a regular viewer into a subscriber - even in the long run it can become your potential customer. Instead of calling them straight to your website, encourage viewers to share videos and spread the message. While organic ways take time to boost your views and they aren\u2019t effective all the time, you wanna drive a huge traffic to your YouTube channel, think about purchasing Youtube views/subscribers. It means you will need get high-quality YouTube users. They can offer from 100 to 1,000+ likes, provide a comment plan, ranging from 10 to 100+ comments alongside views. You can than customize the comments you want to receive, or have users create postive comments themselves. The best service that I\u2019ve used and highly recommend you is Boost Socials which is the best-rating company in the list. ",

            "answer_text": "Here are some ways you can do just that. 1. Create a \"channel trailer\" Many YouTube channels show a channel trailer at the top of their page that autoplays when visitors check them out. Create a \u201ctrailer\u201d video of your own that you can show to unsubscribed visitors on your page to quickly tell them what to expect from you. The benefit of creating a unique trailer for this spot is that you can stitch together footage from your past videos or deliver your \u201cpitch\u201d directly to your audience and ask them to subscribe. Here's a great example from How to Cake It that conveys the channel's focus (making cake), tone (having fun with cake), and personality (passionate about cake). 2. Come up with a pitch for your YouTube channel An elevator pitch is an often underestimated tool that\u2019s relevant to all self-starters, whether you\u2019re an entrepreneur, a freelancer, or a creator.  And YouTubers are no exception. This pitch can be used in your About section, your intro, your closing, or wherever you need to quickly communicate what your channel is about. Most YouTubers already end their videos by saying something along the lines of, \u201cIf you liked this video, please hit the thumbs up, leave a comment, and subscribe.\u201d But this call to action can be enhanced by creating an outro that speaks to the content that\u2019s to come rather than what viewers just watched. Your pitch can be as simple as: I post [videos you post] every [when you post] or a teaser for what's next. These couple of seconds capture the essence of your channel's content in a way that gives new viewers a reason to hit that subscribe button. 3. Buy Youtube views to kickstart your Youtube channels Consumers are naturally attracted to content that has been shared with them or they have heard about from another source. When a person finds your video, the more views that it has, the more likely your audience is to watch it and listen to its message with an open mind. This goes hand in hand with developing a reputation as a producer of valuable content, since your credibility will largely be a factor of your popularity. This boost in your credibility is invaluable when it comes to increasing sales stemming from your video.  If you are looking for a website to Buy Youtube Views, I confidently recommend for you This One. I\u2019ve been working with them for many times and just realize some factors: Quality of Views \u2013 AG provide high-quality followers. Their followers are all look real, which have profile pictures, some videos and active. Turnaround Time \u2013 They deliver the goods on time. Often within 1-2 hours after customer ordered. Customer Service \u2013 Their staffs are very helpful, friendly and they answer all question thoroughoutly. Money Back Guarantee \u2013 This is arguably the biggest factor. If a company doesn\u2019t offer a good refund policy, then they don\u2019t deserve our recommendation. Thanks God, all packages of AG are covered with 100% money back guarantee to keep you in safe. 4. Collaborate with other YouTubers with similar audiences Collaborations aren\u2019t uncommon on YouTube and are a great way to get exposure to a whole new audience. You can reach out to a YouTuber you know or would like to partner with and suggest an idea for cross-promotion. A common approach is to have your proposed partner appear in one of your videos and vice versa, each of you getting an endorsement in front of the other creator\u2019s audience.  Here\u2019s an example of when Sean Evans of Hot Ones interviewed Harley Morenstein of Epic Meal Time over hot wings. Sean then appeared on Epic Meal Time to cook up the spiciest ribs ever. Both channels are about taking food to the next level and both entertain you in similar ways\u2014it's a match made in heaven. ",

            "answer_text": "Youtube is the top video sharing platform, more and more celebrities are getting into the wagon to extend their reach on the online world. Youtube has evolved from when it started to what it is, they have revised their policy which has made it hard for content creators to make money. Here is my take on how to get more Youtube Subscribers: 1. Use Playlists : Curate your content in an organized manner such that it catches the eye of users Your content should resonate with the users. 2. Publish LONG Videos (10+ Minutes) From my experience longer videos greater than 4 min have more chances to rank on youtube. 3. Promote Videos In Your End Screen Don't forget to promote video at the end screen, youtube has made it easy for us in their editor. 4. Focus On Quality\u2026 Not Quantity Create quality content don't as content speaks for itself. 5. Reply To EVERY Comment Connecting with your audience to develop trust in your channel which makes them view your new videos 6. Funnel People to \u201cSubscriber Magnets\u201d Identity the videos which are making more views and promote them. 7. Embed YouTube Videos Share your content across your other social media. 8. Optimize Your Channel Page Polish your channel to make it more professional. 9. Get help from professionals As views and subscribers count has become a benchmark to evaluate the channel\u2019s reach and to stand out of crowd, you need likes, views, and subscribers.  socialrankPRO will help you exactly for that. They have plans for every budget. They have a dedicated 24 X 7 support system, check out their website to get more info. ",

            "answer_text": "on YouTube, \u2018Content is King\u2019 in the long run. Ways which can give you REAL subscribers;a) Be consistent - post videos at a set frequencyb) Improvise - keep improving with every video. Trust me, people notice improvements and then stick to the channel for long time./c) Try and balance Quality v/s Quantity - I always thrive to post good videos on my YouTube channel but posting good videos with a very high frequency is a tough task. So find a middle ground in video production which will give you both, a good frequency (quantity) that keeps subscribers hooked and good quality too. Ways which can give you ACTIVE subscribers;a) Call for action - always end your video with a \u2018Call for action\u2019 so that people would involve themselves in an activity or act towards a cause after watching your video. It could be as simple as \u2018waking up early for a run\u2019.b) Feedback - ask subscribers about their valuable feedback in the comments section on YouTube.c) Interact - with people during video, as if you are talking to them and also try to reply to every single comment that lands up on your channel\u2019s comment section. Share contact, email or any other medium through which people can reach out to you. Do remember, people are Real and Active all the time. We should not wait for them to come to us. We, through our content should go up to them and if they like the content they\u2019ll stick with it for a long long time. I wish you all the best for your channel. ",

            "answer_text": " General advice: to get more subs on Youtube you need your channel to appear among other famous channels. If you want to get your videos into similar videos of the other famous YouTube channel, it is necessary to select a topic, tags, keys, and description correctly. However, it does not always work that way for you. On the flip side, it seems like you do everything right but a source of traffic of your channel stills a channel with a small number of views. How Youtube algorithm works? Once you create a new channel, it is on the very bottom of the youtube suggested videos. For example, you have less than 1000 views per mouth. Thus, your channel appears among the other channels with a small number of subscribers, and YouTube suggests you to them automatically. And so, let's say, your channel suddenly gets into a recommended videos of the unusual for you famous channel. It means you are slowly but surely moving to a new stage. YouTube will be more put your videos among popular ones, and soon this process will become familiar to you. The algorithm is composed of three parts: Stage one. Your channel will be on the first stage for about two months or more. Less than 1000 views per month. Stage two. Then, the rate of your channel suddenly increases to the 100,000 or 200,000 per month. Stage three. Your channel grows X2-X3 again. When everything is properly done it teas you six month to grow from 1000 views to 1M+ views. Normally, this is a scheme of work for every new channel on YouTube. The transition to the next stage usually begins with a large number of views in real time. Such peaks do not last longer than two-three days. When an interest of viewers\u2019 falls by 50-60%, the average number of views increases compared to the previous period. Sometimes, the growth rate does not slow down, and the channel goes to the next stage without falling. If it happens, it means a real success. Just keep doing what you do! Well, it is just a small secret of the YouTube's algorithms for beginners. However, nobody knows how the system works, and only long-term experience and insider data can give the information what you need. ",

An increasing quantity of brands are depending upon original content to catch their audience's attention, rather than jogging traditional ad campaigns. Buy youtube subscribers Video content is just one among the absolute most popular types of content marketing. In fact, YouTube is the largest search engine using just six thousand hours of video viewed on a monthly basis and 300 hrs of video uploaded each single moment. Create searchable names Many men and women see matters to watch with YouTube's search bar, and also you also have to bear that in your mind as you name your own videos. Your names will incorporate the key words they would logically search if you are searching for your information inside the video. Bringing viewers for a YouTube videos follows exactly the same general idea as optimizing your site. You will have to choose key terms and add them on your names and descriptions to arrive if customers search for videos to the own topic. Compose a script Have you watched a video that was assumed to be informational, however it was clear that they had attempted to\"wing it\" This approach will work, however usually it really is painful to watch and a tiny bit expressive. Videos are useful if they are organized using a script to continue to keep you on track. The logical stream of one's video, the more beneficial it's going to probably likely be to viewers and also the greater of these will soon develop right into subscribers. Publish always I love watching Grey's Anatomy just about each and each single Thursday at 8:00 p.m. and a few among the main reasons the reason is that I understand I can trust an hour or so Meredith gray weekly. In the event the series ceased third regular program, and that I really don't understand when to assume it, then I'd most likely lose attention and continue forward. That's the reason consistency is critical. Ask your viewers to subscribe It may seem clear, nevertheless, you need to always ask your viewers to subscribe at the conclusion of each video. Viewers want to get advised what direction to go. After the video they truly are watching is visiting an end, add a call-to-action to subscribe. Asking viewers to subscribe would be similar to asking readers to subscribe for a own email listing. ",

            "answer_text": "Seems I have found another me in this question!.This is the same question I was asking myself since I started the YouTube channel . Though I did a lot of things right, there were no new subscribers and the number of views sucked!. By spending a lot of time studying how to get more views, I have learned a lot from other YouTubers and here is a penny from my side to those aspiring YouTubers!. The first and most important thing we all need to learn is how to make quality content. You should select a niche and stick to it while making videos to attract subscribers. If you go after every trending videos and remake it, probably they will not subscribe or even unsubscribe your channel considering the content as not appropriate!.  To grow a channel, you need to get more views on your old videos and you need to tweak your keywords, description, tags and thumbnail to get so. You may do it manually but it does take a lot of time and effort. Lucky that, there are tools to help you with this - no, I am not marketing them but giving you an insight if you are not familiar with it. I would give you a sneak peek into two of the tools I tried and both have free and paid versions and you may need only free version until you get monetized. The first one is vidIQ- they give a lot of details and insights about other youtube channels, videos and subscriptions. But most of them are not useful for a new YouTuber and their paid versions are so pricy that a newcomer may not afford. (strictly my opinion!) The second one is Tubebuddy - This is rather a simple version of VidIQ but gives more features on the free version. I am using the free version and you can see the difference in both views and subscribers on my channel once I started it six weeks back. The most useful feature of TubeBuddy is the keyword explorer- it helps you to plan your next videos by showing the search volume, optimisation strength etc of the targeted topic by giving you the exact keyword suggestions. For instance, if you are a creator who is focusing on new YouTubers, a keyword on \"how to get more subscribers\" can be entered in the search field and it will give you the details and more suggested keywords!.  There are plenty of tutorial videos available on their website, please spend some time to watch and learn how to use this amazing tool!. Sign up now, use it for a month and if you think it helped you to grow instantly, you may purchase their paid version. They are cheap, will not make a hole in your pocket as some other tools do!.

Here the two important thing you should kept in mind. Content is the king Try to improve the content of the video. Quality CONTENT means the purpose of video should full filed the need of those audience for whom you are making the video. For improving the quality do the following things When you made a video whatch it and see are you satisfied with your own video or not or think can you improve this more than improve it try this again and again, then you will get awesome videoAudience should understand what your are explaining them, for this ask your friend to get the feedback it help you to know where audience will not understand and make it easier. Now remember people will share only those things which they like themselves. So if your video has good content people surely share it and when they share it they will like it and subscribe it. 2. Promotion Promote your video to your target audience only for eg if you made a gaming video then you should share it to those who are interested in gaming. If you share it with those who are not interested may be they will open the video for 2 sec and then cancel it because of no interest.  Take a paper and write down where you will find those people who are interested in your content then advertise to those people only. You can JOIN various groups on Facebook related to your content and you can advertise it for free but these free promotion Don't give you high no. Of subscribers. You should do paid advertisement of your channel if you can afford Because paid ad are very specific to those who are very much interested. In paid ad on Facebook, Google, Instagram etc who can select age of the people among whom you want to advertise and similarly you can select gender. You can also select on basis of what post they like on Facebook for eg if you want to promote gaming channel you Will like to promote to those who like gaming post. There are lot of options to make your ad more specific so that you will high result. All the best dude. If any problems you face let me know through comments. ",

            "answer_text": "Hello! I\u2019ll use a bit of a previous answer\u2026 As with any other business, you need to look for a gap in the market. Why should people watch you? Compare your channel to one with similar content. What makes yours different, better? Now about audience. It's all fine and dandy if your content is high-quality, humorous and interesting, but you may be attracting only a small number of people. Let's use video games as an example. As you may know, Fortnite has blown up recently and it's the only thing people are talking about. Say I wanted to play Animal Crossing. I could make a 10/10, high quality video packed with jokes. However I doubt it would blow up as everyone's focus is on Fortnite. It's the only demand these days. Unless you wanna be brave and you wanna break through this all! Maybe you wanna revive the Animal Crossing series! However this would be very hard and if you're looking for a more definite, stable increase in views, then I would try and adjust your videos to fit in with what people are looking for currently. Does that make sense? And marketing! Some movies spend millions dollars on marketing their film, even more than the actual production of the film. In terms of Youtube, your best bet would be to set up Instagram pages, Twitter pages, stuff like that. Get involved with the community you're trying to reach out to. Try to avoid getting involved with stuff like \u2018sub for sub\u2019, and spamming in people\u2019s comment sections. It gets very annoying and gives you a bad reputation. There's probably quite a few more factors, but i hope these ones will help you. :) ",

You can reach out to a YouTuber you know or would like to partner with and suggest an idea for cross-promotion. A common approach is to have your proposed partner appear in one of your videos and vice versa, each of you getting an endorsement in front of the other creator\u2019s audience. 2.\tCreate a \"channel trailer\" Many YouTube channels show a channel trailer at the top of their page that autoplays when visitors check them out. Create a \u201ctrailer\u201d video of your own that you can show to unsubscribed visitors on your page to quickly tell them what to expect from you. The benefit of creating a unique trailer for this spot is that you can stitch together footage from your past videos or deliver your \u201cpitch\u201d directly to your audience and ask them to subscribe. 3.\tFind out real organic subscribers All the subscribers will stay forever because they are genuine and real. The people are sourced from a managed community of individuals who have registered to be informed of new music, products and services via social media channels. A huge amount of organic subscribers can come from a reputation Youtube promotion service.

Learning how to get subscribers on YouTube fast is not an easy feat for everyone. It pays to be patient, learn from others, and learn from your own experiences. When you see something that\u2019s working, repeat it. When you see something that\u2019s not working, throw it away and focus more on what does. 5.\tOptimize your videos to improve search rankings The best way to get more subscribers is by appearing at the top of Google and YouTube search rankings. Pack your video title and description with keywords that viewers will use to find content similar to yours. Use Google Keyword Planner to find the most searched video keywords.

            "answer_text": "So, you want to know how to buy subscribers to help grow your YouTube channel? Well, it's pretty simple. You don't!!! Trust me, if you've been thinking about buying subscribers to grow your YouTube channel, this is going to save you a lot of pain. Because put simply, you don't want to do it. And this is the main reason why. These are YouTube's Terms of Service. You probably haven't read them, and that wouldn't surprise me because nobody ever reads them. Especially when they are this long. But if you have intentions of buying subscribers, then you may want to read Permissions and Restrictions section 6, which states that you are not allowed to do the following: Cause or encourage any inaccurate measurements of genuine user engagement with the Service, including by paying people or providing them with incentives to increase a video's views, likes or dislikes, or to increase a channel's subscribers, or otherwise manipulate metrics. So it doesn't matter where you bought your subscribers from, and it doesn\u2019t matter how much they promise your subscribers are legitimate, and will genuinely watch your content. Ultimately, you have paid somebody to try and artificially grow your channel, and to manipulate YouTube's metrics, and that is against Terms of Service. And the buck stops there. YouTube are the gatekeepers, and if they find out what you've been doing, then your channel will most likely be suspended or terminated. ",

If your doing closer to $5 a day, then discovery will be the way to go since you\u2019ll be able to stretch your budget a little more that way. 4. After 7 days, pause all your ads and take a look at which one got you the most subscribers. As a secondary matric take a look at which audience watched the longest. Google Ads will tell you the percentage people watched your ad. The audience that watched the longest represents the most potential, even if they didn\u2019t subscribe as much. 5.

            "answer_text": "Do you have dreams of becoming the next big YouTube star? Or maybe you have a business that you want to promote to your target audience. Whatever your reason, this platform is an excellent way to engage with consumers and build your brand. YouTube is the 2nd most visited website globally, with over 1.9 billion people logging in every month. Due to the volume of people visiting the site, new channels are aggressively popping up across the platform. If you hope to make it big on YouTube, you have to get your first 1000 subscribers. Unfortunately, that climb from 0 to 1000 is the hardest part of the journey. We want to make it a little bit easier for business owners and soloprenuers trying to grow their first channel. We will provide some helpful tips that you can use to improve your subscriber count, engagement, and visibility. Choose a Schedule and NicheYour audience expects you to post relevant content consistently. If you\u2019re posting a travel vlog one day, a video game review the following day, and a cooking tutorial over the weekend, you\u2019re going to leave people feeling confused. Instead of knowing what to expect, they may decide to wait until one of your videos that appeals lands in their feed. When you consider that over 500 hours of content get uploaded to YouTube every minute, it\u2019s easy to see why consistency is essential. People seek out channels that post content that they want to see. The truth is, there are plenty of other channels that can offer specific content if you\u2019re not consistent. It all boils down to picking a niche and sticking with it. Find something you love and want to talk about if you\u2019re a solopreneur. Business owners can create videos about their products or industry. Speaking of staying consistent, you should try to keep a regular schedule. This will ensure that your subscribers will know when to check in for your latest posts. If you\u2019re able to build trust with your audience by delivering great content on time, they will become the foundation of your channel. ",

            "answer_text": "There are two methods you can use if you want to get YouTube subscribers: 1 - A \"natural\" way: setting up a YouTube channel, selecting a niche for your videos, creating a number of videos, promoting the videos and thereby achieving the target audience - subscribers. 2- An \"unnatural way\" - buying subscribers. If you choose the second way you have to invest just as you do with the first, however, it does provide you with a significant shortcut. I'm going to focus on buying subscribers in this answer because I have a lot of personal and professional experience with this method. A very popular way to promote a YouTube channel or YouTube videos is by using a promotional services provider, meaning a seller offering subscribers, views, likes or comments for sale. A lot of YouTubers (big and small) use these services. Case in point, buying subscribers give you a boost to success in the and save you the difficult start. The problem with buying subscribers is knowing you're getting your money's worth. What I mean is that some of these sellers are pretty much scammers, and this whole field is so unmoderated that people don't always realize what they're getting themselves into. In other cases, you can just look up reviews online, but in these cases, you'll find that most sellers write their own reviews about themselves, so these opinions aren't objective. Now, I'm not going to recommend a certain service because I can suggest a review website for you to look at if you're looking to get more YouTube subscribers. If you'll click on the link I just provided, you'll get to a website called Brands-Reviews which is basically a life saver in my field of business: this website reviews service providers in the promotional services realm and gives the most honest, through opinion, both on good aspects of every seller and on the bad, so no one is specifically targeted in any way.

In addition, not only will you be able to get real user subscribers, but you can also get two more like views and likes in the same package that saves you more money and time. It's really hard to compete on YouTube, especially when you're new and don't have any credibility with the brand of your video. You'd first need to create branding before you can expand your YouTube channel. Some of the easiest ways to do that are to get the subscribers, views and likes to your channel and some of your most-watched videos from actual people. This is a little boost method that you can use safely to grow your channel effectively and gain leverage over other competitors. This would only work to increase the visibility of your channel at first but in the end, you'd have to do some of the hacks that I'd share below; Use annotations: The notes on your videos are annotations on YouTube. By adopting some of the strategies here you can use them to help you maximize your audience;Call for action - Create something like a sticky note and encourage people to subscribe to your channel. Spotlight annotation - This will allow you to create a clickable annotation on your own video. It's going to help drive traffic to the landing or product page. Link to other videos - You can also use annotation to promote other related videos, whether they are yours or not. Properly planned out a good video to your channel: Here are some best plan for you;Keyword Research - You wouldn't get traffic, let alone high-quality traffic if you didn't do your research with the right keywords. The Google Keywords tool will show you exactly what's hot and has the highest volume and avoid long-tail keywords. Transcript - After the video has been recorded, grab the transcript and upload it to YouTube. This will give Google more context to help index it and give you an additional number of words to help people search. Social media engagement - Connect with the other social networks and post the video on Facebook, Twitter, and so on two or three times a week. The more you share, the more love you will get later on into your picture. Add featured channels: Through working with other content creators on YouTube you will increase your audience. This choice can be found on your YouTube channel page. Everything you have to do is click on the modules, other platforms, save any modifications you've made. Attach a channel or channels, and save them. Make sure the videos are picked in the same niche as yours and you think that your viewers will find it beneficial.So, it's best to stick to all other social indicators for actual users subscribers and never opted for bots or spam, no matter what.

            "answer_text": "Creating great content is important, yes, but it's not the only thing you should do. You have to make sure people can find you and your videos. And there are a couple of steps you can take for that:  Create relevant content. Find out what people are looking for, and make content about it. Right now, post match analyses of World Cup games are in high demand. Whenever a Game of Thrones episode airs, people are looking for reviews right after it. I once uploaded a video about a football coach that was just fired on a brand new (empty) channel. It got 7,000 views in only two days. Of course, you should always create content that you like to make, but if you can tie it to current affairs, that's always a win.Add value to your channel. Be sure to know what your channel is about and what people get out of subscribing you. I have a successful YouTube channel on which I give tips for starting YouTubers. If people watch my videos, they get some valuable info that they can use for their channels. And after watching that video, they want more tips, so they subscribe. If your videos are informative, inspirational or very entertaining, convince people that they can get more of that stuff if they subscribe to you.Work on your channel. Think up a nice title. Create a good banner. Get yourself a nice profile picture. Be sure to fill in the channel description. Include keywords in your channel settings (in the Video Manager). Create a good channel trailer. Use playlists for your content. In short: make your channel look appealing and inviting.Upload regularly. This is really important! Create new content on a regular basis. If people see that you haven't uploaded anything new for a long time, they won't subscribe to you. And people who have subscribed to you will forget why they did that in the first place.Make your subscriptions and likes public. This is very important for step 6. You can do this in your channel settings.Communicate with other YouTubers. You're not alone on that big website, even if it can feel that way when you've just started out. There are thousands of people who start out on YouTube every day. Get to know a couple of them. I've built a website called The YouTube ChannelCrawler, which lists thousands and thousands of YouTube channels. Not just the big ones, but especially the smaller ones. Look for interesting channels in the 0 to 250 subscriber range. Subscribe to them (they'll get an e-mail if you did step 5). Write nice comments on their videos. Support them. In short: be an active and loyal viewer to other YouTubers. A lot of them will appreciate that a lot and take a look at your channel as well. And those who don't and who never reply can be easily unsubscribed. Just keep in mind that you should never demand or expect people to subscribe you back. If you give your support to others, unconditionally and relentlessly, you will get the same support back.Hope this helps. Good luck, and post a link to your YouTube channel in a comment to this answer. I wouldn't mind taking a look at it :). ",

            "answer_text": "13 Ways To Increase Your YouTube Subscribers 1. Monitor \u201cattention score\u201d to measure good storytelling YouTube executive Bing Chen says, \u201cAnother thing that cannot be replaced is good storytelling. We really recommend you go into your dashboard and look at your attention score.\u201d What exactly is your attention score? This shows you the level of attention and the length of time people spend watching your videos. Here\u2019s what makes a great entertaining video: Five-second rule \u2013 A great entertaining video must grab people in the first five seconds. You can use questions or put yourself into an unusual situation. And don\u2019t forget the conflict. People have to get a feeling of suspense immediately.Storytelling \u2013 Bing Chen says this is essential. Learn the tricks of weaving a good story so that people will hang with you through the duration of the video. You can use gimmick or conflict to achieve that.Short \u2013 Entertaining videos can\u2019t be too long. Between one and three minutes is ideal. This is where looking at your attention score is critical. Where are people dropping off? Is that the upper reaches of attention span?Early attention score is low \u2013 Most of the traffic drops off early. People decide quickly whether they will learn what they want to learn from a video.Late attention score is high \u2013 Those who stay past the two or three minute mark will typically stay for the entire video.Steps \u2013 Great informative videos pull people along by giving them systematic steps to accomplish a particular task. In fact, people may tend to pause the video and write notes or actually perform the task. Think about how you would learn to fold a paper airplane or fix a sink.Length \u2013 It doesn\u2019t matter how long your informative video is as long as you are giving people the answers they need.2. Five steps to planning a good video Keyword research \u2013 You won\u2019t get traffic, let alone high-quality traffic, if you don\u2019t do your research with keywords. Google\u2019s keyword tool will show you what\u2019s hot and has the highest volume. Avoid the long-tail keywords.Transcript \u2013 After you\u2019ve recorded the video, grab the transcript and upload it to YouTube. This will give Google more context to help index it and give you an additional number of words to help people searching.Social Media Engagement \u2013 Work your social networks. Share the video two or three times a week on Facebook, Twitter and Google+ each. The more shares you can get, the more your video will rise in the rankings.Your Blog \u2013 After about a week, embed the video on your site. Then you can go through the process of sharing it again.Read More Wait 5 second skip ad open link ",

            "answer_text": "There is no way to 100% guarantee that you will get a lot of subscribers, but here are some tips to increase your odds. Make quality content. Spend time planning out your videos, don\u2019t just make a video for the sake of making a video. If your videos are interesting, people will want to watch them and subscribe.Have good lighting. If your videos look like they were filmed in a dark basement, people won\u2019t want to subscribe to you.Learn about Search Engine Optimization. I\u2019m still far from an expert in terms of SEO, but having a basic understanding about using key words and tags really helps you rank in YouTube search.Make eye-catching thumbnails. Thumbnails are very important because it\u2019s one of the first things people see. If you\u2019re thumbnail is awful, no one will click on your video and subscribe.Reply to comments. You want to create a community on your channel. If you respond to people who comment on your videos, they feel like they have a personal connection with you. They\u2019re more likely to stay and subscribe because you\u2019ve had a conversation with them.Comment on other people\u2019s channels. Find other channels that make similar content and comment something. Don\u2019t promote yourself, just try to establish a connection. They may read your comment and check out your channel and subscribe. This is also a great way to find people to collab with, which goes along with my next tip\u2026\u2026.Collab with people. Collaborations are a great way to grow your YouTube audience. Find people who are willing to collab with you and do it!Post consistently. People tend to subscribe to channels who post regularly. If you aren\u2019t putting out consistent content, your chances of growing on YouTube decrease substantially.Ask people to subscribe. It may sound simple, but asking people to subscribe can sometimes help grow your channel. While it\u2019s constantly on the mind of the video creator, it\u2019s not always on the mind of the viewer. Sometimes the viewer didn\u2019t even think about subscribing, but will if you ask them.I hope these tips help! Remember, it takes time to grow a channel. These tips will help you, but it won\u2019t make you a YouTube sensation over night. Have a great day! ",

            "answer_text": "Hi I've been following a lot of youtubers for a while now and saw a lot of their videos in which they shared how they grew their channel and so on,so basically almost all of them gave the same advice in different words which I would like to share with you ,hope it helps you. 1. Never work for the subscriber count and views : Yes you heard that right, if you're working mainly for the subscriber base, views,money ,fame etc. then this is just not meant for you because it takes time and patience to grow the channel and if someone tells you that they grew their channel overnight then they are simply lying through their teeth,so if you are not passionate about it and simply driven by the materialistic benefits then you won't be able to continue it for long and simply lose the motivation in between which can prove to be detrimental for the channel . 2. Have a great content : Great content means either entertain the crowd and there are a lot of ways to do it like by making vines or sketches, roasting ,reacting to other videos,vlogging,exploring haunted sites and so on or educate them by teaching a subject or creating a tutorial on how to do something etc and if you could develop your own niche which is eccentric then it can help you even more because creative disruptors have always grown faster than anyone else ,take example of the Indian youtube channel \u201cmake joke of\u201dwhich has amassed more than 2 million subscribers in a record time because it gave the audience something different in the form of animated cartoons. 3. Engage with your audience : If you want to build your subscriber base rapidly then build a rapport with your subscribers ,ask them what they would like to see in the next video or by replying to their comments etc. 4 . Consistency : This is the most clich\u00e9 amongst all the points but it is indeed the most important point. CASEY NEISTAT one of my favourite vloggers once said in a video that his friend ROMAN ATWOOD another big youtuber (prankster and now vlogger ) advised him three words as the secret sauce to grow on youtube and they were \u201cjust keep uploading\u201d(here's the link: 3 words got me 3 MILLION SUBSCRIBERS )and casey even did daily vlogging for 534 days which resulted in an exponential growth in his subscriber base and even if you look at the other big youtubers like pewdiepie ,markiplier or jacksepticeye, they all have uploaded more than three thousand videos which shows their amazing consistency level and that is also the secret of their success, if you have a great content and you supplement it with great consistency, the watch time of your videos shoots up and youtube suggests such videos more often and this was also one of the reasons how pewdiepie became the biggest youtuber. You can watch the video explained by the game theory below Game Theory: How PewDiePie Conquered YouTube 5. Smart marketing strategy : Now if you're not visible to others even though you're making a great content on a regular basis then all your hard work will go down the drain,so create a proper marketing strategy to promote yourself, apart from sharing the videos on various social media platforms ask your family members, close friends to share your video with their friends ,also use Google adwords, keyword planner to know the trend and popular topics and make interesting videos around those topics and keep doing that,the initial subscriber base is difficult to build but once you build a loyal audience then the growth becomes exponential,it's like a snowballing effect. 6. Do it only because you're passionate about it : if you love making videos then you'll definitely gain traction from people. I can recall a line which is written in the letter received by youtubers who achieve landmarks like 100 k and 1m subscribers which says 10 m is not far away either,remember the time when you had only few hundreds of subscribers and you wished to achieve 100 k or a million subscribers one day so have faith in your abilities and don\u2019t be in a lookout of shortcuts.

            "answer_text": "Marketing is the biggest thing. If you can afford the publicity then great, otherwise you can still do it but it will be slower. Here are some suggestions to get more subscribers on YouTube. Optimize your YouTube video for search engines  Make sure your YouTube video title includes the keywords your viewers will search for. Then, when you write a video description, make sure to include those keywords / phrases. Do not sacrifice flow or clarity for keyword density. Google rewarded for good content and punished keyword stuffing. Once your YouTube videos show more with search engines, they will also show up better to your viewers as they find your content easier. Each new viewer is a new potential subscriber! Use keywords in the title. This has a greater impact on SEO in the past, but it still has a big impact on the video. Google's crawlers do not view videos in the way they read blog posts, so placing keywords in the title will allow Google bots to know the content of your video. Add an end screen to promote your video, channel, or website End screens are interactive graphics that link to another video, playlist, channel or site, or prompts someone to subscribe to your channel. As the feature name suggests, you can only add a screen that ends in the last 20 seconds of the video, so you have to plan where the display ends. Collaborate with other YouTube users A great way to increase subscribers is by appearing on other YouTube Channels. Try to select channels whose subscribers might be interested in your video. The best way to do this is to become part of Google's dedicated community. Create a list of YouTubers and then contact each of them. Regularly post new content Consistency is always the key to any social network. Posting once and waiting for new subscribers or subscribers is simply not working. On the other hand, when you post regularly and continually add new content to your channel, you give users a reason to subscribe. ",

Nobody wants to watch and share your video when video content is tedious, of poor quality, and of poor audio. You have to make high quality video content, HD quality, clear sound, concise content full of ideas that you think your customers want to hear, not long.  Once your content is good, quality. Viewers will share and spread your video to thousands of other viewers, and the view will increase naturally. The second is posting videos regularly This will create a habit for your viewers to remember, so clearly schedule the playback and frequency of the video. No one wants to follow a channel that has posted a whole video for a whole year. Please follow this rule. Use Annotations Annotations are the little colorful sticky notes that people paste all over their videos once they've been uploaded to YouTube. Although this tool is often overused, and few strategically placed annotations can make a difference for your YouTube marketing efforts. And finally USING THE TOOLS TO INCREASE CHANNEL TURN REGISTER Want to make money on YouTube, need to invest, care for the channel, pull view, increase subscribe. However, to protect the channel you should choose the method of increasing sub secure. ",

I will share with you a number of ways that I think are most effective to get more YouTube subscribers, and not only are they the most effective, but they will also bring you to get a lot of subscribers in a quick and in the correct way. My recommendation is to combine all the ways to get as many subs as possible and as much success as possible on YouTube, but even if you adopt one tip you will see an improvement. So, let's start. My first tip is to do your own marketing. what do I mean? Very simply, market your YouTube channel. In today's network, it is very easy to market yourself, everyone has a profile in all kinds of social networks, and in every social network, everyone has a few dozens if not hundreds of friends/followers who follow him in a few social networks. Aside from social networks, there are a lot of blog and forums platforms and lots of sites where you can publish your YouTube channel easily and free. So, feel free to use all the platforms I mentioned, wherever possible Share and Tell that you have a YouTube channel, that will bring to your channel more subscribers! My second tip is to create connections on YouTube. comment on videos that belong to your niche, contact people who create videos in your niche, and by creating these relationships you will expose your channel to your targeted viewers that will be interesting to be your future subscribers. My last tip is to buy subscribers. Many people use this way today to promote their channel, it will give you the push to succeed and give you the possibility to get more and more subscribers if you are stuck. I used this way at the beginning when I opened my YouTube channel and it really helped me (You can read more about it at getfans blog - This article is exactly what you ask about - How to get more YouTube subs -https://getfans.io/blog/post/How_to_Get_More_YouTube_Subscribers_in_2018 Hope you will achieve you goal \u2666 ",

You can change the way they think, the way they walk, the way they talk. It changes.  Here are a few tips I have for you to grow your YouTube channel. Add Video AnnotationsAnnotations are a great way for your viewers to watch your other videos, to push your views across your channel. Learn more in our article, How to Use YouTube Annotations to Maximize Your Subscribers, View & Overall YouTube Success, and See Annotations in Action in the video below. We create a collection of viral video collections and use annotations to link all the unique videos together, to entice the audience to see not just one video, but all the videos in the collection. 2. Create an impressive trailer This video will automatically play when a new viewer has not subscribed to your channel. You should make a video that is short enough for viewers to watch the video and subscribe to it. Get great results if you generate traffic. 3. Length of video length For new content creators to start using YouTube, this is a golden rule and always remember to do it. When you start making videos, you can experiment with different length videos, and watch the audience respond to the appropriate adjustments. Often, videos that are rated well will not exceed 3 minutes in length. So the advice I want to send to you is make the video short, simple, informative, entertaining and under 5 minutes. 4.  And the most important thing is the content of the video. If the video content is attractive and quality then there is no need for tricks, you also have millions of sub channels. Content that works the best is content that is either entertaining or informative. The content that really works the best is content that is entertaining AND informative. This is pretty standard with any kind of content marketing, but in particular, videos that inform and entertain are usually the most successful. ",

            "answer_text": "I\u2019m going to copy- paste an answer I gave on someone else\u2019s similar question. Sorry to disappoint, friend, but there is no secret. Like every other job, it takes a lot of hard work and determination, more than most people think. YouTube is not a free ticket to success in any way, shape, form, or fashion, despite what some assume. YouTube is a place where you can make content for others to enjoy, it is a creative outlet, and that alone is what separates it from some other jobs.There are some ways you can grab people\u2019s attention. #1 Good Thumbnails- Yeah I get it, seems trivial right? Well, not really. To get people to subscribe they must be interested in the content you make, and before they get interested in your personality and see your video they must (obviously) watch your video. How do you grab said attention? Make good thumbnails, it will stir interest. #2 Good Title - Same psychology as the first one, make it look professional. #3 Good (honest) Promotion - DO NOT go on other people\u2019s channels and comment asking to subscribe, as a content creator myself, i block every single channel that does it\u2026 you come to my channel as a place to enjoy MY content, not promote your own. Make a twitter, tweet regularly. Make a Facebook, post regularly. Tell friends and family, seems weird\u2026 but family will be a good place of support sometimes. Reddit works for a good amount of YouTubers as well. #4 Network - Find channels as your own, and collaborate with them! Even if you\u2019re mainly solo it won\u2019t hurt! Maybe you\u2019ll find good friends and some of their subs will leak to you and vice-versa. #5 Be honest and creative - Easier said then done, I understand, but it\u2019s okay to do a similar video style, it\u2019s okay to have inspiration, but be sure to not copy other people. If you be original and do things your own way you will develop your own sense of style. #6 Be confident and persistent - This one is my personal toughie, spending a good amount of time on a video and it not getting the feedback you hoped for, keep pushing, unless you are EXTREMELY LUCKY you are not going to be successful overnight, work hard. Keep at it. Be confident in the content you provide, confidence and persistence breeds IMPROVEMENT. #7 Last, but certainly not least. WORK HARD - This one goes with number 6, but work as hard as you can, even if you\u2019re not a god at video-making right off the bat, upload it anyways. Put it out there and you eventually will breed your own sense of style. KEEP AT IT! Thanks for reading, I hope I helped! Cheers! :D ",

            "answer_text": "Use custom thumbnails for videos One way to make your channel look great is by adding custom thumbnails.  These images are used in place of the specific screenshot of your video. If you don't use a custom thumbnail, you may have poor and unedited photos. This looks even worse when the picture captures you while you talk. Upload continuously Your channel will grow much faster if you are consistent with uploading new and new content. Decide how many videos you want to upload every week and day and when you will upload new videos. Make sure that you set realistic goals that you can stick to, your viewers will be disappointed if you promise to upload a new video but rather than not uploading anything. The set schedule also makes it easy for your viewers to know when to expect new videos. Create attractive intro videos Keep people coming back by putting some effort into your video. Did you notice I didn't mention any technical details about lighting, sound and composition? This is because I suppose you should know it. The more you feel comfortable on the camera, the more people you register. It may take a while, but you can do it. Create content calendar YouTube subscribers are more likely to stay on YouTube subscriptions to upload videos on a regular & consistent basis instead of having less content and no new content uploaded in larger periods.  The best way to solve this problem is to create a content calendar for each month and notify the new uploaded and updated videos related to your external YouTube channel (End or last 10 seconds) of the videos upload your. This will create a feeling of anxiety among your audience and thus increase your chances of getting views and higher subscribers with each new upload. ",

            "answer_text": "No single way, but a number of steps you have to take each time you are making a video. I assume your goal is to earn money with YouTube. In this case, I would define five key characteristics that I noticed every successful YouTube channel has. The Message. Channel has to have a message that it wants to share. There should be a goal and a purpose to what you do and share there. Is your channel about photography? Your message might be that everybody can learn this following your easy tips. And your goal then might be to share your knowledge about photography, and also make it fun or present it in a aesthetically beautiful way. Are you making book reviews? Your message might be that not every book is worth reading or has some wisdom, intrinsic value to it. Your goal would be to review new or upcoming books and tell what fascinated you, what you learned, how it made your life better or how much fun you had.The Creed. That is a whole system of your believes. This is what makes you different or similar to brands. It takes a lot of work, but all big YouTube channels have their creed and, thus, brands. They become brands. And brands unite people around them and create communities (followers, zealots).The Tone. One day you are funny and gregarious, the other day you are nerdy or cheeky, and the other day you are depressed and gloomy. Unless you are doing a personal V-log, that\u2019s not what people would like to see. Unless that\u2019s is your character and people know that well, it\u2019s unlinkely too work. They want to know what to expect of you. Look at Peter McKinnon - always positive, lighthearted, playful. Or at Sean Tucker - serious, deep and thoughtful. And Thomas Heaton - kind, sincere and sometimes gawky. All three are photographers (and YouTubers) with distinct characters and tone.High quality. Of videos and the content. Gone are the days when you could just record a game that you play or a reviews of some product with free software or on your phone or an old camera. Shaky footage, bad lighting, resolution of less than 720p - avoid them! Content is the king, however. Do your research. What people need and want, and what there already is. How can you satisfy them in your own way? Great content always beats mediocre or even bad quality. If you create great content (what people want in a way that people like) in great quality - you will achieve success.Consistency. Of your message. In your upload frequency, in the tone and in the quality of videos. People stick to channels which content they can predict to some degree. Information should be new, but the structure of each and every video and of your channel should be the same.However, if you are not doing YouTube for money, then your passion will make you wanted on its own. It may time more time, but eventually your contagious interest will engage audiences and they will follow you despite other imperfections. And the money will come with them. P.S. Remember: Content>everything else. ",

            "answer_text": " Create an interesting trailer These trailers need to be short (30-60 seconds), attractive and most importantly they should give your visitors a reason to stay. Do they have to be funny, beautiful and emotional? It will definitely help you! What I really can not emphasize is the need for an effective call to action that gives the viewer a reason to sign up. Not only is the trailer of perfect length, it has to provoke emotional impulses, comedy and end up with a creative call to action. Name your video according to the strategy One of the hardest things is to name your video. You have a name in your head, but it can be something complicated or too long. My rule is to stay current and use YouTube's auto-complete feature to name your video. There is nothing wrong with your video having the same name or something that is close to the popular video, as long as the video is relevant. Registering is easy. It always amazes me when I go to a website and I have a lot of difficulty in learning how to sign up. Add a link to the top of the page, the footer, the sidebar of the site, at the bottom of the blog post, in the functionality bar, in the middle of the blog post, in the author profile, as a popup, under welcome bar, etc. (You do not have to do all of them, but make at least 4 different places and check which page is receiving the most registrations.) Add a dedicated page to sign up. Use your call-to-action Make sure you not only make a call to action to visit your website.  Instead, start by asking viewers to share videos only. You do not want to look too hard on the stock, but a simple request can make a big difference. Ask your users to share and build trust in your community. As you start to see your subscriber base grow, it's time to ask them to look at other content. If you've followed our first tip, you should have a steady video stream to introduce viewers. Proposing those videos will allow you to build views and total watch time, which can improve your search rankings in YouTube. Reply to your video comments Thank you for your positive feedback. Engage them politely and professionally. And, if you post a video on YouTube and want your comments tailored to a particular topic area, go ahead and self-talk by asking your own question in the comments section. The more you engage viewers in your comments and in your videos, the more powerful your YouTube channel community, as more and more people will start sharing and spreading your content. Awesome community is the key to growing your YouTube channel and attracting more subscribers. ",

People love to see the personal face and life of the channels they sign up for. That is one of the ways to be successful. Trying to find a good balance between what you want and what they want, my channel has a major problem when I start looking at the viewer's request for content. Share with your friends Share with your friends what you are working on and ask for a subscription if they are interested. Remember, do not keep bothering friends; They do not have to do anything. Get out on other social media platforms with some personal connections and let them know about your commitments. Ask them to like and sign up (if they are interested). Diversity is the spice of life I believe filming in many different locations can lead to more interest.  I understand that there may be no or you may have a set, but try to change a background or even use a green screen. Diversity is the spice of life to mix it with your wallpaper and place. Focus on your first 30 seconds Impressions in the first few seconds of video are essential. Businesses checking their ad content need to focus on gaining more points. Although many pre-roll video ads are geared toward getting users to view the entire ad before watching the content, there are still many ads with a minimum of five seconds of watch time. Grab the user's attention with an index or something to make them laugh - anything to keep them. Know what your target audience is looking for Analytics is always a reliable way to evaluate all your marketing efforts, to gather and make informed changes to your decisions. If you look at your search query data from YouTube, you'll see what viewers usually enter before clicking on your video.

Although quite often they watch videos just for fun, quite a lot of people want to watch videos in order to find a solution to their problems, rather than reading articles.

It does not need to belong but it has to be concise and descriptive.Keyword: These are words that related to your video. People will be able to easily find your videos if you add appropriate keywords.Now after you upload your videos, the next step is to gain as much exposure as possible.

If you want to know how to promote your YouTube channel, you need to be able to write compelling, interesting titles for each of your videos.  Write a descriptive title, attracting attention and attraction. Prioritize keywords in the first half of the title to provide clear insight on the video topic. But also try to share your enthusiasm for problems at hand. Your title limit is about 70 characters long. Google will cut anything longer than this in search results. Launch a video campaign  It is time to start setting up your ad. After logging in to AdWords, click on the red + CAMPAIGN and a menu will drop down where you can select the video option. Choose a name for the Campaign and then select True View format. The type of video ad you choose should be based on your marketing goals, so think deeply about your plan before continuing! The best time to post It all depends on the geographic location for your audience The most accurate time for your business will be unique to your personal business, regardless of what data says. You will want to check this yourself to see when your audience is really online. For example, if you target working professionals, they will have hours very different from those of college students until 3 am. Start a blog for your YouTube channel I recommend creating a blog with WordPress and using a WordPress-specific theme for videos. It's better for you when using Managed WordPress Hosting so you don't have to worry about blog maintenance. Open up about your life  If you want or have been a public figure, you should also be ready to take your life out there, not all, but probably most. Start a vlogging channel. Start a daily / weekly / monthly vlogging channel and update fans about your life. Or at least, regularly update your Snapchat. Put your heart on it. They are very addictive, getting lots of views, can get many new subscribers from it. ",

Some channels perform every day of the week, so five videos per week. I don't recommend going any further, but no matter which schedule you choose, you want to stick to it, make sure it's on the banner so people can see it, and most importantly, talk. About it in your video. Share useful and valuable information You don't have to create long videos to share information, for example, with an explanation video, you can get a lot of information in less than 60 seconds. Make sure your content follows this golden rule to make your audience trust so that when they encounter a problem they can solve, they will come to you. Advertise your YouTube videos on other social channels  One of the great things about social media is that you can cross-promote content across different channels. Advertising your YouTube videos on your other social channels is the easiest way to increase your audience. Which channel are you on? Facebook, Linkedin, Instagram, Pinterest? There are many words to choose from. And if you have a channel (such as Facebook) that you want to post live video to, you can always make a full-length video teaser on YouTube for you to have the best interaction on all. channels. Reply to your video comment The more you engage viewers in comments, as in your videos, the stronger your YouTube channel community will become, as more and more people will start sharing and spreading your content. A great community is the key to developing your YouTube channel and getting more subscribers. If you post a YouTube video and want your comments to be adjusted to a specific topic, go ahead and make the conversation yourself by asking your own questions in the comments section. Create Trailer for new viewers You can have a video trailer on your YouTube channel for unregistered visitors (yet). Your channel trailer is like a movie trailer, where you can display the highlights of the channels you offer so that viewers want to subscribe to your YouTube channel. ",

Tips to get more Youtube likes/subscribers: Create a script for your videosFirstly, you may need to plan what your channel is going to be all about, who is your target audience, what is your audience preferences, what your audience would like to see and etc. Then you have to write your script based your understanding towards audience needs and wants. Scripts help you yo organize your videos efficiently and keeping you on track. By sticking to a script, you\u2019ll be able to stay on track without veering off to an unrelated topic. This script will also ensure a perfect flow of events resulting in a well-focused video. You should include as many details as possible into your video script such as the exact words you are going to say, the actions you will be taking in the video, the main points you need to stress and any necessary calls to action (click on this link, subscribe to my channel, etc.) Increase your uploading frequency/ConsistentYouTube subscribers usually do not like channels that don\u2019t produce regular content.Upload your videos in a timely, recurring, and structured trend. Try to publish one video per week or at least one or two per month and stick to your schedule. Do not upload videos off of the schedule as this will hurt your reputation. Consistency helps you stay engaged as a viewer. Title optimizationBeing outstanding is the most important aspect of YouTube success.One great way to do this is to give your videos offbeat names. You will be getting a lot of people coming to your channel based on curiosity by doing so. You may use the keyword in the title to get more reach. Google Adwords is a good tool to help you identify what people are searching for on the web. Make sure that your title not too long and do not use the word \u201cvideo\u201d in the title.

If you\u2019ve got one, make sure you do it. You may add yout website/blog URL to your channel under the channel settings. You may also consider adding your website/blog URL in the channel description itself. You may add a \u2018Subscribe\u2019 button somewhere on your blog to drive more subscribers to your YouTube channel as well. Limit the videos time frameKeep your video short, simple, informative, entertaining, and under 5 minutes. For content creators who are getting started, this is the golden number as average length of most YouTube videos was around 4.4 minutes. Once you have a good following, you can experiment with video length and see what your audience\u2019s reaction is. Use Intro and OutroYouTube intro and outro helps in branding and make your video more entertaining. Having an intro and outro will serve your brand and offer your video a sense of professionalism.

            "answer_text": "Knowing how to increase your YouTube subscribers is the secret to getting more views, therefore more money. If you can increase your subscribers, you will start to get the domino effect, which is where people see your channel has a lot of subscribers, so they sign up just because of that. If you have no subscribers, people will assume your channel is not very interesting since nobody is liking it - let's change that right now.  The Fastest Way To Increase Your YouTube Subscribers OK so, no one really wants to bother with strategies that require a whole lot of money or time, so here are some simple strategies you can implement immediately to increase your YouTube subscriber list exponentially. Just remember that if your videos are lacking- nothing will get you more subscribers unless they are super funny! 1. Interact With Your Audience. If you want to increase your YouTube subscribers, you have to be real. Sure, Rihanna has millions of views on her videos and she doesn't interact... Or does she? You listen to her music while you are in the shower - that counts as interacting. Seriously though, if you aren't providing music or some other form of passive entertainment, you need to interact with your audience. If you want to increase your YouTube subscribers on your channel and you do product reviews, information videos or tutorials, you need to help people through the comments, have a Facebook account set up and other ways to allow people to get in touch with you. This might seem like a lot of work at the start but it will pay off and you will begin to increase your YouTube subscribers. 2. Use Social Media. Using social media to increase your YouTube subscribers doesn't mean that you sit on Facebook all day and chat with your friends. It means things like submitting your videos to StumbleUpon, Digg, Reddit and Delicious. These places will bring real traffic to your site, but you need to take the time to give them the right keywords, put them in the right section and actually create accounts to start off with. Once you have the accounts set up it is easy to bookmark each video and increase your YouTube subscribers. 3. Annotate Your Videos. When somebody is watching a video, they can easily forget to subscribe even though they may love your stuff. Increase your YouTube subscribers add a call to action or CPA by annotating your videos and remind them to subscribe, comment or otherwise persuade them to join up. Also remember that annotations can be incredibly annoying and a lot of people close them, so a good strategy can be to have it pop up near the end, or just briefly pop up for a few seconds throughout the video. If it runs through the whole video your comment section will be full of people hating you! 4. Target Your Videos Properly. Write a great headline that people will actually want to search for. Chances are 1 in a million that you will produce something that just \"goes viral\", so you have to work hard to find out what words people will type into YouTuber Google to find your video. If you are writing a video about how to plumb up a toilet, you could title your video \"How To Plumb Up A Toilet - By A Registered Plumber\". Your headline is the first thing people will see, as well as the image you place beside it. You want to make sure that your headline and image (post thumbnail) say exactly what the video will be about, and you definitely want an image that is HD. This is the simplest way to increase your YouTube subscribers but often overlooked. 5. Hijack Other Video Traffic. It is your duty to jump onto competitors videos and hijack their thread! Well, not quite so brutally as that, however if you found a video that said \"How To Rip Out An Old Toilet\", you could add a comment to the thread that hints to your video-note that you're taking a chance with this one; it could be well received by the community or you could get booted off. If done correctly though, this could be a very fast way to increase your YouTube subscribers and can help out other viewers at the same time. 6. Ask Questions. Ask questions at the end of your video and get your viewers interested and curious. Encourage them to comment. This is a great way to increase your YouTube subscribers without any extra time spent after creating the video. Trying to get subscribers without communicating with them is like trying to get a loan without going to the bank and asking for one. You could ask users what struggles they are having in the niche you are targeting, what subjects they would like to see you tackle and what questions they have. 7. Post Video Responses To Other Videos. Using our example before about plumbing, if you see a video about how to install a toilet in a brand new house, you could do a video about fixing broken toilets. Try to think about the most common problems that people will have with toilets (or another niche) by talking to real people. Go on some forums in your niche and see what people are struggling with, this is the real way to increase your YouTube subscribers. If you can hone in on their needs, this is what they will type into the search engines and your video will come out on top if it is the best and most targeted. Increasing YouTube Subscribers Is Easy When You Know How To Do It Learning how to increase your YouTube subscribers is like learning anything else - commit to learning and then implement. There are no doubt plenty of ways to increase your YouTube subscribers, but some ways will work better for different niches. Depending on the niche you are attempting to target, you may have to try a combination of several things, however, don't try to do too many strategies all at once. Take the time to think about what skills you have and where your time is best spent. If you are a slow typer, it may be better to hire somebody else to post comments on other threads of competitors. One thing to always remember when trying to increase your YouTube subscribers is that if your videos are great, people will tell their friends about them and you will increase your YouTube subscribers with very little effort. This is the ideal situation for you. Some things to remember are to always record in HD, keyword and title your videos appropriately, be a bit of a character, be an expert (or learn just a little more than the average journeyman) and try to make people enjoy watching the video. If you can do this you will increase your YouTube subscribers a lot faster than your competitors with poor videos. Are You Losing Money trying to Get Leads for your business?

If you are not active on social media, refer to part B. The first step is to link all your social media. Linking is a powerful tool. Put up the link to you your YouTube channel on all these platforms. Instagram does have a website section in Bio where you can put up links. Then come facebook, Twitter and quora (I know it is not exactly a social media platform, but does the work).The second and the most important step is to pester everyone you know\u2026 like even your acquaintances, the girl who pulled your ear in the kindergarten, the classmate who stole your pencil during lunch time in the third grade or someone who hated you in college. Just anyone. Ask your family relatives, they would have no escape. Text them to like, subscribe and na na na. Don't ask them to share. It'll just repel them. (And they might end up not even liking or subscribing let alone be sharing.) Cuz why would they? What are you going to do if they sit and share those links. So share share and share. This will give you the initial hundreds followers.Now you have the starting hundreds followers, how to reach the thousand mark? That's tricky and whenever you Google or Quora, people are going to tell you to add the appropriate title to your YouTube video or to add tags so that you rank higher than your competitors. Which one does exactly work? I don't know man. I am trying to find the answer. If you are reading this, please like and subscribe my channel.

First, your YouTube content needs to be recommended or searched for by YouTube users. If you are featured or viewed by many users then the chances of you getting more YouTube subscribers is high.Second, your YouTube content must be valuable to users. You can either create a content in the entertainment or educational niche, but you need to put it in some work in your content. The video must be something that users want.The next question would be, what is the connection of the two (2) in getting more YouTube subscribers? As mentioned above, your content needs to be searched by users. This gives them the opportunity to watch your YouTube video. And now that you have their attention, and now that they are watching your YouTube video, you simply need them to keep watching. This is when you need quality content. If have quality content, and it is what users are searching for, they will surely stay. Or termed, audience retention. Learning SEO can help your YouTube video be found by YouTube users or Google. You can also search answers in Quora, that will relate to this topic. And in producing quality content, in general you will need clarity thought in the presentation of the content, good video and sound quality, and camera presence (if you decide to show your face). Therefore, if your quality YouTube video will be searched by many users, and generates high audience retention, then it will produce more YouTube subscribers to your channel. That\u2019s it, I hope my answer is helpful. Good Luck in getting more YouTube subscribers. ",
