            "answer_text": "Raspbian is a 32 bit OS and liable to stay that way. The main benefit of a 64 bit OS is addressing more than 4GB RAM and the Pi 4 caps out at 4GB. You then need to take into account the Raspberry Pi Foundation\u2019s mission of providing a cheap computer that school children can develop IT skills on. I repeat the target audience for the Raspberry Pi is schoolchildren and it makes sense for them to direct support at the 25 million + Raspberry Pi computers already sold (most of which are 32bit) than to split their resources to provide 32 and 64 bit Raspbian versions ",

You only need to type the below command in your Raspberry Pi\u2019s terminal to determine whether your Raspberry Pi Operating System is a 32 or 64 bit. getconf LONG_BIT I tried it on my Raspberry Pi 4 B and from the snapshot below it is evident that it is a 32 bit OS. See this screenshot below;  Hope this helps. ",
