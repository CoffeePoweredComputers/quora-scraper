            "answer_text": "NO, that's VERY BAD for your battery.. always keep the battery between 20%-80% (ideally never below 40%, but definitely never below 20%, and never above 80%).. unplug it when it reaches 80% . If you plan to store the phone away, keep the battery at 50%. That's why when you buy a brand new phone, notice the battery is always usually charged to around 50% (more or less) so it doesn't wear out the battery during long term storage and shipment. If you keep it between 20%-80% and unplug the charger at 80%, you can make your phone battery last 200% longer (or maybe even more) and last many more years.. this is confirmed by studies and tests. Otherwise if you don't, you'll experience degrading batteries within 6\u201312 months and beyond. It's not bad to charge it to 100% exactly but when you keep it above 80% for too long, the battery cells degrade over time.. so if you charge it to 100%, you must use the battery right away and not leave it like that for too long.. but it's better to just charge it to 80% and unplug it. I believe Apple's iOS 13 already has a special feature which helps reduce the battery from degrading from this issue.. it will learn your charging habits over time so when you plug the charger into your phone at night, it will only charge to 80%.. then 30 minutes before you wake up and use the phone, it will top it off to 100%. I guess it's better than nothing. Does this actually work, charging the battery only to 80%? From my experience, yes.. my 2013 Samsung laptop (the series 7, 15.6\u2033) has a special feature built in where it will ONLY charge the battery to 80% max and will not allow the battery to be charged any further than that (whether if the laptop was turned on or off during charging). Fast forward to 2020 (7 years later), the battery feels EXACTLY the same as it did in 2013.. no battery wear at all from my experience. Compare that to some of my flagship Android phones and my Samsung Smart Watch of which I charged to 100% every single day for 3 years or more.. the battery stops holding a charge that well and is noticably much weaker, resulting in me having to replace the battery on those phones (and my Samsung Smart Watch) with an aftermarket battery. So from now on, I use an Android app called AccuBattery which has an alert notification feature to remind me to unplug the charger when it reaches 80%.. this will make the battery last much longer and I won't have to replace the battery and go through the trouble of opening the phone to do that. I don't think Samsung has that feature anymore on their newer model laptops\u2026 probably because they DON'T want people to keep their laptop forever like I am right now.. they realize if they kept that feature on there, people would never ever buy a new laptop ever again or go to Samsung and pay them to replace the battery... go figure, they went for the money. So yes, I've tested this theory myself and it's true.. the battery degrades significantly when I charged it to 100% every single day for 1.5 years. The battery will also degrade from HEAT.. so try to keep the temperatures low as much as possible and don't do too much heavy processing on the phone which will stress out the battery. For some reason, this mostly applies to mid-range and high end flagship phones more so than budget low end phones for some reason (probably because the CPU of the budget phone is so weak and slow, it doesn't strain the battery as much). I suppose Android manufacturers could've included the feature to stop the battery from charging past 80%, but why would they want people to keep their phones forever? Obviously they don't want that. If you hack/root your phone, you can install a 3rd party app that will stop the battery from charging past 80%\u2026 otherwise, just download AccuBattery and have the alarm notification to remind you to unplug it at 80%.

            "answer_text": "Hello Reverand, Lithium Ion batteries are far less demanding than their Nickle Cadmium predecessors. Unlike their older sibling they prefer to be charged often, do not benefit from being fully depleted and when charged should be charged to full capacity. The long and short of it is that regardless of any good behavior on your part or due diligence it is not really going to extend the batteries calculated life cycle by anything that is actually noticable. You can practice good conservation on a daily basis to lengthen it's life between charging by putting apps that you do not use frequently, to sleep rather than having little used apps running constantly in the background. Clean and empty cache files stored in apps that are frequently used to free up memory. It will prevent longer processing time and lagging responses. Making the overall performance snappier. Perform reboot every other day to clean and refresh your phones system. Everything that you have done while interacting with your phone leaves crumbs of data and information that are swept clean after a reboot. You can also assign a time for an auto reboot so you won't have to do it manually. You can find the steps needed for all the suggestions above by just doing a web search. If you can extend the time between essential charging on a daily basis, you are in fact increasing your batteries life in a sense. When in fact you really aren't. You are being concience of it's finite limititations and will simply do what you can to impede the rate of it being spent. I know for certain that if 2 people were given the same device, depending on the individuals general habits one device will last longer than the other. It is for the reason that one of the two regardless of the details, drained their device more times than the other. Requiring more charging per day. Both batteries had the same life limit, one was just spent much faster. I apologise for rambling on. I am no expert but this is the way my brain picks things apart when I am not paying attention. These things I write about are not concious actions determined by me. And the conclusions I reach I am often not fully aware of until I write them down, the little sneak. So I hope some of this helps. If you find any of it confusing or incorrect please let me know and I will pass it on. Thanks for reading and have a pleasant evening! ",
