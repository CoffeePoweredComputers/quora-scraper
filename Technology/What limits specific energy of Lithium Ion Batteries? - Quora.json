            "answer_text": "Disclaimer: I am just a normal first year student in the field of energy storage. Specific energy = Watthours/massunit. If you ask about energy density, then it has a completely different range of answers. Specific energy is relative, as it cannot be very high unless we bring in other materials into a energy storage and conversion device/setup.  And also here energy is not inherent to lithium like coal/gas, here it refers to how much energy it can store/deliver per mass unit. So, to deliver or store energy it needs other materials in it's setup like electrolytes, current collectors, pouches, additives and finally electrodes to hold the lithium ions in both energy states.   All these materials are likely to have higher density than lithium and does not provide anything directly to specific energy. So, the specific gravity of other materials relative to lithium, used in Lithium ion batteries  limits the specific energy density of Lithium ion systems. And above statement is true only for a new battery or rated specific energy. For an old battery along with above reason, many factors like brittle electrodes, defected electrolytes, parasitic reactions, slow/high cycle rate can be limiting factors. Please tell me if my answer has any flaws. It will help me. ",

            "answer_text": "As you may have noticed as you looked up Li-ion batteries that there are at least 6 major chemistries in the Li-ion family.  Each chemistry has a general range for specific-energy and other performances differences to its cousins. It would be a lengthy discussion to try to explain each chemistry's limitations.  Very basically, the greater the number of Li-ions that you can transfer from one electrode to the other, then the higher the specific-energy for that chemistry.  Each chemistry will have different levels of available ions to move back-n-forth between the electrodes.  Sometimes, it's the density of the material, sometimes it's the molecular structure of that particular chemistry, sometimes it's the electrochemistry of the cell like electrolytes and separator material. Now, the speed of transfer relates to its power capability, such as W/kg or W/liter; which is also a function of its internal impedance. The colder the cells, the lower the capacity or specific-energy, as well. If I'm not in the ball park in answering your question, then please ask for more specifics. ",
