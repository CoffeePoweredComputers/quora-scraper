            "answer_text": "What does \u201cbeing a mathematician\u201d mean to you? Teaching three classes of college algebra per semester as an adjunct faculty at a liberal arts college,Doing operations research at a civil engineering firm,Applying machine learning algorithms for a hedge fund\u2026.Those are pretty realistic careers for someone with a PhD in math. \u201c\u2026my family can't afford to risk the cost of education for anything other than a secure career path.\u201d So don\u2019t take their money. You\u2019re going to have bad semesters. That\u2019s perfectly normal and expected. One way to make them a hell of a lot worse is putting even more pressure on yourself to not waste your family\u2019s money. If you\u2019re good enough to have a university pay to you to get an undergrad degree, that\u2019s a pretty good indication that you\u2019re talented enough to make some kind of living at mathematics. If you\u2019re not quite that good, then get a job, do the community college thing, and start getting that good. As to salaries and such, if you\u2019re in the US the Bureau of Labor statistics has all kinds of good stuff. Here\u2019s a link to get you started: U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics Median pay for a mathematician in 2015 is >$111k/yr. Job outlook is \u201cmuch faster than average\u201d growth. Be sure to also check out operations research analysts (lower pay but even more growth) and actuaries (in-between salary, less growth). Good luck! ",

This means that you have to be either \u201cthe fastest of them all\u201d which is quite difficult, or research such fields that no one (or almost nobody) knows of. This, however, can lead to other people rejecting your results as insignificant or uninteresting. If, however, you are capable of attaining graduate courses, being an undergraduate, you almost surely have some skill. If you work not so fast, consult your supervising professor so that they guide your work in such a way that you\u2019ll be able to publish your results. Hope, that helps. ",
