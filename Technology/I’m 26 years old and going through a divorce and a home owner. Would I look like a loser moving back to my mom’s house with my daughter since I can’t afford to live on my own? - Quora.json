            "answer_text": "No. You need help, if your mom lets you move in, that\u2019s a good thing. Just make sure you don\u2019t \u2018expect\u2019 your mom to babysit, or cook for you or your child. Your mom is not a maid either. Clean up after yourself and your baby immediately after you\u2026.whatever it is. Pay rent, give her something. I\u2019m not saying pay half the mortgage, but if you plan on being there\u2026 she may not accept the cash but offer it to her anyway. If she won\u2019t take it, buy her stuff. Good stuff. She still has bills to pay. Expect to pay for and go get your (and your childs) own food. I knew a man some 15 years ago. he was 50ish then. He had moved himself and his two kids into his mom and step dad\u2019s house when the kids were about 3 and 4. He is still there. He pays for nothing. He would say he was going to the store and his mom would say \u201cyou need any money?\u201d, he would go to her a get money. His mom went to work every day and he would sit on his ass and watch tv all day and all night. He would play his music loud and not wash a dish. He didn\u2019t make his kids take out the trash or lift a finger in that house.( he didn\u2019t, why should they) I dated him for 2 months. Wait we didn\u2019t go anywhere or do anything. Anything. I went to work and came to his mom and dads. He wouldn\u2019t even walk two houses to my house. That is a loser. the kids are grown now. I hope they dont still live there, but if they do, I would not blame them. Rent is expensive. Roommates are hard I imagine, but if you could find a guy with a child your child\u2019s age - and same gender so they could share a bedroom, maybe - and you go half on rent and utilities.

            "answer_text": "Absolutely not, you\u2019ll look like a good father who prioritizes his daughter having a stable home over his own pride. These are hard times, and family is meant to be there for us when we need them. You are FAR from the only person who finds themselves unexpectedly back with their family after hard times. I know, because I did too. And I\u2019m 35, and have no kids, so if you\u2019re a loser, I don\u2019t want to know what I am. I moved back after my own divorce, lay-off and the death of my best friend and roommate. I needed a safe haven. You should make sure that YOU aren\u2019t the one calling yourself \u201closer.\u201d It\u2019s important for your daughter not to see you down on yourself, and also to understand that being an adult means sometimes things aren\u2019t how we want or expected them to be, but we can still find our way through. One way you can make yourself feel better, while also providing a good example for your daughter, is by making sure you contribute to the household in whatever way you can, whether monetarily or with helping your mother around the house. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if your mother was happy to have her son and grand-daughter living in the house, especially if she also gets some help with cleaning, cooking, or whatever else. Try to look at this as a potentially healing, mutually beneficial situation for all of you, instead of seeing it as some sort of personal failure. As simple as that sounds, I\u2019ve found that sometimes a small shift in perspective can really change how you feel about something. Wishing you and your family the best. You\u2019ll get through this together. - Stacey ",
