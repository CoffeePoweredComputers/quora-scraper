            "answer_text": "This question does not have a simple answer. Ancient Egypt was not one and the same domain throughout its long history, and neither was Ancient Greece. You will see people quick to assert that Pelasgians, Cycladians and Minoans were not Greek and thus their timelines should not be considered, but the Old and New Egyptian Kingdoms were not one and the same civilisation either. We consider them as such by convention, but this is akin to saying that the modern British are the same peoples as the pre-Celtic (!) hunter gatherers living in Britain 3,000 years ago. Isn't that absurd? Perhaps the most objective way to look at this is to state the dates during which the first deciphered writings in each language have been discovered. Writings in Egyptian hieroglyphics date from 2,800BC. Writings in Greek Linear B date from 1,450BC. Writings in Minoan hieroglyphics date from 2,100BC. In both cases there are older writings and marking that have not been deciphered and thus fall in the domain of prehistory. For example, the Dispilio tablet found in modern Kastoria, Greece, has been dated to 5,202BC. ",

            "answer_text": "Define your terms. The region we know as Egypt today was occupied 40,000 years ago. Greece was occupied 270,000 years ago. Historical Egypt began with the pre-Dynastic Era ~6000 BCE. The First Dynasty began after the unification of upper and lower Egypt by King Menes around 3150 BCE. That was the beginning of the pyramid-building era, the standardization of hieroglyphic writing, and all the things we learned about in grade school. The first recognizable Greek civilization there was around 5,200 years ago in the Cyclades. The Minoan, Mycenaean, and related groups flourished until around 1200 BCE, the so-called Late Bronze Age Collapse. The Dark Ages lasted until around 760 BCE, after which mainland Greece revived and Greece entered what we call the Greek Renaissance or the Classical Period today. So pick the dates you think apply to your question and do the math. ",
