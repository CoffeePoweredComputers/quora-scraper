SAP BW, is the Business Warehouse portion of the SAP suite of tools. What is it used for?  Well, I quoted relevant portions from the SAP help site SAP Business Warehouse, but it appears to be software that allows you to more easily manage the large amounts of data that is used by a large business. There you go.  You've now got some basic info, and you've got a link to the SAP website where you can learn even more if you choose. Does that better prepare you for the job position you were thinking of accepting that requires you to know this software already? ",

            "answer_text": "Expecting you a fresher in to SAP BW space. I try to explain you in simple terms.  SAP BW is an enterprise datawarehousing tool. The data stored in all the Software systems in your organization over the years can be collected into one single Datawarehouse and then you can create reports over the data for reporting purposes. Also you can aggregate data from different systems into SAP BW and show the data in a single report.  eg: You have your Sales System designed using SAP saves sales data into SAP ECC and you have your Customer Data collected and saved in a IBM DB2 DB. You load your Sales Information from SAP ECC and Customer information from DB2 Database and create a report saying Customers from which location/age groups/gender etc are more interested in your products. So using SAP BW you can maintain a Single Version of the Truth in your organization for helping decision makers in taking their decisions. Hope this helps you. ",
