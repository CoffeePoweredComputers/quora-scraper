            "answer_text": "Thanks for the a2a. There are two possible places you could be looking at: health informatics or information technology support & management for clinical facilities or labs. The former is mostly building software for clinics and labs to use, and collecting and evaluating the large amounts of healthcare data captured (Premier in Charlotte, NC, does this). In these organizations, there are two possible roles; programmer or business analyst.  If you want to be a programmer, start with some online courses on Coursera, Udacity, Khan Academy, etc. If you like the work, get into a bootcamp (typically a program of intensive coursework for somewhere in the neighborhood of two months). The bootcamp should have a strong reputation and placement rate. You will be easy to place because of your nursing degree, and even moreso if you have actual nursing experience. If you don't like programming, business analysis could be a good fit. As a BA, you research problems and environments and conceptually design requirements for the software to be built. Join the IIBA (The Professional Association dedicated to promoting the business analysis profession worldwide - IIBA), and again, take some online classes, and network, network, network. Again, you nursing background will be huge. If you want to do IT work like helping people work with computers or figuring out why two systems aren't talk to each other, that can happen quickly in a clinic like the one(s) you have worked in. Again, your experience is relevant. The work might not fascinate. A+ isn't going to hurt, but it costs a few thousand dollars, and I'm not sure it's worth that much. You can just buy a couple of books and an inexpensive computer or two, and try the exam, but even that will cost money. Having A+ won't get you a job, and not having it won't prevent you from getting a job, but it doesn't hurt ",

            "answer_text": "The way to do a career transition like what you want to do is to network extensively. I'd suggest following this approach:  Define what you mean by \"IT field\".  It's a broad field, and includes everything from customer support at large enterprise companies to back office development work at a hedge fund, and everything in between.  Right now your question is far, far too broad for anyone to give you any more useful advice than that.  Ultimately you want to have a goal such as \"I want to work as a front-end developer for a Series A startup\" or \"I want to maintain .NET code at a bank\" etc. before anyone can give you any guidance as to how to get there.Which brings us to the next point: meet people who work in various areas of IT (as broadly defined as possible) and speak to them about their jobs.  Ask them concrete but open-ended questions, such as: \"How did you get you job?\"  \"What skills and background do you look for in a successful hire?\"  \"What programming languages do you think are most important for someone in your position to know well?\"The more you learn about various roles within technology the more you can focus on the area which most interests you.  Then you can define your goal and acquire the skills necessary to get hired to do that thing.I don't know what compTIA A+ certification is, but most of the people I know who work in technology think certifications are generally useless.  Good luck. ",
