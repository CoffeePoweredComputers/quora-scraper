            "answer_text": "Often it takes decades for a forest to return to something resembling its previous condition, but it can take much less time to become healthy again. But the amount of time will vary tremendously, depending upon the type of forest, topography, weather, climate and changes in climate, and burn intensity. Different forests have different natural fire and growth or plant succession cycles. Ponderosa forests typically host frequent, low-intensity, low-burning fires that clean out underbrush but kill few trees. However, if fuels accumulate for too long and a fire breaks out during hot, dry, windy conditions, the fire could be much more intense. And many higher-altitude forests are naturally subject to much less frequent, but far more severe, stand replacement fires that burn huge areas. It is perfectly natural for burned forests to go through cycles of plant succession after a burn, with grasses and smaller plants getting more of a chance to grow after a fire. It is also healthy for forests to have moderate intensity fires come through, removing excess underbrush and allowing for grassy meadows and more open areas to provide a mix of habitats for wildlife. In areas with a natural, healthy fire regime, fires will often burn at mostly moderate intensity, depending upon burning conditions. Fires will skip some areas of forest entirely, burn grasses and some shrubs in others, and burn trees in only a few areas. This results in a mosaic burn pattern, with different areas getting different amounts of burn. And this can actually help forest health. But, if you get a place where natural fires haven't occurred or have been suppressed too much, fuels can build up to dangerous levels. Drought or extended warm, dry weather can make the fuels especially ignitable. Add in steep terrain and windy weather, and you have a recipe for disaster. Under such conditions, large areas of the fire can burn at extreme intensity, cooking or sterilizing the soil. Even worse, subsequent rains without intact watershed to absorb them can turn into destructive floods that roar down slopes unimpeded, washing away soils that took thousands of years to accumulate. Now, the forest exposed to such destructive conditions could take much, much longer to recover, and may require human assistance with flood control, re-seeding , and other help if the recovery is to be visible within human lifetimes. It's even possible, especially if climate change is occurring, that permanent type conversion could occur, with burnt forests turning into shrublands or grasslands. By contrast, in a healthy forest with a stable regime of natural fire, the typical mosaic burn pattern will return nutrients to the soil, and the soil will hold moisture long enough for plants to use it. Grasses and tree seedlings may begin to pop up within days to weeks, with wildlife moving back in short order. Healthy ponderosa and other forests with similar fire regimes might be back in business within weeks to months of a moderate fire, and look much as they did before the fire within a few years. But forests hit by unfortunate circumstances of climate, drought, mismanagement, bad luck, and weather, could be damaged for generations of human lives. ",

            "answer_text": "Starts recovering immediately. Even on the largest intense fire there will be pockets of unburned or less intensely burned trees and plants. The surviving trees will dispense seeds. Some trees are serotinous, meaning fire opens the cones to release the seeds. The most common one in the western US is lodgepole pine (except the lodgepole variant of the Sierra Nevada mountains in California are not serotinous \u2014 a curious oddity). But most trees are not serotinous. They release seeds every year, and after a fire the seeds fall on clear ground and start regenerating. Several brush and shrub species have large root balls underground and will start sprouting immediately. Others have a tough fibrous coating on the seeds (example: ceanothus spp) and the fire will scarify the coating and enable it to break dormancy and start growing. Wind brings in seeds. Even animals will bring in seeds in their scat. Insects fly and crawl back. In a moderate to high intensity fire, the soil nitrogen may be gone \u2014 volatized by the fire and went up in the smoke. So post-fire soils may be nitrogen deficient. The first colonizers are often nitrogen fixers, taking nitrogen from the air and putting it into the soil. Any surviving soil fungi and bacteria will quickly repopulate a burned area. Wildlife will move back in. The following Spring, land managers will get aerial photographs or satellite imagery of the burned area. Damaged and stressed soil and vegetation has a different pattern of EM frequencies than healthy actively growing plants, especially in the Near Infra-Red band. The imagery will show exactly which areas burned and which didn\u2019t, even in remote backcountry where field crews have difficulty accessing and mapping. ",
