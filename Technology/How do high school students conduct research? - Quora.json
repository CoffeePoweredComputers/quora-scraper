            "answer_text": "Many high school students think that only the smart and brilliant students can do research or students who have some innate skill that allows them to do it. But, this isn\u2019t the case. Follow these three steps to be on your way to conduct research as a high school student: (1) take initiative, (2) find a mentor, and (3) be self-confident and self-driven.  #1 Take initiative. The initial phase is everything you do before the actual research starts. You usually have to take initiative to initiate this phase. This is one of the hardest places in research; it can make or break the success of your research. There are typically two cases for what you do during the initial phase of your research: The first case is when you are part of a research program. If you get accepted into a research program, then your initial phase is relatively simple. Your mentor is most likely going to give you a large stack of literature, other research papers in the topic you are researching in, so that you can get an adequate amount of background information. This is relatively simple because your mentor is doing a lot of your job for you. The second case is if you are doing your research yourself. The number one thing you will be doing is Google-ing. Since you don\u2019t have a mentor, you will be the one finding background information on your topic. One of the obstacles you may encounter is that research papers are expensive. Yes, you have to pay to buy research papers to read them. You might deal with this by using your school\u2019s computers, since most schools pay for Google Scholar or some other scholarly website, which you give you free access to research papers. When you are finding background information yourself, you begin to get a better grasp of the topic you are looking into. This will most likely be the period of time where you come across your research motivation (why are you doing this?). Also, this may be the most optimal time to start emailing professors inquiring about mentorship (covered in #2). If you feel like you can\u2019t get past the initial phase, try applying to research programs (see below).  #2 Find a mentor. Most, if not all, high school students have a mentor that helps them in their research. Even the brightest students have mentors because they understand that they cannot do research by themselves. Research is notorious for being hard, and it is hard. So, try to find a mentor. How? (More information here) Research programs for high school students. There are many, many different research programs for high school students, local and internationally. You just have to look for them. These programs allow you to skip the step of finding a professor and will usually pair you up with a mentor, who will define and help you along with the research. However, many programs also do allow you define your own project with a mentor and work collaboratively with him/her. From personal experience, I went to a research program (UCSC SIP), since I had no clue what I wanted to research in. I ended up working on a project with a mentor for ten weeks, where the mentor gave guidance, but I put in majority of the work. Research programs are really good at introducing you to research, especially if you think you aren\u2019t ready. Connections. Having someone to vouch for your ability to do research and excel academically is always a good thing. Check with your teachers. They might be friends with local professors and can slip in a word for you. Referrals will always stand better than sole inquiries. Taking classes at a nearby college. This will allow you to show the professor your skill in their class, making it a lot easier for him/her to convince himself/herself that you are a suitable student to do research with. Just try contacting professors. Many professors will say that they do not have an open lab, but there are always exceptions. Write a good email that takes into account the expertise of the professor. You can read more about writing a good email here. But, in general: Show your current knowledge and what you have found out about the topic you are interested inShow that you are capable of doing research and are academically rigorous or another relevant qualityAny headway/questions you have made on the topic that interested you inBe nice, be respectful. The professor will be doing you a favor if he/she accepts you. He/she is not obligated to accept you. #3 Be self-confident and self-driven. As I said before, research is not easy. Most high school students are not familiar or comfortable with doing something that is so intellectually challenging in this way. Therefore, you have to be able to build up your self-confidence and be able to believe in yourself that you can do it. Additionally, research is not an overnight job. Research takes an enormous amount of time and effort. This is one of the reasons why high school students are not usually given the opportunity to do research, having to prove themselves worthy. Especially if you are doing research during the school year, your workload will be doubled and forget about sleeping at 11 PM everyday. From personal experience, I worked on my research project for ten weeks, putting in approximately 20 hours a week over the summer. This amounts to at least 200 hours of research. And when it came time to write a research paper, it took me just as much time to write the paper. This is why drive is such an important aspect to a high school student\u2019s disposition. Persistence is going to noted by professors and mentors in prospective research applicants: a student who can work hard by themselves and a student who can accept failure and overcome it.  In conclusion, high school research isn\u2019t easy. And it doesn\u2019t get easier when you do it alone. Take initiative in what you are doing. Do a lot of background research and see where your knowledge currently stands. Apply to research programs or email professors. You can then get help from a professional, who does this full-time. Finally, believe in yourself and persist. Doing research is an amazing experience and you are truly blessed if you get the opportunity to do it as a high school student. You just need to believe that you can do it and persist through it. Research isn\u2019t done once you are done. Research is something that is forever changing and lasts forever. It\u2019s not a sprint; it\u2019s a marathon. Either you stay in front of it or it\u2019s going to leave you behind. Hope this helps.

            "answer_text": "If high school students are asked to do some research, I presume, it will be very a simple research project using very simple methodology. Topic of research in a History syllabus: For instance, in a history syllabus for instance on the topic about the founder or pioneers of the cities in which the students live in, a research assignment may be set for the class to conduct research. They can be taught how to conduct a simple research project which is aimed at verifying some interesting information about the city\u2019s forefathers. These may include information regarding where they originally came from, educational levels attained, their professions or occupations, their family\u2019s history, and other factual information. Why conduct research: The class will be first be explained what a research is all about and why they need to conduct research. There may have been recent doubts raised about the published reports of the background of these earlier settlers. So basically this class research project is aimed at collecting more empirical evidence to verify the truth of the written historical reports of the city\u2019s early settlers and pioneers. Research procedure and simple methodology: The class can be divided into different groups, with one group being given the responsibility to gather some first-hand information through interviewing some of the city\u2019s senior citizens or the descendants of the earlier settlers, where these sources of information are accessible. Another group may be sent to collect some second-hand information from newspaper reports or published articles of these people in old newspapers available from sources such as the achieves of the local newspapers or that of the regional or State library, or information kept in the achieve of local government. The students will be taught how these information (data) can be collected using for instance, interviews and literature search. These information (data) are then analysed by the teacher together with the class to derive the findings of the research, which may go to some extent to test the veracity of the published historical reports. These are then written up as the research\u2019s findings. Hence, this may be a simple example of teaching how high school students can conduct research in a History syllabus. ",
