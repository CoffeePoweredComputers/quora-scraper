            "answer_text": "I am a diagnosed narcissist. And i would like to help you, answering your question. But I do not understand the part where you ask 'do you think all judgement is fair' I believe nobody in the world thinks ALL judgment is fair. So please clearify your question. I think I understand what you mean with All the judgement now. Sometimes hard to interpret in other languages.  So here is my 5 cents.  Do you think all the judgement is fair?  Of course not. A lot of judgement is based on old wives tales, misconceptions, personal experience and layman talk. I read stories of, mostly women as mostly men are narcs, that have suffered terrible abuse by someone that has not even been diagnosed a narcissist, never saw a psychiatrist even. Still his behavior is contributed to narcissism. Now, I do not deny the behavior the person describes in such case is narcissistic, but the question is if that is the cause of the problem. Maybe the person has a primary other disorder like antisocial or borderline. Narcissism tends to have a big co morbidity rate, and often people suffering from other PD's have narcissism too. Then someone not specialized can never tell what behavior causes what. I also think that people tend to forget that narcissists are not born. They are made. They are nurturing mistakes. Narcissists are raised and narcissistic already by the age of five. They can't help it, and what is often said, but not at all realized, they do not know it. So they don't realize, they are not aware. That automatically means that all their narcissistic behavior is unintentional. They do not deliberately have low empathy. They do not deliberately \"use\" people. They are not deliberately, and certainly not voluntarily 'monsters'. In stead of looking at narcissists as predatory monsters all the time, i think \"WE\" deserve to be looked at as victims every now and then too.  Do you think that narcissism controls your life?  Yes. Even now I am aware and working on getting control over my own decisions and conscience, it still controls my mind and way of thinking. Maybe even more then it did before. I was quite okay thinking everybody else was in the cage, and i was the one outside. Even if it got me into trouble occasionally. It was quite okay feeling confident about my self in stead of knowing I am actually very insecure about my self. And most of all, it was quite nice knowing things for sure, and not questioning every single thought, every action, having to analyze it on it being a result of logical reasoning and true emotions or narcissistic self defense mechanisms. Being sure I love my son, in stead of having to ask my self if I am actual capable of truly doing so. It really really sucks. When did you first realize you were a narcissist? I was diagnosed in 2012. I had some suspicion earlier that year when my test for autism failed to make me autistic. We had come so far that is was either something in the autistic spectrum or something in the B cluster. And if it would be something in the B cluster, I was pretty sure it would be narcissism as i fitted most of those symptoms and the first line psychologist had almost concluded that after 20 minutes all ready when i started the process. So 1 and 1 makes 2 very fast. He was a very experienced man, about to retire. ",

            "answer_text": "Narcissism is inherent to humans. The idea of self. Having an identity, or wanting to create one for ourselves. It's only natural that we possess a healthy amount of narcissism in us.  Problem is, we view it as a vice. Much like selfishness. Anything done too much is bad. At the end, these are values too. And values can't be good or bad. They are more complex than that! Values hold true only when applied in correct contexts.  Narcissism is in a way a manifestation of integrity. One should be absolutely sure of one's beliefs to even think of sticking to them so firmly. Now, it is a different thing that it can be harmful to others if misused. But that's true of anything else in the world. Even honesty!  In today's world, the idea of narcissism has evolved into something different. When our views keep changing with new information (we live in an era of information overload) we may not be able to stick to most of our own beliefs. They keep changing with time. Here, narcissism manifests itself as an openness and willingness to change. I feel that is a good thing.  Of course there is a flip side to all this. But I am only going to focus on the bright spots here :) ",
