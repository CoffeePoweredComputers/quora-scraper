            "answer_text": "If you had a \"sixth sense\" what would it be? When my twin brother was in Afghanistan, I had a thought pop into my head of fiberglass on a Humvee splintering like someone was smashing it with a hammer. Around that time, my brother had been sleeping on top of a Humvee when he was woken up by machine gun bullets just missing him and hitting the Humvee he was on. I really can\u2019t say for sure it was a sixth sense, as it could have been a coincidence, but I have had a few very odd things happen like that before. ",
