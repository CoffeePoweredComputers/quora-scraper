            "answer_text": "Time Warner Cable -- their customer service and pricing models are horrendous and they have a captive and restrictive market by playing politics to capture our community's franchise for cable services.   This appears to be changing as more cable-independent access to content appears in the marketplace.  It appears that Telco twisted-pair copper gives way to cable coaxial, that gives way to fiber, and soon to over-the-air Wi-Fi using old broadcast frequencies. Unfortunately, there will be politically-driven monopolistic or duopolistic markets where the customer comes second to the politicians and the keepers of the gateways. They will avoid real competition, but competing on chaos -- and ever-changing m\u00e9lange of tariffed programs, packages, add-ons, and other political trickery. ",
