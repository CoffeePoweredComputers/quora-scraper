            "answer_text": "I think the iPhone 12 lineup is super good and I was personally very excited for it to be launched. I know it will be super good in performance and gaming and optimisation but the price does give a hiccup. iPhones are usually bought by some people- some just want Apple logo, some want the ecosystem, some want the cameras, some want performance. But the average person who doesn't has that much disposable income cannot buy an iPhone just for 'iPhone'. The pricing is a $100 more than than last year's phones. But let's wait for tech reviewers on YouTube to get the phone. ",
