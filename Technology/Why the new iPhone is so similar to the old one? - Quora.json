            "answer_text": "Thanks for the A2A. It depends what you mean by \u201cthe same.\u201d They look pretty much the same. I just got my iPhone 12 and I am setting it up exactly like my iPhone X. So my iPhone 12 will look pretty much exactly like my iPhone X. But that\u2019s where the similarity ends. The iPhone 12 has a faster chip and better camera. It also supports Apple\u2019s new MagSafe chargers and has a new ceramic shield to help keep the screen from cracking when dropped. It also supports 5G and has a host of other internal hardware improvements, including better battery life. ",

The truth is there are substantial changes in every single new iPhone model released. And regardless of whether you know (or care) about those substantial changes or not, they do exist. ",
