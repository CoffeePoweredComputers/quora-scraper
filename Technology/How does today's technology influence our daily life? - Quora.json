Credit goes to Ecommerse and Information Technology. They not only made our life so simple and comfortable but also created employment opportunities to many. We are getting almost everything may it be food, information, medicines etc to our door step with a few clicks on our smartphone. This smartphone has become one Allauddin Lamp for us. As coin has always the other side technology can make our life painful too. Pardon my statement it's not technology that can make harm to us but it's man who handles it in an improper way will create disasters. It's purely in our hands to outweigh it's negatives and enjoy it's benefits. Thanks!!!! ",

            "answer_text": "Decision-making is a skill based on need and practice. Technology comes across as making things easier, but they\u2019re second-guessing, taking away the need and ability to think, and to make our own decisions, to be autonomous. It\u2019s insidious, and sheeple are being sucked in because they don\u2019t see it. Technology should be about improving health and safety to a certain extent, not about removing autonomy to the level it\u2019s come to. It\u2019s taking things out of our conscious control; where this is leads is not good. Driving is a skill of judgment of speed, distance, and necessary reaction time. A recent serious accident involving a self-driving vehicle is an example of impending problems with \u2018technology\u2019. ",
