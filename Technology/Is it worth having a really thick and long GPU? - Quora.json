            "answer_text": "Sometimes, yes. A thick GPU is normally a powerful GPU, so the thickness is worth it for the performance. The thickness of the card is the cooler, and higher performance requires a larger cooler. This is true with any computer component, mainly the CPU. If your GPU is 2\u20133 slots thick, and you need those other two slots, you could consider watercooling so that the card becomes thinner, but that is only if you know what you are doing. The GPU is normally long because there is a blower style fan that cannot be located on top of the board, so it is located on the end of the board so that the heat sink can go on top of the board. If your case, motherboard, or clearance between components will not let you have that card, then you should upgrade to a supported card. ",

            "answer_text": "It depends on your use case,but considering the guy who a2a this question has also previously asked me to a2a questions in the realm of gaming,i'll assume this is a question focused on gaming. For gaming,bigger,i.e. one more pcie slot bigger,not by length,would only sometimes give the benefit of overclocking,but for those kinds of insanity,you might as well just go custom loop,save a slot or two and get nore stuff in the mobo connected. So....no. bigger is not always better. It wastes a extra pcie slot,but you do get slightly lower temps. Longer,on the other hand,would sometimes be a annoyance as well,as some cases don't support long gpus,but most of the time,longer most likely means a slightly modified card,maybe one or two more power smoothing thingys that escape my memory as of now and maybe extra pcie power pins,i.e.instead of just 6 pin,maybe 6+2 pin. Or maybe it comes with a cooler stuck to the side of the card,like amd's newest gpu,the r9 480. So...for length,more of a case issue. ",
