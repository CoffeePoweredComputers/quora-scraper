            "answer_text": "Apple and Cheap don't belong together. If you think of an used MacBook, you'll probably have to upgrade RAM, probably get a new battery, and be patient when the old CPU lags with video editing. Besides, there are both good Apple Macs and good Windows PC. You haven't given any good reason to choose one over the other. I bet most your friends own iPads and Macs... Also, it doesn't make any sense getting a laptop if you're homeschooling, you might have some luck convincing your dad on getting the less overpriced Apple Mac: the Mini. (I can't be productive with a laptop unless I plug one or more monitors, a mouse and keyboard). Another tip: Back up all data of your old laptop, and install Linux Mint. Reinstalling Windows will also improve things a bit. ",

            "answer_text": "Sometimes Best Buy has really good deals in their refurbished section. Also, check your local Best Buy for any \u201copen box\u201d deals they currently have in store. I\u2019ve found some pretty good deals. Granted, it\u2019s not going to be \u201ccheap\u201d but it can save you a couple hundred dollars easily. I got my Macbook used off of Ebay; a 2011 macbook pro for about $700. But, it wasn\u2019t disclosed that the USB ports don\u2019t work, and the screen hinge is a bit lose. I also had to replace the motherboard in it. So, I mean, I would\u2019ve rather paid the extra $400 to get a brand new laptop. I had to pay more than that in parts to fix the motherboard anyways. So, it can be kind of a gamble getting used gear online. ",
