            "answer_text": "Some of the software quality metrics: Generally, quality of the AI software can be explained by some of the following attributes: Functionality Does the model/software satisfy the stated needs? Reliability How often does the software/model fail? What is the error rate? Usability How easily the software can be used/integrated/understood? Efficiency How good is the performance of the software? Maintenance How easy it is to repair the software? Portability/integration How easy it is to transport/integrate the software/solution with existing/new systems?  Qualitative metrics can be characterised as metrics that consider certain facets of the program governing the human behaviour. In simple words, such metrics will help to measure the ease and extent of interaction between a human behaviour and the program. These metrics are as follows: Coverage metric Coverage metrics help identify areas of a program not exercised by a set of test cases. Granularity metric These are metrics that measure the size of the description of components that make up the system. Systems of small components are called fine grained, systems of large components are called coarse-grained (fewer, larger components). Correctness metric The correctness of the system/program is asserted when it is said that the program is correct/aligned with the specifications. Simpler put, functional correctness refers to input-output behaviour of the program. Robustness metric Robust metric is dynamic, is when a small change in program behaviour results in correspondingly small change in value. It is pretty difficult though to quantify what is a small change. Friendliness metric Simply means that the program is easy to understand and use. These are some of the metrics that could be used to evaluate quality of AI program in terms of human behaviour towards the AI program and interaction of the two.  Always validate One of the key principles to test the quality of the AI or not AI solutions/products is to always try and validate. Test the solution with different data sets, see how performance, speed, quality varies. What are, say, error rates of deep learning model, how quick it can learn and how much data it requires to arrive at your desirable level? How accurately segmented and what quality of data would it take, for example, for a neural network to train itself for an error rate to be below 5%? Investigate that. Test the solution (if possible) with some of the customers, ask their feedback, what does not work, what is very off. How applicable are the insights/end product is within the organisation? Consult with technologists that understand the space well and make sure they are impressed to the point of wanting to pay for this solution. Look across the team, it\u2019s not only the product that makes a startup great, it\u2019s also people building the product. This also applies not only for AI startups More importantly even, look into the market, across time, how did the market that the company is targeting looked like, looks now and may look in the future. Is there a strong pull from the market to get the product running and how this AI solution fits into the market? Look across competition how many competitors failed in building the product alike? Try to find out what were the reasons for such bad dynamics and try benchmarking the product in question. Do this honestly and as sceptically as possible, it will help to get a good reality check. Hope this helps! ",

            "answer_text": "I would look for a company that writes all their own algorithms rather than just using TensorFlow to solve a problem. There's nothing wrong with using existing libraries, but if you're claiming your core value as a company is AI then you should have some of your own AI algorithms behind that. ",
