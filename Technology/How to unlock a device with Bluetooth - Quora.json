            "answer_text": "Depending on what device you are trying to unlock, you can set this up. If you are trying to unlock an Android device, first pair your Bluetooth headset or whatever device you want to use to unlock your android device. Go into Settings > Security > Smart Lock (This may vary depending on your android device: on my Samsung S10+ it is under Settings > Lock Screen > Smart Lock. This feature is available on all android devices with android 5.0 and later so look for it). Once in, go to Trusted Devices and choose the device you want to use. As long as the Bluetooth device is connected, your android device will not require a password to be unlocked. Similarly, if you want to unlock your Windows PC or laptop, then go into Settings (Win+I) > Accounts > Sign-in Options and turn on Dynamic Lock. ",
