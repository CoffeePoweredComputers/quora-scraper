Digital technology has changed what people term as \u201cmedia.\u201d The influence of new technology on media is apparent since a media company isn\u2019t necessarily a news platform anymore. A media company is now any company that helps pass information across the globe, including social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter. The amount of active web users globally is now near 3.2 billion people. That is almost half of the world\u2019s population. Every day, two million smartphones are sold around the world, and the amount of information we share shared on social media networks is phenomenal.  Social media isn\u2019t the only big statement digital technology has made. Neither is social media the only way technology has had an impact in everyone\u2019s life. Before mobile technology, you had to search through a dictionary to understand the meaning of a word. Now you can look words up in a dictionary app or quickly search the Internet. Beyond words, you can search for practically anything on the Internet using search engines like Google and Bing. There is no denying that the future of technology will continue to revolutionize our lives. In a few years, driverless cars may be the norm for everyone, and robots will be commonplace in factories.
