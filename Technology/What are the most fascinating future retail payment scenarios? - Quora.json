            "answer_text": "I work for a cloud-based point of sale company. It is incredible watching new payment technologies unfold. Like near field communication (NFC) and check-in platforms like \"PayPal Now\" and \"pay with Square.\" The most fascinating (and likely) future for retail payments is going to be a user check-in system. Instead of carrying a wallet and handing over credit cards, we'll just carry smartphones (which will only get smarter) notify of our intent to purchase with a payment app.  You can do this already. Watch and learn (and laugh):     I think this scenario is most likely as it requires no additional hardware purchases for retailers. It's entirely web-based. Yes, it requires the consumer to upgrade their \"personal hardware\" - but that is happening anyway.  In the future we might not even have to talk to anyone, if we don't want to. We'll just walk into a shop. Check into our preferred payment app. Pick up the item we'd like to purchase. Scan it with our smartphone and walk out. Transaction completed. A salesperson will be able to monitor the purchase through a point of sale terminal, as protection against theft.  I'd love to hear other prognostications, though. :) ",
