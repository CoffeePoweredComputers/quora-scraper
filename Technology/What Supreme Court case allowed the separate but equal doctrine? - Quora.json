            "answer_text": "Original Question: What Supreme Court case allowed the separate but equal doctrine? I believe it came out of the Due Process Clause of the 14th Amendment. Or more accurately a means of skirting it. No state shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any state deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; (Equal Protection Clause) nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws. The Supreme Court of the United States case that legitimized it was in 1896. Plessy v. Ferguson, 163 U.S. 537, was a landmark decision of the U.S. Supreme Court that upheld the constitutionality of racial segregation laws for public facilities as long as the segregated facilities were equal in quality \u2013 a doctrine that came to be known as \"separate but equal\". Then of course in the 1954 Brown v Board of Education of Topeka, 347 U.S. 483 decision, \u201cseperate but equal was found to not be equal,\u201d or anywhere close. ",
