            "answer_text": "Unless you qualify as a low income individual, a free phone and free monthly access does not exist in today's expensive world. If you want a device and you want to use it routinely, be prepared to pay for it. One will not just magically appear on your doorstep with a greeting card from an anonymous donor who feels like spending good will because you asked for a luxury that you cannot afford to pay for yourself. If you truly are low income and are on the dole, you have already been given information about government subsidized phone programs when you signed up for your other benefits. I briefly looked at your previous answers and noticed you have neglected to fill out a Quora member profile so we can get to know you better. this is the hallmark of a \u201ctroll\u201d. Questions that have no real substance and no real benefit to the community are a distraction to questions that have substance and a real quality to them are answered most graciously and I for one go to length to research a quality response that not only helps the person asking the question, but might start some dialog on the subject as needed. Fill out your profile. Document your experience. Ask repentant questions that are not self-serving and appear to be \u201clooking or a hand-out\u201d. ",

            "answer_text": "There are government subsisized phones that may be had depending upon your income level. They are called \u201cObama\u201d phones though the program was started under George Bush. The limit is one to a user and involves filing an aplication either in person with a vendor or \u201con line\u201d. User must be low income,on food stamps, or public assistance and must provide either a letter from his/her case worker and proof of income. A letter will be sent either confirming the validity of the application or it will be denied. The wait time between application and response is 30 to 60 days. The phones provided will be either entry level smart phones or used units with 300 plus minutes per month. There are so many providers and more enter due to it being \u201ceasy money\u201d so look around before commiting. Why do you see so many street dwellers with cell phones? Now you know why. ",
