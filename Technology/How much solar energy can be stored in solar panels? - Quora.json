            "answer_text": "Let me bring some conceptual clarity. Solar panels work on the principle of photo-electric effect to generate electricity. It merely is a medium for generation of electricity. If this electricity needs to be stored for later use then one needs to add a battery setup to their solar power system. The solar panels don\u2019t store energy, that\u2019s the battery\u2019s purpose. How much power storage though ? Well, that depends on the user/owner\u2019s system capacity. Generally, the higher the system capacity to generate, the higher the battery storage capacity is required. Industry standard sizes of panels and battery helps make the decision of the consumer easy. I hope I could bring some clarity and perspective with this answer. To know more about solar, visit ZunRoof ",

Just the smallest effort at searching (solar panel; PV; solar thermal,solar storage) and a little reading articles on something like Wikipedia obviate questions like these, of which there are so many on Quora as to make me worry that either a) many folks don\u2019t know the first thing about how to research or learn about anything independently even with the Internet available (many of us learned this and other stuff before there was an Internet), b) bots post most of the questions, or the likely answer c) the internet fosters laziness.
