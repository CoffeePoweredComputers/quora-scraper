            "answer_text": "Energy Efficiency is defined as the maximum operating efficiency obtainable by the equipment without reducing its output.Each and every product designed has a design efficiency and inherent losses (since nothing in this world is 100% efficient). Each equipment has to be operated close to the design ratings for attaining maximum operating efficiency.The Energy Efficiency gap in any equipment mainly occurs because of these reasons:1. Equipment with low design efficiency (Ex: 2 star ACs instead of 5 star ACs)2. Poor operating practices (Ex: Setting the ACs at 16 degC even though 24 decC is comfortable3. lack of proper maintenance and fine tuning (Ex: the filters of ACs are choked with dust and dirt) The main reasons for inefficiencies are because of1. Lack of awareness about the efficiency levels of the products2. lack of proper maintenance (when is the last time we serviced our equipment?)3. Improper operating practices (lack of knowledge) These barriers can be overcome by educating the consumers in the areas of energy efficiency and that is the main objective of BEE Star Rating for appliances by Govt. of India which has been quite successful. In case I haven't answered your question yet, please post a comment with slightly more specific question and I will try to address that. ",
