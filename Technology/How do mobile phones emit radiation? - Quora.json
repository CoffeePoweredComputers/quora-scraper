            "answer_text": "Well, they\u2019d BETTER, or they wouldn\u2019t be of much use. Here\u2019s the problem: people are so frightened by that word \u201cradiation\u201d that no one stops to think about just what it means. \u201cRadiation\u201d simply means the transmission of energy through space or some medium; it covers heat, light, radio waves, TV signals, and pretty much any case where energy is getting from here to there without physical contact or motion (and even there, if you want to consider sound as \u201cacoustic radiation,\u201d things get muddy). Not all \u201cradiation\u201d is at all dangerous, and with those forms that can be dangerous, it is (as is the case with so many things) the dose that makes all the difference. \u201cDangerous\u201d radiation in this context generally means ionizing radiation - those forms, like X-rays and gamma rays, that are energetic enough to break chemical bonds and strip the electrons off atoms (\u201cionizing\u201d them, hence the name). This is the sort of radiation that, if you get enough of it, causes radiation sickness, cancer, and a whole host of nasty things. But the vast majority of things we class as \u201cradiation\u201d are NOT of this type. Ordinary radio waves, for example. Visible light. Infrared \u201clight\u201d (the sort we most commonly associate with heat). And so forth. Cell phones, in particular, emit the following sorts of \u201cradiation:: Light. Ordinary ol\u2019 light, coming from the screen, and obviously not a LOT of that (take a phone out in the sunlight, and you can barely read it - because sunlight is orders of magnitude more intense than the maximum light the screen can produce).Heat. The phone warms up as you use it, because the electronics dissipate power. This results in the radiation of infrared light (and below), but again, it\u2019s just not that much. (And unless you think IR light can cause any health issues, it\u2019s nothing to worry about. If you DO think IR causes health issues, then you\u2019ve got a LOT more to worry about than your cell phone). And finally:Radio waves. Obviously, the phone is communicating with the cell system, with Bluetooth devices, with Wi-Fi networks - and all of this happens using radio waves. These are of even lower frequencies (longer wavelengths), and so lower energies, than either the infrared or visible light output, and so these are also non-ionizing, low-power, and nothing to worry about.So yes, cell phones radiate. But no, it\u2019s not any sort of \u201cbad radiation.\u201d ",

            "answer_text": "Radio waves, the radios they use to communicate with the cell towers, are a form of radiation. As is visible light, the infra-red emitted from a stove, microwaves in your cooker, WiFi, broadcast TV and radio, and a lot more. The more energetic the radiation (the higher the frequency), the more dangerous it is. The radios used by cellphones are very low energy. Apart from anything else, the batteries that power them do not have enough power to emit anything harmful effects for more than a minute or two. Worries about harmful radiation from cellphones are pure superstition. There have been large scale studies, and no damage has been found. ",
