            "answer_text": "Hi, I\u2019m assuming that you are at-least in your pre-final year for graduation in order to apply for internships, because upto 3rd year you have covered some of the important topics of ME like SOM, Thermo, Fluid etc. Speaking the truth, if you want to carry out internships in big companies like Maruti, TATA Motors, Mahindra etc. then you should have some sort of contact (or source). Ask the person in the industry and he can set you for 1 month internship without any hassle. Else you can try sending your resume to them but I believe it\u2019s not gonna work most of the time. You can also try your luck in some \u201cnot so big\u201d automobile ancillary industries where you can join as intern with ease. Search out for them and directly mail their HR your resume, as not much competition is there you can be easily called. For example..try some companies in Gurgaon which manufactures maruti\u2019s steerings etc. I wish you all the best for your future. ",
