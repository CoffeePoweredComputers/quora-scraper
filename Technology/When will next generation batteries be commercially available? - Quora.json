            "answer_text": "The problem is two-fold.  Currently, the price to produce these cells reliably is extremely high relative to the increase in performance characteristics.  One of two things must happen before these technologies are commercially viable:  The scalability of manufacturing reliable cells must increase to the point that the price of the cells lowers to a point where the gains in performance are balanced by the increased price of the battery.  Would you be willing to pay an extra $2,000 for your iphone if I could make it charge in 10 minutes?  Probably not.  Currently, we are trying to find ways to scale up production of these materials in such a way that will drive the price down, and would have reliable results between batches and batteries within the same batch of anode/cathode material.The performance gains increase to such a point that people would be willing to pay exorbitant sums of money to utilize the technology.  Would you be willing to pay $2,000 more for your iphone if I could make it charge up in 1 minute, and last for 2 or 3 days?  Maybe.  Maybe not.  We are also researching ways to improve upon graphene and CNT performance in cells that push their performance beyond their already amazing levels.To answer your last question, we are at least 5 years (probably closer to 10 years) away from being able to reliably and cost effectively introduce these materials into commercially available products for consumer use.  It is mostly university research laboratories and defense research laboratories that are exploring these subjects right now. ",

            "answer_text": "I don't want to be overly negative because there is some really good work going on right now in electrochemical energy storage at all levels.  However, until you start seeing products come to market with major venture and industry backing (e.g., Green Jobs: Khosla-Funded Pellion, GE, Amonix, DARPA, CALSEIA) you should do as Chuck D advised and don't believe the hype.   Eesha Khare appears to be a super bright student, not to mention more motivated and talented than I at that age.  However, work on tutile TiO2 supercapacitors have been on-going for 20 years and won't be replacing lithium ion batteries any time soon. Similarly, the \"3D\" battery technology is very cool, but as with most nano/microtech advances, it is very hard to scale.  It took silicon valley years to get commercialized nanometer interconnects in a silicon transistor, and there was a huge demonstrated market, the whole industry movement was going in that direction, etc. I think the field is still wide open and while those little research nuggets people put out for PR are tantalizing and exciting, that is the exact reason people put them out, to tantalize and excite, because they need money and talent to help them develop their ideas further.
