            "answer_text": "There are no mine or his/hers process at product design in general or industrial design. Those processes, have been defined and clarified long time ago. A simple internet search would have helped you on this.  Industrial Design Process (from this source)  This was something I prepared for our Interns and Juniors.  But I can tell you this: At schools or in an ideal world, designer\u2019s starting point is always a need or a problem that exists, as a generally accepted issue to be solved by most of the users. Design must have a good reason. A solid need is the direction, that should be pursued for a new product. You may want to check Dieter Ram\u2019s manifest too.  Anyway, in real world, it may not work like that. Specially at corporate companies, reasons are mostly built on better market shares. (in general) Let me give you an example; suppose that you are working at a mobile phone company, and Apple came up with a design, that has a notch at its screen\u2019s top. :) Then your company, may ask designers may have been asked to create a new design, with a similar notch at its top. You can think about the scenario, for all industries. (even that notch of Apple\u2019s, designwise was completely unnecessary, but that is not our issue now) Why? because at all businesses, each seller would always like to say, we got that too. That is why, you may see lots of products at all markets, that has no technical or features like changes, (or tiny changes maybe) but only an appearance change, to able to keep their market share stable, to able to say we got something new. That is why briefs matters a lot for a designer for understanding the main purposes of new design, asked by company. It is like democracy. As Plato explained centuries ago, democracy will not work, if the public is not educated enough, or their consciousness and awareness is low. And most of the users are unconscious idiots. They buy stuff, because mainstream media tells them to. They don\u2019t even think do they really need a car, a new mobile, or goods and stuff. So advertisement agnecies and companies are exploiting those idiots. Summary: In real world today, you don\u2019t need a real reason or a fact based defined problem to fix, for a new product. You only need to create a perception and manipulate the society with various marketing tactics. People call it business, I call it B.S. But we all need money to survive, because we can\u2019t educate every damn user. ",

            "answer_text": "First I look at the electronics I need to package. I figure out the size that they will take and and if they will meet the specs that are given from marketing and sales. Next I will do some market research to see what trends are going on and what ideas are innovative. I\u2019ll look at common forms and uses. I\u2019ll also look at reviews on amazon and big retailers. I\u2019ll look at the bad and good and try to keep those in mind as I do the modeling. If there is a time crunch then an ID firm will be called in to do the outside design work. This typically goes through three iterations. After the design is locked down I\u2019ll specify the CMF. Select all that based on the cost of the product target. Then I\u2019ll send it off to the factories for quote. ",
