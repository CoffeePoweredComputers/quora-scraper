            "answer_text": "When will BMW reduce the price of its Bikes? When will Ferrari reduce the price for Enzo? When will Gucci reduce the price for its handbags? Never Why? Because it is a premium product! So what? Don\u2019t us people with less money also deserve a great product? Premium products as pricey because they are premium in quality (well, most of the time) and a part of them being premium is justified by their price so that less people can afford it and thus, the one can have an inflated ego. It starts with quality though. Rich people are ready to pay if the product is of very high quality. So that means, never? Yes, that means never! It\u2019s a part of reality of the capitalist world. You probably think about Apple and not Gucci or Ferrari because their premium product is still priced near what you think you would be able to afford in the near future. This is where criticism for Apple begins. ",

            "answer_text": "Never. Apple makes devices that simply work. No maintenance and that\u2019s the price you pay. With other machines you pay for the hardware and buy the software separately. With Apple you get the latest OS updates free and when you upgrade all the other software\u2019s you\u2019ve installed previously just work. The battery on any MBP is far superior to any other laptop. I\u2019ve been using my MBP for the last 2 1/2 years with no significant drop in battery performance. All the applications that I\u2019ve ever used are open, yet no drop in performance. I\u2019ve never shut down my MBP in the last 2 1/2 years. So, you pretty much get every worth of your penny. ",
