            "answer_text": "I created an AI. It does a task 7 people used to do at my wedding video company Glimmer Films. It is called \u2018Shakefree\u2019 and it detects and deletes severe shake in video that can\u2019t be stabilized. It deletes this out so the editor doesn\u2019t have to. It handles a very simple and tedious job, no human wants to do. As someone who: 1 - CREATED an AI 2- USED an AI to make my company more profitable I believe AI will not increase unemployment.. in fact, it will create more jobs of a better quality. I\u2019ve listed the reasons below. This is just my opinion and personal experience, and I am biased because I\u2019m a business owner who uses AI. REASONS AI won\u2019t increase unemployment: 1 - it took us over 3 years of full-time labor to create the AI. 2 - The AI needs minimum 1 person full time to maintain and tweak it. 3 - we employed 11 different businesses to create the AI, over the 3 years. 4 - my editors are not fired. Now they are working on other \u2019more fun\u2019 things that add value to our company, like improving our social media, team parties, research, etc. This resulted in an increase to profits, morale, and retention. 5 - if our AI company grows, who knows how many more people we\u2019ll have to hire, at higher rates than editors. 6 - if our AI company grows, we\u2019ll have to pay dozens of vendors a lot of money to maintain it (website, office, lawyers, accountants, marketing, etc etc). All of this net positive economic activity would not have happened if we didn\u2019t create and use the AI. Instead, my editors would have been doing a boring task (remove ugly shake) that makes them quit sooner, which sends many negative economic ripple effects into the world. Polls have shown HR is the biggest problem big and small businesses face in 2019. AI can dramatically solve this problem by making jobs less tedious and more enjoyable. This is a massive net positive effect. Finally, don\u2019t take my word for it. I suggest reading Walter Isaacson\u2019s epic book \u2018The Innovators\u201d. The conclusion of the book, after 1000+ pages of research and analysis, is that AI is not going to replace us, but rather enable us. This book was what gave me the courage to try and make the AI. ",

            "answer_text": "Firstly, it needs to be understood the fundamental narrative fallacy that under-girds the question. That is, implicit in such notions is that jobs are finite. That is, once a job has been \u201cautomated out of existence\u201d that is one less job to be done. This is absurd. The simple fact is that \u201cjobs\u201d are infinite and eliminating one job with automation just means that one of those other jobs that could not be done before because that worker was tied up in the former job can now be done now that that former job no longer requires that person to do it. Think about this: what is a \u201cjob\u201d? A job is doing the work of providing something for someone else who wants the product of that labor. Is human desire finite? No. SO why would jobs be finite? As long as there is something someone wants but does not yet have, there is a \u201cjob\u201d providing that. Do you think we will ever get to a place where people would say \u201cYou, know what? I don\u2019t want anything else\u201d? Now here\u2019s the thing - if we would get to that place, then what would be the point of a job? If everyone can have everything they want, then there is no need for a job, not to produce anything since nothing is wanted, and certainly not to \u201cearn a living\u201d to buy stuff since everyone can already have all they want. Now, having said that, sure, there are two things to consider. Yes, there could be unemployment temporarily as labor gets redistributed to doing new jobs that can now be done that could not be done before. Consider: in order for industrialization to be able to occur, farm jobs had to first be eliminated in order to free up the labor to go work those factory jobs. As long as the totality (or near totality) of labor is consumed with just providing food, who is going to work those factory jobs? But this is just temporary. And the \u201csolution\u201d is have an economic environment that facilitates that transition to the extent possible, NOT to just give people money or regulation so that they can just keep doing work that is now pointless and un(der)productive. That labor needs to get moved to where it is actually useful. And having said that, this is where the real problem lies, if there is to be a problem. And that is, what happens when the skills required to do that next level of jobs to be done exceeds the abilities of regular people to do them. After all, it is the simple and tedious and repetitive jobs that get automated. It is jobs like engineering that do not. And the reality is actually that far more engineers are needed already than are available. But not everyone can or could be an engineer. Or to go for hyperbole - what if all the jobs needing to be done require an understanding of quantum mechanics? ",
