            "answer_text": "How far? Probably limitless Well, there are hundreds of scenarios about humanity\u2019s future, ranging from total Annihilation, both by ourselves and alien civilization, to technological Singularity. Humanity could change to anything it wants if enough people deem so and still inside their moral border (if there still are in future). One of the hypothesis that\u2019s quite an eerie peace future of humanity is when we left our physical body to live as a collection of billions of thought combined into one entity (see Arthur C. Clarke\u2019s childhood\u2019s end) that resides in higher dimensions, or in an super-simulation created by advanced ASIs, choosing to create their own heaven. All of these could happen, and if you ask me, humanity has changed A Lot since the classical era, Medieval, and Rennaisance. in which probably some of our modern daily life practices are considered highly unethical or outright impossible. Let just hope we live long enough to witness a great change in humanity towards a better future. (Please tell me what you also think about this and correct me) ",
