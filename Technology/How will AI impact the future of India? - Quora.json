            "answer_text": "Since its evolution, man kind has made consistent efforts to get the job done as easily as possible. From the period of taming of horses to the invention of steam engine to the era of self driving cars, mankind has proven that it's intelligence is beyond one's comprehension. According to the census 2011, India's population stood at 1.21 billion. To cater the demands of such a high population, AI can be a panacea. Recently, in the year 2018, NITI Aayog entered into a partnership with Google to promote and exploit the AI in various social sectors in India. From agriculture to education to employment, each social sector will receive a major transformation. In the Education sector, the AI can reduce the administrative tasks of a teacher like taking attendance, thus saving their considerable amount of time and effort which can be utilized elsewhere. Also, with the \"Virtual Teacher\", the same teacher can teach at multiple areas, thereby broadening the \"Student Base\". \"Telemedicine\" feature of AI can actually break the physical and geographical barriers between the doctor and patient, thus enabling \"Remote follow-ups and monitoring\". It has also, helped in providing \"Voice\" to the patients of Cerebral Palsy. In Japan, AI has been successful towards assisting the Doctors in operations and easing the doctor/nurse shortages. Despite being so beneficial, the AI Sector seriously lacks in both Human and capital resources required to exploit it. In India itself, around 4000 AI experts are required to exploit this technology. Recently, the GoI infused 200 Crores for research and development in the AI sector but lack of sufficient human resource is a prime concern. ",

            "answer_text": "AI will impact the manufacturing labours majorly. Because AI is offering very clear and efficient solutions for majority of the manufacturing jobs which rather requires manufacturing labours to get the job done. New and improved technologies are being offered very frequently and as being an Indian, we always resist the new technology a little more before accepting and using it. AI is forecasted to generate $47 billion in annual revenues and replace 5 million jobs globally by 2020. It\u2019s not just manufacturing jobs but AI will be effecting developers and programmers as well. There are a lot of AI companies being backed by VCs in 2016. With that being said, I would say that AI wave is gonna bring a lots of development in terms of efficient technology and automated processes leaving a significant amount of people jobless. But it won\u2019t happen overnight, It will take time and the pace at which it may happen in India, maybe it won\u2019t be noticeable as the labours must be already switched working in some other field. I am excited what future would be like. ",
