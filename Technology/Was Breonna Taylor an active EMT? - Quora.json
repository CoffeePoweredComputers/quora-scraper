            "answer_text": "Thanks Anna Fitriana for A2A Breonna Taylor died March 13 after police entered her home in the early morning hours as part of a narcotics investigation. Police say they began shooting after one of the officers was shot and injured.  Criticism of Louisville police is mounting as national attention turns to the March shooting death of Breonna Taylor, a 26-year-old EMT who was killed by officers in her own home. But a lawsuit filed against the Louisville Metro Police Department claims the officers weren't looking for Taylor or her boyfriend, Kenneth Walker. And no drugs were found in their home. Walker's defense attorney has claimed in court filings that Walker fired in self-defense, believing the home was being broken into because police didn't announce themselves. Though Breonna Taylor was killed nearly two months ago, her case gained national attention recently after prominent activist Shaun King posted about her story on social media. Since then, Taylor's family has hired civil rights attorney Benjamin Crump, who is also representing the family of Ahmaud Arbery, a 25-year-old black man who was shot and killed by two white men in Georgia in late February. Attorneys for Taylor's family said Wednesday that Louisville police are \"desperate\" to cover up the shooting. \"It seems to me like they're just trying to cover their tracks from day one,\" said Sam Aguiar, a Louisville-based attorney representing Taylor's family. \"Get your damn story straight.\" Spokespeople for the police department have declined to answer many questions about the case asked by The Courier Journal, part of the USA TODAY Network, citing an ongoing internal investigation into Taylor's shooting. Who was Breonna Taylor? Breonna Taylor was a certified EMT who had two jobs at hospitals in Louisville. Her mother, Tamika Palmer, told The Louisville Courier Journal that Taylor was a young woman who adored her family above all else and who had made plans to succeed. \"She had a whole plan on becoming a nurse and buying a house and then starting a family. Breonna had her head on straight, and she was a very decent person,\" Palmer said. \"She didn't deserve this. She wasn't that type of person.\" Family members said that she was kind, hardworking and honest. \"She really did not deserve to end her life so horrifically,\" said Taylor's aunt, Bianca Austin. Why were police at Breonna Taylor's home? Breonna Taylor was not the main target of the narcotics investigation that prompted Louisville Metro Police officers to enter her home. But officers had a search warrant for her and her apartment that included a \"no-knock\" provision, meaning that police could enter her house without identifying themselves as law enforcement. Records show that police believed that a suspect in the narcotics investigation, Jamarcus Glover, used Taylor's home to receive mail, keep drugs or stash money earned from the sale of drugs. However, according to the lawsuit filed by Breonna Taylor\u2019s family, police had identified Glover at a home more than 10 miles from Taylor's apartment before they executed the warrant at her residence. There is no body camera footage available. Police Chief Steve Conrad said the Criminal Interdiction Squad does not use that equipment. What is a 'no-knock' warrant? Police can seek no-knock entry, meaning they don't have to identify themselves before entering a residence or business, if there is a reasonable suspicion that knocking would be dangerous, futile or inhibit the \"effective investigation of the crime,\" according to Louisville Metro Police policies. Civil rights advocates have long complained that \"no-knock\" warrants are dangerous and unnecessary. In this case, police said it was necessary at Taylor's house because \"these drug traffickers have a history of attempting to destroy evidence, have cameras on the location that compromise detectives once an approach to the dwelling is made, and have a history of fleeing from law enforcement.\" Even with the no-knock warrant, Louisville police have said they identified themselves before using a battering ram to enter Taylor's residence. Representatives for Walker and Taylor's family say that isn't true and that neighbors have said the same. What happened when police entered? The lawsuit claims that Taylor and Walker woke up to the unannounced entry and believed their home was being broken into. \"While police may claim to have identified themselves, they did not. Mr. Walker and Ms. Breonna Taylor again heard a large bang on the door. Again, when they inquired there was no response that there was police outside. At this point, the door suddenly explodes. Counsel believes that police hit the door with a battering ram,\" Rob Eggert, who is defending Walker, wrote in a motion. Eggert said Walker acted in self-defense and fired one gunshot. The bullet hit Sgt. Jonathan Mattingly, and police say officers then returned fire. The lawsuit says that officers \"failed to use any sound reasonable judgment\" and fired \"more than 25 blind shots into multiple homes.\" Eggert has said he inspected the apartment building where Taylor lived and found evidence of 20 gunshots fired into the building, some of which entered other apartments. During the gunfire, Taylor was struck at least eight times and died. However, police may have initially believed it was Taylor, not Walker, who shot at police, according to a search warrant obtained for Taylor's home hours after she was killed. The statement in the warrant's affidavit says a \"subject inside the residence was armed with a(n) unknown gun and fired a shot striking a detective. In the course of protecting themselves and other civilians, detectives returned gunfire and struck the subject (an) unknown number of times. The subject collapsed inside the listed residence and subsequently (was) pronounced deceased on scene.\" But according to Walker's arrest citation, he gave a statement shortly after the incident that said he was the sole person to fire a weapon in Taylor's apartment.

My answer: No she had worked as an emergency medical technician, but at the time of her death was employed by University of Louisville Health as an Emergency Room technician. I believe she was planning on becoming an registered nurse. A front line hero killed by those who should honor her. Say her name - Brionna Taylor, say it again. This stupidity has to stop. ",
