From there grew two children networks: Milnet dedicated to military and NSFNet dedicated to education and research. NSFNet provided connectivity to 5 supercomputing centers, all associated with one or more American universities and research centers John von Neumann Center at Princeton UniversitySan Diego Supercomputer Center (SDSC) on the campus of the University of California, San Diego (UCSD)National Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA) at the University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013ChampaignCornell Theory Center at Cornell UniversityPittsburgh Supercomputing Center (PSC), a joint effort of Carnegie Mellon University, the University of Pittsburgh, and Westinghouseand 11 regional networks BARRNet, the Bay Area Regional Research Network in Palo Alto, California;CERFnet, California Education and Research Federation Network in San Diego, California, serving California and Nevada;CICNet, the Committee on Institutional Cooperation Network via the Merit Network in Ann Arbor, Michigan and later as part of the T-3 upgrade via Argonne National Laboratory outside of Chicago, serving the Big Ten Universities and the University of Chicago in Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Michigan, Minnesota, Ohio, and Wisconsin;JVNCNet, the John von Neumann National Supercomputer Center Network in Princeton, New Jersey, connected the universities that made up the Consortium for Scientific Computing as well as a few New Jersey Universities. There were 1.5 Mbit/s (T-1) links to Princeton University, Rutgers University, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Harvard University, Brown University, University of Pennsylvania, University of Pittsburgh, Yale University, The Institute for Advanced Study, Pennsylvania State University, Rochester Institute of Technology, New York University, The University of Colorado and The University of ArizonaMerit/MichNet in Ann Arbor, Michigan serving Michigan, formed in 1966, still in operation as of 2013MIDnet in Lincoln, Nebraska the first NSFNET regional backbone to become operational in the Summer of 1986, serving Arkansas, Iowa, Kansas, Missouri, Nebraska, Oklahoma, and South Dakota, later acquired by Global Internet, which was acquired by Verio, Inc.;NEARNET, the New England Academic and Research Network in Cambridge, Massachusetts, added as part of the upgrade to T-3, serving Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, and Vermont, established in late 1988, operated by BBN under contract to MIT, BBN assumed responsibility for NEARNET on 1 July 1993;NorthWestNet in Seattle, Washington, serving Alaska, Idaho, Montana, North Dakota, Oregon, and Washington, founded in 1987NYSERNet, New York State Education and Research Network in Ithaca, New York;SESQUINET, the Sesquicentennial Network in Houston, Texas, founded during the 150th anniversary of the State of Texas;SURAnet, the Southeastern Universities Research Association network in College Park, Maryland and later as part of the T-3 upgrade in Atlanta, Georgia serving Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia, and West Virginia, sold to BBN in 1994Westnet in Salt Lake City, Utah and Boulder, Colorado, serving Arizona, Colorado, New Mexico, Utah, and Wyoming.It was also from NSFNet that the commercial internet was born and that\u2019s what evolved to the internet that we use today in the US and equivalent networks around the world Links to Wikipedia articles National Science Foundation Network - WikipediaMILNET - Wikipedia",
