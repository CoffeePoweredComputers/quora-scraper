            "answer_text": "Here are just three reasons why renewables are rapidly making their way up the energy agenda. Growing price competitiveness Gas, fossil fuels and other energy alternatives- each with their unique advantages- collectively pose a threat to power plant operators and end users: volatility and insecurity of price. The price of gas fluctuates across regions and, for fossil fuels, in a cyclical fashion. Long-term certainty Renewables have been heavily encouraged by policy measures and financial support, with the explicit aim of driving costs down through early deployment. But the necessity for this is disappearing as we speak for solar and wind (and it has been for hydro for a while now), bringing to the fore solid competitors to fossil fuels or nuclear power, especially when long-term price evolutions are part of the deals. Energy security The majority of oil & gas sources are concentrated in certain regions, many of which are getting more technically challenging and more expensive to reach, whereas renewable energy is domestic. It provides security of supply, helping a nation reduce its dependence on imported sources. It plays a significant role in addressing our energy needs by replacing foreign energy imports with clean and reliable home-grown electricity with the added bonus of fantastic local economic opportunities. While renewable energy systems are better for the environment and produce fewer emissions than conventional energy sources, many of these sources still face difficulties in being deployed at a large scale including, but not limited to, technological barriers, high start-up capital costs, and intermittency challenges.

            "answer_text": "To be blunt, more important than anything else at the moment. We are rapidly approaching a tipping point that will make large areas of the Earth\u2019s land masses uninhabitable for large human populations. THIS WILL HAPPEN UNLESS WE STOP POLLUTING THE ENVIRONMENT. Our current methods of powering transportation and generating electricity are causing massive amounts of air pollution, reducing oxygen levels and increasing climate change. The general public need to be made more aware of this and start adopting alternatives as well as piling on the pressure to make governments and businesses put the future of humanity ahead of short term profits.
