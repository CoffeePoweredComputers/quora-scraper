            "answer_text": "Charging speed of the laptop depends on discharging speed of laptop while in use. Hence, according to this simple logic, if u r using it in normal mode with all connectivity options (like Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, etc along with location) OFF then speed will be same with airplane mode ON. (Provided that u r using same percentage of CPU in both cases without dongle attached to the laptop). In case of mobile phones, connectivity is always working for phone calls and messages in normal mode. Hence while in airplane mode, charging is faster. But if u don't connect dongle to laptop, this thing doesn't happen and speed of discharging remains same. (NOTE :\u2014 This answer is based on factor of discharging only. If there r other factors also, the answer may change) ",

            "answer_text": "There isn\u2019t much of a difference in the speed of charging. Yeah, it might reach a 100% 5 or 10 minutes quicker than if your laptop was not on airplane mode. If you want really fast charging, completely shut down your laptop and then charge it. That\u2019s where you will see a major difference. Thanks. Feel free to ask any more questions. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes. Although, even with the WiFi on, the time period in which your laptop charges completely shouldn't differ much unless you're using the net heavily (downloading at high speeds or streaming something online). If you ask me, I'd say \u201cdon't worry about it too much\u201d. Hope it helps ",
