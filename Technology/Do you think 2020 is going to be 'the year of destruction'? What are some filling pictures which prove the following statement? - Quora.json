I am sorry I simply can\u2019t other than stating facts. Australia bushfires.California bushfires.Amazon forest fires.The biggest disaster of all Covid 19. This deadly virus has literally caused havoc globally. No amount of nuclear war could have caused that much cumulative damage across globe in a short period of six months. 1.138 million precious lives are already lost forever throughout globe. Hundreds of thousands of small and medium firms are shutdown and most unlikely to be opened. Millions and millions of people have lost jobs and their future is bleak. Millions of dependents of those who lost jobs have nothing to eat and no one to look upto, As on today 41.77 million people are affected by the pandemic across globe.Even those schools and firms, which have opened have no idea either to go forward or backward.Not even a single head of state has any clue whatsoever as to what\u2019s going on.No one exactly knows when the vaccine is really expected. If so whether it will be effective or not.One of the all time greatest movie singers of India, S.P. Balasubramanyam, who has enthralled millions of his fans across globe for 4 decades and who sang more than 40,000 songs melodiously in 16 languages left for heavenly abode on account of Covid 19.One of the world famous classical Kuchipudi dancers of all time Shobha Naidu left for heavenly abode due to Covid 19.Those of us, who are not affected by the pandemic across globe simply don\u2019t know whether to go outside or not. Staying at home is not that simple even though it\u2019s pretty safe but it\u2019s completely impractical since there are plenty of compulsions. As such we have to go outside but then at what cost and how long , no one knows. What a sad state of affairs thanks to nothing known virus.Millions and millions of lives are crushed forever while politicians and administrators are enjoying their lives to their hearts\u2019 content disgustingly by showing lip sympathy. What more destructive news you are interested in with telling effect ?To put to shame all those big mouthed rich and super rich people across globe, one Telugu and Hindi films villain but real life Super Hero Sonu Sood helped thousands of helpless workers in India during the pandemic with his Kohinoor Diamond like act. He has undid single handedly what all the arrogant rich and influential people including film stars, politicians and administrators had done till now. He richly deserves at least a dozen Nobel Prizes if not more.",

I am also worried right now because China is actively engaging against India and is trying to solve problems that they created.  2020 is a boon of sorts for Mother Earth since the pollution levels and etc have gone down drastically (only for a short while because everything will be back with increased intensity because we humans never learn) Where i live, it is a huge deal considering it is a city. I\u2019m sure it was even more easier to breathe in Delhi, Mumbai etc.    There are so many other incidents regarding \u201cdestruction\u201d and that was due to skeleton staff, negligence in some places and the lockdown leaving everything still. There are forest fires, deaths of popular people and many near and dear ones we know.     But i believe that the worst things that happened in 2020 are not these disasters that we could not control. It is Human Stupidity    You can read my answer here on the anti-mask protests here: Sriharsha Palanki (\u0c36\u0c4d\u0c30\u0c40\u0c39\u0c30\u0c4d\u0c37 \u0c2a\u0c3e\u0c32\u0c02\u0c15\u0c3f)'s answer to What will our biggest world concerns be in 2020?

A nuclear war can create destruction as has ever been seen before . In these changing frequency zones of space and time as cosmically, energy dimensions are uplifting on the planet , destruction is inevitable but it has to be minimized The calculations that kalyug is coming in 428000 years were wrong as proved later   Kalyug is supposedly ending in 2025 .

What else do you need to feel bad about the year when the world had almost come to standstill at different junctures without any movement of life and which one could not have imagined even in the event of a big WAR. And imagine people having to live with fear all the time and all the suffocating things like mask to be worn and hesitation to embrace or handshake with anybody. Major part of the year is gone and a more destructive picture is facing us all ahead with economy going down and future in tough times. ",
