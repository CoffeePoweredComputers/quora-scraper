You can turn your passion into a profession by the online platform. So I am now going to tell you some easy ways to make money online. 1.Paid for searching the web Qmee.com rewards you for searching in Google, Bing, Yahoo, Amazon, and eBay.

            "answer_text": "In the internet world, there are essentially two things to consider in order to make money. Invest your time : This involves learning a skill, then sell the skill you developed in freelance sites, similar to Freelance.com, Fiver.com, upwork.com. Essentially, you want to focus on skills that don\u2019t have lots of competition, but have high demand.Invest your money : This requires a minimum amount of money to start with (Capital). There are many business models to start in 2020. From e-commerce, and affiliate marketing to social media marketing agencies and blogging.Now let me answer your question with a straight forward response. When I was at 18, I wish somebody told me this, it could\u2019ve simply saved me lots of time. I assume you don\u2019t have any money to invest so, I would recommend you go learn social media marketing. Start off with the basics of marketing, and dive in to Facebook Ads and Instagram influencer marketing. I know there are many other social media marketing strategies you can learn. But, these are the basic ones. Once you learn those skills, go to the nearest coffee shop, or Restaurent in your city. Offer them your services. Build them social media following on Instagram and Facebook, boost their posts from time to time. You should be able to charge around $200 for each client. The more you build a portfolio, the easier it gets to charge more and more, $300 then $500 ..and so on and so forth. The key here is to focus all your energy, power, and time only on one thing. I really wish you the best of luck from the button of my heart. You\u2019re only 18 y.o, you still have lots of time so use it wisely. \u201cDon\u2019t Do It For Money But Do It With Passion\u201d.
