When you\u2019re providing feedback to an employee, it\u2019s important to understand the different types so that you can take a calculated approach to how you deliver the feedback. Some employees respond better to specific feedback approaches than others, so being able to approach a single issue using a few different angles can increase the receptiveness of your feedback.

It\u2019s not a recommended form of feedback because it\u2019s rooted in subjectivity or opinion and is deconstructive in nature.Praise: Praise is used as a positive reinforcement based on the actions of an employee. This type of feedback is often unrelated to any future business objectives.
