The real question is if both of those phones have the same amount of storage or not. I\u2019d go for the XR if the amount of storage is significantly more than the 11. ",

            "answer_text": "iPhone 11 no doubt! It's their straight flagship and not like the XR! Also since it's a 20$ difference you need to check other specifications like storage! The better storage, better the phone! I'll choose XR with more storage than a beefy new iPhone with comparatively less storage! ",
