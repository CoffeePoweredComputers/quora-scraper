            "answer_text": "The USB-C port is universal, you\u2019ll be able to ask the person with the laptop next to you to borrow their laptop power cord and it will automatically safely charge your phone. You can even borrow power directly from another device so you can connect phone to phone and one can charge the other.  Above are all of the standard cables ends for recent Android smartphones. When you start looking at hard drives, printers, and other devices it expands to a bigger list but for the sake of this post, we will stick to the differences between USB-C and Micro USB. The main benefit that most of our members find in the connector is that it\u2019s reversible. This means that you will never have to do the dance of flipping the connector over ten times to try to find the right way to plug it in. This is especially useful in the dark. Throughout the history of the USB cable, it has been common to always have a USB-A connector on one side of the cable. So as new types of USB connectors were introduced over the past to connect to smaller devices, the USB-A connector stayed consistent so we could continue plugging into the same ports. However, with USB-C, USB-A is being replaced, and eventually, USB-C will be the new standard for all devices. And USB-C cables will (eventually) not have a USB-A connector. This is a big transition for how consumers use USB cables! ",

            "answer_text": " USB C is with the following different features to USB standard. Higher bandwidth. It supports 3.1 USB standard, up to 10Gbps transffer.Support USB Power Delivery, up to 100 watt for quick charging.Thinner and smaller for modern smartphones.Symmetric built to be easy to plug.Support video signals.\u201cUSB-C features a new, smaller connector shape that\u2019s reversible so it\u2019s easier to plug in. USB-C cables can carry significantly more power, so they can be used to charge larger devices like laptops. They also offer up to double the transfer speed of USB 3 at 10 Gbps. While connectors are not backwards compatible, the standards are, so adapters can be used with older devices. \u201c Reference source ",
