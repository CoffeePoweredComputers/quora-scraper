            "answer_text": "The speed of light is always the same, it IS the speed of light.It is approximately 300000 km/s. But this speed is effectively reached only in vacuum. In other materials as you mention it is lower. There isn't any magic happening, the reasoning is simpler.In vacuum there are no objects in which photons (particles of light) can bump into hence they move forward at 300000 km/s.  In an actual material photons bounce off atoms which makes them change their path, a bit to the left, bit to the right, hence you get an EFFECTIVE SPEED FORWARD less than 300000 km/s. However the photons still move at 300000 km/s but the sum of all the motions forward is less than that. Hence light ALWAYS moves at the speed of light, no faster no slower. ",

            "answer_text": "No. It isn't really the speed of light. After all, light doesn't always travel at c. Better to think of c as the speed of causality, the maximum rate at which a signal from one event could influence other events. If causality is rigidly respected, then c provides a hard upper limit on everything. ",
