But the most frequently used technologies I see are C#, .Net, MVC,WebApiJava, Spring, HibernatePythonBig dataAngular js/ Angular 2/4/5, React js/ Knock out jsHTML, Css, BootstrapSQLEntity Framework, ADOC++ (for Legacy systems)Here I have mentioned few technologies . That doesn't mean you should be knowing all the technologies to work in a company. One should be aware of any one front end technology, server side technology, and one DB to be called as full stack developer. So easily u can understand other technologies as well just by seeing the code . It's one and the same but just syntax matters. Hope it helps! ",
