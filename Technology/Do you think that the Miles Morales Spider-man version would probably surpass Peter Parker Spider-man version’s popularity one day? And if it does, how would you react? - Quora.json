            "answer_text": "It is definitely possible that Miles could surpass Peter in popularity. It is because Miles of several reasons. Fresh new character - over time characters become stale. They have become overpowered or fought every conceivable type threat that nothing is interesting so they automatically know how to win. Fight sandman.. done in 2 panels, electro 3 panels. Mikes will need to learn his powers and peters old enemies present new threats because he hasn\u2019t fought them before so we enjoy him figuring it outYoung coming off age story - most of us love Peter but the Peter we knew and was introduced was high school and college Peter. Peter has been married, had kids, owned a company, respected in superhero community. Basically he is no longer really growing up in the comics and figuring out life while fight crime. Miles is basically old Peter we loved.Champions are shaping up to really being a good team this will continue his popularityyounger generation will grow up with miles won\u2019t have the attachment to Peter like older generation",

            "answer_text": "I don\u2019t think Miles Morales will ever be more popular than Peter Parker. We\u2019re talking about this guy.  Peter F\u2014-ing Parker. The OG Spider-Man. The one who started everything. Well, maybe not. Chronologically, I\u2019m not sure if there were Spider-Men before Peter Parker, but this was the first Spider-Man to be introduced to us, right? Think of him as this: Peter Parker is the original show, the Spider-Verse is like a spin-off.  Example: Earth-8311. Spider-Ham. His real name is basically a play-on of the OG Spider-Man, Peter Parker, but related to pigs: Peter PORKer. And Peter Parker/Spider-Man is very special for the fans. He is a legend in The Fandom. The memes:  The movies  The games  I know, Miles was in the game and he was a playable character, but come on. Peter was the main character. The cartoons  Similar to Spider-Man PS4, but Peter was the real star of this show. If you say Spider-Man, the first image that would pop up in the majority of CB fans heads is the classic red and blue Spider-Man. Not the Black and Red. The spin-off may do better than the original, but it will never replace the original. Even if Marvel decided to put down Spider-Man/Peter Parker for good. Kill him off and never bring him back. Peter Parker will always be the OG Spider-Man. No hate towards Mile Morales. But, if Miles does become more popular than Peter, I don\u2019t care. It doesn\u2019t really affect me. ",

Pete\u2019s been through the best moments in comics, he lived through the popular ages of comics and the lower ends. He\u2019s seen it all, he\u2019s had years to accumulate his popularity and respect. Spider-Man is the most popular hero in the world, his merchandise makes more money than the next big three heroes combined. Miles was created with the ultimate universe. The ultimate universe was an attempt to start a new mainstream comic universe to drag in new readers who didn\u2019t want to read through all of 616s history. This already puts miles at a disadvantage considering he was created in an attempt to gather new readers. ",

I think he\u2019s a fun character that taps into the original Parker vibe, but makes it his own. In my mind, Morales is vastly better than the current Parker. I\u2019m thrilled with that. I have to admit, keeping Parker fresh is a difficult task. Had Bendis just developed the character for the sake of diversity, eh. But I think instead he created a great character in a climate of diversity, which is a different thing. Miles Morales makes Spider-Man fun again. :) ",

So all it would take is for the powers that be to start having cartoons and then movies that feature Miles Morales instead of Peter Parker. Or have both characters with Miles being teenaged and Peter being an adult. Of course, it would probably take 25 years for it to happen\u2026a whole generation of people would have to die off while another generation or two would have to grow up with Morales as Spider-Man but it could happen. After all, the success of the Spider verse movie will allow the character to play a more prominent role in more formats. Right now someone is trying to figure out how to get him on TV :) ",
