            "answer_text": "They did what every country does when it makes sudden, rapid progress -- they copied whoever was doing it best. England copied the Caliphate, after the Crusades. Italy copied China, via the Silk Road. The Italian Renaissance kicked off intellectual ferment in the whole of Western Europe. The development of colonial navies - Spain, Portugal, Holland, France, and the U.K. -- was one big game of 'first copy, then compete.' The United States took the industrial revolution, one machine at a time, across the Atlantic. Korea copied Japan in building an electronics industry. And so on. When Mr Deng faced the problem of a sclerotic Chinese economy and dissipated educational system, he re-opened the schools, but he also started several policies that aided in bringing in new ideas from the outside. He said, of people who had fled to other countries during Mao's era, that they were welcome back. He allowed foreign teachers to enter the country. He funded promising Chinese students to study abroad. He reached out first to the Japanese and later to the Americans to help set up factories. He opened Shenzhen to commerce, and to the flow of new ideas from Hong Kong.  The ability to import the first phase of scientific and technical knowledge gave China a big boost in getting back to being a country that valued education and could undertake sophisticated research and engineering projects.

            "answer_text": "Well, actually even during the Culture revolution, the country had never stopped studying in science. And I am not sure where did you read or heard that there are no science in China 40years ago. A county can only develop when it keeps funding studying in science constantly. It is undoubtedly that China is getting rich in recent decades, so more funding support are put into science studies, and obviously, achievements are gained. For example, the country built a large highspeed rail system, by funding a lot. So the short answer is: China has never stopped putting money into science studying, and it works. ",
