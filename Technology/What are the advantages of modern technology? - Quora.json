            "answer_text": "Modern technology Today, technology is very important because it is used for almost everything and like everything, technology has advantages and disadvantages  The invention of the computer was a very important point. Communication is thus enhanced, and companies can communicate more easily with foreign countries. Research is also simplified.In the world today, people cannot live without technologies such as televisions, mobile phones, computers and others. These technologies have slowly taken an essential part in people\u2019s day-to-day lives and being without them would be unimaginable for some of us. To understand technology, one must know what it provides in terms of advantages, but also disadvantages. Advantages of technology First, the evolution of technology is beneficial to humans for several reasons. At the medical level, technology can help treat more sick people and consequently save many lives and combat very harmful viruses and bacteria. The invention of the computer was a very important point. Communication is thus enhanced, and companies can communicate more easily with foreign countries. Research is also simplified. For companies, progress in implementing strategic technology trends is helping them save time and therefore, money. Exchanges are faster especially with the internet. Sales and purchases are now facilitated and possible worldwide. This allows businesses to buy raw materials with discounts or at reduced prices. Similarly, global tourism has grown. Technology has also increased the productivity of almost every industry in the world. Thanks to technology, we can even pay with bitcoins instead of using banks. The digital coin has been such a game changing factor, that many realised that this is the right time to open a bitcoin demo account. When observed more closely, new things are discovered every day. Let\u2019s take for instance when radio waves were discovered, radio broadcasts followed suit almost immediately. The same applies to the television and electricity. If no one had discovered that electricity could be generated, then the entertainment industry wouldn\u2019t be at it\u2019s current stage of development. Technology improves daily lives; allowing to move physical storage units to virtual storage banks and more. Scientists of the time are also able to send astronauts to the moon thanks to technology. In the modern industrial world, machines carry out most of the agricultural and industrial work and as a result, workers produce much more goods than a century ago and work less. They have more time to exercise and work in safer environments. ",

            "answer_text": "Modern technology is simply an advancement of old technology. The impact of technology in modern life is unmeasurable, we use technology in different ways and sometimes the way we implement various technologies do more damage than good. What we call modern technology is technically not so new in most cases. For example, mobile phone technology has evolved from what it was in the year 2000 and continued to do so today; nowadays we use smartphones which is merely an advanced version of an older mobile phone.  (Source of an Image - Google) We use technology on a daily basis to accomplish specific tasks or interests. Modern technology or evolved technology at times may replace previously used technology due to its increased benefits or newfound popularity. Take for example transportation technology; at one time steam-powered trains were widely used, now they have been replaced by electric powered trains that move significantly faster, allowing for more efficient use of time and better use of natural resources. ADVANTAGES OF MODERN TECHNOLOGY Easy Access to Information It has become pretty easy to get access to relevant information at any time and anywhere. This has been possible because of modern technologies like broadband internet. Lots of data is being published and indexed online, sites like Wikipedia and Youtube have great original content that is regularly used for research or entertainment. With smart gadgets like the iPad, iPhone, Galaxy tablets, etc., users can easily have access to a vast amount of information wherever they are through the use of the internet on these devices. So a user on a train can easily read breaking news while traveling, they can also buy and sell stocks while in the bedroom or access their smart home temperature on the go. These smart gadgets make it easy to access the internet anywhere, and this simplifies the way we get information. Encourages Innovation and Creativity Since technology seems infinite, it sparks the brain to work to its full potential. In the past, it used to be very difficult to start a business, one had to have lots of capital, and they even had limited access to business information. Today, it is simple to start a business while at home. Let\u2019s look at companies like Etsydotcom which enable creative people to sell their works online; this encourages creativity. Another good example is kickstaterdotcom which helps creative people get funds for their projects through crowdfunding. On this platform, creative developers post projects to seek funding from the community; this helps them generate capital for their ideas which later leads to the creation of new jobs and further innovation of technology. The other creative works which have been facilitated by modern technology include Google, Apple, Facebook, Microsoft, Amazon, etc Improved Communication Communication is like water to life; it is essential to growth, We can not progress without communication. Modern technology has blessed us with advanced communication technology tools. These include e-fax, electronic mail, mobile phones, video conferencing, instant text messaging applications, social networking, etc.. All these modern communication technology tools have simplified the way humans and businesses communicate. I can quickly talk to my relative overseas using a mobile phone or video chatting services like Skype. The Convenience of Traveling/ Ease of Mobility Modern transportation technology makes it very easy to travel long distances. Transport is very important both in our lives and in the business world. Transportation technology has evolved with years. In the past, it used to be slow and expensive to move long distances. Nowadays, we can cover a 10 miles distance within a few minutes using electric trains, airplanes or cars. Improved Housing and Lifestyle Another excellent way of how modern technology has simplified our lives. If you compare the type of housing we used in 1900 and the architecture of houses today, the difference is enormous. New architectural technology has improved the kinds of homes we build. People with money can afford floating homes, and glass homes or people with smaller means can make tiny houses or mobile homes. Most of the items in our houses are now automated, for example, doors use fingerprints, key cards, or Bluetooth on our mobile. Security has also increased at home with the evolution of a more robust integrated security system. Improved Entertainment Modern technology has played a significant role in changing the entertainment industry. Home entertainment has improved with the invention of video games, advance music systems and visual systems like smart televisions, which can connect live to the internet so that a user can share what they\u2019re watching with friends. Easy access and storage of music are ever-present, services like iTunes allow users to purchase and download music on their players at a small cost, this is a win-win situation for both musicians and the users. Additionally, bars, clubs, and amusement parks have all benefited from advancements in technology. We can see things in 3D, ride the highest roller coaster or be served by a robot at the bar, all possible through modern technology. Efficiency and Productivity Modern technology has helped businesses increase production. Humans are slow, and sometimes they fail to deliver on time and quality. Many companies have integrated modern technology in their production line, increasing output and allowing for more consistent quality. Convenience in Education Learning is a process, and it is part of our daily lives. Modern technology has made it simple for students to learn from anywhere through online education and mobile education. Also, students now use modern technology in classrooms to learn more effectively. For example, students use tablets to share visual lessons and examples with peers in the classroom; this has made learning more convenient and fun. Also, new modern educational technologies support individual learning which gives students a chance to learn on their own with no need for tutors. Social Networking Modern technology has made it simple to discover our old friends and also discover new people to network with; this is a benefit to both individuals and businesses. Many businesses have embraced social networking technology to interact with their customers. Users of social networks can share information with friends, live chat with them and interact in all sorts of ways. Benefits to the Health Industry Today most hospitals have implemented modern technology in surgical rooms, and this has reduced mistakes made by doctors. Humans can easily make mistakes because of work overload and stress factors. Additionally, the development community has developed health apps that enable us to monitor our health, weight or fitness. These applications are used on mobile phones, so users have access anytime.
