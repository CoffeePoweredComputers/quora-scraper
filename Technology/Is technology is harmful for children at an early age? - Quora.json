However, the American Academy of Pediatricians does have a series of guidelines for children for screen time (TV, iPod, phone, computer, tablet, etc) based upon some kind of alarming studies. Among the AAP recommendations: For children younger than 18 months, avoid use of screen media other than video-chatting. Parents of children 18 to 24 months of age who want to introduce digital media should choose high-quality programming, and watch it with their children to help them understand what they're seeing.For children ages 2 to 5 years, limit screen use to 1 hour per day of high-quality programs. Parents should co-view media with children to help them understand what they are seeing and apply it to the world around them.For children ages 6 and older, place consistent limits on the time spent using media, and the types of media, and make sure media does not take the place of adequate sleep, physical activity and other behaviors essential to health.Designate media-free times together, such as dinner or driving, as well as media-free locations at home, such as bedrooms.Have ongoing communication about online citizenship and safety, including treating others with respect online and offline.For more information, go to American Academy of Pediatrics Announces New Recommendations for Children\u2019s Media Use Population-based studies continue to show associations between excessive television viewing in early childhood and cognitive, language, and social/emotional delays, likely secondary to decreases in parent\u2013child interaction when the television is on and poorer family functioning in households with high media use. An earlier age of media use onset, greater cumulative hours of media use, and non-PBS content all are significant independent predictors of poor executive functioning in preschoolers\u2026excessive television viewing is more likely in infants and toddlers with a difficult temperament or self-regulation problems, and toddlers with social-emotional delays are more likely to be given a mobile device to calm them down.

            "answer_text": "I think too much of anything is bad at any age\u2014except chocolate. ;-) We have to face the fact that, in developed nations, technology is everywhere. From our cars to our refrigerators, we have surrounded ourselves with so much tech that we almost don\u2019t see it any more. Our children are connected, from birth, in ways we never were. Tech has prove to aid motor & cogitive skills; it\u2019s also shown to encourage a sedentary lifestyle & lower sociability. The thing is to find a balance. It\u2019s easy (but more costly) to rely on tv and computer games to entertain kids. I chose a mixed route for my own son: tons of Lego blocks, toy cars & trucks, board games, and books. When he was 4 or 5, I also found a child\u2019s educational electronic tool that helped him learn his ABC\u2019s. Gradually he was introduced to computer games\u2014but with strict rules (an hour a day, after chores and homework, etc). It worked for me, and for my son. ",
