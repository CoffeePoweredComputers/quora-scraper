            "answer_text": "HDMI cables have 19 pins, and they are soldered to the connector on both ends. These solder commections can fail after repeated insertions or cable flex, and the small pins in the connector can become bent or broken. This is especially so with the lowest-cost cables, which of course are built at the lowest possible cost. While the cable itself can fail due to excessive flex or stress, it\u2019s most likely strain at the connector which can kill a cable. There is one other possibility: HDMI cables have different speed ratings. A cable might be just fine, until one day, for instance, you run some 4K or 4K60 video to your 4KTV, and now you\u2019re sending two times more data over the HDMI cable, which may not support that speed.

            "answer_text": "As others have said, wear and tear on the connector can eventually lead to the pins/wires in the connector itself to break or get worn. Also if a cable is being flexed (bend) a lot it can cause the wires inside the cable to break, picture bending a piece of metal back and forth in the same spot it will eventually wear out and snap in half; it is a similar concept with cables. It could be your device (PC/BluRay player) or the TV/monitor has hung up and needs to be restarted. I have an iPad mini that I connect to my TV with an HDMI cable and occasionally the iPad will sense the TV, but the TV won\u2019t display anything. I have to reboot the iPad and everything works again, for a while. ",
