            "answer_text": "Assuming you are talking about contactless payment cards, they are not WiFi related. They use Near Field Communication (NFC) and totally different protocols from WiFi. There are various standards, which vary in different countries. For contactless payment, the card machine provides power to the card wirelessly and then receives signals back from the card identifying the card holder and account. The card machine will record the details of the transaction on the card wirelessly, and after a number of contactless payments the card and machine will stop accepting further contactless payments until a PIN based payment is made. The machines also have a limit on the amount that a payment can be without using a PIN. Stupidly, many still display the contactless symbol on their screens when the amount exceeds the limit, and when a contactless payment is attempted then the machine advises that it has to be a PIN authorised payment. Chip and PIN also works in different ways. In some countries the PIN is checked by the card/machine, while in other countries the PIN is checked by the issuing bank. I have seen demonstrations of modified card machines that will authorise a payment even if a totally fictitious PIN number is used. When the PIN is validated locally, the card issuer is told that the card and PIN are valid and the payment goes through. I have also been stung twice with hefty bills when someone has managed to get hold of my card number and then gone on a shopping spree. In each case the fraudulent transactions were refunded, but there are many ways that theft can occur. The advantage of contactless systems is that the maximum amount that can be taken is limited to the transaction ceiling and the number of consecutive payments that can be made without providing a PIN or other validation information. I use a pre-payment card for contactless payments so that I know just what balance is available if the card is lost. I have had my normal bank cards replaced with cards that do not support contactless payment. ",
