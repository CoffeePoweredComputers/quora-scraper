            "answer_text": "I don\u2019t know if they are, but they run an OS based on Linux (Chrome OS). You\u2019d have to compare reliability to other Linux systems, not Microsoft. Chrome OS, just like Android is a severely restricted (\u201csandboxed\u201d) OS, this means that third party applications do not have access to \u201croot\u201d privileges which is what most viruses and malware need to work. In Chrome OS you have to specifically enter developer mode to access the full features of your hardware. This provides a huge amount of security but the drawback is you lose advanced control over your device and also the device is connected 24/7 to google sending them your personal information. You can root or go into developer mode for these OS\u2019s but they\u2019re completely inappropriate for serious and important work that requires advanced security, due to their nature. It\u2019s a consumer OS, designed for people who don\u2019t know much about computers, just like Android. This means these OS\u2019s are severely dumbed down for the security of non computer professionals. ",

            "answer_text": "Are cars more reliable than airplanes? You can't compare a simple web only tool to one that allows and supports full functionality. Aside from a few android apps Chromebook does not support installing and using full blown applications. Its easy to make a tool that only does one thing. But full blown functionality takes complexity and finesse. But think about what you really want when you need to cross the ocean. A simple car? Go for it. ",

I have been using them extensively for 8 years, privately and professionally, and I could always find the apps I needed, online or as a Android app. ",

            "answer_text": "Because Chromebook is not a whole laptop system, too few things that can be done on this platform, plus, they do not give you high authorization to modify your files. Basically, google plays a role as an administrator who control everything, too elude possible hazardous things may happen to an user. Therefore, those folks could enjoy easier and more stable system.
