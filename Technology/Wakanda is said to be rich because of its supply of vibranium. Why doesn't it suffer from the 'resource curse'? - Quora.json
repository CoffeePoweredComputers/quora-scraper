            "answer_text": "As mentioned, the resource curse is the economic pitfall of tying your economy to one resource. More specifically, countries that finance their economies on one resource are mostly looking to profit off one or two products. Countries that rely on one resource rarely actually do much with it. In many petrol-states for instance, crude oil for gets refined into petroleum and sold as that, what you won\u2019t see on the balance sheets of a number of petro-countries is other uses for crude oil such as the production of various plastics, plastic components or products derived from plastics. A far wider range of applications than petroleum alone. States under the resource curse often see the material itself, rather than what could be done with it, as the road to riches. That\u2019s where Wakanda differs as Klaue explained in his interrogation Klaue: All a front. Explorers have searched for it. Called it El Dorado. They looked for it in South America, but it was in Africa the whole time. A technological marvel. All because it was built on a mound of the most valuable metal known to man. Isipho, they call it. \"The gift\". I'm the only who's seen it... and made it out alive.\u201d Ross: Vibranium. Klaue: Vibranium, yeah, strongest metal on earth. It's not just a metal. They sew it into their clothes. It powers their city, their tech... their weapons. Ross: Weapons? Klaue: Yeah. Makes my arm cannon look like a leaf blower. (emphasis mine) As an isolationist country, Wakanda\u2019s vibranium is confined to within its borders. But that encourages them to actually do more with it than export it or refine it into a handily-transportable form for further export. Ulysses Klaue says himself they put it into clothes, weapons and handheld devices. Which means that every industry from textiles and electronics to heavy machinery involves the use of vibranium.  Investment pays dividends. That requires specialised talent, which requires engineers, which requires a strong educational infrastructure. As Shuri demonstrates, the country has an entire R&D environment dedicated to developing further uses for it. New devices, new applications, new methods of use. It\u2019s gone from using vibrainum in hatchet-heads to being key components in the nation\u2019s electronics designs. Rather than simply funding their economy, it forms a backbone. Rather than being a crutch to prop the economy up, it is part of many industrial practices. Rather than selling a miracle material to outside buyers, they\u2019re building their own home-grown applications. The country avoids the resource curse by doing far more with their wonder-metal than selling a processed raw material. They\u2019re not Saudi Arabia selling to the highest bidder, they\u2019re China taking up one thing and turning it into a dozen more lucrative things. Wakanda isn\u2019t necessarily super-rich because vibranium is worth $10,000/kilo. That\u2019s an outside market price based largely on black market value which is ludicrous for everyday application unless US dollars are worth pennies to them. It\u2019s super-rich because it used the material in the practical development of the country. It\u2019s super rich because like Britain in the 1830s, they long ago stopped being farmers or miners and started being manufacturers. They industrialised first, gained and edge and used that edge to develop the nation and improve quality of life. ",

            "answer_text": "The short answer is good, forward thinking, leadership. Let\u2019s talk about the concept of the resource curse. The resource curse is based on the observation that countries basing their economy on one source of income tend to have massive levels of income inequality, less development in other sectors and skew towards more authoritative modes of government. Wakanda checks one of those boxes, being a monarchy, but not the others. So how did Wakanda avoid the other pitfalls of the resource curse? The Black Panther line is remarkably forward thinking for a hereditary monarchy. They always put their people, and not their title or position, first. This led to a populace that\u2019s well educated and financially stable. Since the Panthers have always protected and nurtured the people, Wakanda never suffered from the negative aspects of the resource curse. One of the other aspects of the resource curse is that countries dependent on one export are at risk if the resource dries up or the amount they can charge goes down. A real world example of this is Venezuela. To vastly oversimplify the situation, they based a majority of their economy around oil exports. When the price of oil dropped significantly, this kicked the legs out of their economy. Wakanda though, was smart about their money. T\u2019Challa continued the tradition of putting his people first as well as having contingency plans. During the Doomwar arc Dr. Doom uses covert and military means to take over Wakanda so he can gain access to the vibranium. T\u2019Challa know that if Doom controlled the vibranium he would be unstoppable. He activates a last ditch contingency plan that ruins the countries supply of vibranium, unleashing an energy into the stockpile that removes it\u2019s special properties.  His prize destroyed, Doom backs down.  T\u2019Challa\u2019s old friend and ally, Reed Richards wants to help rebuild Wakanda using his resources.  T\u2019challa reveals to Reed that Wakanda has not just sat on it\u2019s ass all these years. Even when they were isolated, the rulers of Wakanda made sure they had alternate sources of income. They invested in companies around the world, own properties through shell companies and have significant investment portfolios. Furthermore, the education level of the average Wakandan is among the highest in the world. Even without vibranium funding their nation they have scores of first rate scientists, engineers and doctors that still makes Wakanda a world leader in those fields. So, with or without the vibranium they are still an economic powerhouse which takes care of it\u2019s people first, the leadership second. ",
