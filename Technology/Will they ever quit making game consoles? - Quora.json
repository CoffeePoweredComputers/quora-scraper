            "answer_text": "yes. im kind of shocked they are even dragging it out for another generation. its fairly obvious that they are at this point trying to be more like pc and its NOT like you cant hook a pc up to any tv and use wireless controllers. its only a matter of time before consoles are a thing of the past. i always find it funny that these morons pretend a pc cost SOOOO much more than a pc BUT they are walking around with 900$ fucking phones in their pockets. in no time at all the platforms will be unified because phones will be powerful enough to stream data from servers to a tv. there will always be grossly overpowered computers, but the majority of the world doesnt need to render MRI\u2019s in real time. the way the cloud is evolving it wouldnt surprise me at all if in 10 years relatively few people own actual pc\u2019s at all because the entirety of the workload is happening off-site. microsoft is already implementing this in the next generation, stadia also already uses this technology. so yea, the fall is coming.

They\u2019re portable and can easily be moved. The main reason consoles were made was for people to play with each other. Let\u2019s take Atari for example. It supports multiple controllers so people could laugh and play with friends. ",
