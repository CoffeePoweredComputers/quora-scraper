            "answer_text": "Long Answer Short All PSUs are equally demanding. Bigger players may provide a comfy life due to better manpower but that is also not completely true. Short Answer Long I work in HPCL as an operations officer in a bottling plant (LPG). I am 5 months old into the organization and i have worked my ass off many times. I have worked 12 hrs+ so much so that a 10 hr stretch in the office looks like a piece of cake, although the actual shift is of 8 hrs. That being said, this isn\u2019t the case for every officer out there. If you are posted in a refinery or a place with shifts, you need to complete your respective shift, pack your bags and go home. But plants operating in general shifts extend almost daily and the officer has to ensure proper closing of the plant as your one single mistake or a hastily taken decision can cost a fortune to the company or may fuel a disaster. I have also heard from a couple of my friends that life in IOCL is quite chilled out as compared to others, which should not come as a surprise as IOCL is one of the largest PSU in India in terms of revenue, manpower etc. More the manpower, lesser the load on a single officer, less demanding is the job. But again it is a matter of personal choices. A person who gets physically tired easily would often find difficulty working as a shift officer. Similarly, a person who cannot handle mental pressures would always curse his job if he/she is posted as a sales officer. All in all, these modern day PSU jobs are not your stereotypical Sarkari Babu jobs where you work for 40% of the day, spread your paan ki pichkari on the walls and then curse the government on why India cannot be a developed state.

            "answer_text": "The most demanding PSU, by far, is Coal India Ltd. Right from the start mining engineers are appointed in the statutory post of Shift incharge where you are responsible for the production and safety in mega opencast mines. Heat, cold, rain are no excuses, the mine and machines have to run 365x24x7 and you have to be out there in the field, day shift/night shift, to co-ordinate it all. Just yesterday it was raining and there was a powercut due to the storm. The trucks couldn\u2019t exit the ramp as it was muddied. At 8 pm in total darkness, me and my supervisor got totally drenched planning and supervising the ramp preparation and drain cutting work. While the engineers in ONGC exploration rigs have to do a lot of physical work too, where Coal India differs is the local environment of its mines. Many of its mines have villages on their boundaries. Vibrations due to blasting - the villagers are angry, dust raised due to wind - the villagers are angry, any rehabilitaion and resettlement issue - the villagers are angry. The use of police force to run the mines is not uncommon as are the incidents of assault on managers and other higher officials. Then there are the incidents with local politicians, union people and coal/diesel mafia. In fact the GM, Project Officer and Manager (top three people in a mine) work their ass off year long to deal with all issues and achieve the ever increasing production targets. ",
