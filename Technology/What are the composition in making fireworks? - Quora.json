            "answer_text": "All fireworks are fuel oxidizer mixture. Different oxidizers are used to make colors. Binders of various types are used to glue the material together. Sometimes catalysts are needed to control burn speed or color. There is a book called Pyrotechnics by Weingart which is a good starting place for a budding pyrotechnist. ( People who figure out how to make pyrotechnics.). This is a field that deals with very energetic material and they can maim or kill you. You are allowed one mistake and that is the one you make when you decide to get into the field, the next one may kill you or someone else. Be careful. I know from firsthand experience. ",

            "answer_text": "Fireworks are paper containers that contain pyrotechnic compositions. The paper containers are commonly made from multiple layers of pasted paper, which becomes hard when it dries. The result is a shell or tube that looks/feels like hard cardboard. The specific pyrotechnic compositions found in fireworks varies widely depending on the type of firework in question. Some common pyrotechnic materials used in fireworks include: black powder (and variants related to black powder), colored flame mixtures, spark/\u201cfire dust\u201d compositions, and flash powder. Black powder is the most widely used pyrotechnic mixture in fireworks. It consists of potassium nitrate, charcoal, and sulfur. True black powder has a 75/15/10 mixture ratio (respectively, by mass,) and is milled heavily. There are variants that use different ratios and that are just hand mixed, which are used for different things in fireworks. Now when it comes to colored flame mixtures, spark effects, and to some extent flash powders, there are many different general types of mixtures, and many variations within each type. Fireworks are more diverse than many people realize, so there are a tremendous number of different compositions used. I have only just touched on the most common types. ",
