            "answer_text": "Face ID detection is based on data collection, there are mahy predesigned and pretrainednmodels which helps in detecting the face . every device with face id enabled takes some shots of the user while setting up from all the angles which helps the system to learn and get trained on the face. the models usually detect eyes nose and lips and thats what they lern about, while getting glasses eyes are still visible in the camera so its easy for model to detect and verify, but it wont work with dark shades unless eyes are still visible , since eyes are also important to be detected properly. To learn more search about face id detection models in machine learning. ",
