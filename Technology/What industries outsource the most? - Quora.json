            "answer_text": "To save time and cost many companies outsource their marketing and support tasks some of them are : Email and social media marketing Website live chat Online ads management Online reputation management Content marketing Website and business analytics Data collection etc I have noticed that people who outsourced these activities don\u2019t live up to the expectation; possibly because agencies have different teams handling all the above digital channels. I would suggest that you hire people from other startups/brands that are in the same niche as yours or somewhat related.If you find In-house hiring costly why don\u2019t you hire remote resource at PlugTalent a good platform to hire resource for 40hr/week at an affordable prices and they are experienced enough to handle all tech tasks and helps you to grow your business effectively.
