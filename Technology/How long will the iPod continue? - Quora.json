            "answer_text": "While the days for the iPod classic are definitely numbered, particularly in light of services like iTunes Match that will provide access to a user's complete iTunes library \"in the cloud\" there is still definitely a market for the iPod touch. Not everybody wants their media device with a side-order of smartphone. Some users like to keep the device separate for any number of reasons, including the additional monthly costs of a data plan and related features, preference for a simple \"feature phone\" or a more complicated smart phone, or simply no real need for a cellular phone at all.  Some users also prefer that their media experience be untethered from their online experience, especially if the latter is work-related. The Kindle is popular for some of the same reasons... a separate device that provides a somewhat isolated, distraction-free reading experience. Many people are also already saddled with another model of smartphone, usually as a result of it being provided or required by their employer. I know quite a few users who have BlackBerries for work and have no desire to carry a personal cell phone, but otherwise like having an iPod touch for personal use. Some also prefer another model of smartphone for features that the iPhone doesn't provide, yet prefer the iPod touch for the features that it does. Teens also form a big market for the iPod touch as it's a one-time purchase that doesn't incur any regular, ongoing expenses. Many parents either won't provide their kids with a cellphone at all, or provide a simple pay-as-you-go feature phone to keep costs down.  The iPhone and other smartphones are rarely available on pay-as-you-go plans -- especially not under any kind of contract price. Consider that the real price of an iPhone is $649-$849.  The less expensive prices that many pay are related to 2-3 year cellular contracts that many are unwilling or unable to undertake for various reasons.  When you factor that in, the one-time $199-$399 price tag on an iPod touch is considerably more reasonable. ",

            "answer_text": "This is directed at the \"old\" iPod lineup.  To add to what Jesse said, a lot of people are attracted to the fact that iPods can hold well over 100GB of data and the iDevices a measly 64GB and it's very pricey for that type of investment (64GB iPhone). The one iDevice I could see people buying just for music, the iPod Touch, only goes to 32GB currently.  Though that really applies to people with very large music collections since I think most people prefer the added benefist an iPod Touch gives over a traditional iPod. To echo what Jesse said, the iPod Touch isn't going anywhere. They still have a large market for people who don't want to or can't afford an iPhone and/or an iPad, or simply don't want either of those things.  ",
