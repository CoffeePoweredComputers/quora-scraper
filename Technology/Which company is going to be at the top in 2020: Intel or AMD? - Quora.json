            "answer_text": "To be honest which one is better comes down to personal preference. Both of them these days are following a more cores for less philosophy and they both have weaknesses. The key difference in the last few years is that AMD finally became competitive again giving you that choice. For a very long time AMD chips weren't taken very seriously anymore thanks to drastically lower performance, overheating problems and just generally being seen as the poor man's cpu. Then along came new leadership in the form of Lisa Su. Under the new leadership they turned around their fortunes through a complete redesign of their chips from the ground up. The new Zen architecture and Ryzen brand chips meant that for the first time in nearly a decade they had something that could not only compete with Intel in the high end space but in several respects blow them out of the water. This shook the foundations of pc gaming to its core. Intel who for years had been able to charge whatever they wanted without needing to innovate much thanks to their monopoly suddenly began having to discount their chips and try to pack in more cores to compete. So back to your original question. Both have strong offerings at competitive prices currently. Both have their strengths and weaknesses and even the mid end offerings from both will do well. So it really is down to personal choice of whether you prefer intel or AMD. Quick note: This is assuming your looking at a standard use or gaming pc. If it's the workstation space AMD would probably be the best option thanks to the thread ripper and eypc ranges that offer great performance for a lot less than Intels Xeon chips. ",

            "answer_text": "They are both going to be with roughly equal global market shares when it comes to the consumer market and Intel with around 85% server market share. However, in the mobile space Intel will continue to reign supreme for a while. Ice Lake and Tiger Lake look solid. However, they aren\u2019t coming to the desktop space. So AMD\u2019s Ryzen 3000 CPUs will be the go-to option for most people. The server market might go either way. Ice Lake is expected to arrive with as many as 56 cores. The IPC gain is also going to be significant, so AMD will have tough competition there. Overall, I\u2019d say AMD will have an upper hand in the mainstream desktop market, Intel in the mobile market and in the server market AMD will compete with its aggressive pricing and higher core counts while Intel will continue to hold the performance crown. Intel is also planning to debut its discrete Xe graphics cards, so we\u2019ll have to wait and see how that plays out. Team blue could gain a significant share of the dedicated graphics card market if they play their cards well. Interesting times ",
