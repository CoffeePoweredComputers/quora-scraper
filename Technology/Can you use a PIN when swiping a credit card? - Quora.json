            "answer_text": "Europe, Canada, Asia-in fact everywhere outside if the USA has chip and pin credit cards, The USA for some dumb reason adopted chip and signature, which when traveling is mostly fine as the system will recognize it and print out a receipt to sign instead of asking for a PIN. Unfortunately I have been stuck at an unmanned rail station in Europe with only an automated ticket machine to purchase tickets. My credit card wouldn\u2019t work as I had no PIN number to enter and so I had to board the train without purchasing a ticket- thankfully no one checked so I got away with a free ride. I guess if I got caught I\u2019d have just explained that I tried to buy a ticket, but couldn\u2019t and I\u2019ll happily pay at a place where I can use my chip and signature card. ",
