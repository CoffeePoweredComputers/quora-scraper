That\u2019s what I use:   Those pictures are from 2018. I included them in this answer: Matthew Bates's answer to School teachers on Quora - Do you teach through PowerPoint? Are there any advantages when compared to traditional chalk/ marker based teaching methods? Since then, I\u2019ve bought a giant screen for my classroom, so I don\u2019t have to project onto paper. An iPad has a huge advantage over an Elmo: You can use it to project more than just documents. I use mine to project youtube videos a lot. ",
