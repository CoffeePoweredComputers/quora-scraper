            "answer_text": "None! I have been working with OCR problems for about 5 years now. After dabbling with the usual suspects for a while, I figured out that none of the current OCR technologies on their own can provide a robust business solution.  In my experience, what works best is the combination of machine learning technologies and multiple OCR engines. Different OCR engines have different strengths - some work really great on scanned documents others are good at images captured from mobile.   But once you deploy data science and machine learning technologies on top of the extracted data, you land up with something that is way more potent than vanilla OCR. We have used it for capturing personal details off driving licenses & passports: Identity Fraud Detection Solution & Platform  Extracting details from invoices, expenses: Mobile Based Receipt Scanning & Data Extraction System  and several other use cases. But I do admit, even with machine learning, we are not able to hit that 100% extraction mark... but it has brought us a lot closer than plain OCR. For critical use cases where 100% extraction is must, we end up supporting it through manual intervention but that % is tiny and constantly shrinking. ",

If you need a custom solution then a partner like Optiform can home help you design that solution and fill in the gaps that perhaps ABBYY doesn\u2019t provide. One of the most useful tools is ABBYY Recognition server and for more complex work flows you have ABBYY Flexicapture that can turn your data into useful content to be sent to other systems. ABBYY Recognition Server for Full-Document OCR ABBYY FlexiCapture - Transform business documents into usable data If your looking for a tool kit to build your own applications ABBYY has your back. the Best OCR SDK (API) for Windows, Linux & Mac OS Other solutions exist but you will find many of those solutions are using ABBYY toolkits, so skip those and just get ABBYY.
