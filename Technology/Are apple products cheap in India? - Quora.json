            "answer_text": "The answer depends on your definition for cheap.But comparing the costs of iPhones in various countries....its not.For example, the cost of a 16 gigs 6 plus in US is around 649$ without a contract while the same in India costs you around 55,000 Rs..Speaking in terms of common currencies....the cost of the 16 gigs 6 plus in US is a just a hair above Rs.42000(considering 1$=65 Rs.)That means....an iPhone in India is costlier by 30% than the one in the US by any terms. And contracts are entirely a different level.Considering the Apple's latest iPhone upgrade program....Users are to pay as low as 32$ a month for about 24 months and that includes the premium and hassle_free Apple Care + too....!!! And when they're done with 12 such payments....they're eligible to upgrade their plan to the next latest iPhone which is usually announced once an year....!!! Speaking in terms of net....you get to use a new iPhone for an year paying just Rs.30,000 and the cherry on top is.....you get to change your device for the latest iPhone every year....!!! Isn't that amazing...?!?!?!!! And let me tell you....the iPhone upgrade program offered by Apple is not the cheapest one around.  Now coming to India's contract plans....I remember Vodafone offering an iPhone 6 for about 3600Rs. a month for 24 months and that with no insurance and no upgradeability. Summing it up, it adds up to Rs. 86,500 and this is the cost for the most basic model...16 gigs iPhone 6. Though it covered the talkative n net usage well enough, I think its neither a sensible plan nor an economical one for the consumers. So, yeah.!Apple Products in India are not cheap by any means..!!And here are the links for details that extend beyond India...:) How much an iPhone costs across the worldniPhone Upgrade Program may be a goldmine for Apple Cheers..!!
