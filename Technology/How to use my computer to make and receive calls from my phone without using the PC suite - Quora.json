            "answer_text": "Try this android app named AirDroid: File Transfer/Manage - Android Apps on Google Play AirDroid allows you to access and manage your Android phone or tablet from Windows, Mac or the Web, wirelessly, for free. I'm sure this app will satisfy all your requirements. When i felt lazy to plug usb or when Android Emulator ran slowly I used AirDroid on my pc for debugging my apps wirelessly. But i later realized, i can do that with adb over wireless network enabled. I still use this app occasionally when i feel lazy to pick up my phone. I guess this works on Non-rooted phones too, but mine is rooted, so i didn\u2019t bother to check it. Guess what, Connect your phone to wifi/internet ,grant access to airdroid, throw your phone anywhere and work with your PC with no worries, the notifications work great for all apps. ",
