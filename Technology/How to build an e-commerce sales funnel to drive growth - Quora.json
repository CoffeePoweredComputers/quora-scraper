            "answer_text": "When people visit your eCommerce store, you want them to fill up their carts and spend lots of cash. That\u2019s natural. But what if they don\u2019t? Consumers lead active lives. They\u2019re always hunting for information online, and sometimes they don\u2019t act right away \u2014 at least in the way you want them to. For instance, visitors might bounce immediately. They get called away from the computer screen or they arrive at their destinations and shut off their mobile devices. Whatever the case, you can\u2019t always snag a customer on the first visit. You can, however, bring them into your eCommerce conversion funnel. Start the process of converting them from leads into customers. On YouTube, LinkedIn, and Facebook, I get tons of questions about how to build and optimize an e-commerce conversion funnel. It\u2019s harder than it looks. But I can share a few secrets that have worked for me \u2014 secrets you can deploy today to boost both sales and conversions.  Average Conversion Rate for E-commerce  The 4 E-commerce Conversion Funnel Stages Stage 1: Awareness During the awareness stage, consumers become aware of your brand. They recognize they need to solve a problem or reach a goal, so they look for solutions. Yours is just one they\u2019re likely to stumble upon. That\u2019s why this stage proves so critical. The awareness stage demands educational content from your brand. Show that you\u2019re generous in giving up free information like blog posts, webinars, reports, and guides. We see this play out in television commercials all the time. You might have seen actor Dean Winters in the \u201cMayhem\u201d Allstate insurance commercials. He amuses the audience with his antics, which keeps viewers cognizant of the Allstate brand. Stage 2: Interest Now that you\u2019ve set the hook, you can\u2019t let your audience escape. Continue to provide them with entertainment and educational value so they remain interested in your products. We see this play out in television commercials all the time. You might have seen actor Dean Winters in the \u201cMayhem\u201d Allstate insurance commercials. He amuses the audience with his antics, which keeps viewers cognizant of the Allstate brand. Replicate that strategy by sharing brand-centered memes on social media, creating more useful content for your blog, engaging your audience through email marketing, and posting videos on YouTube. Stage 3: Desire When you have your audience\u2019s interest, create desire. Talk about your product\u2019s benefits \u2014 not its features \u2014 to make your prospective customers want the same great results. Apple does this beautifully. The company doesn\u2019t talk about boring specs (features); instead, it consistently tells its audience that its products are sleek, elegant, easy to use, and secure (benefits). Focus your marketing messages on how the consumer will ultimately benefit. Build your CTAs strategically. Instead of focusing on what you offer, tell the reader how he or she will benefit. Here are two examples CTAs: Grab your own XYZ Backpack and enjoy extra pockets and thicker shoulder strapsGrab an XYZ Backpack for extra storage for your belongings and ergonomic straps that reduce back pain.The second one creates more desire because the reader can visualize the benefits. Stage 4: Action It\u2019s time to close the sale. You want your prospective customers to add your product to their shopping carts, type in their payment information, and click \u201cBuy Now.\u201d As I mentioned before, the average e-commerce site convinces only about 3 percent of its website visitors to take this step. You can do better. Examine your checkout process from end to end. What might cause someone to abandon his or her shopping cart? It might be unnecessary form fields, surprise shipping charges, or a lack of alternative payment methods. Test different checkout pages to see which elements should go and which need to be added. Build an Optimized E-commerce Conversion Funnel Step 1: Identify your customer journey Google Analytics can help you map the customer journey using reports like user flow. Figure out what people do when they arrive on each of your website pages: Do visitors behave differently when they first touch on your homepage than they do if they find one of your product pages?What referring domains bring in the most traffic?And how many touchpoints does the average consumer make before purchasing something?Step 2: Map your funnel stages to conversion triggers Using the four stages outlined above \u2014 awareness, interest, desire, and action \u2014 create a plan for ushering consumers through your sales funnel. List the types of content you want to serve up at each stage, for instance, and the pages on your site you want to test. Step 3: Define the point at which a visitor turns into a lead For most e-commerce businesses, a visitor becomes a lead when he or she hands over contact information \u2014 usually an email address. If that\u2019s the point when a visitor becomes an eCommerce lead, you need a lead nurturing strategy. Decide how you\u2019ll help consumers transition from awareness to interest to desire to action. Your email subscribers should receive content designed for all four stages so you cater to your entire target audience. The Most Important KPIs for Conversion Funnel Optimization Traffic Nobody enters your conversion funnel unless they find your business. You can generate traffic from numerous sources \u2014 social media, search, email forwards, and more \u2014 but you want your traffic to grow steadily. Pay careful attention to where your traffic is coming from. If you\u2019re getting great traffic from search, put more of your marketing dollars and time into content creation and SEO. Maybe you get tons of traffic from Twitter. Tweet more often and pack more value into every tweet. Conversion rate Tracking your conversion rate tells you how well your audience receives your offer(s). It could be a lead magnet to convince people to sign up for your email list or a discount to incentivize a sale. Tracking conversion rates across all offers will help you get to know your audience better. A/B test different offers to see which gets the most engagement, then apply what you\u2019ve learned. Bounce rate Your bounce rate tells you how many of your website visitors leave your site after visiting just one page. You can reduce the bounce rate by introducing more incentives to visit other pages. If you have a high bounce rate, focus on improving your website\u2019s \u201cstickiness.\u201d Include plenty of internal links to other sites on your page as well as CTAs for various offers. Sales Overall sales is another important metric to track. Even if you\u2019re bringing in hundreds of thousands of website visitors every month, your business can go under if you fail to convince them to buy something. Ideally, sales increase over time. You might have certain dips related to factors outside of your control, such as the seasons, but you want a general upward trend. If that isn\u2019t happening, focus more on the action stage of the conversion funnel. Cart abandonment You\u2019ll also want to know how many people put items in their shopping carts, then navigate away from the page without checking out. A high cart abandonment rate suggests a problem with the checkout process. In addition to improving checkout flow, consider sending cart abandonment emails. If someone leaves your site without purchasing the items in their cart, send a reminder notice. Invite them back \u2014 perhaps with a discount code \u2014 to reclaim those lost sales. ",
