            "answer_text": "More blades are the scam of the century! There is no way that multiple blades can do better than a single blade except in one specific area. Having multiple blades on a razors allows the consumer to cut more hair with one swipe. That is the only thing that multiple blades improve about a shave. But there is a trade-off occurring when you add blades. That trade off is irritation potential from removing more skin, and the changed angle of the cut due to having more blades.  For most the trade off is totally unknown. Because many have never shaved with anything other than multi blade razors. But for those of us who know better the best shaves always come from a single blade used in the proper manner. This single blade gives the closest, most comfortable, and longest lasting shave of any type of hair removal. It can be accomplished with a straight razor, a single edge injector style razor, a Safety razor, or a disposable single blade razor.The key to the closest and most comfortable shave is in the preparation and the products used to shave with. You can't use canned shaving creams and do a once over the face shave and expect anything good. You need to learn the art of \"Wetshaving\" as it has been practiced for centuries before. The idea is to get the beard and skin fully hydrated by keeping the face and beard wet for 3-10 minutes before beginning to shave.  Once the beard and face are fully hydrated then one would use a shaving brush and shaving soap to make their own shave lather. This lather will be wetter and better for the skin than commercial shaving creams that are premade. And then the shave will be done using short light strokes on the beard. The razor is NEVER pushed against the face. It is rested against the face in the proper angle and simply guided along. The weight of the razor doing the work. Hair reduction is the goal not total hair removal. To complete the shave multiple passes over the face are used. But remember that you are only passing a single blade over the face each time so the effect on the face is MUCH less damaging than that 5 blade wonder razor.For most wet shavers two or sometimes three passes over the whole face are all that is necessary to remove all the beard and leave the face smooth and irritation free.  When learning to shave properly in this manner it takes some time to unlearn the bad habits that modern razors have taught us all. And there are nicks and cuts sometimes as you learn this new way of shaving. But if you take the time to learn the process and practice, the very best shaves you have ever experienced are soon coming to you.The trade off for this type of shaving is that it takes a bit longer to shave this way because of the prep and the two or three whole face shaves. Expect to take 20 minutes or so when learning. But once you have learned how to do this style of shaving the total time spent will be down to 10-15 minutes total.The best part is that you will have the satisfaction of knowing that the shaves you are getting are the very best that can be done by anyone.To learn more about traditional shaving visit the website: http://www.badgerandblade.com/ ",
