            "answer_text": "There is a great darkness surrounding this question. It seems sustainable technology is tied to inequality, group identity, economic stimulus, jobs, and just about everything else you can think of. No joke, it\u2019s become almost impossible to have this conversation without conflating the issues. As a centrist Democrat who grew up in Minnesota, I find this all very disturbing. No doubt, we have serious equality issues to work out. We should continue to empower minorities and stop over criminalization. We should continue to improve the environment. To your question, we should think critically about our technology and how we improve the environment along with economics. Many folks act as if sustainable technology is synonymous with wind, solar, the battery, and the electric car. This is often accompanied by a belief in improving economics leading to universal adaptation of these technologies. Fair enough\u2026 The problem it that we can\u2019t talk critically about the technology without drowning in that kitchen sink I mentioned earlier. Question anything about the technology and you will be labeled a lukewarm or more likely a climate denier. Yet, there are real problems that need to be addresses with regards to our energy systems. The quintessential things considered to be \u201csustainable technology\u201d are not so perfect as many would have you believe. Here is a parable to illustrate the problem. What is considered sustainable technology today? May I suggest you take a look at Project Drawdown. You will find a list of 80 solutions for climate change. Some of these are clearly technological solutions. Some of the solutions are social changes which are just, if not more, effective. My hope is that we can engage in an honest discussion about which solutions are most appropriate. Regards, APDahlen ",

            "answer_text": "Who is to judge this thing called appropriate, sustainable? Are those not buzz words, or Mantras\u2026 designed to stop thinking and gain rejection? If Communists are to rule world, they say such thing: Who is and who is not allowed to create what is and is not allowed to be created. Progressive (1984-Dystopia) Education teaches that tyrants must dictate what is and isn\u2019t\u2026 what is a Mantra word or action approved, and what is not\u2026 and to heck with liberty. The most important thing to a brainwashed mind, is to approve and be a tyrant of certain things, and disapprove and be a tyrant against certain other things. Basically, under this scheme\u2026 liberty is despised and banished\u2026 and tyranny is approved and blessed. These are the things now attached to the tyranny behind \u201cappropriate and sustainable.\u201d The mantra to use against this argument, is that anything opposing tyranny\u2026 is \u201creactionary.\u201d Do you see how tyranny works in these mantra words?
