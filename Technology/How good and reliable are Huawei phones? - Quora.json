            "answer_text": "Huawei is the second-largest smartphone manufacturer, that has produced more smartphones than Apple but lesser than Samsung. All around the globe, except the US, there is a huge demand for Huawei smartphones. The brand launches high-end devices in Matte and P-lines handset while introduces affordable handsets in honor series. Furthermore, the mesmerizing design along with mindblowing features and specification attracts the audience toward itself. The impressive camera attracts the selfie lowers to itself. At a much lesser price, it offers excellent camera results. In order to target a large number of customers, the company introduces smartphones in all ranges; expensive, and budget-friendly too. According to IDC, the company's premium smartphones establish a strong brand association for its lower-end and mid-range models, which plays a significant role in making the company rank as the second-largest smartphone manufacturer worldwide. However, in US Huawei brand is not considered. Let's have a look why is it so? Due to the controversy between China and the US, none of the network carriers in the US is establishing a deal with Huawei brand. And if the brand is not able to establish a deal with any single network carrier than it can never succeed in the US as mostly the residents in the US always purchase their smartphones from a reliable network carrier. Not only this but Google also announced that it was restricting access to many of its applications. And Huawei solely depends on Google as all its smartphones run on Google\u2019s Android operating system. If Google restrict its access, then the individuals won't be able to update applications from Google Play Store Therefore in the short term, Huawei's phone may get security and applications update, but in the long term, the scenario is uncertain. This makes it risky to recommend buying Huawei devices at this stage. ",

A: They are terrible, with a high failure My company supports almost million users every year and the one complaint we hear year after year is how their Huawei phones have so many glitches (hardware failures) and how dissatisfied they are with that inferior productHuawei has billions in revenue every year so they advertise their phones to use them as part of their marketing strategy but the truth is that even their premium phones have a huge failure rate that is not commensurate with how expensive those phones are. Huawei actually does not make any profit on any of their phones, they are all sold as Loss Leaders to get the name of Huawei out in front of as many consumer eyes as is possibleLoss leader - Wikipedia",
