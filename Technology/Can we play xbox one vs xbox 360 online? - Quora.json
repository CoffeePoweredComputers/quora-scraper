            "answer_text": "You can play any back-compatible Xbox 360 game on the Xbox One with a person playing the same game on the 360, so long as the person on the Xbox One is playing using a 360 disk. Press the View and Menu buttons together to bring up the Xbox 360 menu (On the X1), and create the party there. It won\u2019t allow cross-console party creation, and you need to create an Xbox 360 party, even if both people are playing on an Xbox One on a back-compatible game. I tested this using Halo 4, two players using an Xbox One (separately), and two players split-screen playing on an Xbox 360, using the Halo 4 Special Edition disk for the Xbox 360. ",

            "answer_text": "Contrary to the other answers, you CAN play online multiplayer with xbox one and 360. For the most part, it only works with games that are backwards compatible. When you load a backwards compatible 360 game on your Xbox one, it essentially loads up the 360 os, dashboard, etc. You are playing the exact same 360 game as the 360 gamers, your Xbox one is just emulating a 360. Gamertags, friends lists, leader boards all work just like they do on 360. ",
