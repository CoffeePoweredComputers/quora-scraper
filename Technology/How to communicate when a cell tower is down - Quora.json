            "answer_text": "Q: How do you communicate when a cell tower is down? Unless you are in a rural area, your phone is likely to be using several towers at the same time. The communication is sent is short packets and jumps back and forth using different frequencies to different towers. In the days of analogue cell phones, the phone was in contact with just one tower, and it was fairly common for the user/phone to move into a null spot for the particular tower. If the phone was out of contact with its tower for a few seconds, the call could be dropped, or the user could suddenly find that they were connected to a totally different party. If the phone could not receive handover commands because it was in a null spot, then the network could not switch the phone to a different cell. With digital phones, when a null is encountered this will clip the audio a little bit, and an odd syllable may be missed, however, the other towers that the phone is using can continue provide coverage and maintain reasonable coverage and can manage any changes of tower that is needed. In rural areas, where the phone may only be in range of one tower, then null spots and tower break downs can mean the loss of a connection. Going back to the question, other alternatives are: Land line.Semaphore flags.Aldis lamp.Walky talky, CB or amateur radio.If face to face - just talk to each other.There are many other possibilities.
