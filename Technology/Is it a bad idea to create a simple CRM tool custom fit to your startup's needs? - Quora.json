            "answer_text": "I think it makes sense, as it gives you many benefits. Custom CRM systems take into account the company's strategic development plans. It is easy to add a new feature if the business requires it. The cost of creating a custom CRM also isn\u2019t small, but in the case of individual development, you pay for the functions required by your company. Additionally, employees don\u2019t have to spend a lot of time on mastering the product, as CRM will initially be created under the already established workflow in the company. Many enterprise software giants such as Salesforce, SAP and Oracle offer their own CRM solutions, but they are extremely difficult to integrate. Moreover, they aren\u2019t always suitable for small and medium businesses. Here you can learn how to create a CRM tailored exactly to your company and even how much it will cost.  ",

            "answer_text": "Completely understand your predicament. After all, this has been a question that people grappled with for more than few years :) Lately we have been seeing a strong tendency to use a off-the-shelf system rather than develop one. Less upfront costsHopefully better scalability since most of the other users in the industry are already using the systemYou get to focus on your core business rather than focusing on how to maintain your IT systems to support the core businessThat said, there are lot of case studies where people did go with custom solutions to their problems. If you have a business model that no one else seems to be following and you are in a niche that no one else understands, probably it makes more sense to develop your own rather than expend energy on something that won't work.
