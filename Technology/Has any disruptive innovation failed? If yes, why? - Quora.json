            "answer_text": "It's very often that Disruptive Innovations fail. Failed Disruptive Innovations fall into 2 categories, one is simply a commercial failure and the other is a niche product/service. What they have in common with each other and with successful Disruptive Innovations is the value propostion they provide (A) is unlike that provided by the predominant paradigm and (B) has the potential to displace that of the predominant paradigm. In cases where the potential for displacement (B) can only be identified by its taking place, then the latter condition is referred to as a tautology - a circular definition (if A, then A) which would mean (as others have said) that a Disruptive Innovation cannot fail and be a Disruptive Innovation. That said, in cases where the preference for the new paradigm is clear, and a viable value proposition can be developed to enable that result, then that innovation can be considered Disruptive apriori. As an example, there is a function in your cell phone that allows it to communicate with other phones nearby without using the cell carrier. Development of technlogy that would facilitate even sparse transmssions (like text messages) to be forwarded through multiple phones to reach phones that would otherwise be out of range would a Disruptive Innovation before the fact since we know that eventual ubiquity would make the carrier function redundant. Initial attempts at developing and/or deploying such technology may fail to achieve viability, much less immediately overwhelm existing markets, and therein we have the potential for the failure of what we know to be Disruptive Innovation. That said, because we know that once Pandora's box has been opened, the inevitable will eventually take place, any and all faliures do not affect the status of the concept as Disruptive. Sorry for being so wordy - hope that helps. ",

Why\u2019s that you might ask? If we can fly with 1.000 , 2.000 or 3.000 miles per hour, why don\u2019t we do it? Several reasons: Aerodynamic resistance increases significantly if you get to sonic and supersonic speeds. Only the military has the kind of money to support that kind of operation.Noise outside of the aircraft. Sometimes you\u2019ll hear a supersonic boom from an military aircraft. Now imagine 100\u2019s flights across the US which drag this boom the whole time from east to the west!Noise within the aircraft. The concorde was tiny and it was really loud inside.Structural damage. The supersonic boom has also the ability to grind any kind of (older) building to dust.Low transport capacity due to the insane amount of fuel requiered.Safety issueshttps://flyawaysimulation.com/media/images1/images/concorde-crash-paris.jpg ",

            "answer_text": "While this appears to be a clear question, it\u2019s actually not. Many, many innovations are claimed to be disruptive that do not meet the standards defined in the Wikipedia article.Many innovations are attempted that are believed to have the potential to be disruptive but then fail because they cannot succeed in implementation or by gaining market share. (In which case, I believe we should categorically say the proposed innovation was not disruptive.)In fact, reading the Wikipedia description, I\u2019ll postulate that only successful innovations can ever be determined to be disruptive. (And I\u2019ll welcome comments discussing how that postulation is incorrect.) There is an \u201cin between\u201d group of innovations which are hoped to be massively disruptive but which only reach a moderate level of market success - far less than the disruption expected in their early days. In my own work, I find claims of disruption to be primarily valuable in marketing efforts to potential investor or within PR. They have not proven effective either in the planning of innovation nor the market execution of innovations. ",
