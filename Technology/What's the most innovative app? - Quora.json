            "answer_text": "TraffickCam- To Stop Human Trafficking. There's a new smartphone app that's asking people from around the world to help stop human trafficking. Human trafficking - including that of underage children - sex slavery and trade have been that poisoned limb of society that we have just had too much trouble getting rid of. With hundreds and hundreds of cases of children being trafficked and forced into sex slavery around the world each day, and the instrument of the Internet serving as a conduit for the same, certain aggressive measures have to be taken by all of us to put an end to these heinous crimes A free app available on iPhone, iPad and Android systems, TraffickCam is asking its users to upload at least four pictures of the hotel rooms they are staying at, whenever they travel. These pictures will then be uploaded onto a database to keep a tab on them. \"You just enter your hotel room, and your room number. You take four pictures, and you submit them to the website. And, then those become part of the pipeline that law enforcement can use to track down where the victims are being trafficked.\" Washington University Researcher and TraffickCam developer Abby Stylianou.  The idea came up when the police wanted to identify a hotel where children had been trafficked. A few years ago, an American police department sought help from a non-profit organization, The Exchange Initiative, formed by the Nix Conference and Meeting Management, on how they could end sex trafficking of young kids. When the police showed an employee a picture of the hotel room in which the victim was, she knew exactly where it was located.  The pictures from the database are cross-referenced with available pictures showing victims of human trafficking. The Internet, it seems, is a cesspool full of criminals openly advertising their heinous actions. It is flooded with thousands of pictures of victims of sex trafficking posed on beds in hotel rooms. The app makes it much easier for the authorities to identify the location of where the victims were and where they could possibly be.  At the moment, TraffickCam has a database with millions of pictures of hotel rooms from across the world. And, even you could be part of the initiative and add to the database. It could mean saving the life of an innocent child. Time to join the cause. ",

            "answer_text": "What I think an innovative app is the one that adds fun and removes the frustration of using a smart phone. Well I have the following that filled my gaming on smart phone with fun and eased up my single handed phone usage. Play J  Play j is a great way to stream your screen with your friends and video chat with them at the same time. The idea is simple just make sure your friend also has the app add them by texting them a request select the app you like to show off and then choose the chat style and hit launch. Once your friend answers the call he or she will be able to see your screen where you can show them your amazing Angry Bird skills or have them help you with a problem that you're having with your phone. Reach ability cursor We all know that bones displays are getting bigger each year and these devices are getting harder to use with just one hand reaching the top part of the screen requires re positioning your hands so you can tap or swipe a single object. So here's a solution try out reach ability cursor. When swiping from either side of the screen you can pull up a digital d-pad to control the top part of your phone with a cursor drag it around to move the cursor and tap on it to click it the d-pad then disappears when you tap away from it or after a few seconds of inactivity it's perfect for tapping on those Instagram stories or the address bar in Google Chrome. Lawnchair 2 Of course I have to throw in my favorite launcher it's called lawnchair 2 and it's not in the Play Store but on APK Mir. Essentially it's a replication of Google picks a stock launcher app but it has a few extra features for customization. Such as I compact support theming grid size gestures backup and restore and other features you find any typical third-party launcher. If you want to know a great alternative that is a nova launcher, I also recommend Hyperion launcher. It's pretty feature packed with plenty of unique features like bond configurations, fingerprint authentications for your private apps, very detailed options for themes and so forth. Fluid navigation gestures The third app though the third app is actually fluid navigation gestures. I've had much shares of horrible navigation bar implementations in the past but fluid navigation gesture just isn't one of them. It's bubbly animations really brings something unique to the table and it gives you a bit more screen real estate one compared to the regular pike gesture navigation bar. Swiping up from the center will jump the phone to the home screen swiping and holding will bring up my recent page swiping from the left will go back and swiping on the right will bring down the notifications panel but I can configure the app to launch whatever tasks I'd like with whatever gesture. MNML Screen Recorder You know there aren't that many great screen recorder apps for Android nowadays. A lot of them have ads or are a bit outdated so it's kind of a relief to finally find one that is simple easy to use and record some the best resolution possible. It doesn't even have ads which should be a plus for a lot of people. A very straightforward app that gets the job done. Otter Voice Notes If you are one of those college students who secretly requires the professor's hour-long lectures just in case you missed something he said or you didn't understand any particular subject he was talking about but those voice recordings tend to be really long and you don't enjoy listening to his hour-long lectures all over again. So I just recommend you to use otter voice notes to transcribe the recordings automatically. Then I can quickly search something he was talking about like a math problem and boom there it is. I just love how this app keeps all your conversations in the cloud so you can quickly access your conversations on other devices. And if you voice record with this app it will transcribe the conversations in real time which is next-level stuff. If you snap a picture while you're recording it will add the visual content to the conversations in line you can even create groups for inviting people to view and share your recordings. There are plenty more features within this app huge thumbs up. ",
