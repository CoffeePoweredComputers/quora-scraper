            "answer_text": "If you don\u2019t feel comfortable fixing computers: bring it to the nearest computer repair shop. If you do, you can try replacing the ram (an issue mostly associated with the symptoms you describe). A good way to check if this is the issue, is if you have two ram sticks inserted in your pc, remove one of them(remove ram sticks only when it\u2019s turned off), then turn the pc back on to see if it is fixed. If it isn\u2019t, re-insert the removed ram stick, and remove the other one, then start the pc again and see if that fixed the issue. If it didn\u2019t, it\u2019s not the ram, and you have crossed one problem of the list of possible problems ;) ",

            "answer_text": "Two possible scenarios. Number 1 the power supply is having issues, so if you have one sitting around that can run the rest of the rig I\u2019d try that. Else it might be trying to spit out an error code with the beeps, but this is unlikely due to it only being one beep. If it\u2019s failing to even do an error code then that sounds like either the motherboard or power supply are on death\u2019s door. Without having the technical specs I\u2019d try a local computer shop or repair service. Sorry for not being of more use. ",
