Unfortunately corporations are dragging feet on this technology so they can milk OLED some more. Fun fact: yellow night shift display filters have never existed in LED LCD displays, that\u2019s because they didn\u2019t flicker. OLED displays flicker, that\u2019s why it\u2019s impossible to use at night, not because of blue light. Google \u201cOLED flicker\u201d ",

You can\u2019t ask a question about \u201cwhat X is better\u201d without providing at least some context or some idea of the criteria on which this judgement should be made. I see several people claiming that \u201cOLED is the best technology available,\u201d but a flat statement like that isn\u2019t very helpful or even necessarily true. What is most important in the application you\u2019re considering? Cost? Reliability? Color accuracy? Brightness and contrast? Weight? And on and on and on\u2026 ",
