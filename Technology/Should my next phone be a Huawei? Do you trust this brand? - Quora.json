Huawei phones are cheap overseas and here (much cheaper than apple) so why do you need some kind of super modern model when you just need something that can call, message, have wifi connection etc. Huawei is a great option for kids as they don\u2019t have an App Store with English apps (you\u2019ll need to go through a series of steps to get google play store) so you wont have to worry about overspending on games.
