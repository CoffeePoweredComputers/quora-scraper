            "answer_text": "I do not think by the term \u201dholograms\u201d you just mean \u201c a physical structure that diffracts light into an image\u201d because we already have such a stucture. If you broaden the definition of the term to include screen-free images or images floating in the air such as the holo-projection of Princess Leia in Star Wars, then at the moment they are physically impossible. Such images require quantum manipulation of photons, and we do not have such technology on Earth. Instead, we have screen-based 3D displays which include laser holograms, glass-based displays and glass-free displays. Technologies using mirrors to create an illusion of holographic images do not qualify as holographic devices, and neither do volumetric displays. Our current screen-based 3D technologies provides different images to each eye and the brain combine the images together into one with depth perception. In fact, some of these displays provide far more realistic stereoscopic images than the Starwars holo-projections. The only disadvantage is the requirement of a screen resulting in smaller viewing angles as compared with the Starwars screenless technology. I have recently obtained a US patent for a new glass-free 3D viewing method which allows multiple viewing positions and seems to fit your implied description. I have uploaded a youtube video explaining how the technology works.  The new technology allows a more natural glass-free 3D viewing by an entire family or a cinema full of viewers. There is no loss of definition or brightness. It does not require a high definition display nor any digital signal conversion. Glass-free viewing by multiple people with the new technology is achieved by using three lenticular layers instead of one to split and redirect light beams to multiple viewers. I hope you find the video helpful. ",

            "answer_text": "I think you are mixing what modern real science is calling a \u201chologram\u201d with the use of the term in science fiction. Science fiction has indeed extended that term beyond what is physically possible. Not only by current technology, but possibly by technology altogether. What we see on the holodeck of Star Trek is pure fantasy if done with light only. But what we are currently calling a hologram in technology parlance is not a 3D visual projection, viewable from all angles. Instead we use the term on much more humble devices. Holography - Wikipedia is the capturing of a light field, rather than an image formed with a lens. It can indeed produces a perfect visual replica of the original object, without special glasses or something similar, but has lots of limitations. Currently we can only do it in \u201cblack and white\u201d because it requires a laser to create the light field in way we can capture it. It is a still image,not a moving one. And this is then stored and viewed on either volumetric displays (tanks) or on 2D surfaces, like the hologram on your credit card. But that is a hologram. Just not the kind projected into thin air, like R2D2 does of Princess Leia in Star Wars. Star Wars, of course, is science-fantasy, not science fiction, so not the best example. That limit on projection also applies to the very common use of floating computer displays without the use of a screen. You\u2019re right. We don\u2019t have any ability to do that (without wearing glasses), if that was your point. Still, it looks pretty cool. ",

That\u2019s \u201c3D display technology.\u201d Volumetric display. It\u2019s not IMpossible. But we currently don\u2019t have the technology to do that. We\u2019re coming close though, see this video below, using sculpted plasma from a kilowatt pulse-laser.  These are tiny explosions of ionized air. QUTE NOISY! Better hold your ears! So \u2026not a hologram. It\u2019s a 3D display. The R2D2 \u201chologram\u201d of Princess Leia, it actually it might be based on Star Wars blaster-weapons. Turn your blaster\u2019s Megajoules setting way down. Now focus it to a point, so it makes a glowing dot that hovers in empty space. Now scan that glowing dot as a 3D raster. Use this moving dot to paint any 3D picture! But the only color will be blue-violet: the color of sparks and ionized air. In the above photo, note the blue beam that issues from R2D2\u2019s projector! That beam is anomalously intense. Movie projectors don\u2019t do that, not in a lighted workshop, unless the air is visibly dusty. To get a blue beam as shown aobve, the intensity must be so enormous that the air itself is breaking down. Don\u2019t wave your hand through the image of Princess Leia. It will burn all the hairs off of the back of your hand! Possibly remove your fingerprints! Heh, that could become a little sideline story in the SW universe. Droids have \u201chologram\u201d projectors? Can they project the image of a single tiny dot? Perhaps turn the brightness up a bit? Then it\u2019s time for 3rd-law violations! Aim it at Jawas! Slice their robes to ribbons, fry their eyeballs! Ah, but we don\u2019t want our \u201cslide projectors\u201d to ever be dangerous. So, only an R2-unit with ILLEGAL MODS to their \u201chologram generator\u201d could use it as a weapon. If you buy one used, you\u2019ll never know what you\u2019re getting. Maybe it\u2019s a Resistance guerilla fighter, and espionage unit, full of all sorts of illegal mods. . ",
