            "answer_text": "If you want you can but i'll advice not to.... Below are reasons for not using laundry detergent in dishwasher :- 1. Laundry detergents are made differently than dishwasher cleansing agents because you need more harsh chemicals to clean clothes. 2. The laundry detergents are really hard to wash away and if you use them to wash your dishes then your dishes will not be properly cleaned. There might be a layer of detergent left which can make you sick. 3. Laundry detergents use fragrance to make clothes smell good. And if you use them to wash your dishes, your food will also smell like that. Thank you for reading.

            "answer_text": "Yes, you can use laundry detergent in the dishwasher, but you probably shouldn\u2019t for a couple of reasons. One, using a product that wasn\u2019t meant for the use of the dishwasher can impact the life expectancy of it as well as voiding the warranty on the appliance if it was purchased. Two, the products in the laundry detergent may not clean the dishes as well as actual dishwasher soap as well as it leaving residue after being cleaned. Furthermore, there are ingredients used in laundry detergent that should not be used on dishes such as fragrances, stain removers, and brighteners. Each have unique formulas created to work correctly when with the right appliance. ",

            "answer_text": "No. The reason we have different soaps and detergents for cleaning and washing is that each has a different purpose. There are special cleaning agents to remove food from your dishes and cutlery just as there are stain removers and water conditioners for your clothes. Then there's the foam factor. While HE detergent has a low sudsing action, there basically isn't any in dishwasher detergent. The former, therefore, would be inappropriate to use in a dishwasher. ",

Not to mention, trying to get the remnants of the wrong detergent removed from your dishwasher, which is a painstaking and sometimes impossible process. ",
