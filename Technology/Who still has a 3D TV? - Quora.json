To me personally it\u2019s a more interesting and enjoyable feature than UHD or HDR - though I do wish I\u2019d been able to snag one of the 4K sets with 3D support before they stopped making them. I\u2019ve got 48 Blu-ray 3D movies (and counting) and I more or less refuse to watch most of them flat. I can only see myself switching to a new TV either when this one dies or if they start making 3D sets again. ",
