            "answer_text": "It depends what they want to study.  If it's something that they can replicate and/or model on earth, they'll do that and look to see how tweaking things changes behaviors.  Much of science is about explaining things mathematically, and so they'll often try to determine whether or not their equations predict the behavior they subsequently observe. As far as things that can't be replicated terrestrially, they look at them.  All our knowledge of the universe beyond our solar system comes from light.  However, there is a new frontier emerging, with gravitational wave detectors (almost analogous to listening to the universe) having been built and started becoming operational. ",

            "answer_text": "They sit for hour and hours and watch it. It's a combination of many things to u dressing it: you need chemist (it's understanding how metals react under certain conditions), theorist, physicist, geologist etc\u2026long list of professionals working together. Remember, whatever is relative to the universe (interns of metal reactions) is relative to earth except things act differently under higher pressure, gravity and heat\u2026so\u2026they do experiments here , on a smaller scale, to see what will happen. Large telescopes help too. ",
