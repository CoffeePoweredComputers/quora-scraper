            "answer_text": "One factor holding back the immersivity of virtual reality experiences is the \"screen-door effect\", where individual pixels on the display are discernible. This leads to the sensation that the images you're seeing in the head mounted display are on the other side of a screen door, hence the name.  The simplest solution to the screen-door effect is to increase the pixel density of the display until the individual pixels are no longer discernible. Some say that's 60 pixels per degree (PPD) of field of view (FOV), others say it's more complicated than that.  The Oculus Rift DK2 has a resolution of 960 x 1080 per eye and a FOV of approximately 100 degrees horizontal. That's 10.8 PPD of FOV. If we use 60 PPD as the target number, that means we need displays with 5-6 times the pixel density of the DK2 to start to put the screen-door effect to bed.  For a 100 degree horizontal FOV display, that means we need 6000 horizontal pixels. For a 180 degree horizontal FOV display, we need 10,800 horizontal pixels. There are many other factors affecting immersivity, including FOV (higher is better, generally). I hope we hear more about them from some other folks! ",
