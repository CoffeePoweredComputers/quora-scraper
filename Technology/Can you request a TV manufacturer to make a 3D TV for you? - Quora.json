Trust me, I have the last and greatest 3D TV made and love it, would love to have the ability to get another. You could definitely talk them into it for the right price - would require getting together people that understand it, bringing out machines that have been shut down for manufacturing\u2026 it would probably require a few hundred thousand at least to have them custom make something. You\u2019d be better off getting one off eBay - some are unopened and new there too. ",
