Measuring 129 x 65 x 9.3 mm (5.08 x 2.56 x 0.37 in) and weighing 140 g (4.94oz) The iPhone 12 mini is not very far in size: 131.5 x 64.2 x 7.4 mm (5.18 x 2.53 x 0.29 in). And it\u2019s lighter too: 135 g (4.76oz) Comparing the two? The 12 Mini is a bit taller, but narrower. And MUCH thinner than the XZ1 by Sony. ",
