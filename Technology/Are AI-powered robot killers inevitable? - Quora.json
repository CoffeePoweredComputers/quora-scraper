            "answer_text": "Original Question: \u201cAre AI-powered robot killers inevitable?\u201d <Begin dodgy impression of professor Farnsworth from Futurama> Sadly, no. We must roll up our sleaves and work long hours to make it happen\u2026 <End dodgy impression of professor Farnsworth from Futurama> Oh, wait\u2026 You were going in the other direction on this weren\u2019t you..? Throughout history people atracted to power have always had certain ambitions. Two of them are: \u201cGain more devoted followers\u201d (Both numerically and in terms of devotion) and \u201cdestroy all opposition\u201d. The creation of AI controlled robots provides an opportunity for as many followers as any would-be despot could hope for. It also provides the opportunity for as many potential rescuers , that are willing to enter hazardous environments as we could hope for. You see, even AI controlled robots are just tools, shells waiting to be motivated by a programmer. Help or hinder, save or condemn, fix or destroy, these are all motivations that are decided by the owner / creator. Otherwise they wouldn\u2019t have any use and wouldn\u2019t be built in the first place. Don\u2019t fear the tool, fear motives of the owner. So\u2026 TLDR version: Yes. They are inevitable (and may already be deployed). But there were always plenty of human beings willing to do anything an AI controlled robot would do, anyway. ",
