            "answer_text": "Spirit Board App? Is that a thing? Here is my very strong opinion about this; If you are using anything as a contouring device, whether it is a board game, a deck of cards, a crystal or even an app- you are very likely going to conjure something. You don\u2019t have to be a medium to do this. The problem is that you have no idea WHAT you are conjuring. You could invite anything from the ethers and the thing that comes won\u2019t always tell you the truth. This is the fundamental difference between people who are not mediums and people who are. MEDIUMS DON\u2019T CONJURE! Mediums are natural doorways. We have to learn to close it, not open it. PLEASE don\u2019t use conjuring tools. This app sounds like a very bad idea. Now you have entities made of energy being asked to interact with tech. Great. ",
