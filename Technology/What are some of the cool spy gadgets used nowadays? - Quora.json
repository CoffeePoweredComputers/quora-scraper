Because spies live and work among us ,they are forced to use everyday items to store sensitive files and transfer super-important information. Designed for one shot, a 4,5-mm-caliber pistol-lipstick is a classic of the spy genre. Presumably, the weapons were confiscated from a KGB agent in the mid-1960s. Did you ever manage to apply the \"kiss of death\" in practice, and remained a mystery. A tiny camera Model F-21, released by the KGB in 1970, was inserted into the buttonhole and triggered by a mechanism hidden in the pocket. One click was enough to open the fake button-shutter and take a picture. In the 1960s, the Chief Intelligence Directorate of East Germany (HVA), the Stasi, produced a camera for microscopy, which photographed documents and reduced the text to the point size. In this way, agents could hide secret messages from all in sight. In the 1960s and 1970s Western diplomats working in Eastern Europe preferred to order clothes and shoes in the West. This took advantage of the intelligence services of Romania, intercepting parcels in the post and installing in the heels of recording devices, transmitters. The Wehrmacht cipher machine \"Enigma\" looked like an ordinary typewriter, although it was not so. The keyboard was connected to the rotors, which several times converted the signal, which comes when the key is pressed. This encryption disk was used by Southerners Confederates during the Civil War in the USA (CSA stands for Confederate States of America - Confederate States of America). The mechanism of the device is simple: just rotate the inner wheel to change the letters in places. But things get more complicated at times if the secret message is written in an unknown language. The Bulgarian secret agent used exactly the same umbrella to kill the dissident George Markov on London Street in 1978. Inside the usual umbrella there was a mechanism that allows injecting a poison when the button is pressed. Markov was poisoned by a potent natural poison ricin. Flying over enemy territory with an automatic camera, pigeons could obtain valuable information. In addition to photographing, these birds were engaged in delivering messages if radio communication was interrupted. Services pigeons enjoyed until the 1950's. ",
