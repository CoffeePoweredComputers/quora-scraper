            "answer_text": "CCD:CCD sensor technology has been dominant in image applications since the technology debuted in the late 1960\u2019s. However, its analog design is based on a \u201cbucket brigade architecture\u201d and requires a non-standardfabrication process that is both complicated and costly to optimize. It is difficult for commercially viable sensor arrays to integrate analog-to-digital conversion (ADC) for digital processing onto CCDs, or to customize them by adding logic blocks to the chip for specific applications. Their high voltage (+12 to +20 Volts) and power requirements shorten battery life and limit their applicability in small form factor, portable devices. Moreover, the need to add external supporting components (including analog front end, timing circuit,reference voltage, correlated double sampling, mechanical shutter and RAM) results in large printed circuit board real-estate requirements, contrary to the trend of miniaturization in weight and size. CMOS APS:CMOS sensors were developed in the early 1980\u2019s. Passive pixel sensor (PPS) image sensors were the first products in this family to come to market. The large feature sizes available in existing CMOS technology allowed only a single transistor and three interconnecting lines for each pixel. The speed andsignal-to-noise-ratio of PPS was significantly lower than that of CCD sensors. In the 1990s, APS technology added an amplifier to eachpixel. This increased sensor speed and improved thesignal-to-noise-ratio, providing a big advantage over PPSsensors.When deep sub-micron CMOS technologies andmicro-lenses appeared, APS became the alternative sensortechnology. Its low power consumption and near-standardmanufacturing process made it a competitor to CCDsensors for certain applications.

            "answer_text": "Get a CCD Camera is always your best choice. Why? CCD produce more video quality than CMOS. CCD sensors, create high-quality, low-noise images. CMOS sensors, traditionally, are more susceptible to noise.CMOS traditionally consumes little power. Implementing a sensor in CMOS yields a low-power sensor.CCDs use a process that consumes lots of power. CCDs consume as much as 100 times more power than an equivalent CMOS sensor.CMOS chips can be fabricated on just about any standard silicon production line, so they tend to be extremely inexpensive compared to CCD sensors.CCD sensors have been mass produced for a longer period of time, so they are more mature. They tend to have higher quality and more pixels.Perfect for indoor and outdoor useBecause each pixel on a CMOS sensor has several transistors located next to it, the light sensitivity of a CMOS chip tends to be lower. Many of the photons hitting the chip hit the transistors instead of the photodiode.Based on these differences, you can see that CCDs tend to be used in cameras that focus on high-quality images with lots of pixels and excellent light sensitivity. CMOS sensors traditionally have lower quality, lower resolution and lower sensitivity. CMOS sensors are just now improving to the point where they reach near parity with CCD devices in some applications. Espymall- all out SD card and battey operated serious Hidden Cameras produced with Sony CCD camera, compare with other cheaper CMOS hidden cameras, CCD Hidden Cameras are more expensive, valueable, and with higher video quailty. CCD hidden camera is harder to find in the market, and once you got one, you will never judge it. ",
