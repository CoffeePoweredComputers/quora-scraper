That doesn\u2019t have to mean trying ot only deal in the next big thing. You can get very rich doing that sometimes, or you can get it seriously wrong, because that\u2019s where the biggest competition is, and which results in cutthroat margins. You need to know at least as much about your customers as the products you intend to sell them. And keep an eye out for both novelty and quality that will appeal to them. You may be a lot better off shifting a thousand items with a \u00a360 markup than fifty thousand on which you can only make \u00a31. You aren\u2019t looking for the next big thing, you are looking for your next big thing (which might not be very different from your last big thing) ",
