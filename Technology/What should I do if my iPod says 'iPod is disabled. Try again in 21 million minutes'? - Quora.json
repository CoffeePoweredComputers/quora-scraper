            "answer_text": "If an iPod has entered the passcode too many times, it locks for a certain number of hours. Each time it happens it locks for longer. Someone entered the passcode so many times that it's essentially locked forever.  You can put it into recovery mode and restore it on a computer using iTunes. If it has iOS 7 on it, you'll need to enter your iCloud password when you set it up again.  If you recently bought this iPod and it was like this when you bought it, it was likely stolen. ",
