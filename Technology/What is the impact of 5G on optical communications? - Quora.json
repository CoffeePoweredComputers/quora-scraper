            "answer_text": "I could interpret your question in two ways: impact of 5G on market of optical communicationsimpact of 5G on optical communications as a technologyIn the terms of market of optical communications, as answered earlier by some experts, the deployment of 5G networks is going to be a major contributor towards expansion of optical communications equipment market. In terms of optical communications as a technology, the need for high-speed/low-latency in 5G networks has posed a number of challenges to various aspects of optical communication technology. The deployment of 5G networks is going to result in large CAPEX for service providers and therefore, there is a need to develop low-cost and reliable equipment which can meet the high-speed/low-latency requirements of 5G networks. There is a need to develop advanced materials which can improve performance of existing optical communication devices. Graphene and some 2D nano-materials are being studied for their production of opto-electronic devices. 2D Transition Metal Dichalcogenide (2DTMD) and Black Phosphorus are two of the most prominently studied 2D nanomaterials. Extensive research is also taking place in the field of Silicon Photonics, Silicon Microring, and Fibre Bragg Grating for their application in optical devices such as lasers, filters, modulators etc. For more information, you can refer to: http://www.intricateresearch.com/developments-in-optical-communication.html ",

            "answer_text": "Optical transport is already very important for 4G systems to provide backhaul services from cell site located 4G LTE eNBs to the core network. 5G changes this in many ways: Existing cell sites will need improved transport capacity to carry the increasing traffic from 5G access. This means either enghanced optical links or transformation from microwave to opticalNew small cell sites used for mmWave 5G access will need new optic transport linksIncreasing adoption of cloud RAN architecture will mean that the cell site transport requirements move from backhaul to fronthaul links. This brings radio performance benefits but introduces the need for lower transport latency and a higher overhead compared to user bitrates.In other words, optical transmission will become increasingly important as operators rollout 5G mobile services. Organisations like CPRI Forum, MEF, NGMN and GSMA have all recognised this issue and are working now on solutions in parallel to 3GPP work on the 5G function specifications. ",

            "answer_text": "5G network is totally revolutionary. It has the ability to enable and inspire a new wave of technological transformation that can alter the way we live and work. 5G is different because of its ability to enable the vision of a candidly connected community. The increasing collaboration will certainly provide more favorable services to the citizen. The evolution of 5G is widely different from its previous steps. The upcoming trends of 5G wireless will stay dependent on fiber implementation. ",
