            "answer_text": "Not all companies need outsourcing, but it did wonders for the businesses that decided to outsource. It\u2019s the right decision if: You\u2019re working on a limited budget. Sometimes hiring an in-house staff can be too expensive, especially for a small business or a start-up. Outsourcing to virtual assistants from other countries, like the Philippines, are cost-effective as they usually cost less compared to Western standards, but are as skilled and competitive.You are dealing with a highly specialized task. Many virtual assistants are skilled professionals who are experts in web development, digital marketing, and customer support among others. Outsourcing to VAs the tasks where you do not have expertise is a great idea to boost efficiency.You want to free up your time.
