            "answer_text": "'Ideonomy' is either a very archaic term recently revived or a new term that refers to an already well-established field (or several). Rather than seeking specialization in 'ideonomy' and its applications per se, therefore, perhaps it would be better to follow the literature on the topic itself (i.e., as \"the science of ideas\"), look into the materials used to teach the subject in the few places where it's offered as a central topic of study, and then consider more comprehensive areas of academic study and application that subsume or include ideonomy with their scope.  In a world and society so thoroughly dominated by science and technology as our 21st-century life, there are no areas in which the \"science of ideas\" isn't relevant or through which applications aren't pursued. Philosophy of language, cognitive science, machine cognition, artificial intelligence, psychology and psychiatry, for example, are just a few obvious areas where 'ideonomy' would be involved and relevant.  Caveat: I do not claim to be an expert on 'ideonomy.' Pun intended, it's a new idea to me, and I am not at all familiar the specific concepts, principles, methods, paradigms, etc. of this field might be, according to its actual experts, that aren't already found in other well-established fields of study, research, development, and application. I have no idea, in other words, what distinguishes ideonomy from those other pursuits, such as those listed in the preceding paragraph.     ",
