            "answer_text": "Those are literally the 2 reasons why I considered studying chemical engineering. Here are those and a few more: I like chemistry. Uhhh yea! Chemistry is so cool. I mean not until university level studies did I make silver in a test tube. My high school chemistry teacher made toothpaste looking stuff come out of a 6 inch diameter test tube on the first day. He had me at \"hello\". I was good at it. Well, when your given a problem and asked to solve it by people who can't, and then you do, it's a good sense of accomplishment that you did something by your own effort that not everyone knows how to do. It's not an elitist thing it's more of a \"my skills matter\" type of thing. And it's fun... Plus your good at something you don't understand everything about yet. Why not explore it more?Solving problems. This ties in with #2. Someone comes to you and says we have these chemicals here, we need them here and we need them like this, can you help? Well of course you say \"yea I can do that, but I'll do it so well that your going to be surprised that it was even possible.\" That's what engineering is about! Solving problems for people. And that bleeds into solving problems for yourself not necessarily chemically oriented but oriented to a particular result... \"Hey johny can you unload the dishwasher?\" Of course you don't want to but studying engineering you can say: \"yes but how do I do it in the shortest amount of time so I can get back to studying chemistry (just kidding)?\"... And then you do it!FYI: the two reasons you mentioned were why I considered chem. eng. and I'm studying chem. eng. and applied chemistry. Chemical engineers get paid well which will make your long terms goals more short term because you won't be reliant on money (that's for another question, ask it and ask me to answer:)). I'm only in my third year with my first internship starting on Tuesday and I'm wicked passionate about it. All from I'm good at it and it's fun, should I study Chem eng? ",

            "answer_text": "If you really love chemistry and are passionate about it then go for MSc in Chemistry. Chemical engineering is not really about chemistry but it is more concerned to production of Chemicals (in broader sense) or design of Chemical Industries. If you are looking for better placement opportunity then select the best option you have. The key to selecting the right branch for yourself is to look at courses that are being taught in that particular stream and see if they interest you. Chemical Engineering deals more with maths than chemistry. Another thing you can do is think of what graduates of a articular streams are doing after graduating or job profiles they get in an industry. Chemical Engineers mostly go either in Production plants or Designing industry. Now there are not much designing companies in India since most of the Indian companies buy license/technology for starting a company from MNCs in foreign countries. So most of the chemical engineers end up working in production plant. Once in production plant, for the initial 5\u201310 years you have to come in shifts and there is not very much to learn, especially if you are more interested in Chemistry. However, if you want to go into research after your bachelors degree then you can gladly take chemical engineering. Once you complete your bachelors, for PhD you can take a subject which has more chemistry in it. Hope this was helpful. All the best. ",
