            "answer_text": "1. Positioning matters, especially in services industry. And positioning is directly proportional to your focus. It's always better to write down top 1,2 or 3 focus areas to avoid an embarrassment later on. For Example: I'm a Football player sounds good but doesn't reflect you core capability. I'm a Goalkeeper or Striker or defender makes more sense and helps you in lucid positioning. 2. Do your homework before going in a class room. Make sure to have a registered business entity, website, and a cross functional team to justify your services offerings. 3. Reflect your maturity through your own platform. That's the starting point for client to judge you. Make sure your website has a nice design to reflect your designing capability, is strategically aligned to reflect your strategic skills and so on. 4. Always have an outside adviser/mentor/consultant to get a neutral feedback of your idea, plan etc. Every startup must possess a Devil's Advocate to see it's model, idea etc getting challenged. That's when you'll actually sit down and think and realise the evolution of new tactics. 5. Define and design your Business/Revenue model early on. 6. Define your target market or niche and take a focused approach rather than doing anything to target everything. 7. Last but not the least, be flexible and adaptable in whatever you do. Entrepreneurship is a journey to Learn-Unlearn and Relearn the things. Thank You.Sushant Bharti (www.366pi.com) ",

            "answer_text": "Technology played a key role in the growth of commerce and trade around  the world. It is true that we have been doing business since time  immemorial, long before there were computers; starting from the simple  concept of barter trade when the concept of a currency was not yet  introduced but trade and commerce was still slow up until the point when  the computer revolution changed everything.
