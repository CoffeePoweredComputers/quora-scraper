            "answer_text": "The first car invented was by Karl Benz and others: www.daimler.com It is generally acknowledged that the first really practical automobiles with petrol/gasoline-powered internal combustion engines were completed almost simultaneously by several German inventors working independently: Karl Benz built his first automobile in 1885 in Mannheim. However, in the early 1900\u2019s many hundreds of different brands were produced by hand in garages all over the US and were too expensive for the average man. Then Henry Ford invented the auto assembly line and reduced the time to produce one by at least an order of magnitude and the costs dropped to the point that millions could afford to buy a Model T. He literally put America on wheels. He started production in 1908 and produced them until 1927. ",
