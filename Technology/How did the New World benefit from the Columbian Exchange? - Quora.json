            "answer_text": "The exchange, of course, includes the indigenous peoples of the Americas. Relatively speaking, any benefits for them were completely overshadowed by a few stark facts. Ninety-nine percent of them perished from the diseases brought over by the first explorers. After that, they were enslaved, slaughtered and their land was taken. Benefits for the explorers, colonists, European regimes and European entrepreneurs were inestimable. Billions of dollars worth of gold and silver crossed the Atlantic to Europe. Trade enriched all parties. There were tremendous advances in science and technology stimulated by the problems of exploration and settlement. Relief was provided for thousands escaping poverty and religious persecution. Power and prestige was vastly increased for European imperialists. Important foods had a significant impact in reducing food scarcity in Europe. Many new nations were ultimately able to advance their own self-determination, free of European control. Settlers of the new world, mostly, thrived and prospered. ",
