In turn, the carrier\u2019s network connects to other networks and ultimately the Internet. Those back haul connections can be things like fiber optic cables or directional microwave antennas.

Towers and the base stations wouldn\u2019t be very useful if you could only communicate with other end points that were connected to the same tower as yours. If you think about the local LTE network as a LAN with the back haul connection acting as the WAN then you\u2019re in the right ball park. ",
