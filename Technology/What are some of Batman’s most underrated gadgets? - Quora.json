            "answer_text": " Batman\u2019s shark repellent. Yes, Batman hardly uses this gadget and it doesn\u2019t exist in some continuities, but it\u2019s not useless to him. So how exactly is shark repellant useful to Batman? Despite living in a freaking city, Batman seems to meet a lot of sharks.  And there\u2019s even a villain called freaking King Shark.  And Batman did kind of use shark repellent on him and it worked.  See, Shark repellents aren\u2019t useless. You never know if you might find a ten foot tall mutated shark trying to kill you in the DC universe. -Nailuj ",
