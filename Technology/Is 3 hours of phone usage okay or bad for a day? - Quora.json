            "answer_text": "Um\u2026 are you sure it's just 3 hours. Cos every 20sec. Of pulling out the phone unlocking it to check the time also counts as useage \u2026 and yes it's a bad thing if you have a habit of doing so. Personally 3 hours would not suffice for me cos let's see 1\u20132hrs of talking (voice and video), 30 mins of organizing, about 1 hour of social media, 2 hours of gaming( during commute and otherwise) , about a 100 time pulling out the phone-unlock-check time or notification (20sec\u00d7100=2000sec which is around 30min) and selfie and photo session time around 30\u201345mins in all(in a day at so many situations ). Now this brings me to close to 6 hours or more for me for mostly a daily basis. This is one weekdays so on weekends it's an entire different sinario which has me doing my phone, laptop and tv all at the same time unless I have an appointment or and outdoor activity. The reason I'm telling all this is because I know I have a problem, tried a lot of different methods but the closest I got to something like a rehab situation was due to a black out of 5days and out of that I successfully abolished all electronic medium for 2 days and close to 12 hours. After which I sourced and made a make shift off-grid power supply and relapsed\u2026 but to get back to the point, it is bad if those 3 hours actually disrupt you from meeting your deadline, it is bad if you constantly think just 3 hours is all you have (21hours your living in reality). And if by phone useage you ment just talking on the phone with someone for 3 hours, that depends on the frequency of how much time and distance your away form being with that person. Good luck. ",

            "answer_text": "It really depends on what you're using your phone for. My job has me working out in the community, and my only method to keep in touch with my office is by use of my work cellphone/mini tablet. I also use that to complete whatever paperwork or task that I have to do while I'm visiting my patients in their homes. On a \u201cnormal\u201d work day, I'm more-or-less constantly on the phone for 8+ hours. And there's my personal cellphone. I use that to keep in touch with my hubby, my children, my family and friends via text or email. I also recieve emails from my children's schools and teachers, the family doctors/dentists/audiologist/whoever else I must absolutely have to be in communication with. I take thousands of pictures with my cellphone as well. Technology truly is fascinating. So overall, I can easily seem like I'm glued to a cellphone for 12, 14 hours in a day. But I'm mindful about my surroundings as well, and to be honest, if you're conscious about why you're using it or what you're using the cellphone for, then I wouldn't worry about it. Just remember: Don't text and drive. ",
