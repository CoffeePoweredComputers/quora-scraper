I can't say I miss them, any more than I am missing being on a plane or bus to get somewhere else. I left high school 61 years ago and I am still in touch with four high school friends and with the only one of my high school teachers who is still alive. I am grateful for their lasting friendship and for the dedication and skills of my teachers. ",

            "answer_text": "I moved/changed schools several times during my childhood, so I was always on the outside, looking in, when it came to social groups. I made a few close friends at each school, but then moved on to the next location. I miss some of my classmates, but going through those years once was definitely enough. The best years of my life have happened since high school. I did well in college and graduate school, married the love of my life, had a couple of very satisfying careers, and was blessed with wonderful children and grandchildren. There were some big challenges to be overcome, during adulthood, though. Although my K-12 years were very difficult, I do appreciate what I learned in the process and how those lessons have helped me succeed throughout adulthood. ",
