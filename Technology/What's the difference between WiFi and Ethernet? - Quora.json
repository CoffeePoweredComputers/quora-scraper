            "answer_text": "A few stipulations: Bandwidth isn\u2019t speed. Bandwidth is capacity. Speed is latency aka delay. Increases in latency visibly impact your user experience more than decreases in bandwidth in most cases.Wired Ethernet is always lower latency and higher bandwidth than WiFi, i.e. always better.The amount of latency increase and bandwidth reduction you will experience by using WiFi vs wired Ethernet depends on many factors. What bands and protocols your router or access point supportsWhat bands and protocols your client supportsHow far the router is from the clientHow much material (walls etc) is between the router and the clientHow much interference is in the air (from both WiFi and non-WiFi sources)How many other devices are connected to the same radioIf you have a router and a client that support 802.11ac with wide channels, and you stand next to the router, your bandwidth may reduce somewhat (probably it will still be more than your ISP connection for most domestic users) and your latency will probably be close to double that of wired. As you move further away, the router will reduce the channel width and step down the data rate to maintain the connection, until it hits the minimum. If it\u2019s set up that way, your device may swap to a lower level protocol and reduce data rate further. As you get further away or get behind more obstacles, the signal will eventually become unusable. The range of expected behavior would be that your bandwidth would reduce by anywhere from 80\u201390% of wired all the way down to 5 or 10% depending on conditions, and your latency will go from double to 10x and beyond. It all depends on your application. If you\u2019re streaming or gaming, any increase in latency is mostly unacceptable. If you\u2019re checking Instagram, in many cases you won\u2019t even notice. ",

            "answer_text": "It\u2019s no contest. Ethernet is a far better option if it\u2019s available. For one it\u2019s faster, like considerably. Direct conections can and do move upwards of 10 gigabits per second (gbps). There\u2019s different types though too. Cat 6 cables can transfer 10gbps, while cat 5e can only do 1gbps. [1] You can tell which cable you have by looking on it\u2019s outer cover[2] . It\u2019ll likely have it repeated the entire length of the cable. Those speeds have drastically improved over a relatively short amount of time, and WiFi has improved a lot too. In 2013, WiFi version 802.11ac was released which could transport data at a speed of roughly 860 megabits per second (mbps). The previous version, 802.11n, could only reach speeds of 150 mbps. It should also be noted though, 1gbps would be the equivalent of 1000 mbps[3]. So while WiFi has improved, it is still oodles behind the speeds of Ethernet. Ethernet is also more secure. While network sniffers can be used on a cabled network, that usually implies out dated hardware (a hub, for example)[4]. It\u2019s far easier to steal people\u2019s data by sitting on an unsecure WiFi network.[5] While there are exceptions, many public WiFi signals will be using outdated and unsecure WiFi protocols.[6] And though the protocols that make up WiFi have improved, it still can\u2019t compare with the security of a closed cable system. In the realm of interference and signal lose, Ethernet undoubtedly comes out on top again. Direct linkage to the end device ensures a constant line of communication between the device and the network. WiFi is prone to interference from lights, electronic devices, and even just having multiple barriers, like walls for example[7] . This means the location of the WiFi router needs to be taken into consideration. Attaching directly by cable allows for the networking device to be located anywhere. Ethernet is susceptible to some interference from strong electrical currents[8] , but the use of shielded twist-pair (stp) can help negate that if needed. In the end, it really comes down to what a person needs from their network. Ethernet is easily the fastest, most secure, and least likely to receive interference between itself and WiFi. But WiFi has drastically improved over the years as well. As it stands, depending on the types of devices you have, you may need WiFi to use them. The age of personal electronic super computers demands that end users be uncabled, so to speak. But if your looking to run a computer or gaming console that has high network demands and the capability to connect via Ethernet, do yourself a favor and plug in.

            "answer_text": " Credit image: youtube WiFi is a wireless technology that connects devices to the internet that uses radio frequency (RF) instead of a physical wired connection. Meanwhile, Ethernet is the traditional technology for connecting computers together in LAN (local area network), so basically wired connection. So, what is the difference between Wi-Fi and Ethernet? Here they are: 1. Speed Ethernet has a faster connection than Wi-Fi. The fastest WiFi as for now is 802.11ac. It transmits data of 1331Mbps (theoretical maximums). And theoretically, Ethernet can offer up to 10 Gb/s if you use cat-6 cable. 2. Reliability For reliability, it is clear that WiFi is the less reliable one of the two as there are several things that can interfere with a wireless signal because there are many environmental factors. These interferences can cause dropped signals and even lower the speeds. Ethernet, on the other hand, delivers a connection at a consistent speed. 3. Security Ethernet is more secure compared to WiFi. Data sent over an Ethernet connection can only be accessed by devices that are physically attached to that particular network, and thus there is little to no chance of data loss or hacking. For WiFi, as it is an open network, therefore, it can be hacked more easily. To protect sensitive data from being hacked, make sure to use WiFi networks where the data is encrypted. 4. Latency Latency is the delay (or time) it takes to send information from one point to the next. Ethernet has lower than WiFi. Both WiFi and Ethernet has its own pros and cons, you need to choose the one that suits better for the goal you wanted to achieve.  Hope the explanation help! OKportal Technology ",

            "answer_text": "Both have advantages and disadvantages. The fact e have both in most homes is no mistake. We are going through a period of uncertainty with connectivity as wifi supplies ever increasingly capable connectivity as more and more house hold devices become wifi ready and prepared for IoT. But and there is always a but. All the time there is potential for ethernet to be profit making, it will be supplied on our routing devices in the home gateway. So with the reasoning out the way we can now look into the benefits of one over the other. The technologies both achieve the same aim which is connectivity of devices into our home networks. The wifi connections are half duplex and contention based while ethernet has moved away from this hub like activity and supplies dedicate services to the end device. This is full duplex and has the capability for higher security and defence against interference with differnt cable types. Generally 1Gb connectivity is expected to a cable connection with backward compatability. The main advantage for wifi is connectivity without the contraint of cable, theefore allowing not only mobility but mobility for miltiple devices. The draw back might be contention, slower connectivity and potentially security issues as anyone within range is likely to see your connectivity and therfore potentually create security issues. in summary there are pros and cons for both in use and while this is the case they will both remain available. Peoplecdrive technologies so the latest issue being security, we may see requirement for wireless with directional connectivity and or guarenteed security. ",

            "answer_text": "Nowadays, majority of the people have a misconception about Wi-Fi. They think that Wi-Fi mean Wireless Fidelity but this is not the case. Wi-Fi is actually a trademarked term meaning IEEE 802.11x. Moreover, Wi-Fi actually means WLAN which stands for Wireless Local Area Network. Additionally, Wi-Fi is basically a wireless networking technology that make use of radio waves to offer high-speed network connection. Now let\u2019s have a look at WLAN. It is such a network that links two or more than two computers or devices by making use of wireless communication to create a Local Area Network (LAN) within a constrained area such as house, office, campus etc. Given below is one of the examples of Wi-Fi network:  On the other hand, Ethernet LAN is the most widely used wires Local Area Network. Like I mentioned above that LAN is a network of two or more than two devices that are made within a small area like office, school etc. Ethernet Network connection is purely a wired connection and is used in-contrast to WLAN. Moreover, Ethernet is technically referred to IEEE 802.3 protocol. And it has been evolved so much that it is now capable of transferring data at gigabits per second speed. ",

But the simple answer is Ethernet connects directly to a device medium and then to the networking port, then to the central public portal and viola, you are on your way. WiFi is a radio, the direction is omnidirectional, it tends to get interference from anything conductive or electrically driven and it doesn't like lead, but besides that you have a radio that must reach a receiver. That receiver must interpret the information it has received as valid and translate it into usable data, you must then do what you want with it and send it back, each step costs time, and bandwidth, Wireless Fidelity is affected by it's environment and will never be able to compare with Ethernet or any other wired medium because it is a radio conversation going on while the wited connection is already finishing the job. This is rather crude but it covers the basics. ",

An Ethernet cable is a dedicated connection that can pass packets both ways simultaneously between the devices at the ends of the Ethernet cable. WiFi is strictly one packet at a time, and the network is shared between all WiFi devices using it. It might not make too much difference for Internet access where the speed of the ISP connection is the limiting factor, but for local networking between devices in the home, using Ethernet should give the best network performance, possibly with just one device on the WiFi network.

Ethernet is a layer-2 type protocol, which can be run on a number of different physical-layer mediums. Certainly Cat 5-7 cables are among them, but so are/were RG-8, RG-11, RG-58, Cat 3, single-mode and multi-mode fiber optic, house power wiring (using PowerLine adapters)\u2026 and, wireless carrier signals in (currently) the 2.4 & 5GHz ranges. So while Andrew probably did a better job of answering what you really wanted to know, I just wanted to explain that what you asked wasn't actually what you wanted to know. ",

Until recently, Ethernet was almost guaranteed to be faster, but with 802.11ac MIMO, and MU-MIMO it is possible to be faster over WiFi, especially if any part on the physical LAN does not support gigabit speeds. Despite the diminishing speed advantage, Ethernet provides a more secure connection, and more stable connection than WiFi. ",

It's software. Wifi is wireless ethernet protocol. And as for the difference between wired and wireless the only benefit wireless has over wired is purely the fact it's wireless. Wired ethernet is better in every aspect. Latency, bandwidth and reliability are all better on wired connections. ",
