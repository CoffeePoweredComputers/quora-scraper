            "answer_text": "If you want to remodel your basement, it is the best idea to hire an interior designer who will decide how to renovate the place. Once the design is in, you have to choose a good renovation company to do the renovation. You may also have to hire a cleaning company to clean up the place before the actual renovation work begins. During the cleaning, make sure that you sort the contents of the basement before they get thrown into the trash. If you have items you still want to keep, then keep them in your home or at a storage unit. Clothes, which are still in good condition that you don\u2019t want to use, can be donated to charity. Furniture that can still be repaired should be repaired so that you can use them on the basement after renovation. Now you contact a renovation company. Make sure to choose a company that will not rip you off. Search reviews from Yelp! or other review sites for a company with good satisfaction rating. Finally, ask the renovation company for their state permits. ",
