            "answer_text": "I am going to give a piece of advice which will stop you from thinking over and over again on this topic and you will start building projects without a doubt. Some aspects decide a good project and implementing these features will help you attract attention from the recruiters when you apply for the job. But first, you need to understand a thing that you will be judged based on how close your project is as compared to the product already available in the market. The close your project is as compared to the already available product in the market, it will help the recruiter to judge you easily. You don\u2019t need to build a unique project to get a job. But you need to build something already available in the market but modified with your touch or design or style and implementation. Recruiters want to know how excellent you are at building stuff and your skillset. So, to conclude, I would advise you to build your clone projects. Build you own food delivery app or build your own UBER or your E-commerce website and try implementing all the features that are available in these apps that will help you to build your skill-set in the right direction and your skills will be much in demand. Now, I already explained to you what to build. Now let's discuss what are the main aspects that make a good project and these include : It must solve a business problem: Your main target to build any project is to solve a business problem. Business problems are problems that we can solve to do or improve business and earn money. For example, you can build your video calling application that solves the problem of communicating or your chatting application to send messages.It must have proper authorization and authentication: It means your project must have a login and sign up feature along with a database to store user information. It must contain some sort of security implementations like storing passwords by encryption or email notification to reset the password. There are many features which help in implementing security. You must assign proper roles and rights to which user can access what information. Research and implement as many features as you can.It must have good UI: People like the project that works fine but they also want the good experience of using your project. So, your project must have a nice and clean user interface with high-quality images and proper navigation. If your project looks good that you are halfway there.It must be hosted somewhere: A lot of students build their project and then upload them on GitHub. Its good to show recruiters or other people how you have to build your project but still, most of them wouldn't have time to go through all of you code and chances are your project might be ignored. So, if you want your project to be noticed, then host it somewhere and share its link in your resume. It will create an impression. It will be easy for anybody to just click on the link and go through your project and get an idea about what you have built and it's working and this will create a good impression on recruiters rather than just showing you code.These are the main features that you project must-have. Focus on implementing these aspects and try implementing as many features as you can and you will get the best project that recruiters will notice. ",
