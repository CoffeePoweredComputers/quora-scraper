            "answer_text": "Alright.  This undetailed question is targetting something very specific.  You want a laptop that is better than its price implies.  You are asking how you can find an $800 laptop for only $$400.  Oh... I'm sure you'd look at that, and correct me with something like \"I'm willing to pay $500\".... but the spirit of what I'm saying remains true. You want to purchase a laptop at a price that is well below its value. The problem is... the manufacturers and retailers aren't stupid.  They know the value of what they make and sell. It is possible to find something on sale, but you can't look at the low priced stuff and expect there to be a gem hidden in that rough.  You will have to still be looking at the laptops that are more than you intended to spend. Everything I've said, might STILL not apply.  Do you know why?  Because you never defined \"good\" or \"low\".  I know I can look up both in a dictionary, but even if I did... I still wouldn't know what YOU consider to be a good laptop.... and I wouldn't know what YOU consider to be a low price. For example... a laptop you might consider to be \"good\", would be one that would allow you to play Assassin's Creed\u00ae Syndicate - Coming 2015 on Ultra settings... and you might want that \"low\" price to be the same as some Black Friday special you only see once a year. That's not going to happen. So... how do you find the best laptop you can get, for the lowest price you can afford?  To paraphrase a joke... research, research, research.  You bookmark sites like Pricewatch.com and Amazon.com  and Newegg.com and you constantly check them.   The problem is... when you finally commit and make your purchase, you never know if something better is going to come along. ",

            "answer_text": "The simplest way to get a great performance working laptop at the lowest price is to do a bit of research. And most importantly, what you will do with your laptop. As buying a gaming laptop worth of 80K for just browsing and playing old games (and PUBG mobile is a total loss, a 26K laptop will be able to do that). First, do a reasearch on processors, latest ones of intel. The 9th gen chips are already here, but at low price, its best to go for 8th gen chips. The i3 8120U and 8130U are great for doing most of the heavy tasks with ease (and is a normal performance laptop if you plug in 8GB total RAM). It still qualifies near the i5 7200U. If you want budget laptops, for performance like priced laptops, know this. Buy a i3 7th/6th gen laptop for around 24K, plug in another 4GB RAM Stick and an SSD for better performance if you think of using it just for programming and Office work. If you need more power, i5 8250U is available for most of the laptop at 36\u201345K with 8GB RAM. You wont be needing more power than this one. Dell 5000 series and Lenovo ideapad variants both have i3 and i5 8th gen chips, so choose one at your price. Else if you need a specific laptop for playing games, then you consider your minimum price as 50K. (Lenovo Ideapad 330 with Ryzen 5 and vega 8 is also a good laptop to run games at 720p). Acer Nitro 5 is a great one, with GTX 1050Ti 4GB which nails games at 1080p. You can move up for Dell 7000 series with 1050Ti and better i5/i7 variants with better battery, cooling systems, LED keyboards and even SSDs. The new ASUS TUF FX505 is a great gaming laptop with the new GTX 1650. 40% better than the 1050ti. proper 1080p gaming laptop. Never go above 80\u201390K for gaming laptops. That\u2019s mainly a loss. You can easily build RTX PCs with 90K. ",
