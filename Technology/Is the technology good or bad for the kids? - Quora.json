            "answer_text": "I remember being a child during the technology revolution. I was coming into adulthood when cellphones first became \u201ca thing,\u201d and I remember the gradual transition from them being \u201cexpensive\u201d and \u201cjust for emergencies\u201d to an era where each phone was a supercomputer through which we interacted with everyone else and the news almost 24/7. I think \u201cbad\u201d and \u201cgood\u201d are too subjective. You need to look at the specific things that changed and decide for yourself whether they are good or bad. Some are clearer than others, and some of the ones that seem good have dark sides to them (and vice versa). Technology has revolutionized entertainment. Mainly, it has cheapened it. It\u2019s not quite as bad now as it was back when TV first became a thing (oh god, those insipid family dramas), but it\u2019s still less high-minded than a good book and playing chamber music with your family.My mother is a violin-teacher, my father is a computer scientist. I grew up in both worlds in equal parts, and honestly, from an entertainment standpoint, mostly I think the entertainment I got from books and music was better for me than the entertainment I got from videogames.I say \u201cmostly\u201d because honestly, I was pretty socially awkward. I was only successfully socialized through multiplayer gaming\u2026 specifically during the height of the MMORPG revolution.Technology has revolutionized the workplace. People who work in technology can now do their jobs almost\u2026 no, entirely from home, which is fortunate during a pandemic. The downside to working from home, though, is that it erodes the barrier between home life and work life. Your family interweaves with your place of work and vice versa. It becomes unavoidable. Inescapable. It becomes hard to relax.People are learning how to manage this, now, out of necessity\u2026 but those management strategies are not free. They take discipline and repetition.Socially, technology means we are more connected than ever before. I can talk to my friends whenever I want. They can talk to me whenever they want.If they are not talking to me, it means they don\u2019t want to. If I don\u2019t respond to them immediately, it means I am ignoring them.Not always, but often enough that that\u2019s how kids learn to read the situation. If they ask a friend a question and don\u2019t have an answer within 30 minutes, there\u2019s a pretty good chance they\u2019ll be crying in a corner when you find them.I\u2019m exaggerating, but less than you might imagine.This connectedness means that people have wide-ranging support networks, but it also means they are reeeeally bad at being alone. Loneliness has gone from being \u201cbad\u201d to being something many teenagers fear more than death.Sadly, I mean that literally.Information flow is constant, rapid, never-ending and thick. This is addictive. It\u2019s also great, because I can learn anything I want to about the world, about science, about the past, just for the asking.\u2026 but it\u2019s dangerous, because I can learn those things largely because of an extensive classical education that has trained me to filter resources for relative reliability. I am good at conducting research, therefore, for me, the internet is an endless, powerful resource.\u2026 for a 14-year-old, the internet is an endless source of information that they have none of the necessary skills to validate.Also, I wasn\u2019t kidding when I said it was addicting. For a modern teenager to be cut off from the internet feels, for them, like withdrawing from cocaine. I had this happen to me once in the middle of college. I literally had to see a therapist, because I was so reliant on that data. Without it my mind became so bored, so fast and I was miserable. Absolutely miserable. An hour away from data felt like being in a straight-jacket in a padded cell.Fortunately it only took about a week of guided meditation to reestablish a healthier balance. Now, I periodically enjoy being intentionally cut off from the world. I love climbing trips because there\u2019s no way my cell phone can stay charged the whole time. I arrive on site, find my friends and turn off my electronics \u201cto save battery.\u201d I turn them back on when I leave.This has another side effect, though\u2026 which I think is both a good thing and a bad thing.Kids these days are much more in tune to global goings-on than their parents ever were. You wanna save the turtles from plastic straws? Convince the nearest teenager with a friend in California. Give it 24 hours.Businesses have had to learn to adapt to this. Crusades are common, and while they\u2019re honestly mostly good crusades, the opposite side of the coin still rears its ugly head.Just recently, an actor failed to join a Biden fundraiser and by the time a day had gone past it took testimonials from a wide swath of his co-workers to prevent him from being canceled for it as a \u201cTrump Supporter.\u201dHe\u2019d just had a baby. He was apolitical to start with. Neither would\u2019ve mattered if it hadn\u2019t been nipped in the bud.Videogames can be, and often are a force for good. I know you don\u2019t want to hear this. No one does. But I\u2019ve been riding the wave all the way from Zork to Eve Online and beyond. I have friends who develop games. I belong to communities centered around games, and one in particular I have traveled internationally to have beers with.It\u2019s not all fake, it\u2019s not all flack. It\u2019s like any other sport or activity you share with friends.The thing that makes it seem otherwise is that you see the child sitting at a computer in a room all day, and you think \u201cshouldn\u2019t s/he be out with their friends?\u201dThing is, that child is only there in body. In reality, they are out with their friends. Their friends are also corporeally sitting in a chair in a dark room somewhere, and all of them, together, have gone somewhere else you can\u2019t follow.And I get it. That\u2019s unintuitive and even a little scary.But it\u2019s also the reason that when the Serb/Croat genocide started, I had friends on both sides and spent a few days in a panicked haze checking my mail every few minutes to find out if Dante had made it out alive.It is almost entirely impossible at this point in my life for you to go to war without endangering the life of, or the lives of family of someone I care about.I am now 37 years old. People my age are eligible to be president.I fully expect that this global perspective that has so infected my generation will bring about an end to War as we know it.\u2026 and honestly, that\u2019s one hell of an upside.

            "answer_text": "Technology is nothing more than techniques and tools. Technology is a very broad term but far too often is used to specifically mean smartphones, video games, tv, wifi, etc. Did the invention of the washing machine over the washing board ruin children, did the invention of the printing press to allow mass production of books ruin children, did the concept of the assembly line for automobile production ruin children, did hub and spoke concept for logistics and infrastructure ruin children? No of course not. The technology is nothing more than a tool and can not ruin children any more than a screwdriver can. The problem comes down to the parenting. The 9 year old should not be playing Grand Theft Auto or other 18 year old game, they should not be watching porn, they should not be spending every waking moment on social media. The parent needs to monitor/regulate their activities/content but at the same time also provide reasoning/context/age limits instead of just saying \u201cno because i said so\u201d. Otherwise the kids will just do it behind the parents back every chance they get. The other key to this is consequences, when they break the rules they have to be punished to entice them not to. ",
