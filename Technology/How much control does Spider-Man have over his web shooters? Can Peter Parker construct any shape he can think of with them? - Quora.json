            "answer_text": "Spider-Man\u2019s control over his web shooters has been depicted in varying degrees over the years. Like seriously it\u2019s weird. During his early years, he could essentially create any structure the plot wanted him to. It was like a plot armor for him. (Like how Batman could defeat anyone with prep time no matter how absurd it could be). To back up my points, here are some examples.  Here he creates a shield. And then his web fluid breaks the laws of physics to spin on its own.  Here he makes another shield (this happened in the same page). I think Peter might have created some magic web fluid. No other explanation here.  He creates a parachute here\u2026\u2026\u2026 Like\u2026\u2026What??!!   He created a flying bat here\u2026\u2026And a giant spider\u2026\u2026. Okay that\u2019s pretty cool. 10 out of 10. He was like the Michaelangelo of Super-heroes.  Well\u2026\u2026..Batman\u2019s not gonna like this\u2026\u2026.  Well\u2026\u2026.. Let\u2019s see Captain America do that right? See the thing is, Super-hero comics were pretty goofy back then. It\u2019s still great to read them, being classic hero tales and all that. But these kinds of absurd stuff won\u2019t work these days. Nowadays Spider-Man can only do basic stuff with his web shooters (Thank God), like normal web shots, web lines and giant webs to trap enemies. So he can swing across Manhattan, and trap enemies with his webs, but he can\u2019t sculpt a web statue of Steve Rogers with Jesus abs. Although I would pay to read that. ",
