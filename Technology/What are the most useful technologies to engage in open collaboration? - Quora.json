            "answer_text": "(Disclaimer: I am a founder of a company mentioned in this answer) There are many, many good options, depending on how exactly you want to collaborate, what behaviors you are trying to support / facilitate, and what existing systems you have in place.  A simple wiki is enough for some teams, other teams might want a full-fledged Enterprise Social Network & Knowledge Management system. For teams looking for more advanced capabilities in terms of helping to find, share, reuse and create knowledge, I am partial to the Fogcutter stack from Fogbeam Labs.    The Fogcutter suite has very powerful capabilities that are missing from most so-called \"Enterprise\" Social Networks.   Specifically, we support SOA/ESB integration for discovering knowledge around real-time business events, BPM integration for locating knowledge related to User Tasks in a BPM workflow, ActivityStrea.ms protocol support over a REST interface for integration with arbitrary 3rd party systems, and Semantic Concept Extraction for extracting structured knowledge and semantics from unstructured content.   Basically, the Fogcutter tools are \"glue\" that connect all of your various content sources:  documents in a Document Management System, internal wikis, internal blogs, random files scattered around network file shares - as well as external sources of information (RSS feeds, IMAP email accounts, etc.) - and finds the semantics that correlate all of this content and makes it all discoverable.  Even better, the entire Fogcutter stack is Open Source, developed in the open, in a true community fashion (no \"faux-pen source\" for us), licensed under the Apache License v2, and supported commercially by the experts at Fogbeam Labs.   Anyone who is interested, feel free to contact me directly here on Quora, or visit http://www.fogbeam.com ",
