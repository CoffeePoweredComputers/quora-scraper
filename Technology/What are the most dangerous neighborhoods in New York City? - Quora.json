            "answer_text": "As a 20 year old black male who\u2019s lived in Harlem, on 115h between 5th and Lenox in Foster projects (One of the most dangerous projects in Harlem) and then in the South Bronx on 158th and Melrose Ave(one of the most dangerous areas in the whole city) and now right back to Harlem on 143rd and 8th Ave.(uptown Harlem) I\u2019ve seen a personal glimpse in two of New York\u2019s Notorious top two most dangerous neighborhoods. In the South Bronx, it doesn\u2019t look as gritty as it was in the 80s, being that there is a lot of new development of new affordable housing buildings. BUT it is still a very violent area of NY. Many shootings, fights, etc. The South Bronx is definitely the area in NY where you have the highest chance of getting robbed, regardless of the time of day. The south Bronx also has A LOT of projects and they are among the most dangerous in the city. Its also still gritty looking just not burnt out lots every where. Now in Harlem, despite gentrification, black people still make up most of the overall population. Harlem encounters many shootings and other violent crimes daily. Harlem also had about an 80% increase in murders in 2019 from the previous year. Harlem has really active neighborhoods in the night time, and on almost every block is a housing building, in the form of a tenement building or a stereotypical housing building. Harlem is also still a little gritty looking, composed of mostly tenement buildings. People also tend to forget how notorious Harlem was for its crime, it was probably if not one of, then THE most dangerous neighborhood in the 80s. And it\u2019s only a neighborhood in Manhattan, unlike the South Bronx composed of different neighborhoods. So there you go, cause I\u2019m sick of articles saying that Midtown is the most dangerous neighborhood\u2026.like cmon. Harlem and the South Bronx are the most dangerous neighborhoods in New York City. ",

            "answer_text": "10. Brooklyn Heights, Boerum Hill & Dumbo  Despite its reputation as a safe and idyllic family neighbourhood, these three areas comprise the 60th street out of 69 neighborhoods. They rank 49/69 in violent crime and 62/69 in property crime. Murders, robbery and burglaries all rose from 2009 to 2010. 9. Chelsea & Hell's Kitchen  Hell's Kitchen was notorious for its violent gang activity back in the day, and Chelsea was a well-known drug haven. Today, both of these areas have seen a big drop in crime, especially violent crime, but not enough to escape the bottom 10 in the rankings. These neighborhoods ranked 65th overall for property crime, thanks to various chain and purse-snatchers and bank robbers. Grand larceny has gone up 46 per cent since 2001, and rape has also spiked 67 per cent in the same time frame. 8. Bedford-Stuyvesant  Things have improved for Bedford-Stuyvesant since Jay-Z rode his Bed-Stuy street credentials to super stardom. It's no longer the poster child for urban violence, but that doesn't mean things aren't generally grim for the slowly gentrifying Brooklyn neighbourhood. After years of improvement, a six per cent spike in overall crime last year is reason for concern. That includes increases in robbery and murder, giving Bed-Stuy the 67th ranking for violent crime. There were 212 serious crimes per 100,000 residents. 7. Downtown  Despite the September 11th attacks of nearly 10 years ago, the Downtown area of Manhattan seems to be doing remarkably well. Real estate prices are climbing, families are moving into the neighbourhood, and classy establishments are taking over the dive bar scene. Surprisingly, none of this makes much of a dent in the neighbourhood's current crime ranking,63rd out of 69. Property crime is the real killer here. There were 191 incidents per 100,000 residents last year, along with the third-worst grand larceny rate in the city. It also ranks 47/69 for burglary. 6. Fort Greene & Clinton Hill  Gentrification has done wonders for real estate prices in Fort Greene and Clinton Hill. Overall crime has also improved, but not enough to put the area higher than 64th safest with a number 55/69 ranking for violent crime and 63/69 for property crime. A low-density population of just over 50,000, the location of dangerous housing projects, and proximity to other low-ranking areas contribute to keeping this part of the city relatively unsafe. Robberies and murders both rose last year. 5. Flatiron  The good news is that violent crime is relatively low at 29/60 in the Flatiron. Property crime, however, ranks 67/69, as criminals do the most damage in this heavily-sought after neighbourhood. There were 1,481 incidents of grand larceny in 2010, or 158 out of 100,000 residents. There were also slight increases in robbery and murder -- which went from 1 killing to 3 in 2010. 4. Brownsville  Brownsville's motto may be 'Never ran, never will,' but we wouldn't call that good advice, considering the neighbourhood is officially the murder capital of New York. Brownsville was the scene of the most murders and shootings per capita in the city. Crime has dropped in recent years, including robbery and even murder, but not enough to keep Brownsville from ranking 66th least safe Locals like Larry King, Mike Tyson and Levance Fields would not be proud. 3. Hunts Point  Efforts have been made in the last few years to clean up industrial Hunts Point, which had a pretty horrible reputation for prostitution in particular and crime in general. Initiatives and funds have helped cut down on murders, car jackings, burglaries and reported rapes. Despite these efforts, Hunts Point ranked 67/69 for crime. There were 135 violent crimes per 100,000 residents, enough to put the neighbourhood dead last in the category. There were also increases in rape (up 67 per cent), misdemeanour sex crimes (26 per cent) and robberies (26 per cent). 2. Greenwich Village & Meatpacking District  Where there are wealthy residents, college students and tourists meandering through busy commerical strips, there is usually thievery. That's why the Village and Meatpacking, despite being one of the most sought after neighborhoods in the city, is second to last in property crime, grand larceny, and overall crime. Long-term trends have been good to the area, with general decreases in most catagories, including overall crime (down 71 per cent since 1993). Car theft and rape, however, have risen, and are issues to watch out for here. 1. Midtown  Only 74,717 people live in the Midtown, but the sheer number of tourists, office and support workers and general wanderers make the centre of Manhattan one of the most trafficked areas in the city. So despite its central location, Midtown ranked dead last 69 out of 69, in overall safety. Midtown had 729 major crimes per 10,000 people. That includes a 146 per cent jump in rapes from the year before, and a 14 per cent rise in felony assault. Serious crimes did fall 7 per cent overall in 2010, which is excellent considering its status as the centre of tourism and nightlife in the city. However, Midtown is still the most likely place you'll become the victim of a crime in New York City ",
