            "answer_text": "The iPhone 11 Pro Max is actually a regular upgrade of the iPhone XS Max. The biggest improvement is the processor and camera. In terms of size, the iPhone 11 Pro Max has not changed much, including the front screen size and resolution are the continuation of the previous generation. The focus of the iPhone 11 Pro Max is that the camera has been greatly improved, and an extra green is added to the original black, white, and gold colours.  In terms of processor, iPhone 11 Pro Max is equipped with the latest Apple A13 processor. The Apple A13 processor has increased CPU computing performance by 20%, GPU graphics rendering performance by 40%, and has a significant reduction in power consumption. It can be said that it is still the most powerful mobile processor at present. Apple official said: Compared with the previous generation, the battery life of the iPhone 11 Pro Max has increased by 5 hours. In terms of cameras, the iPhone 11 Pro Max uses three 12-megapixel lenses, which are a combination of wide-angle main camera+ultra-wide-angle+telephoto, and have excellent picture clarity. In addition, the iPhone 11 Pro Max is finally equipped with an 18W charger this time. Unfortunately, on this generation of iPhones, Apple officially cancelled the 3D Touch function and changed it to a long press to call out the shortcut operation page, and it does not support 5G.  The iPhone 11 Pro Max is available in 64GB, 256GB and 512GB specifications. The iPhone 11 Pro Max is available in four colours: space grey, silver, dark green, and gold. Whether it is worth buying depends on your needs and budget. And iPhone 12 is about to be released, you can wait for the release of iPhone 12 before choosing. ",

            "answer_text": "Thanks for the A2A. No stranger on Quora can tell you if the iPhone 11 Pro Max is worth it for you. If those are the features you want in a smart phone and are willing to pay that price, then of course it is worth it. For me, no matter what the quality, it would not be worth it because I don\u2019t want a phone that big. But maybe you do. It\u2019s a decision you have to make for yourself. ",
