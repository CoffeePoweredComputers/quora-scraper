            "answer_text": "Good question. First there is an investigation period for you to find the right person or firm. Look at local designers to see what they do. Check their website portfolios. Check Yelp or Thumbtack or Houzz which are online sources for designers in your area. Then call the designer. Personally I find the phone the best way of contacting someone I might hire. I don\u2019t like answering online bidding. It\u2019s not revealing enough for both parties. I believe that by talking to a person, you learn the most. Then you can ask for references and call for the experiences of their clients. Most designers don\u2019t mind if you do this. Then invite at least three designers into your home or business. Just like you would, to discover a good bid on a plumbing or electrical job. Have a good description ready of what you want to do. Then take notes of what you learn. Some designers are more prapriatory with their ideas. They would like you to hire them before giving you too much of their input. Then what are they offering you? Better references or better pricing? Don\u2019t forget you get what you pay for \u2026usually. If you pay more for a one hour consult, you will probably get more. I always find it a golden rule to take my sketch pad and give it my all. Whatever I see in the space that might offer a solution, I don\u2019t mind offering. I\u2019ll draw an idea if it\u2019s easier to understand. I will also tell a potential client, that without time to get to know them, the ideas are simply functional intuitive ideas of the space. It\u2019s a process of discovery to know people and their spaces so often the answers to questions you might have in an initial visit, is getting you only the top of the iceberg. But you will garnish a lot if you ask good questions and compare the answers you get from the three designers you pick to interview. Good luck! ",
