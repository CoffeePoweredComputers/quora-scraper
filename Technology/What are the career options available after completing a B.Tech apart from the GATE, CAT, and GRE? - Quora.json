            "answer_text": "I am going to keep it short and crisp (I assume that you don't have the access to any category quotas). These are options are apart from the on-campus job opportunities that you may have-   Take GATE, get a job at a PSU- There is too much competition in ECE, you could even appear through less crowded branches like Instrumentation. You will anyway have to work hard during the last 3-4 months.Take GATE, go for higher studies within India- Aim for IITs, IISC, Go for this option only if you are really interested in a particular topic that you studied in your engineering curriculum.Get trained at BARC Training Schools and work there- BARC has a training school for engineering grads. You may get in through GATE or through BARC's own test. For MS abroad, you need to have good acads, plenty of projects where you have put some real hard work and good financial backing to support your education abroad. You need to take GRE and apply to the tech schools you might be interested in studying at. Take CAT and go for an MBA- You will have a realistic chance at some of the IIMs (Ahmedabad, Bangalore, Shillong) only if you have consistently been good academically (90+ in 10th and 12th) and have scored more than 80% (or 8 CGPA) for your graduation degree. You will have to aim for a percentile above 99 percentile. If you don't boast of too good acads, you may aim for IIM Calcultta, MDI, FMS. Aim for something above 99.7 percentile for IIM C, 99.5+ for FMS, 99+ for MDI. Even XLRI isn't too fussy about acads, you will get a call if you have a good enough percentile in XAT.If you want to go for managerial education while not losing touch with what you have studied during your engineering years, you may go for NITIE. If you are specifically interested in industrial engineering, take GATE and apply for a diploma in industrial engineering. Fancy a career in Intellectual property rights? You may apply at Rajiv Gandhi School of Intellectual property Law which is a law school for engineers run by IIT Kharagpur. Want to really do something productive, inspire some change at grassroots level and at the same time have a lucrative enough career as a manager? Try getting into Institute of Rural Management Anand (IRMA).Want to study humanities instead and make a career out of improving society? Try for Tata Institute of Social Sciences or Department of Humanities and Social Sciences, IIT Guwahati. At TISS you may not be eligible for some courses though. But there are some great courses (yeah good career prospects too) like MA in HRM & LR or an MA in Disaster Management.   Fancy a career in Economics? Take the entrance exam of the MA in Economics program of India's most prestigious school for economics, the Delhi School of Economics.You may even be a civil servant. For that you have to sit through one of the toughest screening procedures in India, the UPSC civil services entrance exam.",

            "answer_text": "1.Campus placement Already bored of studying? Then getting selected in a decent company visiting your campus seems a good option. If you don\u2019t have any intentions of studying further, or at least immediately after B. Tech, you can opt for a job. This is considered to be a safer option where you get time to decide which field you want to stick to-Technical or you want to shift your core interest area from technical to management to some other stream. If you studied engineering out of passion and not because you were forced by your parents or just for sake of doing it, then M.tech is a good option. You can opt for the field of study you aspire to expertise in. For this, you need to prepare well for the entrance exams to get into a good college. GATE is a national exam conducted in India which can fetch you admission in IITs, IISC or NITs and many others. 2.Go for Mtech degree  3.Go for MBA Don\u2019t feel you are the technical guy your parents wanted you to be? Always felt like you are a manager and want to see yourself in a business suit in some MNC? Probably you have a fascination for MBA too. Don\u2019t get diverted by the thoughts that everyone is doing an MBA right now and its value has decreased. If you want to make a career in the management sector, hold managerial positions, then MBA is the right choice. You may specialize in your area of interest which may be the all time popular fields like HR, Marketing, Sales or the new growing domains like Digital Marketing, International Relations etc. In India, there are various entrance examinations that will help you get into the top 30 MBA colleges. CAT (Common Admission Test) serves as a gateway for an MBA at the IIMs and many other leading institutes. Some other popular exams are XAT (Xaviers), NMAT, SNAP, CMAT, TISS, IRMA etc.  4. Prepare for civil services Always saw yourself as an IAS or IPS officer? Admit it, some day or the other you must have thought about preparing for the Civil Services but left the thought because you felt that it's very tough to crack! Yes. Indeed it is one of the toughest exams in the world to crack and there lies a huge competition to be a civil servant, but you cannot hold yourself back because of this. Civil Services is not just about cracking an exam and then clearing an interview, it judges you on everything you can think of, who you are and what you stand for! You need to put your complete focus in addition to lots of determination to prepare for Civil Services Examination. For that you need to - Believe in yourself.  5.Short term courses There are various short term courses anddiploma courses you can opt for after your B.Tech. It can be a certificate course in embedded technology, VLSI, robotics, ethical hacking, protocol testing, machine designing etc. or a diploma course in any specific domain. Such courses are generally job oriented and serve as a bridge between what you know and what the industry expects you to know in order to absorb you into their organization.  6.Enterpenuership-Start your venture Do you have dreams of being a job provider?Always wanted to be your own boss? Then starting something of your own is a great option. But before you think about it you need to be sure about your options. Startup is trending more as a fashion than a career option. Being your own boss does not mean you can ignore work and life would be easy. Starting your venture and making it succeed would be the toughest of all the things you can do. It will have ups and downs every new day. Maybe you would not get any client for the whole year. Be ready for the challenges and immense learning if you are determined to be an entrepreneur. This is the road less travelled.  7.Go Abroad It is also a very good option to explore. If you choose to study abroad, you will get a lot of exposure and learning along with the education part. You might also be able to get a job at international locations if you have plans to settle abroad permanently in the future. You can also explore integrated opportunities abroad. Along with options of Ms abroad you may explore options of Ms + Phd and other research oriented courses. In addition, you could look at the various fellowships in research and development category available that may fascinate you too. You can also apply for the various scholarships which will fund your education partially or completely. Image source-Google ",
