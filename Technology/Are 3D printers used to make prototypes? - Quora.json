            "answer_text": "The short answer to your question is yes: 3D printers are used to make prototypes, but prototyping is just one sector of what 3D printing is used for. As far as prototypes go, I\u2019ve seen both conceptual prototypes and functional prototypes. Depending on what\u2019s being done and why, end use parts are also something that can be made. Casting patterns (masters for RTV/similar mold making) are another common application similar to prototyping. ",
