            "answer_text": "Nope. Every component in every electronic device ever made will fail, eventually. No matter how well you take care of them, no matter if you purchase one brand new and never ever use it, there will come a time that something in the console will fail. And given enough time, every component in it will fail. Typically capacitors will fail first, with electrolytic failing faster than any other type. RAM chips will probably go next, depending on their type, with flash memory dying earlier due to hitting their lifetime P/E limit. Even ROM chips will eventually succumb to bit-rot; stuff like the magnetic field generated by the solar flares can flip bits, eventually destroying the integrity of whatever is \u2018permanently\u2019 written on an IC.

It will require constant upgrading you intend on playing new games, and it's technically not a console, but it does last forever. That's the best you're going to get. ",
