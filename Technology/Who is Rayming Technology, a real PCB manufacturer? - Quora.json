            "answer_text": "Rayming is actually a real factory. They provide pcb\u2019s and pcba\u2019s. Not a very large factory but is clean. While they state they have many certifications I\u2019m not too sure they do. They clearly show to be UL listed, ISO 9001 and ISO 14001 certified but the TS16949 they list has no documentation. TS16949 is an automotive certification and it is TOUGH! Factories that do have that certification are very proud of it and will be sure it\u2019s very visible. ",
