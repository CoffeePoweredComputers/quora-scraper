            "answer_text": "Everything was fine till the Jio Fiber Promotional Preview Plan got migrated to Jio Fiber Migration Plan and Jio Fiber decided to witheld the information from customers before they recharge to fraudulently trick them to recharge/renew. Read ahead to know about this fraud. Here is what happens with the customers when they do the very first recharge. All fiber broadband connections in India across ISPs provides 1:1 upload and download speed this means if your download speed is of 100 MBPS then your upload speed will also be of 100 MBPS. This is the default speed ratio provided by all fiber operators including your local cable guy. Process of Jio Fiber Recharge: Now when your Promotional Preview Plan expires you either visit the jio website or opens myjio app to check the plans available, even you sent daily multiple reminders on sms asking you to immediately recharge to get free set top box. At both the places web and app as soon as you login on the web or myjio app you can see the recharge options available for customers. See screenshot of MyJio App: These are the recharge options available in MyJio App  On clicking on the (i) button you get additional information about the available recharge plan. Where it's clearly written 100 MBPS so here 100 MBPS in Optical Fiber means 1:1 speed ratio of download and upload as explained above.  This information has been withheld from even the Terms and Condition links available below the recharge denominations. See this screenhot:  So basically customers have been kept in dark by JIO Fiberas they themseves do not want to reveal that they have slown the the speed of fiber internet. This is also the very 1st time in India. It has never been experienced before in Indian telecom/ ISP history. Now as soon as you recharge you will get below message: In this message also it has been mentioned 100 MBPS so you would assume since it's a fiber connection the speed ratio would be 1:1. Now here is the moment of truth for you.  So when you do your very first recharge you are no where informed by Jio Fiber that the Upload speed would reduce between 0.5 MBPS to 10 MBPS unlike what you have been using in your promotional previous plan or in any of the plans of other service provider. So before recharge and after recharge it has no where mentioned that the upload speed would fall down drastically or has been throttled from backend nor the tele caller executives of JIO FIBER who keeps calling you to recharge informs you this dirty trick of JIO Fiber to trap you to do your very first recharge. So after recharging when you for the very first time experience the slow internet you call up their customer care and you won't get connected easily to the human executive to address your speed concern. Till the time customer is clueless as to why a 100 MBPS plan would have speed reduced to less than 1 mbps. Meanwhile you struggle with the slow speed you might end up doing speed test several time to know what speed you are getting after recharge. After few unsuccessful attempts you will now get connected to JIO FIBER Customer Care. Now when you complain here about the slow speed you are getting in the upload link which is between 0.5 to 10 MBPS the customer care executive will inform you that the plan is not having 1:1 download and upload speed moreover they will refuse to log a complaint or transfer the call to the supervisor. Now you wihould regret recharging as the plan is of 1:01 download and upload speed that's the reason you are getting slow speed and they will never admit that earlier the speed was 1:1. They will also give you excuses that it may be the problem of RAM in your device or since you are on wifi you are getting slow speed however you know it's not the fault of your device here. You are not getting the upload speed as it has been throutelled from backend keeping you in dark. If I was informed about the reduction of Upload speed before the recharge I might not have used their services any more however JIO Fiber witheld this information so that customers can be tricked to fall in the trap to recharge. In other words you have been fraduantlly tricked to recharge for the first time for a slow speed Internet by keeping you in dark. I was lucky that I just recharged for 1 month so it's easier for me to get Jio Fiber disconnected however immagine if someone has done yearly recharge. They are STUCK with poor internet speed. Why Upload Speed is Important for You: Upload speed is used to upload videos or content when you upload anything on YouTube, Instagram, Facebook, TickTok, Linkdin etc or while you are doing a live video if upload speed is less then the live video or whatsapp video calls won't be clear to the opposite party as the data you are uploading takes more time get reach the other side or might not even reach due to slow upload data transfer speed here. Do not renew your Reliance Jio Fiber as they have reduced the upload speed between 0.5 to 10 MBPS from 100 MBPS and they are not communicating this to the customers before or after recharge. You only get to know about it when you experience slow internet speed and try to complain at their customer care where they refuse to log complaint. #JagoGrahakJago #airtel #tata #Vodafone or Local Cable are better choice for using high speed internet. What you can do now? Talk about this fradulant practice of Jio Fiber of tricking you to recharge for slow internet speed. Tweet about it, post it on facebook, instagram and other social media. Share this with everyone. Retweet this tweet to support me in highlighting this FRAUD. Do not renew your @reliancejio #JioFiber they have reduced the upload speed to 0.5 MB from 100 MBPS and they are not communicating this to the #customers before or after recharge. #JagoGrahakJago@airtelindia @tatadocomo @VodafoneIN are better choice.#Internet #broadband #India\u2014 \u092a\u094d\u0930\u0916\u0930 \ud83c\udf00 (@PrakharSahay) December 27, 2019\n You can also see many customers are facing this problem and they have started to tweet: Take a look at these search results where customers are raising similar concerns: jio fiber - Twitter Search Thanks but already got cheated here also. Last month got it recharged, took plan of one year after that wrong deduction on sms everyday. Pathetic services of @reliancejio &even customer care too. Not ready2resolve my issue. @airtelindia has some network issues but still the best.\u2014 CheatedHomeBuyer Priti Nath (@PritiNath9) December 27, 2019\n Anyone else using Jio Fiber noticed that getting only about 10% upload speed that is 10Mbps on the 100 Mbps plan. What's the point of having a fiber connection and why capping upload speed on Jio fiber @reliancejio  When anyways you count all the data used? Very Stupid logic.\u2014 Ranjit (@geekyranjit) December 23, 2019\n You are right .. I recharged in the morning and now i am getting 1 MBPS speed .. @JioCare .. pic.twitter.com/TqomlmTxZD\u2014 avinash (@avinash_1706) December 27, 2019\n @JioCare @reliancejio i have silver plan which offers upto 100 mbps speed but i am gettinh not more than 50\u2019mbps #JioFiber pic.twitter.com/5X5iJJnjmK\u2014 Sahil (@sahiljain1108) December 24, 2019\n I hope the Jio Fiber corrects their mistake and enables 1:1 speed along with correct recharge plan by mentioning the correct Download and Upload Speesd to enable transparency so that customers can take informed decision wheather to use Jio Fiber or NOT.
