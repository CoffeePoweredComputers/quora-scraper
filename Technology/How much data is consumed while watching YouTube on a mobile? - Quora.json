            "answer_text": "Well! We can't be sure how much data is consumed while watching a video. It depends on Quality of the Video like HQ or HD etcDuration of the video.I would suggest you to go for High Quality if your mobile is connected Via WiFi so that you can save your Data. If your watching in your mobile go for 240p or 360p in the quality the video is in visible quality and you can save your Data. If your stubborn to know how much data is exactly consumed then download any Data Usage Monitor App from Play Store Or IOS and before you play a particular video you write down the current data consumed and after watching check it and calculate but doing this to each and every video you watch in YouTube will make spend more time on doing this calculation rather than watching video. Don't worry about data just enjoying watching videos in 240p or 360p you will have enough data to watch enough video. Or else if you watch a particular video again and again just download the video from YouTube via Tube Mate. That's it.. ",

            "answer_text": "Depends on the what network you are on 4g, 3g, etc. , youtube generally detects the network speed and run the videos accordingly at the resolution which will run smoothly. If you are on 4g or good wifi your data will get exhausted quickly. If I watch a full movie 2 hours long on Airtel 4g almost 400 mb is consumed, again it depends on what resolution the video is played. ",
