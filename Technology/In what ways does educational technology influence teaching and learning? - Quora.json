            "answer_text": "Technology has several effects on education. The biggest of these is the influence it has on the student generation to be taught: Young people who have grown with digital technology have slighly more mental health issues like depression, partly because of the online culture focused on the looks and likings. On the bright side, they have more information to help them deal with their gender identity, to find out others with similar interests and values and to connect with people sharing their advice.They have a different kind of relationship to their phones, the internet and using computer than any earlier generation.They drink less, use less drugs and have sex later than the students before; there are not many criminals in the cohort.They have a short attention span for boring lessons and reading books is also difficult for many.They recognize ways of visual story-telling and know a lot about multimedial communication.Part of them are not used to real conversations and sensitivity and anxiety are common.The general knowledge is not shared by all and the differences in both skills and knowledge is enormous inside a class of teens.The education itself has been partly transformed through technology. The learning analytics are helping teachers to adapt their teaching according to the needs of the students. Some tech applications really do help to make learning more effective and motivating. Shooting videos and simulations are good way of learning together. Interactive digital text books or learning platforms make learners more activevin the classroom. Online courses help learning to be available for students who otherwise could not afford studying or have opportunities near them. The changes in the classroom happen gradually and are not easily detected but part of the change is due to adapting to the change in students and part of it is adapting to the education technology and the pressure to use it. My perspective is that of a Finnish high school teacher and I would be interested in if the same kind of tendencies apply also in other countries. ",

            "answer_text": "Nearly every human endeavor involves technology of some sort, and electronic/ digital technologies are not necessarily better than other kinds, especially from the sustainability aspect of repair & replacement; the true technologies are the knowledge of how to make things that underlies all technologies. In that respect, technology is dependent upon teaching and learning just as much as teaching and learning is dependent upon technologies. For example, lets take the task of solving mathematical problems, as long as you know the concepts of addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, exponents, fractions, trigonomic functions, etc, you can learn to solve complex math problems very quickly with several types of technology, from abacus to computer. At first glance, one might think the electronic computational devices are the more sophisticated technology, thse uber-flexible black boxes we get all our answers from. And I use my computer most of each day and feel lost without it, but I\u2019m very cognizant of its failings, shared by most electronic devices. There are few people that really understand completely how even a tiny part of them works, so no one person can build one from scratch with the capacity currently being marketed. Repairs aren\u2019t about fixing just what\u2019s actually broken, rather the entire component containing the broken bit is replaced, and often your local store\u2019s tech support can not do the work, it has to be shipped out and may be away for more than a week even if all goes well (which is the state of my computer right now). An abacus is a very simple device to make, it only does math calculations, and is often more cumbersome to carry, and is a device with a very steep learning curve and no capacity for storing lots of individual data points. However, skilled users can often beat ordinary users of electronic calculators to the answer, and such feats are not dependent upon sophisticated infrastructure like having a source of electricity or even much light to see by. In fact expert abacus users can often still solve complex problems they way they would do it on an abacus even if they do not have one at the time, they simply picture their abacus in their head and move their fingers as if they were sliding the beads, to help them remember where they are in their calculations. Any idiot like me could make a fully functional abacus, possibly even from scratch. Now that is sophisticated sustainable technology,and it enhances user comprehension of the math performed in a way an electronic black box just can\u2019t do! ",
