            "answer_text": "If you are talking about Fresenius Medical Care, the only upside of working there is the amount of paid time off you receive after working there a few years. I worked there 15 years and I still get agitated when I think about it. After 15 years though, if you do like I did, once my work was completed, I clocked out as early as possibly could and replace my missed hours with my PTO. I usually ended up working 30\u201335 hours a week. Oh, one last thing, kiss any holidays you want to spend with family goodbye because you will be working them or at least pulling a double and end up sleeping your holidays away. ",
