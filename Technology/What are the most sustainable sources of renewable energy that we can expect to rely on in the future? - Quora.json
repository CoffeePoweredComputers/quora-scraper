            "answer_text": "I suppose it depends. Currently according to the EIA, wind is the cheapest sustainable energy ($0.10 per kW/h) unless it is offshore ($0.24 per kW/h). Nuclear is ($0.11 per kW/h) and solar is still quite expensive ($0.21 to $0.31). (As a comparison, natural gas is $0.05). But the cost of renewables is plummeting as technology develops. Wind can be unpredictable, but the power increases with the cube of the wind velocity, so very windy areas can see turbines generate around 7MW. Solar has quite a puny capacity factor but is increasing, plus the cost of solar cells (initially thought to be expensive) will probably end up being negligible. Over a square mile, solar generates over a gigawatt of electricity at peak - same as a large coal plant. But sunlight doesn't always hit at a perfect 90 degree angle, it is oblique, and doesn't exist at all at night... I don't know much about nuclear other than it is very cheap to run and maintain, it has an incredibly high capacity factor (90%), and can generate huge amounts if power. But nuclear has immensely high capital and a new nuclear plant is very expensive, plus 'nuclear' is still a dirty word to a lot of people. In summary, I think solar thermal and wind might have the best chances, but I don't know. Money is everything and people will go for the cheapest solution at the time. ",

            "answer_text": "Marine Current Turbines The under current is slow (m/s) but has high torque and is predictable. Using non rare earth / polluting tech and a balanced install (when 1 area is on an ebb, another is on a flow) electricity issues are pretty much solved for those within economical distance of the shoreline, however room temperature semi-conductors will solve the long distance power transfer issue. Marine life has shown to only be minimally affected, and local animal populations avoid / live with the test machines currently in place. How reliable is the tide?The first computational machines where designed to calculate it! How reliable is your solar or wind farm?We have spent billions and still can't tell you with a high enough degree of certainty what the weather is going to be in even 10 minutes. Anything else, as far as I am aware either needs, fuel (alcohol / bio diesel / nuclear rods), is un-reliable (solar, wind), or requires super complex or rare materials (Helium 3 Mining for example).
