            "answer_text": "Look anywhere on the internet, you will see no viable answer to that question, maybe because not many tech YouTubers and enthusiasts are from rural South-East Asia and Africa. I am not sure how good of an internet connection you can get on off-shore oil drills and I can assure you from experience that mines can barely have a mobile tower, let alone support internet speed for HD videos. There are places with painfully slow internet connections, which need a video conversation to go smoothly, where clear instructions are paramount rather than depending on reading facial expressions.. The bandwidth that may be required to transmit an HD video channel with sound, while receiving another would make it impossible to have any meaningful conversation. In these fringe scenarios, a 1 MP webcam makes sense. Moreover, if one does need a good quality webcam, there are many aftermarket ones available on the market. ",
