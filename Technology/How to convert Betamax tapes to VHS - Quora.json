            "answer_text": "Assuming you own a Betamax player that's in working condition. You would then connect it to a VHS recorder and record away. But as someone else posted here, the Betamax tape will probably have copy protection in the form of Macrovision. This can be bypassed by obtaining a Digital Video Stabilizer box. However, I don't recommend transferring content from a very old format like Betamax to an also defunct format like VHS. Transferring to DVD is a better option as DVD players are ubiquitous and are easy to use. However, you will need to first convert the video to a format that's compliant with the DVD specification then you'd have to use software to burn the disc. They have inexpensive products online that can do the conversion for you but if quality is important to you beware that you get little control over the quality with these cheap solutions. Another option would be to pay a professional to do it. Another option would be to forget about DVD and transfer your Betamax tapes to QuickTime \".mov\" files using the H.264 compression standard. This will produce better quality than DVD at the same file size or even much smaller file sizes. This is because H.264 is a more modern and thus more efficient format than the MPEG-2 format that DVD uses. The downside is, you can\u2019t play discs with these type of files in a DVD player. They will only play in computers. There\u2019s an even newer compression format that recently emerged which is a successor to H.264. It\u2019s called H.265 but as of this writing not many computers are equipped to play it. Apple has support for this starting with the High Sierra version of their operating system. This newest compression standard offers to produce file sizes that would be half the size of H.264 files yet maintain the same quality. Again, the downside would be that you can only play this in computers. ",

            "answer_text": "Quick and dirty? skipping the obvious of power on, insert media etc. For standard betamax get a mono to \"stereo\" cable. Which actually creates joint mono. Run the output jacks on the betamax player to the input jacks on a dvdr recorder or a high grade vcr (4head or more) as they will usually self-stabilize the inbound video. Run the recorder's out to the tv. press play on the bm, wait for it to spin up and feed to the Distributors logo. Then hit record on the recorder. Or get a capture card for your pc/mac and run the bm player into that. Download the free vlc, and grab the VSaTBC plugin from gethub. Following the readme included with the plugin to record with vlc and get near professional conversion to digital. I'd suggest using the free x265 mkv output codec in vlc. Setting it at 820kbs for sub 32inch screens and 996 for large screens. 1200 works for 1080p and 22xx. Just make sure to check the box to set expansion (not conversion) of picture. Betamax uses pulldown. You can simply stretch it to get a proper image. There's more convoluted methods which I use that combine multiple processors and hardware filters but that's a whole nother post of considerable length and very technical. ",

            "answer_text": "Simply put, you don\u2019t. They were two mechanically and electrically different formats, with no simple way to use one mechanism to read the other\u2019s tape. They both ended up with a composite NTSC (edit: or PAL, SECAM, etc) video signal, but that\u2019s about all they have in common, and doesn\u2019t help with your viewing issue. If you can get access to a Beta player, you could certainly copy the content onto a VHS player, though these days you\u2019d be better off just digitizing it, either yourself with a video USB or FireWire adapter, or letting one of the many online conversion services do it for you; many camera or big box stores also offer video transfer services for non-copyrighted videos.

If the recorded media is in NTSC (America and Japan) then the player/recorders must match that format as well. You can not play a PAL/SECAM tape in an NTSC player and visibly see a correct image. There are multi-format VHS recorders out there that can transcode from any format input to any format output. ",
