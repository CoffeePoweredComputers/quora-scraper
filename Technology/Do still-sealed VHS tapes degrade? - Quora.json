            "answer_text": "Yes. Mechanically, because the tape itself is physically thin and somewhat stretchy, it can become slightly uneven or ruffled at the edges, after long periods of being would tightly on the spool, which can compromise how well it contacts the tape heads. Whether this happens will depend on the tape, the exact conditions under which it is stored, and exactly how it was manufactured (how thick the tape medium is and how tightly it was wound on the reels). This issue might be significant enough to reduce the quality of new recordings made on an old blank tape. (However, I\u2019ve never seen a VHS tape get brittle, or simply fall apart, like really old audio tape\u2026 the materials used are relatively tolerant to that sort of failure.) In addition to that, with prerecorded tapes, the magnetic signal is subject to some degree of print-through between layers, and some degree of fading. Together, this tends to make the recording get fuzzier and less distinct over time. Again, this depends on the characteristics of the tape itself, how it was recorded, and how it is stored. (Warmth, humidity, and magnetic fields, like storing tapes near a power transformer, make this occur FAR more rapidly.) (There\u2019s also a sort of psychological effect\u2026. Because the picture quality on VHS tape is pretty bad, even when compared to DVDs, when we view an old tape, it seems to be even worse than it really is, just by contrast with newer recordings.) ",

            "answer_text": "In my experience with VHS tapes, I have yet to find that the tape was noticably worn or unwatchable from just sitting sealed in plastic. However, I have found that heavily USED PRERECORDED tapes that have been watched a lot tend to degrade in quality, because they\u2019re actually being touched and fed through the mechanism. Unused blank tapes shouldn\u2019t (at least, as long as they\u2019re not absurdly old, as in, probably manufactured before the 80\u2019s) be damaged or degraded that badly. What format, however, does degrade even when sitting in a sealed case to the point of unwatchability? CED\u2019s.  You can\u2019t record on the format, sure, but the lubricant and charged particles that make CED\u2019s conductive and the machine not skip will make the CED glitch out and be unwatchable even when still sealed. Yikes. Thank the Omnissiah VHS and Laserdisc took off and not this thing. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, they are not air tight seals and even if they were they were sealed with air inside of them. Sealed tapes will degrade slower due to the restricted air flow, but they will still degrade eventually. Storage temperatures and humidity levels in the storage area will also effect the speed of degradation. The most you can expect from a VHS tape is 15 to 20 years if they are opened, and maybe in the extreme case 25 to 30 years if they remained sealed and properly temperature controlled. But you would need to be aware of it\u2019s storage conditions for the entire duration of it\u2019s existence to have any way to guessing where in that range it will die. ",

            "answer_text": "Do still-sealed VHS tapes degrade? It depends on the material, on the manufacturer. If you store them in a dry and cool place, they will keep longer. In principle, everything changes over time. Some materials change much more slowly than others. There are quality plastics that last for decades. I have audio cassettes at the age of 40 and they haven't changed. I last played video tapes ten years ago. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, but not nearly as fast as tapes which have been played. VHS tapes are a magnetic medium. Magnetic media naturally decays. A VHS tape will (very roughly) experience about 1%-2% signal loss per year just sitting on the shelf under ideal conditions. High heat and humidity will accelerate this natural, inevitable decay. Every time you play it back you are damaging the media. Bottom line, if you have any irreplaceable memories saved on VHS tapes you should have them transferred to digital media ASAP. Video tape has very poor archival characteristics. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, but some tape holds up very well. There was a period in which many tape formulations used an adhesive binder that became sticky with humidity. If you are unfortunate to have this tape, it could ruin your VCR. Other tapes tendended to lose the built in lubrication over time. And sorry to say, some tapes were counterfeit. If you know that it is a reliable brand, just check that it does not feel sticky on the tape on either side. ",

I have many videos I owned from the late 70s through to the 1090s all backed up into a hard drive saved as a mp4 & mov files. ",
