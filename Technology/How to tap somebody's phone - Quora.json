            "answer_text": "I agree with Mario Ortega \u2018s answer, to a certain extent. Unfortunately, today the cost for tracking/tapping a cellphone has gone so low that the illegal business of tracking/tapping other\u2019s phone is literally booming. It is not just booming because it has become cheap, it is booming because the demand is increasing and, unfortunately, this growing demand comes from abusive, jealous partners. According to a recent research done by Joseph Cox (Vice, Feb.22, 2017), $170 are enough to buy a very sophisticated app able to track any phone, even from the other side of the world. According to Cox\u2019s research, this technology, albeit illegal, has been even copied by some law enforcement agencies and it has become so advanced that cannot even be easily removed from the target phone. In Australia, for example Women's Services Network (WESNET) gives new smartphones to victims of domestic violence So, unfortunately, you don\u2019t need to be a V.I.P. to become victim of this sort of stalking, and, beware, this technology is easily available to anyone. Many of our clients are lawyers and business men who are well aware of the risks they take in using standard phones. To be clear, it doesn\u2019t matter what brand is your phone, if it connects to the standard cellular network it can be easily tapped/tracked, no matter what. ",

            "answer_text": "Step 1. Join a law enforcement agency.Step 2. Go to a court for a wiretap warrant. Landline telephones are simple technology. At the core of everything, even the most advanced telephone is still a radio; however, most mobile telephone networks encode voice digitally and encrypt the stream. Someone with suitable knowledge, technology and resources can tap either. However, legality - specifically civil and criminal penalty is more of a concern. Most countries and their component states/provinces do not have a great sense of humor when it comes to wiretaps. ",
