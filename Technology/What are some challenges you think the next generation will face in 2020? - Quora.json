            "answer_text": "OK. You have fine responses about ability to finance your life. And there's something about morality in the absence of churches. Marianne Williamson was running for President on a platform of doing the right thing which she called coming from Love. She was ridiculed and shooed off the stage for the language. People didn't understand. The things that she described were your challenges: Healthcare for all means not just that you have to find a way to see that every one of us can afford to get care when sick (like with covid-19) but you also have to make sure that we are collectively kept well. It's actually cheaper than trying to heal people and the economy after they get sick. Wellness is dependent on not only what people do individually in terms of diet and exercise and meditation and mental health habits. It is also dependent on how we take care of each other and the environment. We need to ungag our scientists. Stop ignoring their life's work and listen to them. Restore and improve on the environmental protection laws which the current administration reversed because profits are more important. We cannot breathe in polluted air. We do not properly hydrate and cleanse with chemical filled water. Trees need to be planted to restore the earth's life sustaining temperature and oxygen balance. Ice capped Mountains with free flowing water and protective plant growth and pollinating insects and other nature balancing animals were not built over millennia to be chopped down level by heavy equipment for profit from their minerals. Stop the perpetual wars. My parents pointed out that big money is made and jobs are had from the manufacture and sale of weaponry. They were right. It's going on and on now and Mr Trump seems to be hell bent on finding some more. Yesterday I read that he wants to be paid for the military personnel who serve in other countries helping to build things and training allies\u2019 military personnel and even participating in their wars. They would be paid mercenaries with the funds going to our government instead of providing a service that helps us to keep world peace. Stop abuse of well\u2026 actually anybody. Marianne Williamson specified children who are under fed and physically and emotionally traumatized and didn't have access to the best education. They are likely to become abusers and incarcerated and living in poverty. I am including women who tend to be underpaid and up against a glass ceiling and victimized sexually. And then there is racism. So many people are against immigration and OK with building fences and they are still holding children in cages apart from their families. Of course right now we are looking at police brutality against black people and surely others of color are targeted. The class of 2020 has its work cut out in a big way. Go forth and change the world. ",

            "answer_text": "Establishing themselves amidst a recession at a time when college credentials are common, the risk of competition from foreign workers via telework is high, the national debt is vast and the annual deficits appalling with no end in sight, and there\u2019s a lot of political strife amidst the \u2018culture wars,\u2019 yet Americans are accustomed to a high material standard of living - smart phone with data plan, home computer, big screen t.v. with cable or satellite service, in much of the U.S. a car, etc\u2026 Making relationship success can be tough. Most humans are straight and have natural innate drives to pair up, at least temporarily, and most people procreate at some point. So much of American society has shifted away from Christian values and expectations (e.g.: regarding fornication, adultery, nature of marriage), and there\u2019s so much less stigma to fornication, co-habitation, adultery and divorce than there used to be, that just getting on the same page with a partner about what\u2019s supposed to happen can be hard, including why it ought to be that way. Then there\u2019s making it happen, which has been hard for a lot longer! While my perspective is Christian, even people who weren\u2019t used to have a common cultural playbook influenced by those values and expectations (e.g.: marriage should be for life, adultery is wrong, a child should have 2 involved parents). So, if you get work and family hammered out, that brings up to #3, a biggie - preparing a future. Unless you plan to live on Social Security alone (I read elsewhere that in 2018, the average Social Security benefit for retirees was $16,719.17 per year), if you anticipate supporting a mainstream American lifestyle and private section pensions seem headed for extinction\u2026you\u2019d better build a very large nest egg. Just putting a little in the company 401-K isn\u2019t likely to do it. ",
