            "answer_text": "I left the working world in 2005. At the time, I was managing a mailing list of 60,000 subscribers. Fortunately I wasn\u2019t the only one inputting new subscribers, but I was the only one vetting the input. 15 years ago the computer I was using was already 3\u20134 years old. But I had 2 19 inch CRT monitors. I had 3 e-mail addresses I was responsible for, and the snail mail. That was when I was \u201cretired at 57\u201d and replaced by a computer system and a young person straight out of college :) What didn\u2019t change was GI/GO which translates garbage in / garbage out. That was why I was in the loop. From what I understand, the amount of garbage in eventually was reduced with technology, whether it was zeroed I don\u2019t know. But I know the first few years, from contacts in the firm, that there were \u201cteething\u201d problems. I said all that to preface the present. We all have had the experience of signing up for stuff online. Well that is the entry point today, to getting on a \u201cmailing\u201d list. A lot different than 15 years ago, when it could be a letter, with a form out of a magazine, or a convention application. Now we do it ourselves. Or if we go to a kiosk, the person behind the counter inputs the information directly, for us. The only time I did it the old way, was when I signed up for burial insurance last month, with an agent. He filled out a form and sent it in, with my signature. So someone had to input into the system that information, from his chicken scratchings. I felt for the person who got those forms. I used to keep some of the most outrageous ones, but they have all been down sized to the shredder. I found one last fall though. A sweet letter from a Mennonite older lady, who wrote her English as she would say it, with her thick Dutch/German accent. It hadn\u2019t been sent to me, but another department. I got it because they were at a loss as to what language it was in, and knew I had some online translation sites. One of many good memories from the almost 8 years. I think in some ways, though we have more accurate technology: digital input of written words, faster computers, and better monitors. Something will have been lost. For instance, this answer, is rather an impersonal connection to someone I don\u2019t know. In the future, when communications and computer interactions come through clothing, appliances, \u201cAlexa PA\u201d or attachments to our bodies that we wear or are permanently implanted (before it all goes internal with nano-bots) will we become less connected? Especially where we work. It is work where a lot of connections are made that lead to marriage and family. Will the digital divide in the workplace end that? Society is changing, and new ways of connecting are happening through technology, how will this affect our working life? I don\u2019t often delve into the societal changes that are ongoing throughout my life, but it is always in the back of my mind. A shadow that is always present. Technology will be great in helping us live better lives, whether at work or out and about or at home. But what about how we interact in society? What will it mean to be human, feminine or masculine, in the future. We are moving away from what our ancestors would call the norms of society. The changes that began in the 20th century in technology, and society, will be a tea party compared to what happens in this century. For good and bad. ",
