            "answer_text": "Jannes Bakker has already stolen my intuitivt first answer (the printing press). Having thought about this for a while longer however, I would argue that there is another, second answer which is at least as important: gunpowder weapons. Sure, if you want to be technical you can argue that they were introduced into Europe during the late middle ages - which is certainly true, but irrelevant. The culture of using gunpowder weapons increasingly as a primary form of armament is something that developed in Europe during the Renaissance, differentiating the continent from the rest of the world. The chinese also had gunpowder - but they never developed armies where *everyone* wielded them. This development democraticed warfare, and undermined the structure of the previous feudal system. It was also absolutely fundamental for all the other major developments which were to take place during the renaissance like the increase in the importance of commerce, centralization of political power to the courts and cities, the conquest of the new world as well as - intetestingly enough - the printing press itself. How exactly are they related you may ask? Well, think about it. 1) The introduction of gunpowder-weapons predates the printingpress somewhat, but it's spread is roughly co-terminous with it. 2) What exactly did the printing press do? It increased the breadth of the spread of information and the written word, yes, but in some ways it also centralized informationflow. For the first time, an individual had the power to print multiple, identical volumes of books when he could have almost complete control over the content. Obviously this power is very attractive to kings, however the technology intensive nature of the printing press means they are dependent on a specialist class whose natural place of residence is the city. This creates an interestic dynamic in which the kings are dependent on competency which necessitates a much more commercial and free environment than the traditional landed aristocracy could provide. 3) The development of this emvironmemt not only benefits from gunpowder weapons but I would argue, is dependent upon the existence of such weapons - as well as encourages their further development. What do I mean? Look at the historical development of the printing press: it was first created in an urban environment, in a small German state, and spread first in this environment. Just look at the heroes of the Renaissance, Luther, Erasmus, Galileo\u2026 all of them were active in the smaller european states, and a look at the map of the initial spread of the printing press confirms this: File:Printing towns incunabula.svg - Wikipedia (https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Printing_towns_incunabula.svg) What happens during the late Renaissance is that royal monopolies om printing \u00e4r established, and these (while not Always Bert effective) at least increased the powers of the greater and centralized European powers (like France) at the expense of powers like Venice or Rotterdam.  Now, this development almost perfectly mirrors the history of the diffusion of gunpowder weapons. First the northern italian citystates led the way with their condottieri during the early renaissance. Eventually however they were overcome by larger rivals like France and the Habsburgs. Even these great powers had to change their game however. Unlike the wealthy italian merchant families, the kings had no wealth from commerce, nor the competency required for wielding and using guns effectively. Instead they 1) sponsorer cities against the landowning aristocracy and 2) created a professional bureaucrat-class of experts and specialists who were payed and appointed by the crown to administer all this. Any class distinguished by its competency will naturally have an interest in the printing press, both partaking in as well as regulating the new environmemt. The winners from both of these developments are really the central government (the royal house) and citydwellers of different kinds. The biggest loosers are the landed elite and the clergy. Why would the landed gentry encourage the growth of specialists? They are not easily bound to the land, and they behave in all sorts of unpredictable ways, revolutionizing the value of land. As anyone with a mortgage can tell you, people who own land (or a house) are much more likely to prioritise economic stability over disruptions in price. The clergy has even less interest in technological development - they used to have a practical monopoly on knowledge after all. What is to say that these two powers would not have banded together to limit the king's power, and the special privileges of the cities? The answer is very simple: the detterent effect of violence. One historical example will surely prove illustrativa enough: Holland. An intellectual and commercial centre during the 1600s, they broke free from the Habsburgs by the barrell of a gun - and subsequently proceeded to become the main place in continental Europe for those who wanted tog circumwent royal monopolies of printing. Imagine that. ",
