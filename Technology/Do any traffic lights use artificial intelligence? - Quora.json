            "answer_text": "Almost certainly, there\u2019s a traffic signal somewhere on this planet that\u2019s being controlled by something we would call AI. The real question is, is that a good idea? I\u2019ve deployed a number of control systems in my career, so I can comment as a \u201cdomain expert\u201d of sorts. I think it\u2019s a terrible idea. It\u2019s implementation dependent of course, but many AI system take nondeterministic amounts of time to come to decisions about things. Control systems don\u2019t take very kindly to accommodating nondeterministic control signals. Here\u2019s an example. The AI might be considering incoming traffic flow in all 4 directions, as it comes to a decision about what to do. It informs the light to turn yellow in 2 directions, in preparation for giving the other direction a green. Then, the AI comes to a different decision, when the impact of all of the data is finally considered. The AI decides doing that yellow light was a bad idea. Now what should it do? Errantly proceed with going to red and giving the other traffic the green? Or, confusingly go green-yellow-green? It\u2019d be better to have something deterministic and provably consistent controlling things. AI is outstanding in certain domains, and out standing in others. ",

            "answer_text": "Besides AI, I thought a lot of this when waiting in a red light with more than 3 cars and no car is passing on the green, that\u2019s one of many problems. I don\u2019t know if in other countries do that but certainly not in Morocco. So to answer your question ,no traffic lights use artificial intelligence. But I can see that there are some good applications of AI to make traffic better by reducing intersections accidents, reducing traffic in some places. The good old timer on a red light is no longer a good idea in some intersections, in fact sometimes police mans control the lights to reduce the traffic, something that can be done effectively by an AI. There are more and more people using cars everyday, and more accidents on intersections, in fact 40% of accidents occur in intersections but not all intersections have traffic lights. So it is a great idea to use AI in traffic lights. ",

Most larger cities in the U.S. already have traffic control centers which take in data from all of the intersections, but the largest ones are just now getting to implementing A.I. One day we\u2019ll look back to the days of our stoplights like we look back on the simple timed ones. But I\u2019ll let this video explain it way better than I can! ",

            "answer_text": "NO! Because AI doesn't exist. My cat is smarter than Siri - she, like Roombas, use computer protocols - nothing more. Traffic lights' controllers (generally a silver or grey box somewhere near the junction - don't HIT one with your car - they are classed as \"street furniture\" and are often not covered by your motor insurance - and they are damn EXPENSIVE) have PROGRAMMES that either run from control centres or are self-contained. Either way, you are playing a VIDEO GAME, the parameters of which are varied by time and traffic detector units. This means if there is a gap in the traffic, they will \"gap out\" and change. If not, the inter-green (the time in seconds between one stage leaving green and the next one's commencement) will lengthen, to allow traffic to clear the junction. At this point, my having served five years as a traffic light ENGINEER, I could write several thousand words about them - but as I have answered the original question, I will stop now. ",
