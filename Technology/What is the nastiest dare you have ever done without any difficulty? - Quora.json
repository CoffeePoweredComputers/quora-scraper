            "answer_text": "My most nastiest dare was is 8th standard. I was in VIIIth D. It was during a festive ocassion, almost half of the class was absent. So the teachers of division C & D combined. Now is the fun time! \ud83d\ude08\ud83d\ude08\ud83d\ude08 Teachers had given us the whole day free, cause of very less students. We enjoyed our time to the fullest. Games periods, extra recess time, movie times, etc. It was the last period of the day and, we all were asked to be seated and make no noice as our principal had already freaked out more than twice for our irresponsible and childish behavior. I along with my three other friends gathered around our desks and thought of playing a game. Me, Varad, Cynthia and Komal were benchmates. We four decided to make no more trouble and play a silent game of \u2018 Truth or Dare\u2019 So we took a pen and made it spin on the table and the tip pointed at me. I chose Dare. I could make out of these guys devious smile that I will surely get beaten from someone for this dare. They were planning something for a whole minute and Varad and Komal said, \u201c Go to Nivea Mam and tell she looks hot in that dress.\u201d Now I knew have really Fk*ed up. The worst part is the teacher is a newbie and she is 22\u201323 years old here for a training. She taught us Computer Science. I am very nervous and didn't have to guts to tell that. They pressurized me to the fullest to go and admire her. I tried to back off, but according to the game rules we have decided, the person who backs off must give a treat to all the participants and even do the homework for two days. \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d There's nowhere for me to go. In front of me there's an ocean and behind me a valley. It's my choice to choose my own poison. With all the courage in my heart, I stood on my legs like a Warrior going to the battlefield knowing that I am surely going to die. Now I was very cunning, so I thought if a plan. My foolproof plan: \u201c To protect myself, my pride, I will give the teacher a slight hint of what is was upto. I knew she was or is still a big fan of Impractical Jokers\u2026so that could be a hint to my dare. Plus she is bed cool about these things. But still we don't know, when her mood changes. So I was prepared.\u201d I slowly approached her, she was reading a book. I still remember the book. Is said, \u2018 How to teach children manners.\u2019 The name of the book itself gave me chills. I looked back and all I could see three faces laughing their asses.. Omg\u2026.. I was going to faint. God forbid, all I wished was not to get punished for saying that. She was near the class door. I slowly, carefully, sweating took my steps towards her. She laughingly came towards me and said, \u201c I know I look good and beautiful in this dress, you may now go back to your seat.\u201d I returned to my seat with an awkward expression. They thought I completed my dare and we continued with the game. The period was over and we four were gonna bid bye to each other and suddenly the teacher came towards us and said, \u201c I do appreciate your courage Anand, but guys do not do such kind of dares in school.\u201d I still couldn't guess how did she come to know about my dare. Nor the three of them knew. Surprisingly, she wasn't angry and as a good teacher, taught us to be responsible and respectful. She saved me and my day. I was happy for completing my dare and Cynthia had to do my homework for two consecutive days, as she backed off. \ud83d\ude01 So I guess there was a lot of difficulty for me to complete the dare, but still completed it. Cause this is Sparta!!! Paldies! \u2764 \u2764 ",

As being from a very disciplined background, (defence services) my childhood was in Strict discipline, but after my father retired from Air force, I changed my school to a private one, Sukhmani International school, So now I started to see all those Punjabi kids, without 1% of discipline in their lives, The fisrt thing I started doing was carrying Hair comb with me, to set my hair, every time I got a chance, But unfortunately some Harami Boy of our class informed the class teacher, and we were doomed when we got a special Bag checking, I lost 5 combs, I am not kidding, I had different kind of combs, like the short one :-  Long comb:-  Round comb :-  Foldable comb :-  Roller comb :-  So the roller comb was the costliest one, Its cost was 549 INR, After all the combs were confesticated, Most of them were returned after a week after giving warning. But this roller comb was not given back, I even tried to ask about it, but our teacher shouted on me, for asking about it, and Said that I should be greatfull for getting other combs back, But Now I had decided to get it back, But I had not made any kind of plan, Later after 2 weeks, I got a dare, of stealing something from any teacher. I had to complete the dare within 2 weeks, After 3\u20134 week of that Confestication case, My ill behavior with classmates landed me in the Principal's Office, after, So after listening to a good Long speech from the Principal Ma'am, I complained that I was not the only mischievous one, to which mam asked who were the others with you, I took names, And she herself went to call those kids. Meanwhile I saw my Comb, my Love \ud83d\ude05 so then I did the required action, I picked that comb, hid it inside my Coat, and took it home. I completed the Dare, easily. ",
