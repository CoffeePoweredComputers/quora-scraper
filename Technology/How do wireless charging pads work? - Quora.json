            "answer_text": "Wireless charging pads make use of coils to create the electromagnetic field that is used to transfer energy from the charging base to the device. An induction coil within the charger forms an oscillating magnetic field, while a secondary coil (on the receiving wireless charging-enabled device or receiver case) obtains power from the field and converts it into the electric current that is used to recharge a device. These coils generally have slightly off-resonance frequencies to allow highly-efficient power transfer, which means with chargers that use inductive coupling, the coils have to be properly aligned for efficient charging. It\u2019s also important to note that wireless charging pads contain coils that are small in diameter (a few inches). The diameter of the coils directly affects the distance between the device and your phone, which means bigger coils will be able to transfer more energy\u2014thus resulting in faster charging speeds. In order to better explain how wireless charging pads work, here\u2019s a simple illustration from TDK:  Simply put, you\u2019ll have to plug your charging pad to a wall socket and place your Qi or PMA-compatible device on top of it. As long as your receiver (wireless charging-enabled device or receiver case) is properly aligned with your charging pad, you\u2019re good to go. Accurate placement and alignment is essential to ensure fast and efficient charging, so you may want to check if your wireless charging pad uses magnetic power to immediately guide your phone to the best charging spot. If it doesn\u2019t, some manufacturers are now producing magnetic wireless charging cases to help you achieve proper placement every time you charge.

            "answer_text": "1st Part : Wireless charging or Inductive charging works on the principle of the Faraday's law of induction which states that a changing magnetic flux can induce an electromotiveforce(EMF) in a coil. EMF is not a force but a potential measured in volts between the two open ends of the coil. The potential creates electric field which drives the current in any circuit connected to the EMF source or in our case the coil ends.  Faraday's law:         is Electromotiveforce of EMF     is magnetic flux.       is number of turns EMF is proportional to the number of turns in the coil multiplied by the rate of change of effective magnetic flux generated by the magnetic source. In our case the flux source will be the charging station. Mutual coupling is ignored and the charging station is assumed to be very close to the device ,which means minimal flux leakage.  Faraday's law of Induction can also be understood with the following figure. The relative motion between the coil and the magnet changes the magnetic field strength over area or magnetic flux. This time varying flux induces voltage in the coil. Total EMF is the induced voltage in each turn multiplied by total number of turns in the coil for a tightly wounded coil.    The above mechanism can be used to charge a battery with voltage rating lower than the EMF. For example for a charger rating of 5 volts, 0.7 A charging a Li-ion battery of rating 3.7 volt 1650 mAh, i.e., the battery at a voltage of 3.7 volts can output 1.65 A for about an hour(or 6.11 Wh) it will take about 1 hr 45 mins to completely charge the battery from nil. Other factors like battery age and temperature also determines charging time. As shown in figure below, the EMF can be rectified and used to charge a battery , just like an AC adapter.   2nd Part : The charging station, as shown above, works on the principle of Amp\u00e8re's circuital law using which one can determine the magnetic field associated with a current. By Controlling the current magnitude and flow direction one can produce magnetic fluctuations of desired magnitude and frequency. In the following figure the oscillator is tuned such that the rate of change of magnetic flux matches the resonating frequency of the receiver coil for maximum power transfer.   Both laws are part of the Maxwell's equations of Classical electromagnetism. ",
