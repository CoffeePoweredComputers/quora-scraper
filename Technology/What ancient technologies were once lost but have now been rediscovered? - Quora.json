            "answer_text": "Concrete is an important one, though the extent to which it was lost in some question.  Although various societies had played with related mixes of materials, it was the Romans who started working with concrete on a large scale. Starting around the early 3rd century BC, they figured out that a mix of lime mortar and aggregates (sand, pebbles, and various kinds of rubble) could be used to produce a sort of artificial stone. More importantly, if a certain volcanic ash were added to the mix, it gained durability and could set underwater, making it perfect for hydraulic uses. With the collapse of the empire, supplies of pozzalana volcanic ash largely dried up, as did the kinds of large-scale public works which called for the use of concrete. The material all but vanished. It may not have been entirely lost, but it did become very, very hard to find, returning in the late Middle Ages, but really taking off in the 19th century when someone figured out how to artificially manufacture pozzalana stone. Soon afterwards, concrete was back as an important structural material. ",

            "answer_text": "Korean blue-green celadon porcelain. Korea, as do China and Japan, has a magnificent history in ceramics. During the Joseon Dynasty (1392\u20131897) the white baekja porcelain came to great popularity not only among the upper class in Korea, but in China where much of it came to be exported. (This is not to be confused with white bone china, invented and produced in England several hundred years later.) Prior to the age of baekja, by the middle part of the Goryeo Dynasty (918-1392) Korean artisans had mastered the art of blue-green celadon, cheongja, with unique techniques separate from the Chinese and Japanese. By the end of the 11th century, quintessential masterpieces were being produced. Military invasions from Mongolia in the mid-13th century put a halt to the top levels of artistry because most of the production sites were destroyed. By the time the Koreans began to make celadon again several decades later and into the 14th century, the original colors had become darker, lost their brilliance. By the beginning of Joseon the original techniques were completely lost.[1] Today, however, \u201cmodern workshops using traditional methods are once again producing celadon ceramics, especially in the 16 kilns of Gangjin, where there is an annual celadon festival.\u201d[2] Footnotes[1] About Korean Celadon[2] Korean Celadon Pottery",
