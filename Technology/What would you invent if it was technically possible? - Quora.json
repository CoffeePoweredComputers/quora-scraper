I believe the biggest danger would be control and the biggest problem eventually could be traffic. Someday, there will always be a few of these in the air out in the distance, hovering outside of windows, delivering mail or groceries. I also would expect they would require too much fuel to be practical. Rocket fuel is a feasible option but I\u2019m not clear about availability. I would suspect these to be quite expensive, as well. For 1% of us, that wouldn\u2019t be a problem. ",
