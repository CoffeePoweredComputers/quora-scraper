            "answer_text": "Jio acquired Radisys, a vendor who develops products for 4G and 5G networks in 2018. Radisys has nearly 800 employees who are developing products and solutions related to wireless networks. This helps Jio in being prepared for a rollout of the 5G network. In the recent Annual General Meeting (AGM), Mukesh Ambani, the founder of Jio proudly announced that the company is ready to rollout a home-grown 5G network in India. He also mentioned that the technology will be made available for other service providers across the globe, once it is tested in India. I\u2019m doubtful if Jio developed a solution from scratch. They might\u2019ve leveraged hardware platforms from vendors in Taiwan/Korea and licensed software stacks from vendors such as Altran and Metaswitch to develop the solution. ",
