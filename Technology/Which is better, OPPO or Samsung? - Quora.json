            "answer_text": "Oppo a clear winner at the price. Samsung just has that little extra in quality and being userfriendly. Samsung then asks a lot more for that premium feel. Speaking in general terms. Both makes have budget and flagship models. If money is a concern - one certainly would be interested in Oppo. In reality phones are bought by the heart and not by the mind. If we bought, what we needed, a phone costing more than 1000$ would be the death of the company. Still they thrive. In terms of aftermarket support and spare parts Samsung is a market leader. That could be more valuable than the initial price. Oppo is a little different, it may not support Your network or all services. You have to do a little research to be sure it works in Your region. You could argue that Samsung is a little more expensive, but You're buying peace of mind. Everything is straight forward. Oppo on the other hand could be a real bargain, if it does what You want it to, it might just save You some money. Huawei makes good phones too, but like Oppo I find the skin annoying. I want pure Android. I love being able to do as I please, without a Nanny trying to guess what I'm doing, preventing me from doing it. Intuition is ok, but when You know what You're doing it really gets annoying. Luckily there's a phone to every taste and walk of life. Like someone mentioned, if You like selfies, Oppo might just be it. Apple I just can't relate to. But I would happily reccommend them to a certain group of people, as it really works for them. The primary thing about any phone is, if it fits Your needs and taste at a price You want to pay/ can afford, then everything else is just theoretical. ",

            "answer_text": "Of Course SAMSUNG is No.1. My Experience: OPPO is a china based company and SAMSUNG is korean based company. So china electronics are really not reliable as we all know today.SAMSUNG provides high quality AMOLED screen in phones. While OPPO lack this very important feature.May be you will think about OPPO's famous selfie cameras :) In my personal experience, SAMSUNG phones capture a real look of sight with brief description, while OPPO simply gives an edited look that will never look like real sight. It means OPPO is good for non professional and pre-edited photography lovers.SAMSUNG camera quality is best right after iphone. OPPO 12MP will really work like SAMSUNG 5MP to 8MP only.SAMSUNG 2GB RAM = OPPO 4GB RAM. An amazing fact that i noted. OPPO 4GB RAM performance is not better than SAMSUNG 2GB RAM. You can think an example that chinese 2GB memory cards can be extended to 4GB using a simple memory extender softwares :) there OPPO RAM works same like in this way.SAMSUNG having android version greater than 6.0 never hangs. I AM USING SAMSUNG J4 2018 (android v.9.0 pie) FOR 7 MONTHS BUT I NEVER DID FACTORY RESET or any VIRUS SCAN. REALLY. My all OPPO user friends are constantly complaining that our phone's 4GB RAM performance is never equal to your SAMSUNG 2GB RAM performance.Finally SAMSUNG support is available worldwide and 100% satistactory. Your SAMSUNG will never lost its cost but only 15% when you will resale within warranty period. On other hand OPPO will lost its resale price 45% down right after unpacking.So\u2026 :) up to you :):):) Choose Celebrity's Advertised China's OPPO\u2026. or a WORLD TRUSTED BRAND SAMSUNG.",
