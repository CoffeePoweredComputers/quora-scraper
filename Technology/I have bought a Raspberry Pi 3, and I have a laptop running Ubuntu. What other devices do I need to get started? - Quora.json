            "answer_text": "To try out Raspberry PI, a laptop is good enough. To use the Raspberry PI as a independent system, you would need a monitor (HDM for direct connection), KB and a mouse. A USB hub will be of great help (else you would have to disconnect USB devices every time you move around the raspi). Further, you would need many other add ons(eg., Sensors and interfacing card in case of IoT) as you start with project. It all depends on what you want to use PI for ! ",
