            "answer_text": "It\u2019s terribly inefficient to supply only one main battle tank, so it\u2019s really better to think from an organizational standpoint: How many support vehicles does a standard US Army Tank Platoon need? To answer that question, we should think about what a standard US Army Tank Platoon would need to have, in order to be fully combat-ready. It needs to have a full complement of ammunition. For four M1A2 tanks, that would be 168 rounds of main gun ammo (4x42), about 40,000 rounds of 7.62 mm machine gun ammo (~10k/tank) and 4,000 rounds of .50 caliber machine gun ammo (~1k/tank), 72 smoke grenades (for the tank grenade launchers), 360 rounds of 9mm pistol ammunition for the tank crew\u2019s sidearms and 840 rounds of 5.56 mm ammo for the tank M4 carbines. In addition, mines are often on the standard issue combat carry list, such as the Claymore (and others). That ammunition is what the tanks will start with. Resupplying them would not require a full complement of each item, but would be prioritized based on expected threat type and size (i.e., enemy dismounted infantry vs. enemy infantry in barely-armored APCs such as the MTLB vs. enemy infantry in well-armored and armed BMP-3s vs. enemy tank formations, etc.), as well as the mission of the tank platoon (are they defending vs. mostly BMP-armed enemy infantry, or are they heading out on an offensive operation/meeting engagement against a largely unknown enemy force, etc.). It also needs to have a full complement of fuel and petroleum products. Each tank\u2019s fuel reserves would be topped off, for > 2,000 gallons of fuel (JP8, or DF2, or whatever). It would have oil, grease, hydraulic fluid, and others, both in the various parts of the vehicle that use it (engine oil, suspension & shock absorbers, roadwheel hubs, track tensioning, turret hydraulics, etc.) and each tank would also have a small amount of replacement for each of these already on-hand. Again, that\u2019s what they would need to have already on the tanks, and the supply vehicles would not necessarily need to keep 100% of the full complement of the entire platoon for every one of these items as a replacement. The tanks need to have some spare parts available; what kind is kept on-hand depends on the item. A tank platoon does not need to have a supply truck with an entire spare engine on it following them around, but someone in the supply train needs to have spare engines. Spares of items that can easily be replaced by the crew, such as roadwheels and small sections of track, are usually kept on the tanks themselves for immediate needs, and a few more are kept in their immediate supply chain. Other items that become worn or damaged easily are also often kept on-hand, with additional replacements for them kept in the immediate supply chain. There are other items that would need the support of a trained mechanic in order to properly replace, and those items are usually kept with the mechanics and not the crews, and still others that would require even higher levels of mechanic service (and, multiple hours of replacement time) would not be kept in the immediate supply chain for the tank platoon. Tanks require a minimum crew staffing level; our example M1A2 tanks have an ideal crew of four and a minimum crew of three. Let\u2019s assume ad arguendo that we have a full crew on all four tanks, which means we have sixteen total crew members. Let us further assume that it is a standard complement of rank structure, so that there is one commissioned officer as the Platoon Leader (a 2nd Lieutenant, let\u2019s say), one senior NCO (a Sergeant First Class/E-7), two Staff Sergeant/E-6 Tank Commanders, four Sergeant/E-5 gunners, and eight SPC/E-4 or PFC/E-3 (or possibly E-1 or E-2) Loaders & Drivers. As a general rule, let\u2019s figure 4 Liters of water/person/day for drinking (and another 1/2 L or so for hygiene) and a caloric allowance of 4000 KCal/day/person. For the water, in Desert Shield/Desert Storm each crew member had two 2L desert canteens of water on their person, and two cases of bottled water on the tank (for a grand total of ~40 L on board, to start out with) plus potable water in a plastic container (5 gallons, roughly 19 L more). Tank crews generally carry a specified amount of water and MREs on their tank\u2014usually, specified by local command SOPs, but often three day\u2019s worth\u2014and the supply vehicles would need to carry additional MREs, water, and also other sundry supplies (toothbrushes, toothpaste, razors & shaving supplies, soap, etc.). Tank crews in combat conditions (and in simulated ones, such as gunnery training or field exercises) wear flameproof clothing, and these items need to be laundered or replaced occasionally, and the supply chain needs to carry a few of these items as well as weather-specific replacement items. This is not a complete list of items, but it\u2019s fairly comprehensive. So, with that in mind, and keeping in mind that we don\u2019t need to resupply 100% of every item for every tank or crew member, we can probably consider this: Fuel enough to resupply each tank with 500 gallons of fuel (2000 gallons)Other petroleum supplies enough to replenish only the on-board stores for 1 full tank\u2019s worth of supplies (or, 1/4 of the platoon\u2019s total)Ammo enough to resupply 1 tank complete (or, 1/4 of the platoon\u2019s total)Spare parts for crew-replaceable items enough to resupply maybe 1.5\u20132 tanks complete of its on-board supplies, plus the spare parts for most items that could be replaced by the mechanics attached/assigned to the platoon (usually this is a company-level asset, but for the sake of argument we\u2019ll just worry about a platoon for now)Food enough to resupply the platoon for a couple of daysWater enough to resupply the platoon for a couple of daysEnough of all of the above items to replace the ones used by the soldiers who operate the fuel truck, supply trucks, and maintenance vehicles, also.So, just based on this, you would probably need 1 fuel truck, 1 ammo truck, 2 other supply trucks, and a water trailer for a platoon of tanks. One tank needs 1/4 of that. (Just a thought exercise here. By and large, supply is tracked & co-ordinated at the company level, which is usually 3\u20135 platoons depending on the military force; three \u201cline\u201d platoons and a HQ platoon in a US Army tank company. Certain supply elements are not under direct company control\u2014fuel and ammo, usually\u2014while others such as food, water, and the crew- and company-level maintenance supplies are usually run by the unit executive officer and first sergeant.)

            "answer_text": "It would really depend on where you draw the line. If you\u2019re talking about divisions, even armoured or mechanised divisions, they have hundreds of vehicles that aren\u2019t tanks, or even armed/combat service vehicles. Having said that, a critical component of any armoured operation would be the fuel trucks, logistics trucks and the recovery vehicles. At the company level, covering 3 US tank platoons, are found a water/cargo truck, and several APCs/Humvees. And attached from the Battalion level, would be a maintenance platoon involving a recovery vehicle, an APC, and a utility truck containing spare parts, as well as a medical APC. At the Battalion level itself, would involve any number of support vehicles transporting and assisting units including motorised recon, mortar troops, signals, medical, and maintenance HQ groups. Assuming I\u2019m reading my second link right, at the Battalion level, the official figures are: 4 120mm Mortar Carriers 4 120mm Mortars 5 Field Kitchen Carriers 2 HQ tanks 43 trucks of various sizes and purposes 24 Humvees 3 CnC carriers 5 Javelin Missile Launchers. At the Company level, you have 1 APC 14 Tanks 1 Truck 2 Humvees Given that I am restricting myself in this particular answer to the most immediate level of reference as far as tanks are concerned, the ratio appears to be around 80:44 or just over 2:1 support vehicle:tank. TL;DR; fielding tanks requires fielding many more support vehicles. https://fas.org/man/dod-101/army/unit/toe/ https://fas.org/man/dod-101/army/unit/toe/17375F100.htm ",
