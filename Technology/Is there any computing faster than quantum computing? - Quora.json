            "answer_text": "Actually, we don\u2019t know. We haven\u2019t even explored the full potentials of quantum computations to compare it with other computational paradigms. Consider the problem of the traveling salesman. In this problem, a salesman is to travel n cities by visiting each city once and only once, and returning to the starting city. The problem is to find the route with lowest cost among the  possible routes. J. Bang et al[1] proposed a quantum heuristic algorithm to solve the problem of TSA in , where . Compared to classical algorithms, Bang et al\u2019s algorithm is quadratically faster. A Hamiltonian path problem is the problem of finding a path in an undirected or directed graph that visits each vertex exactly once[2] . We might say that TSA is a special case of the Hamiltonian path, can\u2019t we? In 1994, L. Adleman [3] solved the problem of the Hamiltonian path in a constant time using DNA computing which is another computational paradigm, like quantum computing, which utilizes DNA molecules to encode the problem itself and operations are preformed on them using standard protocols and enzymes to find a solution. Obviously, DNA computing won this round against quantum computing, but we might wake up tomorrow and find out that awesome quantum algorithm to solve this problem in a constant time as well.
