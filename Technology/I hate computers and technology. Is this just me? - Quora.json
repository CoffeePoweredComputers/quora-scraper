            "answer_text": "Nope, it's not just you. Computers still have a long way to go in terms of usability. This is one of the reasons Apple was able to turn the pc world upside down in a short time. iPhones were computers that anyone could use without a manual, for the first time since computers were introduced to the general public. We still need a few more people like Steve Jobs to get there, to that point where we can interact more naturally and intuitively with our computers. Siri seems to be another good step in the right direction, but it takes so much computing power it has to reside in the cloud. Maybe when everything is wireless and interconnected it won't matter anymore where the computing power resides. Don't dispair, complain! Some developers are listening and working to make things better for everyone. They need your feedback. Computers are simply tools, they need to conform to our needs, not the other way around. ",

            "answer_text": "The problem for many of us regarding technology and computers, is the rapid evolution track. You no sooner purchase a new gadget, desktop computer, DVD player, or gaming system, and a newer model is released. Certain minds love the thrill of getting a new computer related product, while other minds like to enjoy using one they have, or have learned to use thoroughly.  An issue I'm noticing currently is how quickly the operating systems on computer systems are becoming rapidly obsolete. The general assumption from the creators of computer products is availability of services no longer plays a role. This is frustrating for consumers who live in rural areas, and are still unable to subscribe to decent Internet access.  I hesitate to see innovation throttled back, particularly since the world is struggling through the early stages of an economic crises. Still, I believe people would be more accepting and willing to learn how to use computers happily if they didn't feel the pressure to constantly learn something new. ",
