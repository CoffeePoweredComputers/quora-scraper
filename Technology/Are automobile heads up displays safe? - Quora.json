            "answer_text": "IMO, a good idea, but I do not know if this will work any better than the displays we have today, which do NOT work well. As far as \u2018\u2019safe\u2019\u2019 goes, this is excessively overstated\u2026is only one small factor in the grand scheme of things . I will state that only the speedometer is effective as it is \u201clive\u201d info - even then , during cruise, its \u201cdead \u201c info . Warning lights work better(low fuel, no battery charge, etc., . I\u2019d like to see the cluster info placed in direct line of sight , I think that this would be the same as \u201cheads up\u2019\u2019 .. It should only be the vehicle\u2019s speed, the other info is , IMO, unnecessary. ",

            "answer_text": "I can only vouch for BMW's, but yes, perfectly. It only shows relevant information, normally speed and limit. If I'm using nav, then basic nav info is displayed. Any warning messages will be displayed as required. I doubt that I'll buy another car without a decent HUD. In fact I test drove a Mercedes without a HUD and actually found it uncomfortable having to look down to find my speed. ",

            "answer_text": "The idea is to keep your eyes on the road by giving you less distance to gaze for your dash board info like speed and rev. So it must be safe. However, if the display creates a glare especially at night the results may vary. But some manufacturers really did a good job with HUDs. ",
