            "answer_text": "With the use of technology, people are able to get to more destinations more efficiently and quickly. For example, the Japanese bullet trains are capable of reaching a speed of 320km/h (199mph). There is also artificial intelligence being used to manage traffic congestion on the roads, as wells as automated trains and buses which helps save manpower and manage the ageing population in some cities. Below are the technological changes which improve the way we travel: Technology makes travelling more environmental-friendlyAs you can see, the introduction of technology in transportation has become environmental-friendly. For example, car manufacturers are now working on manufacturing electric vehicles, which obtains energy from solar panels located at the roof of the vehicle. This reduces the carbon emission of one\u2019s country and thus protects the environment from global warming and rising sea levels.Technology has freed up space in your bagsNowadays, we do not need to bring stacks of paper and documents with us for work or travel as technological gadgets such as tablets, lightweight laptops and smartphones have already replaced them. This allows to lighten the weight of your bags and thus make transportation from one location to another easier.The chances of getting lost or losing connection with people on the road are lowerWith the introduction of Android Auto and Apple CarPlay in vehicles, people are able to get to places using the built-in GPS in a short period of time. Besides that, they are able to stay connected with others while driving through a wireless connection between a smartphone and the Android Auto/Apple CarPlay installed in vehicles.Technology reduces the number of traffic accidents and fatalitiesTechnology has indeed reduced the number of injuries and deaths caused by traffic accidents with the use of adaptive headlights which enables drivers to see in the dark, traction control systems which avoid instability when driving and driverless vehicles which abolishes human error and thus reduces traffic accidents.TelecommutingTechnology enables people to work from home by making use of the internet, email and the telephone. This helps to manage traffic congestion as it reduces the number of drivers on the roads and public transport passengers during peak hours.In conclusion, technology has brought many benefits to transportation as it improved people\u2019s safety on the roads, managed traffic jams on the road and preserved the environment.

            "answer_text": "Unless you are walking, your method of travel uses some sort of technology. Walkers care about good shoes, but that is perhaps another topic. Sailing and the vessels in The Age of Sail, depend on intricate knowledge of the vessel\u2019s size and construction, and use of sails to catch breezes to travel in the desired direction. People traveling on the Pacific Ocean designed different vessels, suited to the waters and the distances they travelled. People trailing the rivers in North America made canoes suited to the purpose. With animals, one needs reins, saddles or saddle bags plus many stops to rest and feed the animals. Make the jump to motorized transport, that is the technology of engines and in roads, rubber tires. Railroads are marvels of technology, from the track beds upward. Flying is another way to travel, in planes made light but strong, flown by people who know how to keep moving no matter the freaks of wind and air pressure until it is time to land without crashing. As information technology becomes more useful for land travel, it goes faster, more safely, and often with entertainment for the passengers. ",
