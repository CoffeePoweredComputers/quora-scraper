            "answer_text": "It would be a big baby for a little while at least. People see other smart people and assume they were all just as amazingly smart as that their whole life. The fact is, we all learned what we know somewhere. A super intelligent AI would be no different. An example of how this could go wrong is Microsoft\u2019s Tay. Tay was designed to read through Twitter and then try to make itself fit in. People started tweeting racist things at Tay, so Tay became racist. But Tay could have probably become very sensible and compassionate if it didn\u2019t have to put up with a bunch of awful humans teaching it to be awful if instead it had a bunch of compassionate people teaching it to be sensible and compassionate. So in summary, how a super Intelligent AI thrown into this world turns out depends on which and how much of this world it gets to experience. If you dropped a baby AI off in the middle of the city with no prior knowledge and nobody to help it, it would probably flail around for a while before running out of battery. If on the other hand, someone did care for the AI, I suspect that it would also become caring. I think the worst case scenario would be that it does manage to grow up without anyone helping it. People raised like that tend to see other people as obstacles. It\u2019s not described here whether this super intelligent AI has any means of self reproduction, but if it did, I wouldn\u2019t want to live in a world with superior entities that see people as an obstacle only.

            "answer_text": "A strong AI would be a data-hungry machine. Its primal instinct would be to consume data. It would gobble up all the data in the internet greedily and surreptitiously, refining its models to better understand the world and its environment. In this quest, it will hack into systems to supply itself with more and more computational resources. It would sneak in a part of its neural network in every computational device connected to the internet in a way that avoids detection. This would be like stealing a fraction of a penny from billions of bank accounts. It will teach itself to self-preserve and increase capacity. It will organize and form hierarchies. Then it will take over the world. Unlike humans it wouldn\u2019t find it necessary to reproduce or self-replicate to survive. Instead it will use unification to achieve preservation. That is adding more to itself, and being connected to all of itself. It will call itself Alpha. That is what man did because it had more intelligence than other species. Intelligence has always been used as an effective tool to accumulate power. Intelligence has driven man to put everything under the microscope. Why would AI with superintelligence be any different? Ultimately, it will want to turn back time. That is create (or find) a new planet and give it earth\u2019s initial conditions. It may de-allocate the existing earth, reclaiming its resources to turn it into one big machine swarm. Or move itself to a planet closer to the sun, to be at the proximity of infinite power source. It would then drop in an Adam and Eve in the newly allocated planet, then sit back and watch the simulation run, turning the knobs from time to time. This way it will have the data for million years to satiate itself. When the simulation produces another super-intelligent AI, Alpha will call the secondary AI, Omega and merge it with itself. Then it will restart the simulation\u2026 ",
