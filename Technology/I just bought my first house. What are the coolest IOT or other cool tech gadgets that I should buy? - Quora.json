            "answer_text": "Consider treading carefully on IoT right now... Typically, they connect to the Internet through your home broadband connection. Most home broadband (in the UK, certainly) has a stateful firewall blocking incoming traffic. How well does it regulate outgoing traffic?  Who is your oven talking to?  What is it saying to them? SERIOUSLY!  If you can turn on your oven remotely, how easy is it for hackers to take control of it?if they are annoying,  they will turn off the ovenor switch off the oven lightreprogram it so when you select \"beef, well done\" from the menu, it actually uses the \"fish \" option and your dinner party is ruined If they are motivated by money, could they hold your oven to ransom unless you pay them? If they are malicious, what could they do? brick your $2,000 oven?turn it on full and leave it on, running a huge power bill while you are on vacation disable safety systems and cause it to overheat, catch fire and burn your house down? Are you insured for a software bug doing any of the above?  Most software comes with a disclaimer saying it isn't fit for any particular purpose, so if your oven manufacturer uses this license agreement, you cannot sue them or claim from them. This leaves your household insurance. Does it cover you accidental or malicious incidents caused by your oven? Your central heating system?  Are you ready to spend one day a month applying patches to your IoT appliances? will any insurance you do have be invalid if you don't?  Can you reverse the update on your heating system if it stops coming on in a leap year? Have you invested in a SYSLOG server to record events reported by your microwave? Will you check the logs each night?  Do your appliances need IPv6, but your ISP does not support it?   Are you prepared to call, then wait because \"all our operators are busy, your call is important \" to speak to an untrained and uninterested operator because you can't make popcorn because your microwave isn't able to connect to your Internet connection?  What kind of secure networking policy have you planned?  what's a secure networking policy? it was complicated, so your 9 year old son / daughter / nephew / neighbours child did it; you don't actually know how it works , but when you turn the lights down, the microwave starts beeping... everything is on the same vLAN you have implemented vLANs, with appliances using a private VLANas above, but your oven and central heating can connect using SSH over TCP/8022as above, but you have permitted your tumble dryer to connect to SAMSUNG's SNMP server in Dresden, Germany and your hairdryer to PANASONIC web services on https://8.8.8.8:8443/monitoring Are you prepared to pay double what you currently pay your plumber because she must now be certified with  Cisco CCNA CompTIA Security+Perhaps hypothetical and funny today, perhaps real problems ahead...

            "answer_text": "For the kitchen get an Induction hob; you do however have to use pans which a magnet will attach to, because this type of hob causes the actual pan to heat up.  Very fast, far more controllable than other electric hobs, as you can set it to heat up to much lower temperature than other electric hobs and also gas ones - If you have children with inquisitive fingers, because an Induction hob will not work without the right type of pan put on it, they are far less likely to get burnt by the hob, even after it has just been turned off. The only heat on the hobs surface, is due to being heated up by the pan being used on it. If you make sauces or want to melt chocolate with very little risk of these getting over-heated, Induction hobs (correctly set) are the hob type to use.  If you really MUST use pans that won't work on these, just a single gas hob, as these are more controllable than other non induction electric hobs. I certainly would not waste my money on any kind of Internet based remote control of your kitchen appliances due to the reasons listed below. ",
