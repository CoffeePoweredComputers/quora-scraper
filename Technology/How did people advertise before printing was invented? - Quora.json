            "answer_text": "Advertising is a tricky word. There really wasn\u2019t advertising as we know it (hauberks 20% off, arbalest quarrels BOGO!) Likewise, when is before printing? So I\u2019m assuming you mean European, post-Classical, pre-Gutenberg. If you lived in a village, you knew everybody and didn\u2019t have coinage much. So you met your own needs, or bartered with a neighbor. Big exception were public houses, because brewing is a very skilled art. If you were a merchant or a tradesperson. or a specialist (doctor, lawyer, etc.) in the city, you probably worked out of your house, shop on the bottom, living quarters on the top. So, you had to buy provisions and you had to sell product. So, people had to know your name and profession. Making copies was a labor intensive and time consuming. And, since most people were illiterate, there wasn\u2019t really any point to papering the neighborhood. So, most people advertised with hand-painted signs hung on the front of the shop. Other ways that people could advertise were: Word of mouthLocation. look at any map of an old city. There\u2019ll be a Tailor Street, and a Weaver Street, and a Shambles (butchering).Announcing. You could hire people to go around shouting your spiel. Very much like the seedier side of New Orleans today, where touts try to drag you into their particular establishment.Fairs. You\u2019d put up a stand at the fair and go for the walk-in trade.Guilds. If you were a guild member in good standing, some guild official would point potential customers in your direction.If you were an official, or a prelate. You could have copies made. But, you sent them to people who could read them (or have them read) to the correct audience. Not advertising, but communications. And, remember Marin Luther nailing his 39 theses to the door of the church? That was actually considered to be a legitimate way to express a grievance. As to monumental art; I believe it stretches the definition of advertising. It\u2019s a sort of vanity cast in granite. ",

Thing is Akshar\u2019s father is a renowned journalist known as Mr. Anil Grover, my summers were spent mostly in Akshar\u2019s home he used to have a massive library at his home with a lot of books.

Have a pleasant evening kind sir and stay safe.  The above school photo from Xavier\u2019s class of Mr. A K Sharma shows me at the last row with high eye powered glasses me in the last row the tallest boy in the class.
