            "answer_text": "Mostly because most people evaluate a whole product. So say when Apple removed the headphone jack many people thought \u201cthat sucks, but they do give that little adaptor dongle with the new phone, and I can still use my headphones as long as I don\u2019t lose that little thing\u2026and woah look at how nice having the whole screen with no button!\u201d It isn\u2019t that the good stiff distracts from the bad stuff, it is that it out weighs it. It is also frequently the case that the things Apple claims are minor and lots of people run around screaming and yelling like Apple poured sugar in their gas tanks and/or stole their family pets are in fact minor. For example the 12 series phones no longer come with a free pair of EarPods or a 5W charger. It is clearly worse for many people to not have those things (for example my wife tends to destroy ear pods, so when she gets a new phone she gets a needed spare pair\u2026when I get a new one I get a pair she can have as a spare). On the other hand many people have headphones they like more then ear pods (I have AirPods I don\u2019t destroy, and like them better then Ear Pods). Others have wired headphones they like more then EarPods (not hard, EarPods are kind of middle of the road quality, spend $100 on headphones and it is hard to not beat EarPods). Most people have a lot of chargers already, I have more then I can use. Not getting another 5W charger is absolutely not harming me, nor most people except Apple decided to ship a USB-C thunderbolt cable. Most people\u2019s \u201cI already have 45 chargers who needs more!\u201d are all USB-A. So unless you have spare iPhone cables most people are out something (and people buying their first iPhone won\u2019t have spare cables, also many people seem to break those cables from time to time). That is a problems for what I see as a large number of people. A $9 problem (new phone cable), or a $20 problem (20W USB-C charger to quick charge the iPhone). So depending on what you actually have the missing charger/headphones could be a $0 problem up to say $40 (EarPods are $20, charger is $20) with $10 being more common. Can Apple get away with making the new phone $0 to $40 \u201cworse\u201d? Maybe, I mean they also made the new phone better. Including \u201cbetter for the environment\u201d which you might personally decide is a $0 benefit, or maybe more. Maybe the faster CPU is a big deal. Or the new look. Or more likely for an iPhone purchaser you have a two or three year old phone and the new one is substantially faster. That $0 to $40 problem probably gets lost in the noise. Now people don\u2019t normally make a worksheet and put dollar clause on each problem and total things up, but people do have a good intuition for that sort of thing. I can\u2019t tell you how many dollars having a new phone in blue is worth to me, but if you show me prices and colors I will absolutely make a choice, and without much effort. Most people can (there are interesting psychology experiments about this). ",

            "answer_text": " Apple is the only company that can deliver an iOS phone. And they do a good enough job of it every year that, yeah, they can get away with stuff.  The original iPhone wasn\u2019t originally a smartphone, just a \u201cfeature phone\u201d \u2014 it had applications, but you couldn\u2019t add new ones. Only Apple could. And it was also, at the time, pretty much the only phone without a user-swappable battery. It was also introduced as the most expensive new phone to date. Why was it successful? First reason: Apple already had a built-in market that already understood this device. The iPod had been the first really successful portable music/media player. Why? Apple did the whole thing, soup-to-nuts: device, application, music sales, video sales, etc. The early devices were great for us computer nerds who didn\u2019t see a problem ripping our existing CDs with some app and loading that onto a device. But that wasn\u2019t a mass market thing. Some companies tried to do it mass-market, like Sony, but they had okay technology with abysmal software. Apple got it right with the iPod. The iPhone wasn\u2019t really a cellular phone, it was a much better iPod with phone and internet functions.  Second reason: Apple is a cult. No, really, they are\u2026 particularly when the iPhone shipped. They had an undisputed, charismatic cult leader in Steve Jobs, the guy who was single-handedly making decisions that often mystified the rest of the industry, and often, he got it right. When the iPhone was introduced, smart phones were made by Palm, Nokia, Blackberry, and various Microsoft licensees. Just about every one of those phones were made for and sold to business people. It was common knowledge that consumers would not pay hundreds of dollars for a smart phone. Nokia sold a few lower end smartphones to consumers, but basically dressed them up as feature phones. So the iPhone launched as a super expensive consumer device. But the iPod was already a pretty expensive consumer device. It was a very smart way to get into a new business. I\u2019ve been in a bunch of startups, and the usual thinking is that you can effectively change just one consumer behavior with a new product. If you try to change more than one, you\u2019ll probably be too confusing to survive. Apple was properly positioned to change just enough consumer behavior to get people to buy their fancier iPod upgrade from AT&T. Even the user interface, while new, was based on skeuomorphism \u2014 regular, ordinary things you already understood were fully animated in iPhone apps. It was clumsy from a computer nerd\u2019s standpoint, but very good for that individual regular consumer being pushed to not make more than one big leap going to the iPhone.  Elsewhere in the smartphone world, you had at least one of two things: an attached business -user following and/or lots of alternatives. Early on, Palm, Microsoft, and RIM/Blackberry had established their own niches. But professionals often don\u2019t like any change, so these devices evolved pretty slowly. Each company did produce a whole new OS/UI and something of a push to consumers, but it was too little, too late. The real opposition to iOS became, of course, Android. Google was prescient in their understanding that the smartphone would soon replace the PC as the basic for personal computing for much of the world. With that went the Internet, and when they stood around in 2015 and looked, they only saw proprietary companies running mobile: Nokia, RIM, Palm, Microsoft. If four guys decided to not use Google search engines as the built-in on smartphones, Google could be wiped out. So Google bought a little startup company run by former phone execs, and Android was born. At the time they had no interest in hardware, so the decided to basically give it away, just without losing all control. That was amazingly successful. There are currently around 1.5 billion smartphones sold every year, about 200+ million iPhones and 1.2+ billion Androids, and some others down in the noise. But here\u2019s the Android innovator\u2019s curse and blessing: every Android phone is more or less a drop-in replacement for any other Android phone. So Apple can try a thing that might not be super popular, and they\u2019re pretty much going to succeed. Maybe Samsung or Google could, too \u2014 mostly because they both also have a pretty tight following, if perhaps not as cult-like (and don\u2019t get me wrong, any other company would kick puppies to have Apple\u2019s level of cult). But if LG or Motorola or most others do it, they had better offer some huge carrot to sell their device, or the customer will jump to another Android phone. Once Apple does it, that tends to make it okay.  Samsung does play these games, too, but in an entirely different way. Apple has made between one and four iPhone models every year since they started in 2007. Samsung has put out more models in a single year. They have multiple full lines of phones at different price points from $100 to $2000+; they\u2019re looking Western buyers in North America and Europe with their expensive models, sure, but also parts of India, Asia, and Africa, and South America where cost is far more sensitive.  As party of this, Samsung can \u201ctrial balloon\u201d a phone concept. They can afford to fail on one product. They can experiment with features, if there\u2019s a good reason for it. Apple really can\u2019t\u2026 a single model failure for Apple would be devastating. So while Apple \u201cgets away\u201d with things, take a close look. They launched with the locked-in battery, so you can\u2019t even call them out on that. They nixed the headphone jack. They tried the all-glass phone with the iPhone 4, but retreated from that until Samsung did it in 2017, followed up 7 months later by Apple\u2019s iPhone X. Apple made the first really good fingerprint reader in a phone (not the first, just the first that really worked well), and they were the first to entirely nix it in favor of their better face recognizer (my Android phone did face unlock back in 2011, but not well). Basically, people love iOS enough to take on an iPhone that maybe has one unexpected wart or two, as long as they\u2019re small warts, and it comes with a new beauty mark. Android buyers can more easily shop around, but if \u201cApple Did It,\u201d that more or less makes it safe for everyone else to copy. That has the kind of weird effect of Apple copying \u2014 and perhaps perfecting \u2014 the innovations put out in Android phones, while Android devices, for the most part, are copying Apple\u2019s \u201cthis is a bad idea, but it\u2019ll make us money\u201d decisions. And sure, others\u2026 Samsung\u2019s glass case thing just won\u2019t go away, even though Samsung\u2019s started offering alternatives to it themselves.
