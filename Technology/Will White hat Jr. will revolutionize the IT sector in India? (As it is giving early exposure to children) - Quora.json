            "answer_text": "Nope\u2026 This is just like learning dance, music \u2026 Did those children who learn these skills revolutionize the industry?? I doubt it and hence scepticism for same. And whatever the chintu ad show.. Its all a far fetched dream Lot of people think coding is tough, its actually not\u2026 I got my first PC when I was in 6th class and learnt C++ coding in 8th while C++ is taught from standard XIth in CBSE then. With new education reforms it will be taught early .It definitely helped me There are advanced concepts.like data structures, AI, ML which no doubt require expertise but basic app or web application building is easy. Especially with low code/ no code platforms. What though is important which people touch upon the surface only is understanding of application of object oriented programming or how concepts like objects, classes defined work in real world. Now if you have a knack of business and use those to identify and build beautiful apps that can be monitized that's where your Chintu cracks it, with or without coding. Lot of people don't know, the actual coding for the first Apple PC was done by Steve Wozniak and not Steve jobs. They were friends and partners when apple started. First of all big guys of Indian IT are all services. Majority of work is application support or BPO support. This actually doesn't require coding skills. Most of work is well defined, mundane and doesn't require the coding taught in engineering courses. So I doubt IT sector revolution needs coding kids to revolutionize it. Secondly companies hire based on degree and not based on knowledge. So your Btech/ BSc degrees are minimum requirements and for that you need to crack IIT JEE or other comepetitive exams . So coding or not, you need to first crack competitive exams to get into IT Sector via the job route and 4 years in college are good enough for anyone to learn basics and advance coding skills So forget revolutionizing IT sector\u2026 Whitehat Jr is just a fad or toys or course for children\u2026 albeit an overpriced one ",

            "answer_text": "There are chances that the app might revolutionize the IT sector in India but India is already in the leading countries of IT sector. Bill Gates was once asked by a reporter - \u2018why do you hire most of your engineers from India and not from your own country ? \u2019. He replied \u201c if I would not hire engineers from India, then there will be another Microsoft in India \u201d. We are already on our Zenith in the IT sector. White Hat Jr. will only improve that situation. ",
