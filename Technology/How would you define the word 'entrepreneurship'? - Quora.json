            "answer_text": "According to absolutely nobody important, basically just me, entrepreneurship is about working for free to make sure you own what you\u2019ve worked on. Other people have touched on aspects of this: Risk taking.Irrational risk taking.Failing.Sometimes not failing.Sometimes not failing big.But I think all this language about failing early and often, taking risks, moving fast and breaking things, and whatever else sounds cool when you\u2019re wearing sneakers with a blazer jacket without a tie but definitely with an ironic silk-screened t-shirt and a black-rimmed pair of glasses, well, it all misses the point a little bit. Sure, a lot of startups fail. But you could winnow those odds down a lot by asking yourself \u201cwhy.\u201d Often, it\u2019s because they\u2019re stupid. The idea was stupid. Or the execution was stupid. Or the founders didn\u2019t even know they were stupid. Or it was Hail Mary or Bankruptcy. Winning entrepreneurs love to tell the story of how stupid they were, but it\u2019s really a humble brag. Other stupid people failed, but they hit on something. Their idea just worked. How lucky that they had the perfect idea. Plus discipline, connections, financial independence, and the ability to live lean at the right stage of their lives. The key is that all entrepreneurs really hard to make sure they are able to take risks that they can afford to lose. Why? Because their idea isn\u2019t stupid, and they have the secret inside angle on why. Maybe they hit on something in their engineering classes and discovered an approach that hadn\u2019t been matched to the right commercial application. Maybe they slaved away for a few years in an industry and discovered something everybody hates, for which they could see an obvious solution. And they know exactly what kind of work needs to be done to fix it. And darned if they\u2019re going to go through all the work of convincing people just for some MBA to take the credit and the promotion. They want to OWN it. ",

            "answer_text": "Alfonso! Thank you for including us/me in your article. To be an Entrepreneur for me is the willingness to see a problem and fix it. Usually the problem is either social, financial, environmental and the like. Having a vision is ideal but to actually take action, be motivated, dedicated is a key factor in achieving it.  I believe we were all meant to be visionaries, entrepreneurs and to live our lives with purpose in order to enhance the lives of others. Why? Simply because we dream. Other than that, we could have been created to sleep without any thoughts. I also believe we were meant to help each other to recognize this. We definitely can't live in this world by ourselves. ie:  Every business needs customersEvery King or Queen needs subjectsEvery mechanical device needs and operatorEverything in this world needs usWe are all connected and no one can do without the other. Knowing all of this should elevate us to be more than what we are.  Once someone asked: \"Do you believe in aliens\"? I said NO! They asked why? I said because we are already so profound, what could be better than that?  Another asked: \"What do you think of mankind\"? I said, we really didn't have to go into space because I recognized that we are already astronauts.  ie: We can't see space during the daylight because of cloud formation. Very rarely we can see space at night. However, we see the stars. Gravity keeps all life on this planet. We are the perfect distance from the sun. The world spins on an access in space without strings, without every living thing floating away into space. All of this is going on continually without our intervention. We are basically very lucky or someone or thing is keeping us here. We are important!Knowing all of this, why wouldn't you want to live with purpose and meaning? Why not be all you can be. Everything we need is right here. Everything we need to change is between our ears, everything else can be found in a horse or a pig. One of our mental thoughts written down and put into action can produce physical things that were originally non existent. All things were created in thought first. ie: RecipesBuildingsComputersSocial MediaCars...Many Christians may argue this point. God does not dislike gay people. It's only written in the bible because he knows two men/women can't make a baby naturally. Therefore, life for us would cease to exist. Seeing how we are already are over populated there's no need for concern. LOL  Man can not destroy this physical world. We can only destroy ourselves.  Why not believe we were made in an image of a higher power, who spoke a word and the world was created? We are all entrepreneurs designed to create. Designed to live with purpose. Designed to assist one another with a purpose. Designed to teach and learn. Designed to adapt. Design to take that knowledge pass it on, for generations to come. Designed to live FOREVER. WE ARE ALL ENTREPRENEURS! Not the textbook definition but in the real sense of it. Entrepreneurs create opportunities and live with purpose any fool can start a business. Examples of Entrepreneurs: Martin Luther King Jr. \"I have a dream\"Thomas EdisonBenjamin FranklinLeonardo DaVinciBill GatesOprah WinfreyArnold SchwarzeneggerBill GatesWarren BuffetMaya Angelou....
