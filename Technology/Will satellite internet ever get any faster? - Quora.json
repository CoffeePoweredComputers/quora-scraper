            "answer_text": "Yes - much faster. Present satellite Internet requires a fixed position \u201cdish\u201d antenna pointing to a satellite in geosynchronous orbit, so that the satellite \u201cmoves\u201d exactly with the earth\u2019s rotation and remains in a fixed location in comparison to the earth\u2019s surface. This allows a few dozen massive satellites to service millions of people. But geosynchronous orbit is an altitude of about 36,000 km (about 22,000 miles), so the round-trip is about 72,000 km. The speed of light is about 300,000 km/sec, meaning that there is about a quarter-second delay in the round trip. This delay makes certain applications work less than ideally (online video games, some phone conversations, etc.) Also, present geosynchronous satellites are BIG, but so few in number that their bandwidth is limited, which slows overall throughput speed irrespective of the delay. An alternative would be to put up several thousand low-earth-orbit satellites. Their number (which can always be increased) can guarantee ever-increasing bandwidth. The signal delay can be reduced to almost nothing, as these satellites only orbit at an altitude of a few hundred km (about 150 miles). The problem is, they will streak across the sky, moving in and out of range every few minutes, never sitting still in one place. So, in the same way you can get \u201csatellite radio\u201d (or cell-phone service) while moving about, the network protocols will need to negotiate sessions between nearby satellites, and \u201chand off\u201d signals to one another the way that your phone calls are \u201chanded off\u201d to different cell towers as you travel. Most likely, these thousands of low-earth orbit \u201cInternet Satellites\u201d will operate in conjunction with major ground-based stations, with antennae large enough to handle the moving satellites, and re-broadcasting the communications to thousands of nearby residents and businesses. Elon Musk has proposed to build out a low-earth-orbit satellite network. ",

            "answer_text": "It gets faster all the time, if one looks at data rates. I\u2019ve been in the business for 7 years now, and our current budget customers are getting 8\u201316x the speed they were getting when I started. High-end customers haven\u2019t seen quite the same dramatic increase, but anything less than 5x increase is unusual. At the very top, customers with extreme budgets have higher data rates over satellite than I get over fiber optic at my home. Satellite modems that support over 700 Mbps are commercially available today. What we will not see, however, is significantly lower latency from satellites in geostationary orbit. If satellite-based Internet access is to have lower latency, it must use satellites in lower orbit, such as the Iridium constellation. That\u2019s simply fundamental physics. ",
