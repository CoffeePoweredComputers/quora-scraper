Let me tell you for you to have a successful blog you will need these requirements: Write good quality contentBuild engagement with your readersBe consistent with your postsBe differentMost people think creating a blog is difficult but I totally get it because I had the same mentality before I started mine. I was confused at first I din\u2019t know how to get started, I heard things called plugins, web hosting , domain name I did not know any of these things I did my degree in BA and I have no idea what these things mean. I had to try things myself because no matter what, you are the only person who wants whats best for you, So I created mine with some a little help with my cousin sister she also has her own blog and she started before me and she is generating almost $9,000 a month with her blog. I started mine with Bluehost I recommend it to everyone it is one of the best web hosting sites out their.

            "answer_text": "Writing Jobs For Teenagers Freelance writing can be a perfect online job for teens because you can fit it around your schedule. You are probably used to writing assignments at school, so why not get paid for it?  UpworkOn Upwork, businesses post jobs and freelancers submit pitches to apply. The fees on this site will range from job to job, but there are many freelancers out there who have started on Upwork and gained repeat clients from it. The fee structure is based on your lifetime billings with each client: 20% for the first $500 billed10% for total billings of $500.01 to $10,0005% for total billings above $10,000Upwork isn\u2019t just for writers. Other categories include marketing, web development, customer service, and design to name a few. Bid on projects across several categories to find what most interests you. FiverrFiverr is another digital freelancer marketplace. As the name suggests, you can buy or sell for as little as $5. Jobs on this site are referred to as \u2018gigs.\u2019 Typical gigs include graphic design, digital marketing, writing and translation, video and animation, programming and tech \u2014 basically anything that you can do online. This is a perfect site for website owners to come and get services on an ad-hoc basis. You can price your gigs however you want. If you take a look at the gigs that are available on there, there aren\u2019t actually that many for only $5. You can also tier your offering with additional services at a premium price. If you\u2019re handy with design, technology, words, or a host of other online skills, you could easily make good money from offering your services on Fiverr. TextbrokerTextbroker doesn\u2019t pay quite as much as other freelance platforms, but it\u2019s still a good way for teens to make some extra money. One of the benefits of writing on a site like this is that you\u2019ll get a lot of good practice (the more you write, the better you tend to get). You\u2019ll also build a portfolio you can use to pitch higher-paid writing jobs. Your fee depends on whether the job is an OpenOrder, DirectOrder, or TeamOrder: OpenOrders pay per word and depend on your quality rating level. You can choose from thousands of orders at your preferred quality level. A DirectOrder is an order that is sent directly to you. This could either be because a client has worked with you previously and wants to work with you again, or because they have seen your profile and are impressed enough to reach out and work with you. If you have a Direct Order, you set your own rate per word. TeamOrders are for working with the same clients consistently. These projects are open to any author on your team on a first come, first serve basis. The client sets the rate per word for the whole team, and there is no limit to how many teams you can join.  CafepressCafepress is an online gift shop or, as they claim, the world\u2019s best online gift shop. You create items to sell, and they do the marketing for you. Popular categories include: Men\u2019s clothingWomen\u2019s clothingAccessoriesBaby clothingHome and decorDrinkwareStationaryStickers and signsYou can design your own products on there by heading to the \u2018Design Your Own\u2019 section on the website. Select the product that you want to design and use a Cafepress designer to produce the item. The amount of money that you make depends on how much markup you put on your items. You get to choose how much to charge, so it\u2019s entirely up to you. In the Cafepress marketplace, you will earn 5-10% of the sale price for whatever you sell. InstagramInstagram isn\u2019t just a place to share photos of your food or your furry companion. It\u2019s also a platform that you can use to earn some serious cash. Just look at some of the biggest Instagram influencers out there who earn thousands per post. Yes, you read that correctly. Thousands! The amount of money that you are able to make depends on how many followers you have, how engaged they are, and the size of your influence. You can make money from sponsored posts, affiliate marketing, or selling your own products or services. There are other ways to make money on Instagram, but these are the main ones. Sitter CitySimilar to Find Child Care, Senior Care, Pet Care and Housekeeping, Sitter City offers services for a babysitter, nanny, pet sitter, housekeeper, or elderly companion. Again, creating a profile is free and easy, and you choose your own rate. Results for each site may vary depending on your location. If you want to make money by providing any of these services, you\u2019ll get the most options for potential matches by signing up for both. EtsyEtsy is a site where you can sell (and buy) unique, handmade, and vintage items. If you\u2019re a crafty person, this is a great site to sell and make money on. Most people think you have to know how to knit or create elaborate jewelry to make money on Etsy, but that\u2019s not necessarily the case. I know several people who sell printables on the website (usually things like inspirational quotes) that do really well. I also know someone who\u2019s had massive success on Etsy selling simple handmade jewelry and leather bracelets. The amount of money you make depends on what you sell and how much people are willing to pay for your items. However, the income potential is massive. Slice The PieSlice The Pie is a website that pays people for reviews. You can review songs, clothes, commercials, and more before they go live. Your feedback helps artists, record labels, and brands make important decisions about their products. Some reviews will pay you more, which you\u2019ll see on the Category page. You will also get paid more depending on the quality of your review and your star rating on the site. For example, a 1-star reviewer earns $0.03 per track review, while a 5-star reviewer makes $0.15 for each track reviewed. Cash out via PayPal once your account hits $10. You also get bonus points for referring your friends. Important FACTS ! Teen Jobs: Tips For Getting Started Keep these tips in mind when searching for the best ways to make money online as a teen. Get a PayPal Account As you may have noticed from reading through this list of online jobs for teens, most sites pay via PayPal. Therefore, in order to accept payments, you\u2019ll need to sign up for an account of your own. Setting up a PayPal account is easy. In order to complete your account, PayPal will send a couple small deposits to your bank account and have you verify the amounts. That means you need to set up your account ahead of time. If you wait until you\u2019re ready to transfer your earnings, you\u2019ll have to hold off a few extra days. Keep Your Parents In The Loop I know it\u2019s tempting to keep things to yourself, but if you\u2019re suddenly earning extra money and not explaining where it\u2019s coming from, your parents are going to be worried. For your own safety and benefit, let them know what you\u2019re doing. Tell them how you\u2019ve been researching all kinds of online jobs for students to earn money. A strong work ethic, particularly from a young age, is very impressive and they will appreciate your initiative! ",

            "answer_text": "When I was in college, I worked one of the best jobs for college students I could possibly ask for. I was a team lead at my school\u2019s indoor recreation center. I loved my job. Seriously, who wouldn\u2019t love getting paid to do homework and play pool? And as a team leads, I took my job pretty seriously (nerd alert ?). It was my job to train the new employees, manage our events, and do my damndest to make sure everyone had a good time. Unfortunately, not everyone I worked with shared my same level of commitment to the job. Every day students would call in or forget their shifts, and I would be stuck cleaning up the resulting mess. At the time it was super frustrating, but in hindsight, it\u2019s a little easier to empathize. College is busy. Working through college can help offset some big expenses, but between classes, volunteer work, and enjoying some of the best years of your life, it can be difficult to fit into a rigid work schedule. That\u2019s where the Internet comes in. Legit Online Jobs for Students To Earn Money If you\u2019re in college and want to work but have trouble finding the time, these online jobs for students to earn money can give you the flexibility you\u2019re looking for. Not to mention working online often pays way better than your regular campus positions. Double win. 1. Social Media Manager What it pays: $15-$40/hour Most of us spend hours a week on social media anyway. Why not get paid for it? Every business uses social media, but managing it in-house is more expensive (employee taxes) and employees\u2019 time is better spent elsewhere. That\u2019s where independently contracted social media managers come in. Social media managers help build brand awareness by curating content, building relationships with potential customers, and driving new leads. Your job is to be the online voice of the company. Get started as a social media manager by approaching local businesses and telling them about your services. Start by reaching out to businesses you already frequent \u2014 yoga studios, coffee shops, boutiques, restaurants, etc. Focus on whatever social media platforms you\u2019re most comfortable with, and talk about how you can use it to grow their business and reach new customers. 2. Blogger  What it pays: varies (some bloggers make $100,000+ per month) If I could go back in time, I would for sure have started a blog in college. (As a finance major, I could have used the creative outlet.) The key to making money as a blogger is to write content that provides value to your readers. No one wants to read an article titled \u201cMy Family Vacation to Hawaii,\u201d (except maybe your mom and aunt Jody). On the other hand, a piece on \u201c7 Things You Need to Know Before Vacationing in Hawaii\u201d is both intriguing and helpful. Before you start your blog, choose a topic you enjoy writing about, and make it specific. As they say in marketing, if you speak to everyone, you\u2019ll speak to no one. Once you have your topic, write down at least 20 blog post ideas, then get to crackin\u2019 on your first five posts. This is a good test of whether or not you actually enjoy writing on your chosen subject (or even at all). Once you\u2019re ready to start your blog, the next step is to choose a host for your website. HostGator is a popular option and the one we recommend for beginner bloggers. It\u2019s not free \u2014 plans start at $2.75 per month \u2014 but it\u2019s an essential first step. See our step-by-step guide to starting a profitable blog to kick things off on the right foot.  3. Freelance Writer What it pays: $50-$500+ per article Don\u2019t sweat your credentials here \u2014 if you have good grammatical skills and a desire to write, you can make it as a freelance writer. Freelance writing is a flexible and lucrative way to make money in college. And think how cool it would be to add to your resume \u201cPublished in the New York Times\u201d or some other big media outlet. Having an online presence in the form of your own blog can help you land high-paying clients faster and serve as a portfolio for your work. Otherwise, you can get started as a freelance writer by picking up clients on Upwork. Once you\u2019ve got some work to show and testimonials to back you up, start pitching to jobs on Problogger and Freelance Writing Jobs. 4. Virtual Assistant What it pays: $15-$200+ per hour Virtual assistant services range from data entry and customer service to copywriting and email marketing. The amount you can charge as a virtual assistant depends on your skillset and experience. Specialized skills like copywriting or email marketing are premium services that pay premium rates. Businesses hire virtual assistants to outsource tasks that don\u2019t need to be done in-house. For example, a cafe makes food, keeps the dining and kitchen areas clean, and serves customers. They don\u2019t specialize in social media management or content marketing. By hiring a virtual assistant, they can avoid paying employee taxes (since VAs aren\u2019t employees of the businesses they work for) and have someone experienced managing their digital marketing efforts. It\u2019s a win-win. Start working as a virtual assistant by making a list of services you can offer. Then create profiles on Zirtual and Virtual Assistant Networking to start booking your first clients. For more information, see our guide on the exact steps to become a virtual assistant. Watch my video on How You Can Make Money Online Today with a Small Youtube Channel. 5. Graphic Designer What it pays: $25-$50 per hour You don\u2019t have to be a graphic design major to make money online as a graphic designer. All you need are the right tools and an eye for detail. Small businesses need appealing graphics for everything \u2014 business cards, logos, social media images, etc. If you don\u2019t yet have the necessary skills but still want to try your hand at graphic design, sign up for the free Graphic Design Basics course on Skillshare. This class is a short overview of the fundamentals of visual design. Once you\u2019re ready to get started, reach out to small businesses in your area. Let them know what services you offer (business cards, branding, flyer design, etc.) and how you can help them increase brand awareness. In addition to local businesses, many bloggers use freelance designers for Pinterest pin creation and other social media imagery. Email your favorites and see if they could use your new skills. 99designs and freelance sites like Upwork are also promising sources for freelance designers. ",

            "answer_text": "If you needed to start something today. I have a simple thing that you can I that I have done successfully for over 40 years and that is to find under priced Items and sell them. You decide what items mean to you, stuff that you love, like, passionate about, have a lot of knowledge about or maybe you are even an expert with. I have created a lot of success by just doing this one thing. When I was younger, I found action figures, hot wheels and other collectibles that were under priced and sold them for 5\u20136\u20137\u201310 times more than the amount I paid for them. My first house was grossly under priced, I walked into $ 20,000.00 of equity. I have found under priced employees. I once hired a young kid that was a phenom. When he was in college, he and a bunch of his tech friends were drinking and made up a contest to see who could hack into BOA first. He won, he then was had visit by the FBI and ultimately got kicked out of school and had to come back to my and his hometown for a year. I was able to get him for one year at minimum wage. I recently bought a business for $ 2,500.00 it was only doing $ 500.00 a month in gross revenue, because the store had no merchandise in it. Within a year we turned that same business into a $ 60,000.00 dollar a year business and it continues to grow. After you find the items then sell them on Facebook Marketplace, Craigslist, Mercari, Offer Up, Let Go, EBAY, etc. I would start with asking your mom, dad, siblings, cousins, aunts, uncles, grandmas, grandpas, friends, acquaintances, etc. Make a list, we each know 40,000 people minimally. I have won a lot of money with statement over the last 25 years. I give them a memory jogger and each person inevitably come up with 200 names. If you ask those 200 to come up with 200 names. Simple math 200 x 200 = 40,000. That is a lot of people who might be interested in giving you free stuff, which is the most under priced as you can get. Finally, I would like to tell you a story that should help. The story is about a kid that was with his dad in the middle of the forest, it is nighttime, and I pitch black outside and it was also freezing cold inside their cabin. The boy wants to go to the wood pile to get some wood so he can start a fire, but he is scared. His dad says what are you afraid of you have a flashlight, correct. The boy said yes but, the wood pile is a 100 feet-meters away. The dad opened the door and said son, shine the light down towards the ground just about 20 inches ahead of your feet. The dad asked the boy what he saw, and the boy said one step. The dad said take that step, now what do you see, the boy again said one step. I think we all understand the morale of the story which is inch by inch is a cinch and mile by mile takes a while. Just Start! I hope this helps and Good Luck! ",

Just read this blog post on Gtpedia about making money online http://gtpedia.com/how-to-make-money-online-season-on/ BloggingOne of the best and surest way to make huge income online is to build a website/blog.

            "answer_text": " You really cannot make much money, anywhere, (including the Internet), if your sole aim is to make money. Money must not be the major factor. It's just like gasoline on a long road trip, you are going to need it, but, you are not doing a tour of gas stations. Now, let's get started. The easiest way is to build something, right from the first day. A web app, a mobile app or something else like this, for just quick simple income. I agree that these are not highly reliable, but, what's the harm in trying. If you want to build a real business, not just simply do a stunt (for a quick buck) you have to work hard. For my startup, (I won't reveal much details here), we were profitable from day 1, as we didn't follow the trail of money. Money will come, if you build something good. I assume that you must be knowing a bit of programming, too. The first thing is to build a minimum viable product, which could be used to test the worth of your idea. It does not need to be something highly advanced, but, something functional. Remember, if it's hard to explain, your MVP is not good enough.  Second advice, start following resources like hacker news, which might prove useful. But, do not indulge yourself too much into it. Why don't you join teens in tech? Daniel seems to do a nice job, by mentoring teen entrepreneurs. Third, have fun and enjoy what you do.  Fourth and the most important thing, check this -> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYfNvmF0Bqw .Welcome to the entrepreneurship world.  ",

            "answer_text": "I know of two ways which have definitely gave me spendable money and I'll tell you both of them. One is less skill and just patience and luck. The other also needs patience but you need some skill and work into it. SurveysMost people recommend them but you never knew which actually gets you any. Swagbucks is a simple one. You can do surveys, watch videos and answer polls to earn swagbucks. However, it takes some time and you need to remember things like age and birthday if you put a fake one since it asks on a regular basis. Not all surveys take you and it takes quite a while to find one you get any from. Recommend looking at the ones with 10 to 40 swagbucks since you have more of a chance. Don't buy the \u00a33 Amazon gift card or any of the ones on \u201csale\u201d since it ain't worth it. Look at the ones not on sale and they have a more reasonable price. 800 swagbucks for a \u00a35 PayPal gift card or get a steam one at 500 swagbucks worth the same amount of cash. It is ripping you off. Anyway, after a while the gift card will process and it will be usuable. 2. Freelancing I use divert and currently have made 15$ from it. I sold Twitch stream packs which weren't the best. First find a skill your good at or like, for example; video editing. If you don't have a professional program get it cracked. Learn the program and make a couple of short videos with it. Now make an account, you can't change your name afterwards so think about it. It doesn't ask for your age but technically you should be 12 and over. Make your gig look professional and look at people making similar and do something on the lines of that. Do something different though, maybe yours have an extra thing they don't. Be truthful as well. It takes time getting noticed so put yourself out on social media by joining groups and asking people to look at your gig for tips but not too much so it isn't spam or your like a begger. It takes 14 days to cash it out and you can use a bank or PayPal. Also recommend doing a skill test, Fiverr won't show the failures so don't worry too much if you do bad. Do skill tests on ones you use or do. Hope you earn some cash and have a nice day. ",

            "answer_text": "I've been fairly successful using some of the following methods, enough to be almost completely independent from my parents throughout high schoool. 1) Take advantage of Alibaba. A lot of people fail to realize the power of Chinese manufacturers to produce products at a fraction of what you may pay for it in the US. What you want to do is choose a product (lets use women's necklaces in this example) and search for the product on alibaba. You can find nice looking peices of jewelry that manufacturers can make for around 10-25\u00a2 a piece with a minimum quantity order of about 300-500. After buying these, visit BigCartel or Etsy and set up a page for the product you ordered and charge anywhere from 5-15$ for your necklace. Now initially it might seem like you get no visitors but this is where you utilize popular accounts on Twitter. Contact some popular accounts (like \"commonwhitegirl\" or \"teenposts\") and they will give you a price of about 5-25$ for a single advertisement tweet. Buy a few tweets from several accounts and have them tweet on same night. Soon you will notice large traffics visiting your website and it might become a trend. A bit procedural but the profit margins are RIDICULOUS.  2) LEARN CODE. LIKE NOW. Freelance programming is allowing programmers to make a full living from the comfort of their bedroom. Visit code.org or codeacademy.com to learn some languages and practice these to perfect them. Then visit sites like freelancer.com and do jobs for clients, with payouts fluctuating greatly. A bit more complicated but you learn skills that can help in future employment. 3) Popular twitter accounts. Once again this is a new and rising field of \"employment\" where many people are making high five figure salaries (even six figure for some) a year simply by tweeting. Create a twitter account focused on one subject, whether it be movie quotes, funny pictures, or tweeting facts about a certain topic, and focus on this niche. If the niche is small, be sure to freguently change your account. I myself started one account that followed the latest trends and I would change the account name and everything to follow the latest social media trend. You can easily gain thousands of followers per trend and soon you have six figure followers. Then work with an advertising compamy and tweet out advertising links and you will earn money based on the number of unique impressions you earn. Although time consuming, you develop a solid account that will earn money almost guranteed in the long run. If you put time into these, you will see results, it doesnt start suddenly but once you get the hang of it, you can actually make a decent income from these. Hope I was able to help. ",

Some will produce an immediate income while others may take months or more. For instance, blogs and surveys are ideal for the beginner, and surveys can produce immediate income.  A blog is like an online journal. Surveys simply require you to share your opinion. Your own web-site on the other hand requires some expertise and will usually produce income in the longer-term.  However once your site does start making money for you, it\u2019s like having your own money-printing machine! Google Adsense is where you enable adverts to show on your blog or website, and you get paid every time someone clicks on the ads.  So, if your blog or website become popular, and you are getting thousands of visitors a week or a day, you can make a great income doing pretty much nothing! (You did the work previously setting up the blog or site and now you can reap the rewards). Google Adwords is where you pay for your own advert that will appear down the right side of the page when people do a google search.  For instance, let\u2019s say you are selling health products and need more customers. If you have your own website, however simple, you can create an advert that will appear on Google\u2019s search results when someone does a search for health products. You pay every time someone clicks on your advert. Let\u2019s say Google charge you 20 cents a click, and for every 30 people that click you get a sale of, say, $40. As long as you are in profit with the results, it can be well worth doing. However, I strongly recommend that you follow the experts with this method, else you could waste a lot of money. Read my ebook before you get involved. Affiliate marketing can work well with Adwords.   This is where you send buyers to other people\u2019s websites and get generous commission on any sales made. The sales are tracked by way of a coded link. You don\u2019t need to buy stock or send items to customers, the website owner does all that. This can be a superb way to make money once you understand it. Selling on Ebay is another way to make money online quickly.  You don\u2019t need to sell stuff from your loft, you can sell whatever you are most interested in \u2013 so, if you love sport, why not look into selling sports-related items. If you make jewellery, sell that. If you love dogs, sell dog-related items. Again, there are tricks of the trade that will make the difference between ebay success and failure. So, you can get started with the methods that make immediate cash and then progress into other methods if you want to earn more. Some people make six figures A MONTH online, while others just want a few hundred a week. That\u2019s the great thing about making money online, you can build up to whatever income you want, and let\u2019s face it, there aren\u2019t many jobs that offer you that!

I used to do job before 13 years but then I came to know about 'Freelancing', I found it interesting and I started practicing it.

Freelancing also has its plus and minus but I would guide you. First, choose your skill / talent or passion that what you can do at the best in freelancing. Second, choose the right freelance marketplace online. I've used all in last 12 years but I would suggest these:www.Elance.com (Highly Recommended)www.FreelancerCircle.com (Highly Recommended)www.Upwork.com (Highly Recommended) www.PeoplePerHour.com (Optionally Recommended)www.Guru.com (Optionally Recommended)www.WorkNHire.com (Optionally Recommended) www.Freelancer.com (Not Recommended)www.Outsource.com (Not Recommended)www.RentACoder.com (Not Recommended)   Third, register free and setup your profile there.

            "answer_text": "I\u2019ll asume you mean big money not just a couple of dollars working as a pizza guy so I won\u2019t discuss about \u201cthose\u201d jobs. Personally I found the following three ways the best to start making real money and they can be done from anywhere in the world. No excuses. 1)Affiliate Marketing This is probably my best way to make money as a teenager because a) anyone can do it b) you put all the work once (and then passive income) c) you can earn +1k a month if you are successful. So what Affiliate Marketing is exactly? Basically someone or a company has a product (both digital or physical) and of course, they want to sell it and rank first. If they have an affiliate program you can join them, and they will give you a link for each product. If someone buys that product through your link they will give you a commission which will vary depending on the product. If it sounded complex I promise it\u2019s not that really What are the best affiliate programs out there? I\u2019ll say two: Amazon Associates and Clickbank Amazon Associates is as you may guess, with amazon. Once you applied and join Amazon associates you can pretty much pick anything from amazon and have your affiliate link which then if someone buys that amazon product clicking your link to it, you will earn a commission. Pros: - Everybody trust amazon so it\u2019s easier to sell -It\u2019s more \u201cProfessional\u201d Cons: -It\u2019s not that simple to join the program, in fact you first need a website and they have to review it and then approve it. -Small commissions per product (less than 10%) generally. I n the other hand, Clickbank focuses more on digital products such us \u201cKeto diet\u201d \u201cSuperior singing method\u201detc. You can sign in in just minutes and get the link to thousands of products to promote, again, all digital products.You don\u2019t need a website or anything and you can \u201cspam\u201d you link anywhere you want to (Via Email, YouTube, a blog) Pros: -You can sign in and start selling in just minutes -Big commissions (40/50%) - You don\u2019t need a website or anything Cons: -It\u2019s harder to sell since most people don\u2019t trust digital products and many of them are crap. -Lot of competition (since anyone can join ) Personally I\u2019ll go with amazon program I tried clickbank without exit. Simply because everyone buys through amazon and no one trust digital products. 2) FreelancingFreelaning is doing a job for someone (usually from around the world). It can be a simple task such as editing a video to creating a software. Where to start freelancing? I recommend this three sites: Fiverr: The most popular however a lot of competition. Anyone can join and get started easily. Basically whichever is you skill you post something like \u201cI\u2019ll be your video editor \u201c or \u201cI\u2019ll come up with some lyrics for your songs\u201d etc. How much you earn will depend on how much you ask and how good you rank. The more clients and good reviews you get the better you\u2019ll rankYou can take a look at it and get the picture.You can visit their site (Fiverr) or download the mobile app. My second option is Freelancer.com. I made my first dollars there. Although it\u2019s freelancing as well as Fiver it\u2019s very different because instead of potential clients looking which service it\u2019s best they instead post a project and you apply. I applied to someone looking for a video editor and finally out of the all the freelancers who applied he hired me to work with him longtime. The last site is called Upwork and I\u2019ve never used it but it\u2019s very similar to Fiverr, however it\u2019s more for bigger projects. Pros and cons about freelancing? You need to have a skill which you are good at it.Then you need to rank good (in case of Fiverr) or convince the client you are the best option (Freelancer,com) But this one basically you can earn money doing something you like or are passionate about, literary there are unlimited projects or jobs out there or if you are creative start doing something nobody has done before. 3) Social Media Manager/Marketing This is a great way as well but I haven\u2019t personally tried it, that\u2019s why it\u2019s last on my list. However I know many people are making 2k per month with this and even more. What is it exactly. As you may know, all business have their digital site to promote themselves, it\u2019s how it works nowadays. What you will be offering is to help a business to get more clients through Social Media. This can be done by managing their Instagram, Twitter, Facebook accounts and they will pay you pretty well. There are unlimited business you can even pick a local one (let\u2019s say a dentist) and start offering your services. However it\u2019s hard to get your first client.So those are my 3 best ways to make money as a teenager and as mentioned earlier, if you are successful you can be financially free for the rest of your life. And finally you may be asking yourself, how on earth am I going to learn to do that? 2 things, one you can either learn it from YouTube which there is good stuff but all of them will just want to sell you their \u201dfree\u201d course (which is not)and trust me, they are not worth it. I recommend signing up with Skillshare, you can find the really best courses about all these 3 and you can get all of them with their free trial (1 month however I\u2019ll see if I can get you 3). I learnt everything from skillshare and I personally wouldnt recommend it if I didn\u2019t really love it.And lastly take action, pick the best one that you think is best for you and start researching and taking action. Hope I was clear and please if there\u2019s any serious grammar mistake let me know (English is not my first language)Ill update this with links and pictures in the future ",

            "answer_text": "There\u2019s not much difference in making money online as a teenager than as an adult. I\u2019m assuming you are younger than 18, and you can still do anything that requires Paypal, but you just need to get an adult to act as the primary holder of your account. Most things like Shopify are just going to need you to have a cosigner. Everything else will be under your name and control. Youtube is always a great option because there are so many people on the platform, so you can drive traffic to your website or Instagram where you can grow your audience and use affiliate products to cash in on your loving fans. There are also product testing websites where you can do quick reviews of a website or app and get paid at a high rate compared to retail jobs. It\u2019s about $30 per hour, but it\u2019s not something you can simply do all the time. You check in when you\u2019re available to see if you qualify for anything. Freelancing on something like Fiverr where the age limit is as low as 13! Think of a skill that you have that can help people either run their business more efficiently or something that might be busy work for others that you can do pretty well. Maybe you can edit photos for ads or something like that. I can give you a link to Fiverr and you can get 20% your first purchase if you decide to get a service to help you maybe do something you don\u2019t know how to do for your business. I teach more about online business as well as personal finance over on my Instagram (at a.j.valenti), and I encourage young people to check it out and get some new perspective on things that will allow them to be financially free and able to achieve any goal in life. I hope this helped. ",

Teenagers often have different talents and hobbies \u2013 for example, you may be good at web design or at least, photoshop; you may write well and be able to formulate your thoughts briefly and correctly, and thus work as a copywriter. There are many options if you think about making money along these lines. I guess, you apprehend my train of ideas. If you find writing articles too difficult \u2013 for example, epistolary genre is not your specialty \u2013 there is a similar way to earn, but a little bit easier. A real opportunity to earn money on the internet for a teenager - is writing comments on forums, blogs, social networks. Besides, it\u2019s much more reliable than clicking on suspicious web sites, that are often diurnal and do not pay a cent to the employees (often they just disappear when a day of salary comes), or simply lead to porn sites. People create such sites in order to find free labor force and from the very beginning are not going to pay anything. So be careful and stay away from such cowboy firms. But anyway \u2013 writing is interesting, comprehensive, it is easier than other activities and makes your mind well furnished. No matter what you choose \u2013 good luck! ",

One of which is by becoming a freelancer and offering a service like for example, building websites for local businesses. You can easily learn how to do this in 30 minutes to an hour from one video tutorial. Or, one very easy method is by testing out various websites/apps and providing your honest feedback. I recently made a video about this where I show you how to make up to $30/hr by doing this.  Feel free to give that a watch, as I go over 5 different websites that will pay you for this. But last but not least, I would highly recommend starting a website/Youtube channel around a niche that you are either knowledgeable or passionate about. This won\u2019t make you rich overnight, but if you put up videos/articles rather consistently and build a following, it can be a great source of passive income! Not only can you make a commission every time someone watches an ad, but you can even promote other peoples products/services online and get paid for every customer you refer to the product.

Use 10 of your friends to judge which might actually sell (people you trust not to steal your ideas) and then put them on sites like cafepress.com.  I made enough money from selling t shirts the old fashioned way, on the streets of NYC, to buy my first car while I was in college and that business paid for pretty much all my expenses while I was in school except tuition. I was lucky enough to have a big hit with one specific design, so I never even bothered to try others but you could quickly build a significant following online using social media, based on satisfied customers who want to know about new designs as they come out.  Everyone wears t shirts; they are relatively cheap to make, and you never need to get involved with anything beyond design with all the websites set up for this sort of thing these days. All you need is a fresh idea, or a new take on an old one. ",

We bought some small jewelry charms off of Amazon and necklace chains and earrings and attached them together with some stickers and other stuff. We were quite surprised to find out that people actually bought our items and left positive reviews! As long as you have nice pictures for people to look at and a nice idea, I am sure people would buy your items. Although you do have to pay a small fee of a couple of cents every time you put an item on your shop, I wish you the best of luck on whatever you chose to do. -Estelle ",

If you go the digital products route look up courses and videos on launch jacking. Pretty much you will be reviewing a product before it launches and sending people to the offer after your review. They will normally give you a trial copy to tryout and make a review about. From there people will see the video and go through your link of they like what the product has to offer and you as a person ",

You need to know what things are worth and take the risk, just like any investment. You\u2019ll develop your own negotiation style, and you\u2019ll start to see the little tricks that a buyer or a seller can use to come out on top. Whatever you decide to do, please realize that you have to actually work. Nobody is going to just hand you money. ",

Start a Blog or #2 Start a Youtube Channel. I don\u2019t know much about Youtube yet - still learning. But as for a blog, here is it. #1. Get a domain name and a web hosting package. You can get started with Hostgator at $2.75 a month. #2. Start writing content #3. At the end of 6 months, you will see some ranking on Google p- meaning you get fre traffic. But if you do not see, start learning SEO. #4. If the latter worked and you get traffic, go ahead and apply for Google Adsense. But wait, tell you parents or anyone 18 to help you do that. #5. Start earning income from it. The good news is that Adsense does not need your PayPal account to pay you. You will get it wired to your bank directly. If you want to know how to start a money making blog in 5 steps, see my profile. And if you want to get Google Approval as I did under 24 hours, visit my blog to read more. I hope this helps.

My siblings and I all worked 35 hours a week. Then, we had to come home and do two hours worth of homework every night.

Start looking into Affiliate Marketing, there\u2019s a lot of different affiliate networks out there including a lot of the big name brands and stores. A teenager is very likely going to be more tuned in to what the current trends are with other teens and young people, so this can be used to market to that audience more effectively. Of course, you\u2019re not just limited to marketing to people of the same age, you can market towards older people too if you do some research on it. You can set up a Wordpress site yourself, a lot of web hosting companies will include a \u201c1 click setup\u201d option for it. For example, Bluehost will give you a free domain name, free SSL cert and install Wordpress for you for $3.95 a month which is quite a good offer. There are a lot of free resources out there that will help you to get started, just be wary of anyone promising you the sun, moon and stars or anyone telling you that you\u2019ll be earning 50 grand before you even get out of bed. Make no mistake, although you genuinely can make some really good money with Affiliate Marketing, it takes time and effort when you a first starting out because you\u2019ll make mistakes, that\u2019s normal and part of the learning process. Hope it works out well for you. Kind Regards Alan ",

Best advice would be to use passive income apps where with the very little effort you can earn some extra bucks for coffee at high school. For example, Honeygain and Smart Panel is totally easy and no effort required apps. online surveys - it requires time but you can earn more. For example, try Survey Junkie, it has numerous options of surveys and small tasks for which you get paid. ",

Another way is to be an Affiliate Marketer where you will promote products and get a commission on each product you sell. I suggest Click Bank, WarriorPlus or JVVZOO. These are excellent affiliat plataforms where you can get the top products and links to sell. You get 50% commision of the sale. Before promoting, you need to be approved by the vendor. Finally, if you love taking photos, I recommend visiting EyeEm. This is a great plataform for selling ypur photos. The photos have to be good quality to be approved. ",
