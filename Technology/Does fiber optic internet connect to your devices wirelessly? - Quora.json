            "answer_text": "Two different things. Wired data / communications lines comes in two formats: copper (or any electrical conductor) and fiber optics. Copper carries electrons (electricity) and fiber carries photons (light). That\u2019s the physical connections. Once connected to a common network (almost always \u201cEthernet\u201d tech today), any mixture of device types can talk to each other. Wireless uses radio frequency communications, which is a from of electro-magnetic technology (like copper based wired communications), obviously without a physical medium. On that same thought\u2026 \u201cIR\u201d (infra-red) remotes are more like fiber over the air, in that the signal is part of the light spectrum. Wifi uses 2.4Ghz and 5Ghz frequency ranges. Think FM radio, but well beyond the dial. The physical fiber connectors are standardized. The medium doesn\u2019t matter much in networking\u2026 the \u201cOSI model\u201d helps demonstrate this concept. The physical layer is independent from the \u201cframing\u201d layer (layer 2)\u2026 in this case Ethernet. This means that Ethernet (Wifi is an extension of that) can talk over multiple mediums\u2026 so a computer that has a copper connection, another with fiber and another with \u201cWifi\u201d can all talk to each other\u2026 they have no real understanding (awareness) that the other devices are on different physical mediums/paths. The core of the Internet is all fiber optic based. Fiber optics have 100x the capacity of copper based technology: we have a lot of room to grow/advance with fiber, not as much left with copper. For the foreseeable future, wired will always be preferred over wireless: not that wireless clearly has it\u2019s advantages and can usually do the job well-enough. It\u2019s simply more susceptible to interference than wired communications, generally speaking. And of the two wired formats, fiber is the least susceptible to interference from external sources - anything beyond physically damaging or kinking the fiber itself: affecting the light travelling over a very small glass tube, with cladding and other layers of protection.

            "answer_text": "No. Fiber optic internet is an alternative connection to your ISP and the internet. It is not wireless, it uses fibers that transmit data by flashing light. To connect your devices you\u2019ll still need a modem like device called an ONT and a router. Many routers include WiFi for wireless connectivity, but you could also use an access point to add wireless connectivity to your network. The connection to your ISP, fiber optic, cable, DSL, etc. has nothing to do with how devices locally connect to your network. ",
