            "answer_text": "There sure is and as real as the person writing this answer. The big 3 carriers have nationwide 5G coverage with Verizon being the most recent to make their announcement[1]. Keep in mind that it won't cover every single inch of the US yet like 4G but it will get there in time. More importantly, 5G devices are becoming more available to the market. I've always viewed Apple's acceptance as the point where 5G is ready for the main stream. Which makes 5G more real. But there's still a lot of room for this technology to mature. Expect this to happen in the next 5-10 years. Footnotes[1] Fastest 5G Network in the World just got bigger and better ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, 5G is available in many cities. But it's not widely available like 4G anywhere in the world. It's a much more difficult task to setup 5G coverage outside of cities because of the very short range of towers. Cost will also become an issue when settings it up in areas with less number of users. So true millimeter wave 5G network won't likely grow as fast as 4G outside of cities. What will be widely made available is Sub-6 5G which is not the highest frequency 5G available, but will have longer range and the network will be easier to implement. Sub-6 5G is below 6Ghz while mm wave 5G is above 24Ghz. It will still improve latency and speed compared to 4G. So 5G will come soon in many parts of the world. But it won't be the drastically different super high speed 5G that many are talking about. That will be reserved for cities for now. ",
