            "answer_text": "Sony or any other manufacturer that also operates as an end producer, i.e. not a raw material or parts manufacturer, takes the sum of all Research and Development, Marketing & Promotional, Manufacturing (labor, parts, overhead expenses, fixed costs, variable costs, and inventory costs, taxes, and other.) Shippong, Storage and \u201cGreen fees\u201d adds it all up and divides by how many units produced to get a total unit cost. That unit cost is then doubled or even tripled to get the \u201cList Price of an item\u201d. They then add 10\u201315% for sales concessions paid to salesmen, and that\u2019s why a new Sony TV costs around $1500 to $1850. Then Best Buy, Amazon, or Alibaba doubles that price given and you pay anywhere from $3,600 to $4500 (which they then put on \u201csale\u201d knocking it back to $3000-$3750) for a TV that has about $375 worth of parts inside, that they paid someone $20 to put together.
