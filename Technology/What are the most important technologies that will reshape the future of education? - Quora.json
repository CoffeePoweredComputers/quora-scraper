The cloud technology is gradually eliminating the need for students to carry bulky computers. Smartphones are connecting students to students and teachers (but disconnecting them from parents!). Smartwatches are likely to enable more students to participate in \u201cWho Wants to be a Millionaire\u201d games. Self driving cars in near future are likely to let students travel to and from schools, without having to depend on parents. ",

World class courses are now available to everyone, regardless of location or whether or not they can afford to pay. I think collaborative technology such as Kramer will also transform education as we know it. Students can work together remotely and share their work on a central monitor. Teachers can monitor their progress, and work with each student individually. ",
