            "answer_text": "Excitel Broadband is the WORST broadband service you can expect, I strongly recommend you to change your decision or regret later in your life. The support is absolutely useless and defrauding, their service agents are not employed but on a contract basis with some third party and thus their agents try to sell their own internet instead of fixing the issue with Excitel connection. Their CEO, Vivek Raina, is the least bit concerned about the customers. I was recently frauded where I paid for a month and never, ever received a single second of internet and their support claims that I have been using it whereas the cable from which internet comes is dead since I paid the amount. You write to Nodal Officers, Appellate Authority, COO, CEO, only the support responds that too with a delay saying that whatever your problem is, you are responsible for it and not them. I\u2019m telling you, this company is not going to last long and it is better if you bet somewhere else if you also decide to pay for the long term. This company is a mere definition of a \u2018hustle\u2019 between contractors, sub-contractors, fraudulent customer support and not an organization you can rely on. This feedback is after using Excitel as my \u2018secondary\u2019 connection NOT \u2018primary\u2019, I set up two different internets as I am a freelancer and I work online and going offline is the worst nightmare, so even if I have to pay extra to ensure not going offline, I am fine and thus two internets ACT & Excitel. I can't even imagine using this huge-mistake-for-a-company as a primary connection, my cousins use it as a primary connection and they speak good for it, but whenever I try to use their connection it fails and they spend 4 to 5 days of their 30 days on the call with Excitel Support, so maybe it is worth it if you like to spend that amount of time on pleading support to help you. Or you could be using a better ISP and avoid that hassle in the first place. It\u2019s Your Choice! But I Strictly Don\u2019t Recommend Excitel & I Spend 8 Hours of My Every Day\u2019s 24 Online. ",

            "answer_text": "Excitel Feedback Excitel is the Internet Service Provider. I have recently started using Excitel Broadband connection and would like to provide feedback about the same which you may help you selecting the right option. You may want consider the pros and cons before switching to it. PROS: - Economical - It offers good speed internet at a low price compare to other Internet Service provider. - Fair Customer Support - There is a 24x7 central customer support team to troubleshoot the issue in case there is any problem. However the local service provider is available from 10 AM to 7 PM (7 days a week). - No Major Device Cost - You don't need MODEM to start using the connection. If you have a ROUTER, that is suffice. CONS: - Network Issue - Unlike other service providers, Excitel doesn't provide you a fix IP address. The way it works is that it creates a subnet within a network and allocates a Dynamic IP address to you which keeps on changing after certain interval of time. And then if you are using multiple devices at home, then you device will then create another subnet and use the Dynamic private IP address (which means 2 level of subnets - a subnet within a subnet). So, if there is any application that doesn't support the same, then the application won't work. I have seen some applications on Android device that doesn't work with 2 levels of subnets allocating Dynamic IP addresses. - Unreliable over VPN - If you want to work from home on some day and your company needs that you need to be in company's VPN, then Excitel does NOT work with VPN. It will keep disconnecting the VPN connection and you won't be able to work. This is so because the way Excitel works. As the Dynamic IP address keeps changing at regular intervals, it will disconnect you every 10-12 mins or so and will keep prompting you to connect to VPN again and again which is painful. Excitel department says that they don't support. This is the problem that only very few excitel networking guys understand. Rest will continue to assure you that it is not an issue with Excitel (which is obviously not the case) ",
