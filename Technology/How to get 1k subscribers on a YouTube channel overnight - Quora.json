            "answer_text": "First of all, it is difficult to increase views overnight. Look friend, you have to keep suspense, you have to be patient. I told you my experience I am also a YouTuber I do not have 1K as of now. But I had put a song on Independence Day. And I got viewers around 1.7K in a single day, it was a big deal for me Because I did not have so many views before this.  So I would like to tell the reason behind the number of views that I have taken. I watched many videos on YouTube to increase views. So I got an idea from that too. The most important of them is to place tags. If you want that your videos are in top then add tags many as possible related to your video. I recommend you to watch in youtube how to increase views. How to add thumbnail in youtube. How to write title, description and type. Moreover how to add tags and what to add in tags. Mtlb yr jitne possible topics or name de skte ho do!
