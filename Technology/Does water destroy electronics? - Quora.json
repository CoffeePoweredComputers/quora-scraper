            "answer_text": "Water is electrically conductive. Unless the electronics are \u201cwaterproofed\u201d, water can short out components, and under certain circumstances, cause components to burn up. In some cases, the equipment that has been contaminated by water can be dried out by immersing them in some highly absorptive media, like rice, with no ill effects. ",

            "answer_text": "Not necessarily. Water by itself does not conduct electricity. If the liquid has any electrolyte in it the conductivity could cause circuits to fry in a powered-on device. But say dropping your cell phone into the toilet will probably not damage it. ",
