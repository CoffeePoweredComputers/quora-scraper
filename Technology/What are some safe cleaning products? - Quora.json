Coli. \u201cA single gram of human feces\u2014which is about the weight of a paper clip\u2014can contain one trillion germs About 1.8 million children under the age of 5 die each year from diarrheal diseases and pneumonia, the top two killers of young children around the world 8. It's Not Just Beards \u2014 the Whole World Is Covered in Poop \u201cThe Journal of Applied Microbiology, co-authored by Gerba, examined the kitchens and bathrooms of 14 homes over 30 week. \u201c The results were about the opposite of what you might expect:\u201cThe highest concentrations of faecal coliforms \u2026 were found in the sponge/ dishcloth and in the kitchen sink drain area while the lowest concentrations were found on the bathroom counter top, on the bathroom floor and on the toilet seat,\u201d the authors write. Also, the cutting board you use to prepare your beautiful, Instagram-worthy meals is likely filthy, too. Gerba has said the cutting boards he\u2019s tested have, on average, about twice as much fecal bacteria as what\u2019s found on toilet seats.\u201d your phone is pretty gross: A recent study from London School of Hygiene &Tropical Medicine researchers found fecal matter on one in six cellphones they swabbed. That same study found fecal bacteria on 16 percent of the 390 hands tested. \u201cThere\u2019s about a tenth of a gram of poop in the average pair of underwear,\u201d Gerba once told ABC News\u201d \u201cThere are 99.000 deaths each year in USA from HAI. and one in two women gets UTI. \u201d \u201cIn the presence of an antimicrobial, microbes are either killed or, if they carry resistance genes, survive. These survivors will replicate, and their progeny will quickly become the dominant type throughout the microbial population.\u201d The more the microbes are the bigger the chances for them to develop drug resistance.

            "answer_text": "Safe cleaning products are rare to find these days. So many claim to be safe and toxic-free, while others truly are. One thing to consider when buying a true safe and toxic-free cleaning product is does it actually work? I have slowly switched out all my cleaning products based on a few different rationales (reasons!): Alkylphenols: Found in most detergents and cleaners - linked to breast cancer Phthalates: Found in air fresheners, household cleaners, and plastics. Linked to endocrine cancer. Benzene - found in most cleaners and linked to blood diseases Styrene - Found in most household cleaners - linked to cancer, organ toxicity, reproduction defects I could go on and on. Bottom line is this: Most products you buy from the grocery store contains one or more of these chemicals. Unfortunately the list goes on and on. So to answer your question: What are safe cleaning products? I recommend products that do NOT require a child proof cap. Research based and studied to ensure they are safe. I have actually demonstrated a few of the products I use for people and have drank a small portion to show they are not harmful. I can\u2019t disclose the product names here, however I can introduce you to America\u2019s Best Kept Secret at any time. Over 400 products, all cleaning products are plant-based, toxic free, concentrated to save plastic containers going into the environment and are cost neutral to what you currently put in your homes. I hope this helps and I am happy to hear you want to make your home safer!! ",
