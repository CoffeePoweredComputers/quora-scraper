            "answer_text": "Happiness has been an interest of mine for many years, as from an early age I was clear that it was my ultimate goal in life. The interesting part comes when one tries to achieve this goal, how on earth can we attain happiness?  As you can imagine, there has been a lot of interest in this in psychology circles and they have come up with some fascinating results.  I'm not going to list reams of research but the main take-aways for me were that happiness does not increase with the acquisition of wealth after a certain level of income, this has been widely reported.  It's also interesting that the way people spend money affects their happiness, spending it on experiences rather than possessions is much more beneficial.  Perception has a huge impact on happiness; being grateful for what you have, being able to recognise positives and concentrate on them instead of dwelling on negatives is important. Thinking other people are better off than you based on completely false assumptions is also very unhelpful, everybody has problems.  Having resilience is also important, knowing that sometimes things can and will go wrong and having the tools to deal with it is massively important, alas many people seriously lack these skills and seem in no hurry to develop them.  Physical resilience is also important, being able to complete difficult physical challenges is hugely rewarding as anybody who has done it will tell you, however, it also imbides the person with an inner strength which can be called upon when needed.  Having loving family and or friends is also very important as it provides a safe base from which to explore the world. All of my happiest memories have been when I have been surrounded by family and friends, and of course it's important to acknowledge this, both to yourself and to your family/friends. Reaching out to people regularly and letting them know how much you mean to them is beneficial to all parties.  In answer to your question, nothing stands in the way of my happiness, I practice what I have learned over the years and it works! We all have bad days but I know they are fleeting. Wishing to be happy all the time is an impossible dream that will never come true. ",
