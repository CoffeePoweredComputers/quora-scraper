            "answer_text": "Its very wrong to determine megapixels to resolution. A 16MP 1080p camera means\u2026a kid with a big eye. He can see clearly with 16MP eye but with less details into mind \u2026 I mean saved as less detailed video saved into memory. An 8MP 4k camera means a Hollywood iMax 7D movie will be shot in an 8MP 4K camera. It means a regular size eye with very high resolution and memory saved like an adult. Now coming to the point\u2026 simply goto camera settings and you will see 16:9 with less resolution and 4:3 ratio with high resolution. That higher resolution is your camera's maximum resolution. ",
