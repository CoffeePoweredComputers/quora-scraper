            "answer_text": "God has given us enough things with which we can live a peaceful life and comfortable life, still we go to make our lives better. Gadgets have become  very important part of our lives nowadays.  During the past few years, technology has evolved in many ways and is  probably without a doubt better than ever before. People are always  trying to find something new that will improve our lives dramatically.  Some of the creations that have really changed our lives are the  computer, telephone, internet and electronic mail, television, cell  phone and voice mail. Everything has a positive and a negative effect on  our lives and so does technology. Technology may be very helpful but it  can sometimes be very harmful. Take a look at one of the positive effect of mobile phones in our lives: Earlier:   Now:  Nowadays its not limited to just calling, with the invention of Internet, we have features like Navigation:   Instant Messaging:  Lifestyles:  and many more... Now along with this, we can have gadgets like vacuum cleaners, washing machines, hair dryers, massagers, treadmills, lifeline cycles, refrigerators, laptops, smart TVs, smartphones, earphones, binoculars and many more. Gadgets are not limited to these daily usage devices, we have technologies in various fields too. In scientific and research fields, we have gadgets like Intelligent machines, IR sensors, simulators, satellites, PMUs(phasor measurement units), Large centrifugation machines, spectrophotometers etc.In defense, we have auto tracking missiles, spy trackers, night vision weapons, drones, laser guns etc. All these have helped a lot to frame our life in present and future and will continue doing so. But as we know happiness and sorrows follows each other, gadgets have made our life somewhat complex, lethargic and addictive. Addictions:It is easy to become addicted to gaming, texting, talking on the phone or socializing online. Some students may  attempt to do this in class, which disrupts their learning, and at home  it detracts from study time. Kids putting in long hours on their gadgets  will give less attention to assignments and may be irritable when they  are away from their gadgets. They might also sleep less, which can slow  down their thinking the next day. Creativity:In the past, children  and young people filled up their free time by reading books,  socializing, or engaging in active, creative play. A fixation on gadgets  reduces participation in of all these, especially the aspect of  creativity. Digital worlds can be vast, but they are always structured,  not requiring the imagination and inventiveness of unstructured play.  Some children become less creative and less able to entertain  themselves. Health:Persistent use of  high-tech gadgetry can lead to a slew of health problems for young and  old alike. A sedentary lifestyle discourages exercise and encourages  obesity. The back-lit screens used for computers, iPhones and video  games can cause eye problems. Walking around everywhere with music  blaring directly into your ears brings on headaches and hearing  difficulties. The net effect of all these things, plus the pressure of  immediate responses to everything, can become stressful. Our Brain: Technology use changes  our brains and not always for the better. Just thinking about doing  something --- such as performing an action in a video game --- affects  your brain nearly as strongly as actually doing it. There is  circumstantial evidence linking a rise in Attention Deficit Disorder  with increased use of video games, causing many scientists to worry that  children may do permanent harm to their brains by spending too much  time interacting with such gadgets. Still we can make our life a balanced one by appropriate use of gadgets.We should know our needs and requirements before using a gadget and can make our life a more comfortable and balanced one.  ",

            "answer_text": "It is human nature to value things that are hard to get. Gadgets have enabled us to get information in a few seconds, which has reduced our interest in getting information. What to know the score of your favourite team? There's a gadget for it. Want to know how to cook anything in the world? Same gadget can come in handy. Want to track how much you walk, run, or jog? A gadget on your wrist will do the job. Coming to their importance, if you own a gadget and use it almost daily, you can't imagine how would you get your stuff done had that gadget not been there in your reach. Most probably, the answer to this would be- by using another gadget. This is how important gadgets are for us, or have now become.  But the downside being the value of services they provide is no longer equal to what it was before we had a gadget to get that. For example, we can see the whether forecast of any place in the world for next 30 days just by Googling it. How easy it is. If a person from 1950s came into 2018 and saw what we can do with a device in our pockets, they would be dumbstruck, but after realising what we actually do with it, the person would literally laugh in his head. PS- I am writing this using my phone and the reader will probably see this on his/her phone or tablet or phone or laptop or personal computer. ",
