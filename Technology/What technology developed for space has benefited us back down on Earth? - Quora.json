            "answer_text": "It is so numerous it is impossible to list them all. The technology that's in your smartphone and in your computers was developed in large part because of technology of obtained in the space race. The use of transistors instead of vacuum tubes in our Electronics. Everything about your technological life meaning your car, your watch, your eyeglasses and their lenses and frames, memory foam on your bed or in your shoes are all suchapplications. If you have a professional job in your using Analytics, the breakthroughs in analytics was largely done for our space missions. How your internal combustion engine has actually changed for your car, the way cars are now climate controlled, and streamlined electrical wiring are very complex systems all come from breakthroughs with various space stations in space shuttles. The use of semiconductors, superconductors , super fluids, farming medicine, mathematics, chemistry, biology, biochemistry, physics, engineering oh, and I was to the other things have all benefited from space exploration. I remember it one time no part of the US government had a better return on investment than the space program. I believe it was something like for every dollar spent in space exploration $20 comes back to the US economy. Our entire modern existence can be credited to two things: space sciences and Nikola Tesla. Before some mental midget decides to come in here and try to be cute I wasn't meaning that Nikola Tesla was part of the space race. I am well aware of when Tesla died but his impact on Modern civilization cannot be in any way shape or form exaggerated. ",

            "answer_text": "Anything that travels in space transcends Earth. So, everyone on Earth sees the effects equally. Now rockets impart momentum at a certain cost. As that cost falls, the ability to maintain a mass flow rate between different points of the cosmos and Earth\u2019s surface is reduced in cost. That then opens various markets at various locations throughout the solar system. So, as rockets developed throughout the opening years of the space age we saw the following developments; Small suborbital rockets - V2 - Intercontinental Ballistic Missile (ICBM) - Mutual Assured Destruction (MAD) - End of global warfare.Moderate orbiting rockets - R7 - Sputnik - Communications Satellite - Global business, Internet.Large lunar rockets - Saturn V - Apollo - View of Earth from the Moon - Environmental Movement, Gaia Hypothesis, Peace Movement.Now, recently SpaceX has developed a rocket that can land and be reflown again. With this rocket SpaceX has increased their profitability and capacity. They are using this increased revenue to make use of all their capacity by putting up an improved wireless communications network as well as building highly reusable rockets. Reusable Rocket - Falcon 9 & Falcon Heavy - low cost access to spaceStarLink - Global Wireless Hotspot - make $1.45 trillion per year from 6 billion wireless users. Grow to $3.68 trillion per year as 15 billion wireless users access internet.BFR Spaceship - Very low cost space accessEarth to Earth transport - replace 31,000 airplanes with 3600 rockets to transport 4.5 billion peopleSpace TourismDepopulation of Earth - population grows by 1.15% per year - 6.00% per year decide to live off world. Fewer than 100 million on Earth in 50 years.Solar Power Satellite - end the use of fossil fuels and nuclear powerSpace Mining - close mines and major manufacturing on EarthLaser Light Craft - 90 million ballistic drones replace 1.4 billion automobiles.",
