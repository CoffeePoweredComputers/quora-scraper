            "answer_text": "One hundred years ago, technology was getting more traction in comparison with the preceding century. Humanity was on the eve of third industrial revolution which resulted in an enormous abundance of wealth. From a social perspective not everyone benefited from the mass production but the inequality was far less than today. The introduction of insulin, penicillin, vaccination against polio, and better sanitation have caused the life expectancy at birth to reach an average of 71 in 2016 compared to 48 in 1916. The commercialization of household appliances, automobile, telephone, radio and television have totally changed our lives. A radical invention like transistor has revolutionized the electronic industry and so far the prediction of the Moore\u2019s Law has proven to be accurate.The invention of computers has permitted the exploration of space including the landing on the Moon in 1969. The internet (ARPANET), the world wide web came in existence respectively in 1983 and 1991. The social media emerged at the turn of the current millennium. The current Digital Revolution is the base of the Fourth industrial Revolution with enormous socioeconomic implications. Technology is unstoppable and its future is unpredictable. It is my hope that wisdom will remain our main guiding principle in the development of future technologies. ",

            "answer_text": "In was 1918. Cars were just beginning to catch on with \u201cnormal people\u201d and for most people the only way to hear music was if there was a musician around to play live, or a player piano, radio was not yet common. The \u201chigh tech\u201d stuff was airplanes. Ok that and military submarines but most people never saw on of those. The Titanic was the height of ship building before it sank 6 year ago. It was a time a rapid technological change, In a few years there would be airline travel but not yet. Lindberg had not yet flown across the Atlantic and for most people airplanes were something you watched other people fly in airshows. Not everyone had electricity, electric lights, cars, Refrigerators, radio and phonographs. These things existed but had not spread especially to rural areas. It was still a \u201cbig deal\u201d to graduate from High School, less then 20% of the population had that much education. Yes 80% did not even finish high school. But for the most part the US was still a place where a man with a 6th or 8th grade education could support a family by working on a farm or factory. In science Albert Einstein had published his revolutionary paper only a decade ago and the effects were still new. ",
