            "answer_text": "Reverse your question-- how do you make STEM interesting for your kids?  The notion that we need to 'mold' our youth to 'like STEM' (whatever that means) is misguided and likely to result in failure.  What we can do, however, is make STEM-related stuff really compelling for them.   Invent a simple solution to problem that your kids are interested in.  Or just show them how to install a light switch or build a bookcase.Have them remix hip-hop music using Python or Javascript (earsketch.gatech.edu)Buy a Makey-Makey on Amazon and build a game controller from apples and bananas.Go on a nature walk.Play tetris (a natural way to improve spatial reasoning skills)Do a puzzle together. (Logic, crossword, jigsaw, anything that triggers reasoning skills)Play an instrument (newsflash: mostly math + science, layered with some artistry and expression)Bake a cake. Talk about measurement and fractions.  Talk about chemical changes and heat transfer.  Think about using different tools and materials for decorating it. Not all of the above activities will engage all kids, but at least one of them probably will.  'STEM' is not one-size-fits-all.  It's a valuable set of tools from which people can draw upon to make the world a better place.   ",
