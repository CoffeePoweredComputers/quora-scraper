            "answer_text": "While I can\u2019t confirm this with any documentation, I will go out on an educated limb and say, no. Even looking at some of the Qi charging devices from Mophie and similar products won\u2019t even allow their wireless chargers to be used while plugged into a USB port on your computer because of insufficient power output. The watch requires very little power in comparison to a phone, so it makes sense that the charger itself, assuming it could actually get a solid connection (ever notice that the charging side of the watch cable curves in?). Now, the newer charging devices that support the iPhone 8/X will absolutely charge the Apple Watch. Having too much power is better than not enough. I have the Apple Watch (the 1st gen) and my iPhone X is coming on Nov. 3rd, so I\u2019ve been looking into all this wireless charging. I\u2019ll likely get the new Mophie charger that supports 7.5W fast charging, shown here:  It will support anything with the Qi wireless charging standard, but looks to be better than some of the older gen stuff that doesn\u2019t charge as fast. That said, when Apple releases the new PowerMat, you can bet that I\u2019ll get it. How awesome it will be to have one place to wirelessly charge my iPhone X, AirPods (with the new case, of course), and my watch. My advice? Don\u2019t skimp on wireless charging gear \u2014 get it from a reputable manufacturer. The last thing you want is to degrade your battery life from a cheap, poor power source. ",

            "answer_text": "Thanks for the A2A, Unlikely. People have attempted to charge other Qi devices on the watch charger over the years and it hasn\u2019t worked. They have also attempted to charge the series 0/1/2 watch on Qi chargers and it normally doesn\u2019t work, but once in a while something happens and they charge for a little bit which implies Qi and what watch charger uses are close but not close enough. The series 3 watch might charge on a Qi charger though, it works with \u201csome\u201d of them (and fairly consistently, unlike the prior watches, so if you find one it works with it more or less keeps working). However I don\u2019t think it would actually be more convenient to use a Qi charger with the watch, the little magnetic one that comes with the watch sticks to it and makes it hard to come loose by accident (and it still has 2 times over ~3 years for me!). I don\u2019t think one without that magnet would be as good. Also most Qi chargers are physically large enough that you would need to remove the watch strap (at least if it is a loop style). That\u2019s why I\u2019m not excited about Apple\u2019s unreleased \u201cAirPower\u201d product. I reserve the right to change my mind, but at the moment I\u2019m thinking \u201cMeh\u201d, and spending what Apple charges on a \u201cMeh\u201d product is unlikely. ",
