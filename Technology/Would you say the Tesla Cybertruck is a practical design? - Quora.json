            "answer_text": "As a daily driver, very practical. As a hauler, less so. The reasons I haven\u2019t purchased a Tesla before were size, practicality, and price/value. I have three kids; two teenagers and one that\u2019s about to be. My 15 year old son is about an inch taller than me now. We take road trips often. I\u2019m not willing to pay more money for a car where I\u2019d have to stuff the kids three across like sardines and waste time charging when there are vehicle choices out there that are a better fit at less than half the price. The Cybertruck is the first Tesla vehicle that would actually work for me without compromising anything. It\u2019s priced right \u2014 I don\u2019t finance cars, and the advertised configurations are numbers I would be willing to write a check for. It looks like everyone would fit comfortably. The high-end model has enough range that I could go between my NJ and TN houses with only one charging stop. As a passenger vehicle, it checks all the boxes. As a truck? Probably not. I have a diesel RAM 3500 dually. It\u2019s used to haul my Jeep, ATV\u2019s, and soon a fifth wheel RV. Heavy things like that are going to decimate the range. Between the weight and the wind resistance, I expect the range will be cut almost in half, which immediately makes it impractical for distance towing. When I\u2019m traveling 1,000+ miles, I\u2019m not going to make my trip time even longer by having to make extra stops to charge. None of the charging stations that currently exist have room for trucks with trailers anyway, which means I would have to find a place to drop the trailer, disconnect everything, go waste time charging, then go hook it all back up. Forget that. I\u2019d rather keep my diesel, which I fill up at truck stops in under five minutes. Perhaps ironically, I would consider it a viable replacement for the family vehicle, but I wouldn\u2019t consider it as a replacement for my truck.  Thanks for reading.

            "answer_text": "I can only speak for my own current needs, but I will use a practical example of what I have seen this week during my work day. Now, I live in rural Victoria in Australia. So I\u2019m not doing some 20km commute to work each day. And neither are many of the people I work with. Wednesday: I didn\u2019t need to take my trailer, so the 200km round trip was not a problem range wise. How much the 500kg of supplies and tools might have effected that is an interesting question, but from my understanding once again, not to much of a problem for the longer range model. Unloading those tools from the rear tailgate isn\u2019t much of a problem. So on THAT day, at least useable. Parked immediately next to me on site was a FWD with two LARGE tool boxes in the tray. The sloped sides of the \u201cCybertruck\u201d tray would make this configuration inconvenient, if not impossible to use. I see this sort of configuration on a regular basis, and once again, we are talking 500\u2013600kg of tools and tool boxes on that vehicle. Parked out of the way at the top end of the site was the large AWD that brought the Kanga excavator on site, that's a 2500kg trailer and equipment. Plus supplies in the back of his vehicle. That vehicle had a 300km round trip on Wednesday, or there about, Probably outside the Range of even the top range \u201cCyberTruck\u201d, Though it CAN tow that amount, there is very little info on how FAR it can tow it. Evidence from online trials show E.V.s do not really do THAT well distance wise towing. One particular trial with a model X showed towing a trailer reduced the theoretical range to 30%, and actual practical range failed to live up to that. One other vehicle attending the site had heavy duty equipment racks custom built into his tray and as part of that, over head roof racks. All loaded with concrete forms, supplies, and reo. Seeing as tesla are NOT a fan of people modifying their vehicles, and it\u2019s doubtful they will produce a vehicle with this built in, this would make the choice of a \u201cCybertruck\u201d in this application unlikely. I suppose you could argue that instead of using the tray, you could tow a trailer, But see above, E.V.s are not that great at towing, and this is an VERY un-aerodynamic load. And though it\u2019s not a major inconvenience towing a trailer, it is still an inconvenience compared to having everything loaded on the back. Now, Another problem, That's four vehicles on site at once. Many building sites have limited power access points. Even IF there where enough extra points for ALL those vehicles to plug in at once, we are talking about a standard 15A plug here, it will take considerable time for something like a \u201cCybertruck\u201d to charge on those. PLUS, Who is going to pay for the power? These are not uncommon configurations or uses for vehicles of this type. I regularly travel 200km PLUS each day up an down the Monash freeway, a very busy route from the eastern suburbs of Melbourne. Many of the vehicle I commonly see on the road are trade vehicles and farm vehicles. In this application, NO the \u201cCybertruck\u201d is not a practical vehicle. Even though from what I have seen online, certain people think it might be, I don't think in this instance they are REALLY being very practical and need to think a bit more about how people might use something labelled a \u201cTruck\u201d. That's NOT to say that it\u2019s a totally useless vehicle there are applications where it would be a suitable compromise for an I.C.E. vehicle. It\u2019s just definitely NOT practical for anywhere NEAR all the applications of a \u201cTruck\u201d. ",
