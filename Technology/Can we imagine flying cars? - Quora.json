            "answer_text": "Yeah, I can imagine flying cars, but hopefully that can only be operated in an automated mode with collision avoidance technology built in. I just can imagine allowing people who are already challenged while driving in a 2 dimensional environment being let loose in an uncontrolled 3 dimensional environment. Even those of us on the ground wouldn\u2019t be safe with all the stuff that would fall out of the sky. ",

Of that group a tiny number who might consider one. Of that group few could actually use one. Why? Go watch a helicopter land or take off. Bet it's noisy. So will a flying car. As noisy as a subway train. Yeah your neighbours will love that. Really. ",
