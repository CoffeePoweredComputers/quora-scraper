            "answer_text": "Consider your YouTube channel as your baby that your have to feed and nurture. It will take at least 2\u20133 years before you see positive results. Now, do the following. Although i cannot guarantee your success, but there is a good chance that you could be successful if you do the following things: Create interesting/informative/creative videos. Without good content i.e content people love, you will get nowhere. Take your time making a video. A single video per year with a million views is much better than daily videos which gain less than 100 views.Find out a niche which you love and focus ONLY on that niche. Do not create a channel of a niche that you don\u2019t love, otherwise you will feel bored to make videos because creating and nurturing a channel takes serious time.Give a good video title so that people can search for your content and find it. Also give a good video description as well as a captivating thumbnail.Try to upload at the same time always i.e upload consistently.Never ever, EVER buy views,subscribers or even do sub4sub. Your channel may or may not get banned but it\u2019s no use other than waste of time, trust me.Use good quality microphone i.e your voice should be audible. In the beginning, you can get away with only your mobile, but as time passes, invest in a camera and microphone.Do not make shaky videos. People will have dizziness while watching the videos. If you can afford to buy a gimbal, buy one. Else, try not to shake your videos much.Shoot your videos from different angles. Learn how to make a good video by taking different angle shots from YouTube tutorials.Instead of just uploading a video with some music, APPEAR in your videos and say something. It\u2019s very important to keep a personal touch with your viewers.These are all i could think of right now. Feel free to contact me if you need any more advice. BTW, i gained 1000 subs and 4000 watch hours in around 11 months of creation of my channel. Hello, I am Abhinash and I have just started out as a YouTuber. Search for \u201cTHE INDIAN NOMAD\u201d in YouTube. It\u2019s a channel dedicated to Budget Travel, Currency and Visa. You can also get my channel\u2019s link in my Bio and Credential. In case you find my videos entertaining or informative, do show your support by SUBSCRIBING to my channel. Thanks in advance! ",

            "answer_text": "1. Ask your viewers to subscribe I told you we\u2019re starting with the easiest ones first. Sometimes your audience just needs to be reminded. The big red subscribe button is omnipresent, but you might also want to point out the bell beside it that turns on notifications for your new videos. Simple. Does this tip seem too salesy to you? This is your reminder that you\u2019ve got valuable content, and you\u2019re just making it easier for them to keep up with the work you do. If you\u2019re already doing this, remember to demonstrate why your channel is worth subscribing to. And make sure you do it right when they love you the most (e.g., right after you\u2019ve provided new and useful information, or you\u2019ve made them laugh). Don\u2019t do it too much, or you\u2019ll risk turning people off. 2. End your videos by mentioning the one you\u2019re working on next Subscribing to a YouTube channel is an act of anticipation. Viewers who\u2019ve just seen what your brand is about are primed to want more, if you\u2019ve done your job right. Hyping your next video, and making it clear why it\u2019s not to be missed, is the most organic way to encourage people to tap subscribe. Of course, this requires having a good handle on your content schedule, and knowing what\u2019s coming next. (More on that soon.) 3. Interact with your audience and make friends If you form relationships with your viewers, they\u2019re more likely to want to keep watching your work. Respond to comments. Follow their channels back. Yes, it\u2019s exciting if a famous YouTuber comments on your video, but who knows who\u2019ll be famous next year. Form a community of peers and promote each other. (Yes, I\u2019m talking about shine theory.) Also, once you\u2019re plugged in, your audience will provide you with plenty of free content ideas for your next video. Don\u2019t worry, you don\u2019t have to take all of them. Manage your YouTube presence using Hootsuite and not only can you upload and schedule videos, you can also add comment streams to your dashboard. That makes it easy to review, reply, and/or moderate comments on all your videos from one place. 4. Update your channel art Your YouTube banner welcomes everyone who clicks over to check out your channel. Maybe they just watched a video and are looking for more. Maybe they\u2019re a potential subscriber. Put your best foot forward. Your banner needs to be clean, on-brand, compelling, and\u2014this is the fussy part\u2014optimized for all devices. You don\u2019t want important details covered up by your social media buttons, for instance. We have a handy guide for creating your own YouTube channel art, along with free templates with the most up-to-date dimensions. 5. Brand your thumbnails A thumbnail is a 1280 x 720px still image that acts as a cover for your video. And they are also your first, best chance to persuade people to click on your video. (Aside from your video titles, that is, but more on that later.) While some might advocate using the most \u201ceye-catching\u201d design (which seems to mean screaming red capslock over a man\u2019s shocked face and a picture of a\u2026 tomato?), one size does not fit all on YouTube. But we aren\u2019t here to earn cold views. To convert a viewer into a subscriber, take a look at your videos page. What does a new viewer see? Sleek, professional and consistent videos that imply an ongoing commitment to quality? Or a random mish-mash competing for attention? You want to aim for consistent branding in all your thumbnails. Use the same font, the same colour palette, or even the same frame composition so people know (at least subconsciously) that they\u2019re looking at a video from your channel. For instance, John Plant has built his survivalist Primitive Technology channel up to 9.9 million subscribers with understated, minimalist thumbnails. They\u2019re not loud, but they are consistent. And most importantly, they\u2019re clickable.  6. Embed your videos on your website or blog This one is win-win, because embedding video on your website may well help your site\u2019s search rankings with the Google algorithm. And as far as YouTube subscribers go, you\u2019re presenting your video right where the people most likely to care about it are already looking. 7. Use YouTube\u2019s clickable tools in your videos YouTube killed annotations a few years back, and good riddance. Pop-ups are one 90s throwback we\u2019re all better off without. That said, YouTube has some other, less annoying, tools for you to use: End screens: these are still images at the end of your video where you can remind people to subscribe, or insert another call to action, before YouTube\u2019s algorithm moves them on to the next video.Branding watermarks: this is an extra subscribe button that will hover over your video throughout, even in full screen. Like so:8. Think in terms of playlists Playlists are a great way to increase your channel\u2019s watch time. They also motivate people to click subscribe by lining up your best content in one place. (Or your related content, in several places.) Epicurious, for instance, treats their YouTube playlists like TV series. It\u2019s very bingeable and if, at the end, people want to be notified when there are new videos, they will subscribe.  Meanwhile, LEGO uses playlists more loosely, adding videos to relevant playlists by topic (i.e., all the Minecraft-inspired videos go in one; all the Star Wars videos in another.)  9. Run a contest If you want a short-term bump in engagement, or just feel like you\u2019ve been languishing in a subscriber count plateau, check out our guide to running a YouTube contest. Key steps include choosing a prize that matters to your audience, and asking viewers to subscribe and turn on notifications in order to participate. 10. Celebrate your subscriber milestones Everyone loves a round number. Celebrate them and thank the people who got you there. For inspiration, here is a video with reactions for every single milestone you could possibly ever hit. Bonus: Download a free guide that reveals the exact steps one creator took to gain more than 23,000,000 views on YouTube with no budget and no expensive gear.  11. Release videos on a consistent schedule Many experts confidently cite a rule-of-thumb as to how often creators should post video to their channels. For instance: one video a week to start, increasing to 3-4 week as your channel grows. The theory is that more videos = more watch time from viewers. But prioritizing quantity over quality has drawbacks. If your goal is to convert viewers to subscribers, you need to focus on quality first, and consistency next. (Then you can start worrying about quantity.) If you upload videos consistently, then people know that more good content is coming, and they\u2019re more likely to tap subscribe. You can also use a social media management platform like Hootsuite to schedule your videos on YouTube for publishing later. 12. Entice your audience over from other social media channels This means cross-promoting on Twitter, Instagram, Pinterest, Facebook\u2014wherever you have a community of fans established. This can be as simple as encouraging people to check out your YouTube channel in your Instagram or Twitter bio. Please consider subscribing to my channel also All In one dose ",

            "answer_text": "I\u2019m telling you now, nothing comes easy with YouTube nowadays. But can you possibly reach 1000 Subscribers? DEFINITELY. Here are a few tips I can share with you to get more Subscribers on your channel. Make your channel look professional - The way your channel looks can make or break the success of your video, so be sure it adds to the allure! Create a catchy channel name and add channel art to get things started. Add a short description to your channel to give viewers a glimpse of the kind of content you\u2019re offering.2. Always add Tags on your videos - This part is important. Without the right tags, no one\u2019s going to find your videos. When you upload a video to your channel, choose tags that are descriptive and specific. You don\u2019t want to use the exact same tags as everyone else, because your video will get buried that way. 3. Offer something to your viewers - If you look through the most popular YouTube videos, you\u2019ll see that each one offers something interesting. Some offer amazing music, others offer thoughtful advice, and still others offer a few minutes of hilarious entertainment. What are you going to offer to people watching your video? Keep this in mind with every video you make. Keep in mind that this is just a jumpstart for your YouTube goal. Just be consistent and keep your drive high to achieve your goals. You can learn more about this from reading this blog that I found on the internet. Good luck! ",

If you just started your youtube channel,then there are many ways to gain subscribers.You should ask your friends to share your channel link. Keep looking for groups\u2026either on facebook or any other social media to find people who really need to know about your channel. Suppose you started a cook channel, then people who want to learn cooking or are interested in cooking should know about your channel. But just gaining subscribers is not enough to grow your channel, you should keep working and uploading as many good videos as possible. Keep making your content nicely, and public will support you and your channel. Furthermore, never share any details of your channel with anyone because security is as important as subscribers. You should also be emotionally prepared to hear accuses and blames because some people will always try to get you down by their words.They will speak very demotivating things but you should not lose hope and keep believing in your dreams. Thanks for reading\u2026 Best of luck ",
