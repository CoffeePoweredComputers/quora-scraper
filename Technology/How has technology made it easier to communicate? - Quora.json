            "answer_text": "well you will get my old fashioned answer, tech has made long distance communication easier but letters or snail mail was something! writing a letter was somehow more meaningful and the waiting for the answer or receiving a letter was a surprise of it s own. Now in the day to day communication with close by people technology hasn't done us any favors. You can observe yourself in restaurant for exemple families sharing a meal but busy texting to someone else on their devices! this is very anti communication. It is easier for people nowadays to text than actually move and go see their friends or relatives, this isn't a very good communication habit. Communicating through texts is totally without feelings or emotions compared to actually go see the person you would want to talk to, spend some time together, share an activity and talk about what needed to be said. So no technology isnt making communication better, i would actually say it made it worse ",
