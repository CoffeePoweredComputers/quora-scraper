            "answer_text": "YES!Smart watches can detect if the person wearing it is asleep. I don't think that there is currently an app for it but the tiny sensors that are being used by the mobile industry can indeed help to conclude if a person is sleeping or not. Accelerometer-As its name implies, it measures the acceleration that the sensor is experiencing relative to freefall.If we move it in anydirection and data from this sensor will spike, but leave it still and it will go flat. Data from this sensor can be an important factor to determine if the person is asleep. Gyroscope-The gyroscope is a sensor that can provide orientation information as well, but with greater precision. Heart rate monitor-Debuted with the Samsung Galaxy S5, this sensor can detect the heart rate of the person and the data from this sensor can play a major role in determining if the person is asleep. Light sensor-It is a sensor that measures how brightthe ambient light is. The device's software uses thisdata to adjust the display's brightness automatically. And as we know, people normally sleep with little or no light in their rooms, the data from this sensor can also be useful. ",

            "answer_text": "It has a number of sensors that can monitor your heart rate, and in particular movement. However despite a lot of research these devices are pretty inaccurate. They can be affected for example by someone moving next to you, or movement resulting from heavy snoring or apnea events. There is evidence in fact from a number of researchers that these monitors can do more harm than good. For example research at the Rush Medical Center in Chicago, reported in the Journal of Sleep Medicine, cautioned the use of sleep monitoring wearables for two reasons. First, despite their inherent inaccuracy, users believed their data above that of professional sleep monitors; even when they were experiencing good sleep, they would believe that they were not, if the wearable said so. Second, the suspect data actually caused anxiety which can make it more difficult to get a good night\u2019s sleep rather than less. And the suspect data are used merely to make recommendations to improve sleep behavior such as don\u2019t drink alcohol or coffee in the evening, keep the bedroom free of computers and smartphones, reduce the room temperature and wear ear-plugs \u2013 hardly earth-shattering insights.

            "answer_text": "I am not some kind of engineer that is going to explain how there are tiny micro bio metric sensors inside the phone, which obviously there are in the most sophisticated smartphones. Still though, how do they do it? Well, based on my own experiences, I have to say it seems quite simple, especially because I and We are on our cell phones until we fall asleep and when we wake up we check them, ahh it\u2019s so simple, they just measure the time between you looking at your phone say when you lock the screen and unlock it again. So now they may not know for certain, that is the app I use that came with my Samsung, it asks me, Hey, where you asleep between 10 pm and 8 am? and it is usually quite accurate. So i say yes or I can adjust the time to the exact times as far as I know. So then it will know based on the pattern also. However, what if I am asleep on my bed with my phone close or even closer?! Does it monitor my movement through its gyroscopic sensors, or monitor my breathing through it\u2019s microphone speakers? Probably all of the above, those are just the ways I can think of that they might be monitoring your sleep, which is a scary thought if you think about it, it knows you as well as you know yourself, possibly better.

Before we jump into the deeper points we should clear on one point that there are some sensors that detect our activity right and anyone could give the answer if he or she has a minimum amount of general knowledge. Technically it is defined as- Smartwatch tracks all our movements s by using an axis-based(tri-axis) motion. This axis-based detection procedure generally detects our motion of acts such as heartbeat, blood pressure, fitness and so on which is also called cartography. But let\u2019s see what are the key points that make us more knowledgable on that topic. What Is The Accuracy Level Of Sleep Detection Of Sleep Detector?\u2026 Continue to reading ",

CPAP (continuous positive air pressure) machines\u2014used to treat heavy snoring and sleep apnea\u2014can record when the subject is sleeping and when they are not.  Of course, they make this determination by monitoring the person's breathing. It may or may not yet be possible to determine this by simply monitoring the pulse. ",
