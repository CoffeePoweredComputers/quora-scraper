            "answer_text": "iPhones are Not Built On a Penny When Apple launched the iPhone, it set out to create a premium smartphone that did not compromise in quality. Having positioned the product in this manner, Apple cannot afford to not use premium components within an iPhone. Setting aside Apple\u2019s huge profit margins, the components inside iPhone still cost a lot more than most Android competitors. Analyst firm IHS iSuppli has calculated the price of components used in smartphones in a detailed manner. To consider a simple example, if a Moto G and an iPhone are compared then aside from the battery, almost every other component of the former costs less than the ones present in the latter. These include the NAND flash, the display, the memory, the interface and the sensors. In fact, some of Moto G\u2019s components cost about half of that of the iPhone. The box contents provided with Moto G also cost much less than those provided with the iPhone. Rough estimates by iSuppli put the components and assembly cost of a Moto G at around $110 while that of an iPhone at around $200. This shows that Apple does have a high manufacturing cost for an iPhone, but it certainly does not explain the final retail cost of it which exceeds $600. The Apple Ecosystem When you purchase the iPhone, you actually buy into the Apple ecosystem that allows access to more than a million apps and features like iMessage, FaceTime and iCloud services that are bundled free. Above everything, there is the proprietary iOS platform and periodic updates and upgrades included with it. The development costs for all these ecosystem elements, especially for the iOS, are woven into the retail price of the device. Such a uniform ecosystem helps in avoiding compatibility conflicts throughout the iPhone and iOS universe. The actual price calculation for this premium ecosystem is difficult to arrive at, but it\u2019s safe to say that the wages of Apple\u2019s software developers, designers and other technical personnel definitely makes its way into the cost of every iPhone. The Apple-nomics Factor Another important factor that adds to the price of the iPhone is the unique economics in play when compared to the Android smartphones. As discussed above, Apple does pay more than the competition to have the iPhones built. Due to this lofty base cost, the supply of iPhones is comparatively lesser than the premium Android competitors. Since the iPhones enjoy an incredible popularity, the demand is tremendously high with respect to the supply quantity. As any economics rookie would understand, low supply plus huge demand equals premium pricing. This is exactly the case with iPhones as the need for these devices compared to their availability is quite steep, leading to an inflated price influenced by this economics. The iBuzz Wave Apple spends a ton of dough on advertising and creating a near persistent buzz around its products. Nowhere is this more prominent than its iOS based devices. It almost always outspends its competition on a yearly basis. Apple has been splendidly successful in creating a rabid following for its products and this following is subject constantly to its iBuzz. The company has been extremely effective in getting its pre-existing customers on board to buy any of its new product launches. This results in a massive sellout as soon as a new product hits the stores. The primary appeal that causes this kind of wildfire is that it\u2019s a one brand product and therefore there is just one release of a new iteration every year. The expense needed to create this near constant buzz to \u2018maintain the herd\u2019, so to speak, gets added into the iPhone\u2019s retail cost. ",

            "answer_text": "Apple's reputation and brand allow it to charge a premium for its high-end products like the iPhone 11 Pro Max. And adding memory or storage to these products increases the cost even more. Because of this \"Apple Tax\" Apple products are often more expensive than its competitors. Creating a higher-quality phone naturally would increase the cost of it. But the fact that Apple can market a phone for $449 and still make a profit shows that they were clearly upping the price because they knew people would pay. Apple product has never been cheap in any country and dramatically the cost of its new gadgets is increasing over time. It has become a symbol of status and only rich class people can afford them. Also, the technology required to manufacture them is very costly. A lot of times you must have wondered why these apple products are so expensive. In this video, you will know the reasons why Apple products are so expensive.  ",

            "answer_text": "Expensive or Cheap is a very relative term. Apple iphones are expensive compared to other phones in the market, but the ones you compare them to, do not do what an Apple iPhone can do.  An iFixit tear down of an Apple product gives you an idea of how much would be the cost of manufacturing. Apple generally charges 60/70% higher than the cost of manufacturing. They probably do that to keep a premium image, to cover R & D costs, marketing, advertising, logistics and channel costs & of course their own profit. Most of their competitors keep a high price & then keep cutting the prices toUnbelievable levels! The BBZ10 was launched at 40k & it's last price was 17k. Can you imagine the state of those customers that bought it at 40k??! Conversely, a price cut is a rare activity in Apple. Finally Apple does really give you your money's worth in the long term. The seamless user experience achieved by the perfect harmony of hardware & software remains a dream for many companies. This is Apple's powerful trump card which it will continue to play for many years to come. ",

            "answer_text": "Well . Apple has always made premium products that offer a better user experience than other machines thus have a very high research and development cost in comparison to the competitors which is the reason why the products have a premium price however you are paying for a more reliable product which may seem like a drawback in the short run it is well worth the cost as even my 3 year old MacBook Pro retains its value in contrast to a top of the line windows machine from he same period . Lee in mind this is only a small Answer to a very big question . ",
