            "answer_text": " The Airborne Internet is a proposed network in which all nodes would be located in aircraft. The network is intended for use in aviation communications, navigation, and surveillance (CNS) and would also be useful to businesses, private Internet users, and government agencies, especially the military. In time of war, for example, an airborne network might enable military planes to operate without the need for a communications infrastructure on the ground. Such a network could also allow civilian planes to continually monitor each other's positions and flight paths.The nodes would provide air-to-air, surface-to-air, and surface-to-surface communications. The aircraft or blimps would fly at altitudes of around 10 mi (16 km), and would cover regions of about 40 mi (64 km) in radius. Data transfer rates would be on the order of several megabits per second, comparable to those of high-speed cable modem connections.The concept of the Airborne Internet was first proposed at NASA Langley Research Center's Small Aircraft Transportation System (SATS) Planning Conference in 1999.Working of Airborne InternetThree companies are planning to provide high-speed wireless Internet connection by placing aircraft in fixed patterns over hundreds of cities.Angel Technologies is planning an airborne Internet network, called High Altitude Long Operation (HALO), which would use lightweight planes.AeroVironment has teamed up with NASAon a solar-powered, unmanned plane that would work like the HALO network.Sky Station International is planning a similar things using blimps instead of planes.Finally,Airborne Internet,Very much useful in field of aviation services like aircraft monitoring and air traffic management ,weather information etc.Provides passengers to access the Internet at very high altitudes.This new service will be useful for who live in small village (remote places).Source-Airborne internet  ",

            "answer_text": "Let us say for example you are connected to your ISP from a land line, may be a co-axial cable or an ethernet cable or a twisted pair telephone line. These are terestrial version. Airborne would be somethg that carries the connection hardare and infrastructure o a balloon or a zeppelin similar to Hindenberg or a Goodyear Blimp. You would connect to it wirelessly through 4G some such similar protocol and suitable hardware. Thesewould be termed Airborne. These would of course connect to the internet backbone through cables if they are tethered to the ground or through microwave links. ",
