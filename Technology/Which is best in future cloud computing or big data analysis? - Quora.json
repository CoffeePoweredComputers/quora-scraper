            "answer_text": "The best for what? Comparing cloud computing to big data analytics is a bit like comparing apples to oranges. Cloud computing refers to a platform. This platform is often used to access computer facilities, such as data storage, or used to run programs and applications over the internet. Big data analytics refers to the process of understanding large quantities of information. By using specialized software, the data is analyzed for patterns. The data is also organized and structured in a meaningful way. Sometimes, the data is even used to help advance other fields, such as Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. Far from being in competition, cloud computing and big data analytics often work together. A good example is enterprise application software (EAS). This kind of software is developed with the needs of an organization in mind, as opposed to individual users. Because of this, EAS is often deployed using cloud computing. This is to make sure the right people access the right information. EAS also handles the information of organizations, sometimes entire companies or corporations. Big data analytics is used to make sense of the data that large organizations produce on a daily basis. At Tenfold, we want to make sure that people have the information they need before making a decision. We have a whitepaper on Cloud vs. On-Premise Enterprise Solutions. It's available to you at no cost. As we move forward, we must consider our options when it comes to security, cost, and many more. I hope this helped. ",
