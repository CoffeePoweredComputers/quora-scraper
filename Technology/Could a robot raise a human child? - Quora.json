            "answer_text": "As a matter of programming even at the level of AI, a robot is bound by that specific limits established by the programer. Programming will enable the machine to perform basic mechanical tasks like bathing, changing diapers and feeding of an infant. This would take very intensive programming as anyone can tell you an infant can be very unpredictable. Falling off the changing table or coming to harm in the bathtub are obvious bad scenarios requiring instantaneous reflexive reactions. The mechanical issues not withstanding there are far more consequential demands placed those that take on the responsibility of child rearing. The emotional, psychological and social aspects of raising a child can only be approximated through the eyes of the programmer and that narrow, pinpoint set of parameters would be prohibitively restricted. Children need extensive, daily reinforcement of the characteristics that will enable them to perform in the multifaceted and extremely variable conditions of contemporary society. No single set of rules is universally applicable to all social situations. And since societies change and are constantly evolving and devolving the rules are forever in flux. There is also the establishment of discipline and rules where judgements concerning circumstances and conditions define the type and degree of punishment for an infinite number of infractions. As parents we do our best to teach our children basic conducts that are acceptable in the cultures and societies in which we exist. But what about changes and adaptations we have to make when we engage in new or different situations with different rules. Isn't this where most of societies frictions and conflict originate? How would different societies and cultures deal with this in the robot's programming when humans have such a hard time dealing with it emotionally and psychologically as it is? Wouldn't it then be necessary to make every child subject to robotic programming standards that were universally applied? If this were necessary for robots to raise our children, wouldn't our children thus be limited to imitate the program? Another thing a robot may never recognize is the particular human traits of imagination and creativity. How would a robot, having no cognizance of these traits, be able to recognize and encourage their positive expression in children? After consideration of these different aspects and the infinite number of variations possible with each it becomes obvious that unless we wish to raise robots in our own image but sterile in many other aspects of humanity then no robots cannot raise children.

            "answer_text": "Could a robot raise a human child? Good God, NO! A robot even with \u201cAI\u201d isn\u2019t intelligent and knows nothing about human culture or knowledge - that is what a parent teaches a child, and it\u2019s ESPECIALLY the tacit knowledge parts such as how to socialize and deal with other people. That stuff can\u2019t even be written down on paper for one human to teach another; it\u2019s only by emulation and response that children learn it. There were experiments in the 17th century when a Scottish King James IV wanted to know if language was biologically innate. So he arranged to \u201cget some infants\u201d and he had them raised by a deaf-mute woman on an isolated island in order to wait to see if they would spontaneous start speaking English! It ended as horrifically as one might imagine - he only succeeded in creating mute children who became adults who couldn\u2019t speak English but couldn\u2019t even learn ANY language at all and who were unable to interact properly with any other human. Basically they became \u201cferal\u201d children. That\u2019s pretty much what would happen if you tried to use a robot to raise a child: unspeakable immoral disaster!!

            "answer_text": "Not currently, and not likely in the near future. But hypothetically an advanced enough computer, program, robot combination should be able to match any human behaviour. A lot of the most advanced AI demonstrations these days involve nueral net programs where you show the computer examples of what you do and then sort random variants of the neural net program until it produces results closer and closer to what you want. This is kind of analogous to how you teach a child or animal but unlike an animal brain once it has been taught it can be endlessly copied. ",

            "answer_text": "Human parents do the best they can. Sometimes the best is very good. Sometimes it\u2019s very bad. Sometimes it\u2019s extremely bad, as in the case of a father in the news recently who was just convicted of killing his 5 kids. I have no doubt that a robot could have done a better job of parenting than this convicted child killer. But in well over 99% of all cases, a robot could never compete with parents. ",
