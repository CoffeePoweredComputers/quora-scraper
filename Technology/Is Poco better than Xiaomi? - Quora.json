Xiaomi divided into 3 brands or series RedmiMiPocoAll 3 brands have 3 different support communities and i say poco had the best support community , they hear people's voice unlike redmi , mi and even comimg to ads Poco devices won't have any shitty ads and Redmi K series also won't support ads and so as Mi ! Mi had the worst community as they give lots kf bugs with software updates in budget/midrange devices ! (Mi a1 user) Redmi is been worst as they provide shitty 18+ adult content ads !,(,Redmi note 4 , Note 7 pro user) Poco is been the best ! The newly launched poco x2 had superior main sensor , it even beats the camera on K20 pro ! .. Midrange , Value Flagship - 1. Poco , 2. Redmi Flagship - 1. Mi Budget - 1. Redmi ",
