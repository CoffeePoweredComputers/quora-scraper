            "answer_text": "Personally I think that idea is similar to fighting fire with fire. Tech is amazing, it allows us to do great things, but we coped just fine without these things for 3 billion years. Many of our problems stem from technology. Its nice to think that technology might solve the environmental crisis that it lead to. For certain we are now dependent on technology. We are going down a river with a current too strong to turn back. But hopefully one day the river might take us where we want / need to be. ",

            "answer_text": "The technology development itself is not the goal. So as to genuinely take care of huge issues identified with the environment, sanitation, education, destitution and other wellbeing and social issues, a definitive goal must be to change human behavior, mindfulness and states of mind. The role of technology is to serve as an impetus to kick off these changes. ",
