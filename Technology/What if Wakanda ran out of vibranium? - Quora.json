            "answer_text": "This could certainly happen. In the main Marvel Comics universe, the meteor that formed the basis of the Great Mound had almost completely been mined out by the time of Wakanda\u2019s war with Latveria (published in Doomwar, 2010). This isn\u2019t to say that the meteor was small, but rather that Wakanda had gotten extremely good at mining and processing it, transferring all the Vibranium into a vault that held 10,000 tons. It was this vault that was Victor Von Doom\u2019s true goal for invading Wakanda.  Doom is apparently the only genius who knows how to mystically charge Vibranium, possibly because his mask is based off a Vibranium relic given to his Romani ancestors generations ago. To keep him from using this ultimate power, T\u2019Challa destroys all the processed Vibranium in the entire world, rendering it inert, basically turning it into another form of metal that has no special properties.  So what will become of Wakanda? Reed Richards worries that T\u2019Challa has destroyed Wakanda\u2019s economy, Victor Von Doom says he\u2019s destroyed Wakanda\u2019s people.  Shuri, in the right panel, believes he\u2019s saved Wakanda instead. Why? T\u2019Challa chose to destroy the Vibranium in part because he believed that Wakanda had grown too dependent on it, but that Wakanda can be more than Vibranium.  What other resources does Wakanda have? For one thing, its people, a culture and civilization that have thrived and advanced in isolation for centuries, without the devastation wrought by outside invaders and colonizers. In the 20th century, generations of Wakandans have visited the outside world and brought back knowledge and technology as well. T\u2019Challa and the Wakandan throne are financial powerhouses with investments around the globe, numerous patents, etc\u2014many of these patents might depend on Vibranium, of course, but the minds of the inventors and business people and artists of Wakanda do not have to. As David Maynard's answer suggests, Shuri could get interested in using Adamantium resins to do work with an entirely different super-metal! Finally, there\u2019s the land itself: Wakanda is small, but consists of more than the Great Mound. Because Wakanda has tried to remain ecologically sound and sustainable, they\u2019ve continued to practice traditional agriculture, fisheries, and ways of life alongside technological development fueled by Vibranium. None of that was lost when Vibranium was neutralized. In recent years, the Marvel comics universe was shattered and re-assembled during the latest Secret Wars event. In its wake, Wakanda was restored to a previous state, and Vibranium is plentiful once more. Still, the lessons learned in the period in-between were not forgotten: Wakanda is more than just the Black Panther, and Wakanda is more than Vibranium. ",
