            "answer_text": "More complex technology, naturally, makes use of more rarefied physical concepts. GPS satellites, for example, adjust their internal timekeeping to account for the relativistic effects of their motion. Einstein's theory of Special Relativity describes the dilation of time that fast-moving objects experience. Without taking steps to correct for this change in the rate that time passes, GPS coordinates would be inaccurate by an unacceptable factor. In general, physics describes the sort of things that are possible in the universe, and technology is eventually built to do work within the confines physics has discovered. This interplay works in reverse, as well. While early physicists may have been able to articulate basic principles with little more than thought experiments, modern physicists frequently make use of extremely high-tech machines and processes. The Large Hadron Collider in Switzerland, for example, is the world's largest particle accelerator. It operates at higher energies than any previous collider, and it was built explicitly to conduct experiments in particle physics. ",

            "answer_text": "Physics research discovers new things about the natural world. Then the engineer learns about the subject, and invents something using it. The inventions compound. (Electrodynamics itself was discovered by researchers from Coulomb, through Ohm, Oersted, Faraday, Ampere, through Maxwell and Lorentz. Hertz, Edison, Tesla, Bell, etc. discovered new things electricity was good for. Add quantum theory, we got the diode, the transistor, the integrated circuit, and so forth) (As an aside, cranks also emerge from the darkness to claim that the physics discoveries are nonsense, and their own pet theories are the true ones \u2014 even after applications have become numerous.)
