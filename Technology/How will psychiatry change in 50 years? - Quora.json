            "answer_text": "Assuming things remain relatively stable, I think that we will learn more about physical consciousness and how chemicals in the brain interact. This will allow for better treatments for the mentally ill. Right now, it\u2019s still a bit of a dark art, with doctors and patients working over time with different pharmaceuticals. That\u2019s what I needed to do, and am now stable. I\u2019m 56 and it\u2019s taken a good part of my life to accomplish I wouldn\u2019t trade my stability for anything now, but, it would have been nice to have been able to arrive there sooner. ",

Hopefully we will be better able to individualize or medicine treatments, which presently are somewhat hit or miss. We might develop better tools and techniques for psychological learning, or \u201cunlearning\u201d harmful or destructive memories and patterns. We might know more about \u201cconsciousness.\u201d We might have more capability to understand and interact with creatures who have brains that function quite differently than ours. Or, unless Captain Picard saves us, we might all be \u201cassimilated into the hive.\u201d ",
