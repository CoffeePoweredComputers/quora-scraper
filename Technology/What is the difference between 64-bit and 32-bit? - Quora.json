            "answer_text": "OK - layman\u2019s terms\u2026keeping it alarmingly simple and horribly inaccurate! Crudely - a 32 bit computer can access memory using 32 wires that go between the computer chip (the CPU) and the memory chip(s) (the RAM). Each of those wires can carry a \u2018bit\u2019 - that being a zero or a one\u2026binary - right? There are about 4 billion combinations of 32 zeroes and ones - so the CPU has only 4 billion ways to say what data it would like to access. This means that it can only have 4 billion bytes of memory. 4 gigabytes, 4Gbytes for short. There was a time when 4Gbytes was a hell of a lot of memory - but these days, it\u2019s not that much. Video games and large application programs can eat up 4Gbytes without problems. But with only 32 wires\u2026that\u2019s all the memory you can have. Solution? Add more wires of course! Since computers like to do things in powers of two - and nobody wanted to have to do this change more than they have to - the latest computers just doubled the number of wires they could potentially use - giving 64 zeroes and ones that can be used to get data from RAM memory. That allows it to access not 4 billion bytes - but 16 quintiillion bytes! 16 million gigabytes! More memory than 4 billion 32 bit computers! More memory than there is in all of the computers in the entire world. 1024 gigabytes is a \u2018terabyte\u2019 (about how much you have on your hard disk drive\u2026probably) - 1024 terabytes is a petabyte, 1024 petabytes is an exabyte. Nobody is ever going to have 16 exabytes of RAM on one computer\u2026not EVER. This is so much memory that we can be sure that we\u2019ll never need a computer with more bits. Additionally - a 64 bit computer can do arithmetic on 64 bits at a time - so bigger numbers, faster. A 32 bit computer can do that too - but typically, not as fast. ",

            "answer_text": "Whenever you buy an operating system, a software or a game, you probably see 32-bit and 64-bit options available. If you\u2019re a Windows user, you must have noticed that you have two Program Files folders \u2014 one simply \u201cProgram Files\u201d and the other labeled \u201cProgram Files (x86).\u201d This \u201cProgram Files\u201d folder is used for storing the DLL files of 64-bit applications only. The x86 folder is used for storing the DLL files of 32-bit applications. To install a 64-bit version of Windows, you need a CPU that\u2019s capable of running a 64-bit version of Windows. The benefits of using a 64-bit operating system are most apparent when you have a large amount of random access memory (RAM) installed on your computer, typically 4 GB of RAM or more. In such cases, because a 64-bit operating system can handle large amounts of memory more efficiently than a 32-bit operating system, a 64-bit system can be more responsive when running several programs at the same time and switch between them frequently. A computer with a 64-bit processor can have a 64-bit or 32-bit version of an operating system installed. However, with a 32-bit operating system, the 64-bit processor would not run at its full capability. How can 64-bit Processor handle more RAM? The computer system only supports binary counting. There is either 0 or 1. Each one is a considered a \u201cbit.\u201d That means for 1-bit computing, you get two possible values, 2-bit means four values, then at 3 bits, you double that to eight (2\u00b3). Keep going exponentially and you eventually get 32-bit (2 to the 32nd power) worth 4,294,967,296 and 64-bit (or 2 to the 64th power) is worth 18,446,744,073,709,551,616 values. That\u2019s a lot of bits, and the numbers show just how much more powerful a chip that supports higher bit computing can be. It\u2019s a lot more than double. So It\u2019s pretty obvious that 64-bit processor is capable of doing more computing than 32-bit. ",

They\u2019re (mostly) too complicated for a \u201claymans\u2019 definition IMHO, even if technically correct. The simpler highway example showing one vs two lanes (on each side) is better (though maybe too simple), but also misleading IMHO, since it conveys the false impression that 64 is twice as good as 32 (because 64 is twice as large as 32), similar to a 2 lane highway being twice as good as 1 lane. In reality it's not proportional of course (64 bit isn\u2019t like doubling the lanes), which leads to confusion for non-technical people. Basically, a simple explanation for a non-technical person is that a computer stores data in internal storage locations, and that data travels along internal pathways to and from those locations. In a 64 bit computer, there are more of these pathways, like more lanes on a highway (to use that example, though 64 is not twice as good as 32 - it doesn\u2019t work that way), and the locations where the data is headed from/to (generally) have more room as well (greater capacity to store that data), compared to a 32 bit computer (which has fewer pathways and less storage capacity at its internal locations). Everything normally operates faster as a result. It's somewhat (though crudely) similar to you driving down a highway with many more lanes to a mall with a larger parking lot (in a 64 bit machine), compared to a highway with fewer lanes to a mall with a smaller parking lot. It's inherently slower to get there, with (potentially) more delays along the way and when you arrive. Data traveling through a computer has the same problem fundamentally, which is diminished in a 64 bit machine compared to 32 bit. ",

            "answer_text": "32 bit and 64 bit tends to refer to two things: Memory addressing.Big numbers.Basically, the biggest 32-bit number is around 4 billion. That means a 32 bit computer has no concept of a number bigger than that, 5 billion is an alien concept to a 32 bit computer. As humans, we consider that numbers don\u2019t actually end but extend into infinity. Computers don\u2019t and a 32 bit computer thinks that numbers end at about 4 billion. It also means that memory addressing is also limited to about 4 billion bytes, which is 4GB of RAM. A 32 bit OS is simply an Operating System designed for a 32 bit computer. A 64 bit OS is the same thing, but designed for a 64 bit computer, which can understand numbers up to 18,446,744,073,709,551,615. As I am sure you can tell, that\u2019s much more than double 4 billion. That\u2019s because the maximum number for 32 bit is about 4 billion, for 33 bit it\u2019s 8 billion, 34 bit it\u2019s 16 billion. so it just keeps on doubling each bit you add. That doesn\u2019t really make much sense until you think about how binary works, say you\u2019ve got 8 bit: 10101010 That\u2019s 8 bits of information, which means you can have 256 different combinations of 1s and 0s. Now, make it 9 bit, that means you get all those combinations, plus 1 more bit, which can be 1 or 0. That means you can have 256 states with the ninth bit set to 1, and 256 states with the 9th bit set to 0, giving you 512 states, so 8 bit to 9 bit has doubled the highest value. That keeps on going to 4 billion for 32 bits, and 18,446,744,073,709,551,615 for 64 bit. The only real difference between a 32 bit OS and a 64 bit OS is the maximum number that they can comprehend.

            "answer_text": "All the answers I\u2019ve seen so far have focused on the technical aspects, however when I read the question I imagined some regular person standing in the middle of a computer shop, looking at the various products on offer. Some of them are labeled as being 64 bit, and some of them (the old, cheap models that the shop is trying to offload) only 32 bit. So what\u2019s the difference, that person asks? Here, full of generalizations and technical inaccuracies, is my answer to that interpretation of the question. Generally speaking, a 64 bit computer can run more software titles, because it can handle both the 64-bit ones and the 32-bit ones. If you get a 32 bit computer, you\u2019re limited to 32 bit software titles, and more and more things are appearing in 64-bit only form. The future - and much of the present for that matter - is 64 bit.When you run a 64 bit program on a 64 bit computer, it has more memory headroom. If the computer has enough physical memory fitted then this can bring real world benefits in terms of speed and capability for some things like photo editors and basically anything that needs a lot of workspace. For a lot of other stuff it makes no practical difference at all.All other things being equal, 64 bit anything uses more disk and memory space than the equivalent 32 bit version, so if you\u2019re going for a 64 bit computer make sure it has a capacious hard disk and plenty of memory fitted. You won\u2019t see a 32 bit computer with more than 4 GB of memory (RAM); for a 64 bit model I wouldn\u2019t look at anything with less than 8 GB of memory.From the point of view of that totally non-technical dude looking bewildered in the computer shop, that\u2019s about the long and short of it.

How much memory a CPU can access is determined by the size of the address bus, but this has nothing to do at all with whether the PC is described as being 32 bit or 64 bit. This measurement applies to the size of the data bus. A 64 bit PC will have a CPU with a 64 bit data bus. It will move twice as much data in and out of memory as a 32 bit PC in the same amount of time. Similarly a 64 bit CPU will also likely have 64 bit architecture internally. This means its data registers (which hold data within the CPU upon which calculations are carried out) will also be 64 bit. There are some assumptions that can be made from this, such as a 64 bit CPU will on average be quicker than a 32 bit CPU powered by the same clock speed, primarily because it can fetch twice the amount of data out of the memory in a cycle. This answer is a gross simplification of how things work in reality, but gives a brief understanding of the fundamental difference. In short, it is the size of the data bus, and has nothing to do with the address bus or how much memory the CPU can access. ",

            "answer_text": "Differences between a 32-bit and 64-bit CPU A big difference between 32-bit processors and 64-bit processors is the number of calculations per second they can perform, which affects the speed at which they can complete tasks. 64-bit processors can come in dual core, quad core, six core, and eight core versions for home computing. Multiple cores allow for an increased number of calculations per second that can be performed, which can increase the processing power and help make a computer run faster. Software programs that require many calculations to function smoothly can operate faster and more efficiently on the multi-core 64-bit processors, for the most part. Another big difference between 32-bit processors and 64-bit processors is the maximum amount of memory (RAM) that is supported. 32-bit computers support a maximum of 3-4GB of memory, whereas a 64-bit computer can support memory amounts over 4 GB. This feature is important for software programs used in graphic design, engineering, and video editing as these programs have to perform many calculations to render their images. One thing to note is that 3D graphic programs and games do not benefit much, if at all, from switching to a 64-bit computer, unless the program is a 64-bit program. A 32-bit processor is adequate for any program written for a 32-bit processor. In the case of computer games, you'll get a lot more performance by upgrading the video card instead of getting a 64-bit processor. In the end, 64-bit processors are becoming more and more commonplace in home computers. Most manufacturers build computers with 64-bit processors due to cheaper prices and because more users are now using 64-bit operating systems and programs. Computer parts retailers are offering fewer and fewer 32-bit processors and soon may not offer any at all.. I have already answered this on another thread but saw the same thread so answered again.

            "answer_text": "There are several things that change about the architecture of the CPU. I think a good answer to this question depends on who is asking. For a computer user, not a system programmer, what you have to know is that if you have a computer you purchased recently, it is probably 64-bit. You can probably run 32 bit or 64 bit programs, but you should choose 64 if there is an option. If you have a 32 bit system, you will probably not be able to run a 64 bit application. Really, that\u2019s all you need to know. If you are a programmer, you will notice that the size of pointers is increased from four bytes to eight. For the most part, the change in the address width has to do with being able to access more memory. Imagine you have a hypothetical computer with two-bit address space. With two bits, you could address up to four values. |Address | Value |\u00a0(0, 0) -> Value1\u00a0(0, 1) -> Value2\u00a0(1, 0) -> Value3\u00a0(1, 1) -> Value4\u00a0This would be a pretty limited computer, if you could only address four values! However, every bit you add to the address doubles the number of values you can address. |Address | Value |\u00a0(0, 0, 0) -> Value1\u00a0(0, 0, 1) -> Value2\u00a0(0, 1, 0) -> Value3\u00a0(0, 1, 1) -> Value4\u00a0(1, 0, 0) -> Value5\u00a0(1, 0, 1) -> Value6\u00a0(1, 1, 0) -> Value7\u00a0(1, 1, 1) -> Value8\u00a0four bits enables you to address 16 values, with 5 bits, 32, and so on. With a 32 bit address space, a little over four billion values are accessible. This is why the maximum amount of memory that can be addressed on a 32 bit desktop is 4GB. There are lots of other differences between 32 and 64 bit hardware architectures, but I feel memory address space is the most prudent difference. ",

When people say \u201c64-bit processor\u201d, they usually mean a processor that implements the x86-64 instruction set. Compared to previously used x86 instruction sets, x86\u201364 has some powerful additions \u2014 new commands the processor can execute \u2014 that make it possible to handle larger numbers (including larger memory addresses) and often allowing for much better performance. Of course, these advantages only come if you use the new features \u2014 x86\u201364 is still compatible with x86, meaning that you can use the older set of instructions as well. This means that you can write (technically, compile) software that only uses the x86 instruction set \u2014 then it will work on both x86 and x86\u201364; or you can take advantage of the new features, and the software will be faster (and may support handling a lot more memory) \u2014 but then you won\u2019t be able to run it on an older computer. So there you have it \u2014 a 32-bit OS is the one that does only use x86 instruction set. You can run it on both 32-bit and 64-bit computers. A 64-bit OS is the one that uses the full x86\u201364 instruction set, achieving better performance (and being able to handle more memory) \u2014 but you can only run it on a newer 64-bit computer.

To locate more places it would need to divide memory in sections, first step would be to locate the section (ie. the country code) and from that section it would need to locate the specific cell (ie. the telephone number). All I said above is exactly the same for a 64 bit system, only that the numbers the computer works with can be as big as 2^64. ",

            "answer_text": "Differences between a 32-bit and 64-bit CPU A big difference between 32-bit processors and 64-bit processors is the number of calculations per second they can perform, which affects the speed at which they can complete tasks. 64-bit processors can come in dual core, quad core, six core, and eight core versions for home computing. Multiple cores allow for an increased number of calculations per second that can be performed, which can increase the processing power and help make a computer run faster. Software programs that require many calculations to function smoothly can operate faster and more efficiently on the multi-core 64-bit processors, for the most part. Another big difference between 32-bit processors and 64-bit processors is the maximum amount of memory (RAM) that is supported. 32-bit computers support a maximum of 3-4GB of memory, whereas a 64-bit computer can support memory amounts over 4 GB. This feature is important for software programs used in graphic design, engineering, and video editing as these programs have to perform many calculations to render their images. One thing to note is that 3D graphic programs and games do not benefit much, if at all, from switching to a 64-bit computer, unless the program is a 64-bit program. A 32-bit processor is adequate for any program written for a 32-bit processor. In the case of computer games, you'll get a lot more performance by upgrading the video card instead of getting a 64-bit processor. In the end, 64-bit processors are becoming more and more commonplace in home computers. Most manufacturers build computers with 64-bit processors due to cheaper prices and because more users are now using 64-bit operating systems and programs. Computer parts retailers are offering fewer and fewer 32-bit processors and soon may not offer any at all. ",

            "answer_text": "the number of bits is an expression of how wide the word is in the pcu. what is a word? a word is a collection of individual switches that can be either on or off. how we interpret these collections is how we cause calculations and logic to be used in the heart of the machine. the smaller the word the simpler the \u201cthings that can be said to the machine\u201d are. when we had 4 bit machines the words had to be collected together to make meaningful commands. 1+1 would have to be fed to the processor as ADD then no.1 then the second 1 then the EQUALS would be a call to get the result back. That took a number of clock cycles to achieve. Now we can pass the whole equation as an operator and its operands asking for the result in one cycle. The operations can be much larger given the larger number of bits available to carry the information/commands. The other part of the bitness is the width of the data bus, that is the number of bits passed in parallel to the cpu and is the mechanism by which we address the memory of our machines. 4 lines of address bus can address 16 memory locations, 8 bits can address 256, thats (2^8)+1 so 64 bits is (2^64)+1 and thats significantly more than (2^32)+1. there are limits to finite devices and the data bus and word size has a tremendous affect of the abilities of a device to work quickly over a large amount of data. If you want more out of your machinery you need to put more into it. why are you still asking about 64bit ather than asking when the 128 or 256bit machines are coming.Because they are! ",

It is the OS that determines is the CPU used in the 32 bit legacy mode or the 64 bit long mode. If the CPU is in the long mode it cannot use real or virtual86 mode. That means DOS programs cannot be executed without software emulation. In principle 16-bit Windows programs could be executed but Microsoft was chosen not to support then in 64-bit Windows. That means only 64- and 32-bit programs can be used. That is any program written before 1995 will not work. A 32-bit Windows can use 32-bit and 16-bit programs, including DOS programs.

            "answer_text": "In computing, there exist two type processor i.e., 32-bit and 64-bit. These processor tells us how much memory a processor can have access from a CPU register. For instance, A 32-bit system can access 2^32 memory addresses, i.e 4 GB of RAM or physical memory. A 64-bit system can access 2^64 memory addresses, i.e actually 18-Billion GB of RAM. In short, any amount of memory greater than 4 GB can be easily handled by it. Most computers made in the 1990s and early 2000s were 32-bit machines. The CPU register stores memory addresses, which is how the processor accesses data from RAM. One bit in the register can reference an individual byte in memory, so a 32-bit system can address a maximum of 4 GB (4,294,967,296 bytes) of RAM. The actual limit is often less around 3.5 GB, since part of the register is used to store other temporary values besides memory addresses. Most computers released over the past two decades were built on a 32-bit architecture, hence most operating systems were designed to run on a 32-bit processor. A 64-bit register can theoretically reference 18,446,744,073,709,551,616 bytes, or 17,179,869,184 GB (16 exabytes) of memory. This is several million times more than an average workstation would need to access. What\u2019s important is that a 64-bit computer (which means it has a 64-bit processor) can access more than 4 GB of RAM. If a computer has 8 GB of RAM, it better have a 64-bit processor. Otherwise, at least 4 GB of the memory will be inaccessible by the CPU. A major between 32-bit processors and 64-bit processors is the number of calculations per second they can perform, which affects the speed at which they can complete tasks. 64-bit processors can come in dual core, quad core, six core, and eight core versions for home computing.

            "answer_text": "This one is easy. To make it \u201cfor dummies\u201d, we need to get rid of binary notation. Not many non computer scientists understand it. Let's assume computers speak decimal notation, the one we all learn in primary school. Let's make another assumption, instead of 32bit, we call it 2spaces. Wchich means we can only allow 2 spaces for digits. Like this: 01, 02, 03, \u2026 98, 99. Now, if we want to go more than 99 - we can't. Our computer is a \u201c2space\u201d one. The next number would be a 100 which occupies 3 spaces. So what? All computers have memory portions which we call bytes. We put stuff in it. Those memory portions have addressees like a house address. If we want to deliver mail to a house, we need an address, right? So if we want to put stuff in a memory location, we need its address. The above numbers I mentioned, the ones between 01 and 99 are the addresses. So since our computer is a \u201c2space\u201d machine, we can only have up to 99 addressees all together, hence only up to 99 memory locations. Means our town is pretty small with only 99 houses we can deliver mail to. What if more people want to live in the town? Ah, they can live, but they wont have an address, and they wont get any mail. The same with our \u201c2space\u201d computer, we can put more memory, but we can't put stuff in it cos there are no addressees. Then someone said let's make a \u201c3space\u201d computer. Now we can have a whopping 999 addressees and lots more houses can be built, and the mail can be delivered properly. So \u201c2space\u201d machine vs \u201c3space\u201d machine is the difference between a 32bit computer and a 64bit computer in a dumbiest possible explanation. ",

            "answer_text": "There is no need to use an analogy as it\u2019s very simple to explain. First introduced in Von Neumann architecture, RAM has a key role in modern computers.  If you notice diagram of Von Neumann architecture above, RAM acts as input/output device to CPU. We put data and instructions in RAM through input/storage/network devices etc. and CPU has to fetch that data and instructions from RAM, decode instructions, execute them on data and send output back to RAM. The question is, how much data CPU can fetch from RAM in one clock cycle? Before I answer it, let\u2019s look at how the data and instructions are resting in RAM. The atomic unit of RAM is a circuit called flip-flop/latch. At any given time, a flip-flop/latch can either hold 1 (high voltage) or 0 (low voltage). The atomic unit of data and instructions is conceptually called a bit. At any given time, a bit can either be 1 or 0. So, a flip-flop/latch holds one bit of data. Your data and instructions may consist of a large number of bits depending upon their respective size. Now the same question is, how many bits of data CPU can fetch from RAM in one clock cycle? To transfer data between RAM and CPU, we need wires. While in more clock cycles, one wire can transfer more bits, one wire can transfer only one bit in one clock cycle. We need a set of wires called bus and the number of wires (called bus width) in a bus determine the number of bits that could be transferred during one clock cycle. After understanding bus, lets divide it into two: Address bus (its width determines how much RAM address could be carried)Data bus (its width determines how much data could be transfered in one clock cycle)When we say 32-bit or 64-bit computer, we refer to data bus width of that computer. In programming, this width of data bus is called word size. When you design a 32-bit / 64 bit CPU, you need data bus accordingly. For this reason there is always a particular combination of microprocessor and motherboard because data bus is designed on motherboard connecting RAM port. These days 64-bit computers are everywhere. And Operating Systems are also designed accordingly. A 32-bit Operating System may run on 64-bit computer (for the obvious reason) but a 32-bit computer may not run 64-bit Operating System. ",

Also, a 64-bit OS can run 64-bit apps, unlike most 32-bit OSes (somehow OSX managed to pull a weird trick, similar to that used in Intel VT-X which also requires 64-bit). 64-bit apps can have quite a bit more data in the CPU itself, instead of moving to and from the memory back and forth. In fact, instead of the typical 4 (to maybe 6) 32-bit general purpose registers in 32-bit you have at least 16 64-bit registers, ignoring in both cases extensions like MMX or SSE. Note that 64-bit also guarantees SSE2 which is again a better performance enhancement. Most CPUs lately are 64-bit now (I\u2019ve had a 2004\u2019s 64-bit CPU but I think 2007 or so is the last time 32-bit CPUs besides the Atom were made). In the Intel category, of course (ARM, another architecture for phones, moved to 64-bit fairly recently, almost 10 years after Intel+AMD). AMD was similar and the actual 64-bit mode you see in the Intel CPUs now is really something pioneered by AMD (the Intel original 64-bit mode was something \u2026 evil :) )  In essence: 64-bit OSes can do most of what 32-bit OSes can, and more. The only thing doable only on 32-bit is running very old 16-bit DOS apps (.com executables). Ah, do you need any? Note that 16-bit protected mode does still work so some old apps may work, as long as they don\u2019t assume full control. ",

While 4Gb is standard in more entry level machines still that limit is unacceptable in today's market aside for low end hobby electronics and purpose built items like monitoring equipment. Even then 64 bit is so common its economic to use in those applications as well. Hope this helps, the difference seems small when listed like that, but it makes a large difference. ",

A switch can only be either on (1) or off (0), hence the base number system computers use being binary (1 or 0). In decimal where every placeholder increases the amount of numbers available by a power of 10 (units, tens, hundreds, thousands, ten thousands, etc.), binary numbers increase by a power of 2 for every placeholder (1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, etc.) So a 32 bit (placeholder) CPU can address up to 4,294,967,296 bits (2 to the 32) or 4.3 Billion. Sounds like a lot but it has massive limitations in terms of addressable memory space (4 Gigabytes of RAM - 4.3 Billion addresses). Now a 64 bit CPU can theoretically address up to 2 to the 64 or 18,446,744,073,709,551,646 bits - a whole lot more. I say theoretically because other factors come into play and that much memory would create bottlenecks of other sorts. So the answer is a 64 bit CPU can address more memory than a 32 bit CPU.

            "answer_text": "The two main categories of processors are 32-bit and 64-bit. The type of processor a computer has not only affects its overall performance, but it can also dictate what type of software it uses. The 32-bit processor was the primary processor used in all computers until the early 1990s. Intel Pentium processors and early AMD processors were 32-bit, which means the operating system and software work with data units that are 32 bits wide. Windows 95, 98, and XP are all 32-bit operating systems. The 64-bit computer has been around since 1961 when IBM created the IBM 7030 Stretch supercomputer. However, it was not put into use in home computers until the early 2000s. Microsoft released a 64-bit version of Windows XP to be used on computers with a 64-bit processor. Windows Vista, Windows 7, and Windows 8 also come in 64-bit versions. Other software has been developed that is designed to run on a 64-bit computer, which are 64-bit based as well, in that they work with data units that are 64 bits wide. Thanks Hope you understand// ",

            "answer_text": "The 32-bit processors are perfectly capable of handling a limited amount of RAM (in Windows, 4GB or less), and 64-bit processors are capable of utilizing much more. Of course, in order to achieve this, your operating system also needs to be designed to take advantage of the greater access to memory.With an increase in the availability of 64-bit processors and larger capacities of RAM, Microsoft and Apple both have upgraded versions of their operating systems that are designed to take full advantage of the new technology.But in the case of Microsoft Windows, the basic versions of the operating systems put software limitations on the amount of RAM that can be used by applications, but even in the ultimate and professional version of the operating system, 4GB is the maximum usable memory the 32-bit version can handle. While a 64-bit operating system can increase the capabilities of a processor drastically, the real jump in power comes from software designed with this architecture in mind. Here you need to remember that 32-bit/64-bit CPU\u2019s are memory handling units and where as an operating system is a program which works based on allocating memory etc and utilizes memory available.

And to understand this, suppose there is a road between processor and memory of 4 lane, ok and traffic is going slowly. If we double the width of road to 8 Lane road then traffic will go faster than before. So a 64 Bit processor is twice as faster compare to a 32 Bit processor In terms of data interaction(data in and out). One important thing to note is that the OS should be according to the processor. because if you run a 32 bit OS on a 64 bit processor, it would only interact 32 bits of data at a time between processor and memory. so to get its full potential see you need is a 64 bit OS it is the same if you use a 32 bit processor and 64 bit OS the output would be of 32 bits. In technical language that 4 lane and 8 lane road is called as \u201cBus\u201d. Sorry if my grammer is wrong anywhere. Im still learning english. ",

It can handle a maximum of 4GB of system memory and has been quite popular for sometime. But as days passed by, the need for more system memory became evident in order to support modern applications like video processing, animation, CAD, gaming, etc. Soon the architecture needed to shift radically to a newer one. This led to the birth of 64 bit CPUs (marked by AMD Athlon 64 line). The x64 became a standard with the help of AMD. These modules were able to access huge amounts of memory without any problems and made computations much more faster as compared to previous generation x86 CPUs. I think this is what makes the two architectures different. ",

The definition is a little more complicated if the data bus (to which the external memory is connected) is not the same size as the internal registers. For example, the (ancient) 8088 and 6809 processors had an 8 bit data bus but 16 bit internal registers. Thus they were said to be 8 bits \u201cexternal\u201d and 16 bits \u201cinternal\u201d. ",

            "answer_text": "A bit is a way of writing numbers using only 1\u2019s and 0\u2019s. Think of bits like digits of 10. We write numbers in digits of 10, like 639, but computers (sort of) write them out of 1\u2019s and 0\u2019s, like 1011 (11 in decimal). An 8 bit computer can do math with integers that are 8 bits wide. That is, it can do math with anything from 0000 0000 (0x00 in hexadecimal, or 0) to 1111 1111 (FF in hex, or 256 in decimal). Any more than that and it will overflow and crash, which is what it does when it encounters a number too big to fit in 8 bits. Its assembly code (the most basic coding language, the one that the core CPU uses) will also have 8 bit instructions for its 8 bit register. If it tries to run longer, more complex instructions, it\u2019s not going to be able to load them properly. A 32 bit computer can do math with anything from 0 to 11111111 11111111 11111111 11111111 (About 4 billion). This means that, like the 8 bit, if it tries to compute a number over 4 billion it\u2019s gonna puke and crash*. This also means that if it tries to run code which has 64 bit long instructions it\u2019s gonna crash. This is why you can\u2019t run 64 bit programs on a 32 bit computer. 64 bit computers continue the trend. 64 bit computers can handle anything up to a couple trillion, and are able to load fancy 64 bit instructions too. It can still understand 32 bit code, though, which is why you can run 32 bit programs on 64 bit CPUs. That\u2019s how core bus bitwidth works. More bits = higher computable numbers + more complex instructions available (but smaller ones are still understood) There are some weird bits, though: The x86 CPU is just a 32 bit CPU (so, still limited to 4 billion) that went to university and learned all of the 64 bit instructions. The Arduino Uno is also kind of like that. The Uno\u2019s CPU is an 8 bit CPU that uses 12 bit instructions through a 12 bit memory system, thanks to some clever engineers at ATmega. *This is also why 32 bit computers are limited to 4GB of memory. Even if the CPU had more, it wouldn\u2019t be able to access it, since that would mean counting past its limit. ",

            "answer_text": "Thanks for the A2A. Both Snehal Puli and Krishna Kanth are correct. Let me try to put it in my words. Processors (CPU) use an \u201caddress\u201d to access main memory (RAM). Each byte of RAM has a distinct address. So, a CPU that can understand 32 bits for addresses, can, at a time, address upto 2^32 = 4G different bytes. So, an OS written for 32 bit CPUs can also let processes access upto 4G memory easily. Going beyond that may be possible using things like PAE if the CPU supports that, but is certainly not easy. A 64-bit CPU can address 2^64 = 16TB memory. Each (64bit) process (which can run on only on a 64 bit OS) can use upto 16TB! Note that it is very possible to let 32 bit processes, built for 32 bit OSes to run on a 64-bit OS. Similarly 64 bit CPUs are designed to run 32 bit OS-es just fine. A 32 bit process running on a 64 bit OS is still limited to 4G. But, there is a loss. Each pointer, or memory address stored by the running program takes up double the memory space for 64 bit programs compared to 32 bit ones. So, if your program needs to use > 4G memory in one go, make it 64 bit. If you have even one 64 bit program you need, make your OS and CPU 64 bit. For others, 32 bit is smaller, faster. ",

Just take a note that, in 32 bit the instructions use smaller space so to do something larger it will need double time and in 64 bit it will do in one go. 32 bit machines limit a process to use address space less than 2 Gb thats not the case in 64 bit, here a process can allocate more than 4 Gb of space. The main problem is O.S. limits the use of memory in case of 32 bit machines. But in 64 bit it can handle large memories easily that is why 64 bit pcs are faster. 32 bit machines will support 32 bit O.S. so you cant use more than 3 Gb of RAM, however there may be 16 Gb of RAM in your Computer. So when you are doing heavy tasks in PC it will slow down in absence of memory space. ",

So this is the only and main difference. How will you know the effect, you can visually see the difference only if* Operating system should work with 64 bit (if u have 64 bit system u can also install 32bit operating system)* Applications should work with 64bit (Both 32bit and 64 bit applications will run in 64bit system)* Games should use the power of 64bit ",

These registers can store some bits of data. When the registers are of size 32-bit, its called a 32-bit OS and its called a 64-bit OS when the size of registers is 64-bit. Now, you will be thinking what difference does the size of registers make? It makes a lot if difference. Let\u2019s see how. Some CPU register stores memory addresses, which is how the processor accesses data from RAM. If the CPU register in which memory addresses are stored is of 32-bit, the maximum size of the main memory or RAM can be 2^32 bytes or 4GB assuming that the RAM is byte addressable. Why? To understand this, you have to revisit binary number basics. Each bit in the address register can be either 1 or 0. With N bits, how many different values can be generates? There are some other differences too between 32-bit and 64-bit OS. The size of an INTEGER can be of 64 bits in a 64-bit OS. 64-bit OS can come with multiple cores associated with the CPU. Multiple cores makes the processing faster. ",

In the 70s those early computers were very slow and very limited in how things got handled, so routines were created for even the most basic tasks. Apple 1 used like a 1 kHz speed, and 16-bit ram access. I think 640k was the max memory one could fathom, with 16K being a more common size. ",

A 64 bit operating system can utilize a lot more memory as it can run 2 to the power of 64 gbs of ram which is a lot more than what we have and need right now. So the main difference is that a 32bit pc runs a 32 bit operating system which can utilize 4gbs of ram and a 64bit pc uses a 64bit operating system that can utilize 2 to the 64th power bytes of ram.

So the primary and basic difference of 32bit and 64bit computer is its capability of breaking a command into chunks size of 32bit or 64bit. A command broken into small chunks of 32bits are more no of packages compared to 64bits, so its obvious that computer takes more efforts to complete a command that are broken in n number of 32bits packet compared to 64bit. Handling more data at once is faster and better. ",
