            "answer_text": "Let me start by saying that this is not a yes or no question. It\u2019s an area of grey that\u2019s up to you to decide where you opinion lies. As a youth I would say undeniably yes. I am also assuming you\u2019re talking about recently technology such as phones, laptops, tablets and the ilk. The amount of knowledge I have at my fingertips and in my pockets is too vast for anybody to truely understand and it\u2019s increasing rapidly. Anything from price checking a purchase to googling emergency care in extremely dire situations is possible now. We have vastly increased the quality of life for many youths. One could go on and on about the benefits of technology but you pretty much got the idea That being said even a avid supporter of technology, such as myself, would be remiss to say that it\u2019s all positives. The internet is a new frontier that in much of the world isn\u2019t heavily censored and with a little know how you can reach incredibly vile, discpicable places which I won\u2019t mention on this thread. It\u2019s aged my generation and the generations younger than me quicker than our fathers and grandfathers. We always see the news and constant reminders about the violences and injustices in the world that it can strip us of our childhood earlier than what the general population is used to. In my opinion it\u2019s made a good amount of people much more vain, constantly trying to outdo each other on social media (which is why I staff off most). Part of my thoughts could be my innate cyniscm but i don\u2019t think many people would end up disagreeing with me. With more pros and cons for technology for youth than I can possibly list it\u2019s up to you, dear fellow quora user, to decide how you feel on this topic. I encourage you to research and think critically on this question. ",

            "answer_text": "There are unlimited benefits and opportunities when it comes to technology especially for youth. However it still comes down on they can efficiently use technology on their lives. Whether at school, at home or anywhere they can always use technology to their advantage. They can even start earning a little extra money if they want to but I\u2019m not saying they should. My point is technology was introduced to make our life easier than before, but sure is, it also comes with a great price. No matter how effective technology is, there are still who can see it as a threat to society. Some say that technology makes people lazier and dumber. But I still stand that technology is great for youth. Technology is a tool, you just got to utilize it wisely. ",
