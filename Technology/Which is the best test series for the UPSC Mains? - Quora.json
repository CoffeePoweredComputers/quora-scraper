            "answer_text": "My brief intro:- Given 3 mains, 1 interview. Attempts Exhausted and currently working as Rural Development Officer in Bihar. My optional was Geography and frankly I never understood this subject and the reason for my failure is attributed to Geography optional and my careless attitude towards this exam. Now coming back to the original question, which coaching is best for the Mains test series program? In my 3 Mains attempt, I have given test series in Vision, IAS score and Chrome IAS respectively. Observation1:- Quality of questions at Vision IAS is satisfactory. But, in Vision IAS aspirants themselves check the script. It is a common sight in metro stations where you can see students checking vision scripts and it\u2019s not a joke, if you know someone who stays in ORN may testify this. Observation 2:- Checking of GS Score is abysmal but the faculties for feedback are humble and talented. I am attaching you one of the sample script. Just observe the sub-standard comments given. You may go to the toppers script section of GS Score and you may observe all the scripts. Comments are sub-standard and hardly any fruitful outcome you will achieve after joining their test series. Observation 3:- As far as feedback and quality of questions is concerned, I found Chrome IAS as 2-3 steps above . Why I sat this :- 1. Quality of questions - one notch above vision IAS . 2. Evaluation - much better than Vision , GS Score. 3. Feedback - unparalleled in Old Rajinder Nagar . Another good thing with Chrome IAS and especially with Mridul Sir is that they never over emphasized on Model answers rather asked to think and work on creativity quotient. This helps a lot . In earlier attempts I used to mug model answers - which I could not even recall . But at that time , I could not realize the futility. And if I had attempts I would have again joined Chrome IAS. Evaluation of Essay and Ethics was far more superior than what I experience in my previous attempts . Inputs were pin pointed. GS 1 , GS 2 and GS 3 inputs were also quite insightful. Overall it was my best experience in Civil Services journey. Aspirants must realize the value of their money and if they are not satisfied they should demand more. Never ever compromise on the quality of the feedback. If you feel some juvenile has corrected your script go to their management and complaint. Don\u2019t compromise! Rest your luck. ",

            "answer_text": "Any preparation is incomplete without evaluating your own performance before you appear for the main exam. The same goes for UPSC CSE preparation. Before you take your final exam you must have written multiple tests so that you\u2019re able to reduce your anxiety and are confident on your D-DAY. There are several test series that are available. But before joining a test series certain aspects should be kept in mind- 1. Quality of questions: The quality of questions being asked must be related to the pattern of the exam. This is only possible when the test series is being conducted by an institute that has been taking these test series in an organised manner and has a dedicated team to handle this. 2. Quality of examiners: Also when one decides to write the test series one overcomes a lot of our fears to even arrive at the centre to take the exam hence it is crucial that one must be assured that the answers are being checked properly by someone who knows the requirement of the exam. 3. Realistic timetable of the test series: The tests being taken must be frequent enough but should not be too frequent also that one is not able to study anything. The timetable of the test series must be such that you are able to finish all the tests at least 15-20 days prior to the start of our actual exam. 4. Mentor: You must also ensure that you do have a mentor to whom you can turn to for guidance, the institute that provides the test series must have a faculty who is willing to help you to explain where your faults are and which areas need improvement. A constant mentoring helps to keep you motivated and positive throughout the preparation. After keeping in mind all these point you must decide to select the test series that suit your requirement. The famous ones include visions ias, KSG test series, vajiram etc. Amongst these the one that I personally recommend is KSG for prelims as well as mains because I am aware that they have a dedicated team for test series, their test series includes inputs from selected candidates which makes the questions and answers closely related to the pattern of the exam, Khan sir is very helpful in matters of preparation and personally goes out of the way to help the aspirants. He is well versed with the pattern of the exam and is also abreast the latest pattern. Hope it helps! Good luck. ",
