            "answer_text": "I\u2019d be more impressed if a Silicon Valley surgeon said it. You\u2019re taking the word of someone who knows nothing about either surgery, medical doctors, OR AI to make accurate and sweeping statements about the other disciplines? Can you see how ridiculous it sounds? Let\u2019s take it from another point of view. How about if I told you a foot surgeon and an infectious disease doctor got together and said that all Silicon Valley Investors will be replaced by AI by 2035? Well maybe that one is possible, but in general the premise is weak. What I\u2019m saying here is that the whole question is being floated by the least educated and least well-informed member of this three-way association. What kind of skill and expertise does it take to become a Silicon Valley investor? What\u2019s his track record? How many investments has he made? Did they all turn out, or did some of them tank? Did he come up with the investments, or were they floated to him? What is the ROI? What is the buy in? Are any Hedge-Funds putting money against it? You can see where I\u2019m going with this. A thousand questions would need to be answered unequivocally by experts who put their opinions and signatures down on legal documents attesting to the truth of the assertions made there before I\u2019d even look at it again. That\u2019s one point of view. I grant you that some sorts of absolutely routine surgeries may be done by robotic assistant \u2014 they already are. Some eye-surgery has progressed to that point, and closing incisions after uneventful chest surgery may soon join the field, but ALL surgery? ALL medical doctors? Which bar did your source find this guy in, anyway? There\u2019s one last flaw in this rosy picture. Every successful AI.that\u2019s ever been made to manage any robotic task has been exhaustively trained with precisely one set of tools and them only to do exactly that one task. Precisely. If a part on a conveyer belt get\u2019s wedged into the narrow space at the edge of the belt, the AI that expects to pick it up and screw it onto an assembly will simply go mad, or shut down in confusion. When have you heard of an operation for something perfectly mundane suddenly run into complications? Duh! That\u2019s the whole reason for medical malpractice insurance. So now we have a situation where we have to have ten thousand precisely standard tools and attachments for our robotic surgeon who can pick them out of bins if you will, and a library of ten thousand AI programs that have been trained in precisely those tools and techniques and patients with precisely the right problems who have been prepped exactly right. You\u2019re talking long odds here. ",

            "answer_text": "I highly doubt it, for a number of reasons: 1- It is far from clear that the technology will be ready by then. There is some robotic surgery and a very small amount of autonomous robotic surgery in use now. This, however, is a far cry from replacing surgeons. No AI, for instance, has been able to replicate a human doctor in terms of speaking to patients, taking a history, explaining the findings back to the patient, formulating a treatment plan, liaising with other specialties, or anything else. There\u2019s a huge amount of these ancillary human skills that a doctor needs, and I often find the computer science types (who are usually the most aggressive with their predictions that we will be replaced), completely neglect this. For instance, if you want an AI that can input a set of symptoms, interpret them according to standardised guidelines, and offer a plan, there\u2019s probably AI\u2019s that can do this now, better than I could. However, show me an AI that actually can get this history out of your average patient, or go and speak to the patient\u2019s concerned family and explain what is going on, or any of those things. 2- Even if it is, it may not be in widespread use. It takes a long time for technology to become widespread in health. We were still using paper-based records as of a few years ago (and yes, that is a total travesty, but it\u2019s also what happens). Getting the profession to adopt new technology takes time, and pushing it out into the clinic and into widespread use takes even longer. It took years, for instance, for CT scanners to become widely available. MRI is now relatively easy to get if you need it but is still expensive. Getting AI across the entire hospital system to put doctors out of business, no chance that is going to happen in as little as 15 years\u2026 especially not when my hospital is still using fax as the gold standard for communication. Human patients will also likely be more psychologically comfortable with human doctors for years to come. I doubt many humans will be completely comfortable with an AI doing all the work for some time yet. 3- There\u2019s definitely a culture in medicine of not farming tasks out to machines. Medicine tends to pride the individual skill of the doctor and the culture is very, very, ossified and resistant to change (which is not always a good thing). It is surprisingly resistant to automation, and the way doctors are taught and assessed, still generally assumes that the doctor should do various tasks manually, and it tends to lump various skillsets together. So even when machines can do tasks better than we can, it\u2019s still generally expected that the human doctor still knows how to do it, so generally most doctors still end up doing it. A good example of this is EKG interpretation: the initial computer analysis algorithms for EKG interpretation were not particularly good. Newer algorithms are far from perfect, but increasingly they are getting better, and some of the latest ones (mostly still in the research setting) are now at least as good as a cardiologist. Anyway, the response of the profession was not \u201cok, we could develop better algorithms to help automate the process\u201d- instead it was \u201cok, automated analysis is a complete waste of time, never use it, interpret it manually\u201d. Even if we do have automatic algorithms that can out-perform a human, I doubt we\u2019ll ever see them actually used or relied on- not for years, anyway. ",
