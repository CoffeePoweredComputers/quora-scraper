            "answer_text": "Without a doubt, yes. There are many utilitarian aspects of the benefits of learning a new language. Yes, it makes you more employable, it makes travel easier, and all that. I don't disagree. But to me, language is far more than a utilitarian mode of communication. As much as being able to speak a certain language opens doors to employment, it also opens doors to new cultures. Languages are inseparably intertwined with culture. They are the carriers of culture, markers of social identity. There is no better way to understand another culture, its practices, how that culture views the world, and to immerse oneself in another culture, than learning its language. Individually, it opens doors to new friendships. It has been my experience that speaking the native language of another person makes them open up to me far more than than they would if I didn't speak their language. They appear to relate to me far more than they would otherwise. I've made some great relationships by being able to speak Hindi and French (though my French isn't very good at all). Learning languages can also be very helpful if you are interested in linguistics. One of the main draws of linguistics for me is the way different languages work, how they can express the same concept in so many different and unrelated ways, and how humans use such complex structures in the language that we speak instinctively, without even thinking about it. Besides, there is always the joy of learning a language for its own sake. There is something about being a polyglot that really appeals to me. French isn't exactly a very different language, but it always excites me when I'm able to read a French passage and fully understand it! ",

            "answer_text": "You start losing your own language. At first it\u2019s just a word here and there, where you want to say it in your mother tongue and all you can think of is the language you\u2019ve been learning. But soon you\u2019ll start changing the order of words, pronouncing things wrong, and often simply coming to a loss of words. You\u2019d think learning languages would make you more articulate, but it generally has the opposite effect!You can\u2019t tune other people out. Before, when you heard this particular foreign language, you could ignore it and carry on with your business. But now, even when you don\u2019t mean to eavesdrop, your ears tune in to the new language from across the store or parking lot. It will stand out when you\u2019re in a crowd.You can\u2019t see the world from just your own perspective anymore. When you only spoke one language, you felt pretty confident in how the world worked. Blue is blue, right? Not if you speak a language that always distinguishes light blue from dark. 5+5=10, right? I mean, how this be wrong? Well, if you learn a language with no numbers higher than 6, 5+5 just equals \u201ca lot\u201d. Languages affect how you can think about things, and once you start thinking in a new way, it\u2019s hard to forget about.Learning a language changes who you are. It changes the way you talk, of course. It also changes the people you know, your personality, even your worldview. Think carefully before you start learning. Once you begin, your world will be different forever. ",
