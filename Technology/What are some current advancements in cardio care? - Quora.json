            "answer_text": "There is going on a lot behind scenes. It will definitely take some years to implement all advancements but we are already on the way towards them. Prevention. It is getting greater importance every day.We know that diet is causing gut microbiome disbiosis, which leads to inflammation in the gut and late inflammation in arteries. That all end up by deposits of cholesterol and calcium along with other substances that are nothing less than a means of healing the ruptured endothelium of arteries.Refined sugars, trans fats, pasteurized milk, white flour & rice, chemicals, pesticides are killing the gut microbiome.Sufficient movement and avoiding long sitting.Enough sunlight or natural vitamin D, C, E.Getting enough essential nutrients through fermented food.Grounding is providing essential electrons to ATP creation in mitochondria.24/7/365 monitoring by wearable devices is getting increasing importance. It can be for example used to predict arrhythmias well before they start (my own research area).Replacement of statins by more advanced drugs directing towards cholesterol only. This should be applied only in patients where dietary changes and anti-inflammatory regimen fails. Not vice-versa.Future drug targeting Corona-1 receptor in T-lymphocyte enables live transplanted people without damaging immunosuppressive drugs. No rejections. No collateral infections. Organs get tolerated.Heart organoids. Not fully grown organs but a predecessor of them and a very important step in reaching the level of full, transplantable organs.Exercises aimed to recover certain types of cardiomyopathy.There is going on exciting research on the electric character of the cardiovascular system. We already know that blood in microvessels is pushed by electromagnetic forces \u2014 the sum of those forces leads to diastolic pressure of blood returning to the heart.The heart itself employs its strong electromagnetic forces to properly blood going through it. More results are expected to occur in the future.There are a lot of great things going on in cardiology. It will take some time to implement those findings but things are moving in the right direction. Have good health & a happy life :-) ",

            "answer_text": "An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure. It is no secret that the best way to build up healthy cardio conditioning is to exercise regularly, adopt a nutritious diet, and follow a lifestyle that is conducive to healthy heart and lungs. We still need tools to treat the population needing medical care. Cardiorespiratory science is one of the many medical science branches that is producing new tools for cardio care. As an avid reader and researcher, I regularly dig in a few medical journals to keep up with the technology trends. My curiosity comes from my background in software design. I used to work with Ultrasound equipment building computer applications in that filed. Recently due to COVID, I noticed a few new cardio cares that seem to be very useful. Here is quick description of a few amazing useful tools:  In the time of global pandemic, General Motors and Ventec Life Systems teamed up to produce ventilators to help the COVID patients that are on their last leg needing a breathing machine to keep them alive.  This one is a Cough Assist mechanical digital device. CoughAssist T70 is a mechanical insufflation-exsufflation device designed to noninvasively clear secretions from the lungs by simulating a natural cough. Similar to a normal deep breath, CoughAssist gradually applies positive air pressure (insufflation) to obtain a large volume of air within the lungs. The device then quickly reverses the flow of air by shifting to negative air pressure (exsufflation). The resulting high expiratory flow helps mobilize secretions out of the airway as a deep, natural cough would do.  This cool chest wall oscillation device highly beneficial for folks with chronic respiratory diseases, a life saving tool. A noninvasive high frequency chest wall oscillation (HFCWO) device, the InCourage system benefits patients living with a wide range of chronic respiratory challenges associated with cystic fibrosis, certain neuromuscular/neuromotor diseases, COPD and bronchiectasis.
