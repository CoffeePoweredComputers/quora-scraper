            "answer_text": "Timothy Donald \"Tim\" Cook...   ... had two high ranking-product guys, Jony Ive on the hardware and Scott Forstall on the software side. Both had a fundamentally different understanding of what good design is, pure simplicity vs. the for many years by Steve Jobs favored skeumorphism. Cook let go of Forstall and elevated Jony to the Senior Vice President of Design, overseeing both the hardware and the software part. This will allow Apple to produce more coherent products from a design point of view. Cooks says:  You have to be an A-plus at collaboration. And so the changes that we made get us to a whole new level of collaboration. [...] I despise politics. There is no room for it in a company. My life is going to be way too short to deal with that. No bureaucracy. We want this fast-moving, agile company where there are no politics, no agendas. \u2026 introduced the iPad Mini on November 2nd 2012, against Steve Jobs claims that a tablet with a 7.9-inch display would never succeed. Today the iPad Mini is according to many analysts the best selling tablet on the market. As Cook claims: I see cannibalization as a huge opportunity for us. One, our base philosophy is to never fear cannibalization. If we do, somebody else will just cannibalize it and so we never fear it. We know that iPhone has cannibalized some iPod business. It doesn\u2019t worry us, but it\u2019s done that. We know that iPad will cannibalize some Macs that doesn\u2019t worry us. On iPad in particular, we have the mother of all opportunities here, because the Windows market is much, much larger than the Mac market is.   \u2026 apologized publicly for Apple Maps and took prompt measures. It was one of the reasons why he let go Scott Forstall who was responsible for the development of Apple Maps on iOS 6. As Cook frankly explained: It wasn\u2019t a matter of saying, \u201cStrategically it\u2019s important that we not work with company X.\u201d We set out to give the customer something to provide a better experience. And the truth is it didn\u2019t live up to our expectations. We screwed up. [...] We\u2019re putting all of our energy into making it right. And we have already had several software updates. We\u2019ve got a huge plan to make it even better. It will get better and better over time.   \u2026 has come on good terms with the investors, as he introduced a buyback plan to purchase an additional $50 billion worth of shares through 2015. He also convinced the board to pay out a dividend for the first time in Apple\u2019s history and recently increased it by 15% to $3.05 per share. The buyback  plan will reduce outstanding shares, which will lead to an additional dividend increase. Furthermore, Apple's valuation in 2014 has grown by almost as much as Google's entire market capitalisation.  Nevertheless, Cook states:  We do things for other reasons than a profit motive, we do things because they are right and just,[...] I don\u2019t think about the bloody ROI, [...] Just to be very straightforward with you, if that\u2019s a hard line for you\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009then you should get out of the stock. \u2026 transformed the way Apple communicates to the public and made Apple a more open and cooperating company. He especially made Apple\u2019s labour rights and business relations much more transparent and addresses issues instantly and straightforwardly. Keyword: Foxconn. Furthermore, he made sure that key people (especially Jony Ive) regularly appeared in the spotlight.  As Cook remarks: If you look at our website, we\u2019re publishing working hours for almost a million people across our supply chain. Nobody else is doing this. We are very much managing this at a micro level. And you know, maybe as important as that, we are training workers on their rights. We have trained 2 million people, and we\u2019ve brought college courses to the factories where people can begin to earn their degrees. Link: Labour and Human Rights  and My objective is to raise the public profile of several of the folks on the executive team, and others as well. Because I think that\u2019s good for Apple at the end of the day. ... introduced and discontinued the iPhone 5C. The iPhone 5C was the second product alteration Tim Cook announced besides the iPad Mini after the death of Steve Jobs. While the iPad original iPad Mini became the 2nd most sold iPad, the iPhone 5C fell flat. On September 9th 2015, the iPhone 5C was discontinued upon the arrival of the iPhone 6s and 6s Plus. Cook states, explaining the reason of the 5C's defeat:  I think the 5s, people are really intrigued with Touch ID [...] It's a major feature that has excited people. And I think that associated with the other things that are unique to the 5s, got the 5s to have a significant amount more attention and a higher mix of sales. ... acquired Beats Music and strengthened Apple's deep connection between technology and liberal arts.  Cook notes:  This is all about music, and we\u2019ve always viewed that music was key to society and culture. Music\u2019s always been at the heart of Apple. It\u2019s deep in our DNA. We\u2019ve sold Macs to musicians since the beginning of Macs. And we accelerated the music industry with the digital music revolution with the iPod and the iTunes music store. So we\u2019ve always loved music and believed in the power of it and believed that it could transcend language, culture and bring people together and produce emotions and deep feelings that other things can\u2019t. And we\u2019ve stood at the intersection of technology and the liberal arts. ... introduced the Apple Pay on 20th of October 2014, which not only took Apple into the realms of finance, but which is also the first entirely new service launched under Tim Cook.  Cook comments on its rapid growth:  It\u2019s gone faster than I thought it would, much faster actually. [...] This was only possible because we could control and design the hardware, the software, and the service. You can imagine trying to do this with several different companies. You would be pulling your hair out doing it. ... made Apple fit for the Chinese market by planning to have 40 stores open by mid 2016, by partnering with China Mobile and by specifically addressing Chinese customers through product design and marketing initiatives. China's smartphone market is the world's largest and one of the fastest growing. By October 2015, China accounted for 24 per cent of Apple's revenue, up from 15 per cent in 2014.  Cook says:  China is currently our second-largest market, I believe it will become our first, I believe strongly that it wil [...] and  We are investing in China \u2026 for the decades ahead, [...] ... introduced the Apple Watch on April 24th 2015. It is the first product which was entirely created under Tim Cook and defines a new product category as the iPod, the iPhone and the iPad did.  Cook illustrates: The MP3 industry, before the iPod \u2014 we weren\u2019t the first company to make an MP3 [player],[...] There were lots of companies in the\u2026 you may not be able to remember that, but there were lots of them out there. They weren\u2019t used very much. They were fundamentally too hard to use, and the user interface was really bad. You almost needed a PhD to use these. They weren\u2019t, they\u2019re not memorable. They didn\u2019t really move the dial.[...] There are several things that are called \u2018smart watches\u2019 that are shipping, but I\u2019m not sure you could name any, [...] Certainly there\u2019s been none that have changed the way people live their lives\u2026At Apple, that\u2019s our objective: We want to change the way you live your life. And just like this iPad has changed the way you work, and hopefully the way you live, and the iPhone has done that, we see the Apple Watch doing that. ... has found his public voice as a leader and global role model. He is not only the first CEO among the Fortune 500 to publicly announce that he is gay, but addresses subjects ranging from human rights, access to education, female representation on Wall Street, immigration reform and privacy rights. Most notably, he is actively pushing Apple towards an environmental friendly  and carbon neutral company by investing in renewable energy and continuously lowering the energy usage of Apple devices.  Cook says:  We want to leave a better world than we found it.  and You want to be the pebble in the pond that creates the ripple for change, [...] ...reiterated Apple's attitude towards privacy, making the company one of the sole companies of Silicon Valley that fights for its user's privacy rights. Cook asserts:  A few years ago, users of internet services began to realise that when an online service is free, you\u2019re not the customer. You\u2019re the product. But at Apple, we believe a great customer experience shouldn\u2019t come at the expense of your privacy. Recently, he restated his position in on 60 Minutes:  There have been people that suggest that we should have a back door. But the reality is if you put a back door in, that back door\u2019s for everybody, for good guys and bad guys [...] I don\u2019t believe that the tradeoff here is privacy versus national security, I think that\u2019s an overly simplistic view. We\u2019re America. We should have both.  ...released the MacBook (Retina) on April 10th 2015, making it the first 12-inch laptop Apple has ever produced. According to Phil Schiller, it represents Apple's vision of the future of notebooks. Tim Cook jokes during its introduction:  It is unbelievable! Can you even see it? ...released the iPad Pro on November 11th 2015. Compared to Steve Jobs, who saw the iPad as a third product category between the smartphone and the Mac, the iPad Pro is Apple's first try to blur the line between tablet and laptop. Tim Cook remarks:  Yes, the iPad Pro is a replacement for a notebook or a desktop for many, many people. They will start using it and conclude they no longer need to use anything else, other than their phones. He asserts, however, that these two categories should stay independent:  We feel strongly that customers are not really looking for a converged Mac and iPad. Because what that would wind up doing, or what we\u2019re worried would happen, is that neither experience would be as good as the customer wants. So we want to make the best tablet in the world and the best Mac in the world. And putting those two together would not achieve either. You\u2019d begin to compromise in different ways. \u2026 kept the mojo alive. Apple continues to be one of the most recognized brands in the world. One could argue, that the operation \u201cReplacing Steve Jobs, keeping the good things, get rid of the bad things and meanwhile maintain Apple\u2019s identity\u201d was successful. Cook says: You know, we want to really enrich people\u2019s lives at the end of the day, not just make money. Making money might be a byproduct, but it\u2019s not our North Star. and  First and foremost, our job in life is to make the best. We\u2019ve never lost sight of that. We want to give people a good value, and if we can develop something that\u2019s really great, that costs even less than what we\u2019re offering today, then we would do that. What we won\u2019t do is something that\u2019s second rate, or that\u2019s only a good product, not a great product. That\u2019s not what Apple stands for. Tim Cook as been been named CEO of the year 2014 by CNN, Person of the Year 2014 by Financial Times and has received the world's highest approval rating from employees in 2012 on Glassdoor (97%). ",

            "answer_text": "Since Tim Cook becoming CEO, a new Apple was born and the Apple of Steve Job was be killed. Before, Apple is well known as the company invent a series of technology and product. Apple doesn't have market research, they don't try to tail any opponents, they tried to discover new thing uniquely. Let get back to 2006, the first iPhone was introduced, that moment Steves define Smartphone age again. Without him, maybe now I still use an smartphone will QWERTY keyboard as same as my granpa's Blackberry Bold 9000.  And now? They tail Samsung and enlarge iPhone to 4.7 and upper. This's a brilliant mistake! Maybe customer and client interest in smartphone with big screen but from viewpoint of Software Engineer and Designer 4.0 inches is enough. The most important is user can reach any position on screen by one hand and thumb finger (left or right) and touch anything to interact to system. Moreover, Steves always establish a stable martket with 3, 4 product. He don't focus on anything product. Let see, in Steves's age, he always create a diversity market with Mac computer, iPod, Iphone and iPad. It can be changes flexibility to fit marketshare. But Apple always has other path to get profit. What's now? Tim focus on iPhone only, he forsake iPod. Now you can see the report of Apple's profit over 70% is from iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 plus. It's a hit to other opponents but let suppose that if Apple lose their marketshare with Iphone what's next? No thing can save them. The typical story is about Microsoft, with Windows and what's now? They lost marketshare and no longer be a tech giant. ",

            "answer_text": "I think he's dealing with the fact that he's the guy who replaced Steve Jobs.  Nobody is more aware of this fact than Tim Cook. He's doing two things as I see it.   First, he's doing what he always has done.  Cook delivers. Most of the things the media have focussed on has been his implementation of this. As the COO he had a history of effective delivery and there's no change on that since taking the reins as outlined so effectively by Marc.  He cleared up post-Steve, removing Forstall, establishing charity matching, making Apple more open and humane, putting Ive front and centre, brought all the products up to date via broadly incremental improvement. Secondly, he's banking on Ive to deliver vision.  I think this is what will be interesting about 2014, Cook has cleared the decks internally, a flurry of releases at the end of last year, creating space for Ive to bring about new work, the Mac Pro and iOS 7 being the two major releases this year, all else being, as I said, moving ahead in incremental steps.  The lovely animation at the start of WWDC was a statement of intent straight from Jony Ive.  It's the Cook/Ive manifesto in one document.   This thoughtful, quiet insistence builds upon the Jobs legacy but is distinctively different.  So, as I see it, what will be interesting about Tim Cook will be only be seen from 2014 on. ",
