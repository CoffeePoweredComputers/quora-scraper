            "answer_text": "This is one of the best questions I saw in Quora in the recent past and I will try to answer to my best ( as this is very interesting topic for me) : Intelligent Personal Assistant.Digital Personal Assistant or Intelligent Personal Assistant is a software that is installed in our smart phone (and even in Win 10 and next version of OS X) which helps in assisting our things and giving suggestions when needed (like uhh, it reminds of any birthdays or anniversaries or appointments we fix,predicts weather and warns about traffic, navigation etc.). Apart from that, it even cracks jokes ( Hell yeah, jokes), tells us facts (which we probably don\u2019t know), basing on the frequency of our voice it judges our mood and confidence levels ( in Apple\u2019s Siri ). They work through Artificial Intelligence (A.I.). For those who are pretty new for this I.P.A. they may find it as a wonder. As for know, I.P.A. has some limitations, but if the talented people on our planet may sit and develop it, I believe I.P.A. reaches a point where it becomes a member of our family and humans get dependent on it. Apple\u2019s Siri and Microsoft\u2019s Cortana are my most favorite I.P.A.s. Internet of Things (I.o.T).Imagine that if you are on a hurry to go out and you can\u2019t find your car keys. Then you pull out your smart phone and search for your keys through your mobile and find them somewhere in your home. How cool it would be? Or else you are sitting on your couch in your hall after a full-a-day work and suddenly you remembered that you need to switch on your oven, but you are too exhausted to walk and go to the kitchen and on the oven. Then you simply on your oven by sitting on the same couch without moving an inch through your smart phone. This is how it looks when I.o.T will come into practice. Creating a network of embedded systems and sharing information between each of them is really a wonderful and futuristic thing which will change the fortune of people and they will definitely have an impact on present day man\u2019s style of working. Just a high-speed internet matters. 3D-Holography.Watching a photo on your mobile phone is an old-day matter. But what if the same image projects out of your mobile screen and gets displayed in a 3D-manner and can be watched from 360 degrees? One should definitely give a bow to the man who got the thought of holography as it is really a revolution in technology. ",

            "answer_text": "All I want is a way to measure my blood glucose level without needing to get blood or use an expensive strip to do it. This has been promised for years and there is occasionaly a news story that says how close a company is to producing such an apparatus. It\u2019s always \u2018just around the corner\u201d. Also, where\u2019s my personal robot that will cook for me and fetch my beer? ",
