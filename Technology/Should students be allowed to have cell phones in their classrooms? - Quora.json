            "answer_text": "How old is the student? Here in primary school all students hand in their smartphones at the beginning of class and they are kept with the teacher on their desks until the class ends. It is there because kids play on their smartphones and is a disruption in class. They are their to learn, not look at snapchat and YouTube . In secondary school it isn't a problem as again they are there to learn and the distractions hinder their ability to learn. They are required to not have them out when in class. So should they be allowed to have them sure but they shouldn't have them out during classes and depending on the student should have enough responsibility to understand that. If they don\u2019t then it should be confiscated until the end of class. I don\u2019t understand you are there to learn not play around on your smartphone. There is a time and place for it and in class is not a place for it. ",

A number of school have gone to \u201cclaiming phones\u201d at the beginning of the day. And you know what? Kids appreciated it! In the \u201cdays of yore\u2026\u201d kids did not need this distraction. And when there is an event? a single line of communication is much more effective than having dozens of calls coming in with contradictory information. ",
