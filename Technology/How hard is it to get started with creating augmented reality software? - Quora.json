            "answer_text": "Much of the difficulty would depend on how well versed you are developing things in a 3D space. Then again, AR can cover so much that a full immersion 3D space might not be needed. For the most part, AR apps/games are just the images being rendered on top of a camera\u2019s view. That way, you get the world around you + whatever your app/game drew on it. Look at Pokemon Go. What did that game do? Parts of the game took the image produced by your phone\u2019s camera and placed images/animations on top of it. The same stuff happens all the time in FB Messenger. In the case that you wanted to go all out, you\u2019d really need some serious developing skills. The prime example would be Lenovo Star Wars. They went all out to even include extra hardware for that game. So the first guess would be that developing something like that needs the mentioned serious developing skills and IDEs / SDKs to work with. ",
