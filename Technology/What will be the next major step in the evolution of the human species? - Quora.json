            "answer_text": " Specific answer, involving much scientific wildass guessing but also a lot of fun not included in the \"General answer\" at bottom here: Stage 1: We'll accept genetic cures for a few major illnesses, the low-hanging fruit of gene therapy, as we've already started to do for certain leukemias in early human trials that are dizzying in their success rates. Stage 2.1: We'll soon see full genome sequencing doable in minutes at a cost of tens or hundreds of US dollars.   Stage 2.2a: We'll enact laws ensuring strangers go to jail for sequencing our genomes against our will. Stage 2.2b: We'll start paying people to sequence their genomes.  Who's we?  Medical research facilities, and health insurance companies. Stage 3:  We'll start knowing in much greater detail what genetic markers have what impact on our longterm disease rates and longevity.  Why?  Because of our massive database of individual human genomes (cross-correlated with personal and family medical histories) as described in the previous step, combined with ever advancing computing power that brings us closer and closer to understanding gene interactions and protein folding. Stage 4: Genome sequencing will be essentially free.  US insurance companies will have most citizens' genomes on file, despite the laws, because when information can be had from a stray hair, and for almost free, who can trace its provenance? And these insurers will strain to eject genetic \"bad apples\" from their coverage system.  Legislation will enter a new phase of socioeconomic, public-vs-industry war that will make ObamaCare/ACA look like a happy memory.   Stage 5: US insurance companies will realize that genetic cures and preventative gene therapies are the only affordable way to cover patients who are otherwise doomed to bankrupt said insurers.  Gene therapies will proliferate as the path of least resistance through this massive health insurance armageddon of total genomic knowledge vs the very notion of insurance as a buffer against uncertainty.   Stage 6: Most patients will face choices between accepting gene therapies and paying for future or present medical conditions out of pocket.  Most patients will choose gene therapies.  Culture will rage about this on a scale that makes modern worries about vaccines and GMOs look placid.  Stage 7.1: People will screen their unborn children for a vast number of genetic markers and therapy their embryos and fetuses for same, both in vitro and in vivo. Stage 7.2: People will also select their unborn children for traits we've evolved to want: Beauty (symmetry and proportionality), muscle mass, high metabolism, reflexes, endurance, height, full hair, and so on.  Intellect will play a role, but will be limited, as it always has been, by the burdens our big craniums put on pregnant women, and on our spines. Stage 8: The fun stuff: Some people will start selecting their children not for traits we're hardwired to like, but for traits that actually confer success in the actual world their children are being born into.  Namely, we'll start seeing children born not to look like Greek gods, but who look like gray aliens.  Eyes that see a fuller EM spectrum, organs near the eyes that function like an fMRI to see into other people's heads and manipulate same.  Children whose digestive systems have been replaced by a simplified energy battery.  Photographic memories with 100x the capacity of other brains.  Spatial reasoning centers capable of thinking in 4+ spatial dimensions.  Muscles not made of muscle, that are stronger than muscle without any of the curb appeal.  Bones that never shatter, that are stronger than human bone and lighter and would sooner bend than break.  Endogenous organelles in the brain that allow for direct information transfer with other brains or machines. Mouths vestigial.  Giant heads held aloft by these new bones and muscles, freed from the constraints to which previous human heads were subject.  Multiple sight organs aligned in bands reflecting the various parts of the EM spectrum each one covers, with each band covered by a black carapace.  Structures that previously protected us from fighting injuries, like sturdy eyesockets, brow ridges, cheekbones, nose bridges, and lantern jaws, vanished.  And hair abandoned as an obsolete sign of health and method for regulating body temperature. Basically, A new crop of kids will rise up who look like the gal at the top of this answer. What, you thought that was a male? Be nice, this is your great-granddaughter we're talking about!  :) Stage 9.1:  Those kids scare the shit out of people who aren't little gray aliens. Stage 9.2: Those kids and their parents use their advantages to ensure they're not pogrommed into oblivion, which also will involve them securing a lot of wealth or power for themselves. Stage 10: Other people realize they either make their offspring have some of the same traits as the little alien weirdos, or their offspring will be second-class citizens, in fact will be a different and subservient species to the weirdos. Stage 11:  We're a new species.   General answer, in which I am much more confident: Evolution is change via evolutionary algorithm.  So if we just manually change our own genes or augment ourselves with machinery, that is not evolution per se.   But if we really are about to embark on a great experiment in modifying ourselves both by gene and by machine, we might soon discover that the best modifications are found through the aid of evolutionary algorithms, rather than straight old fashioned engineering and design.   So let's say that happens.  Evolutionary algorithms can be tweaked to solve problems beyond the basic one in nature, \"Which variety of things can keep existing in this environment?\"  They can be tweaked almost at will.  So, will humans evolve themselves to handle pollution?  Entirely possible.  Will humans evolve nature to deal with pollution before it reaches our bodies?  Entirely possible.  Will humans evolve themselves to conform to old ideas of environmental fitness, hardwired into our brains and evident on the cover of every magazine?  Super duper possible. And let's say somehow we *don't* do any genetic engineering on ourselves.  Evolution will still eventually happen.  According to the latest estimates, separated populations will diverge into separate species every 50,000 generations to 100,000 generations.  That also implies with a little bit of inference that after 2 million years a single species could not reproduce with its ancestors from 2 million years earlier.  And this is an average. Like the average speed of the water in a river, there are places where the water almost stands still and places where it rushes faster.   If this seems without evidence, please understand that the evidence for it involves the genes and bones and bodies and gravesites of many many different species. If you want a simpler analogy, think about how language changes over time. It is usually possible for someone to understand a speaker of their \"same\" language from 200 years ago but not from 1000 years ago and definitely not from 2000 years ago.  That is how language evolves, and genes evolve the same way only 1000 times more slowly. ",

Over the past few hundred years, due to industrial revolution the amount of physical work got reduced tremendously and people instead of doing lot of physical works in fields, forests and on manual basic mechanical devices, they started to sit in offices and homes comfortably doing nearly zero physical word as compared to previous era. These changes occurred so rapidly that it didn't allowed evolution and natural selection to work (changes occur over thousands of years and the group of individuals which are responsive and adaptable to change are selected by the nature). As a result all basic functions of the human body such as metabolism couldn't adapt with the changes in the lifestyle. Theoretically speaking as the energy needs of the human have decreased, the metabolism rate should have declined too. but this didn't happened. Also the various stress related works tremendously increased the consumption of tobacco, alcohol etc. (although people are consuming alcohol for centuries but it was never purified to get a high concentration as these days). this resulted in the diseases like Diabetes, Atheroscelerosis, obesity, blood pressure etc.but as the time will continue the evolution will do its job and the persons who will be responsive and better adaptable to these changes will increase.  The other major change is not gonna happen in humans rather humans are going to face it as a threat. There will be evolution of super bugs. As humans are evolving, there immune system is also evolving and it is becoming more resistant to pathogens. With the development of Antibiotics, almost all the diseases which were considered deadly earlier are easily treatable these days. But as on one hand these changes are occurring, pathogens are also evolving side by side (you can easily observe this as the antibiotics which were used few decades back are useless today as the are not responsive on the pathogens anymore). So eventually highly evolved bugs which will not be responsive to almost all antibiotics will come into picture. But as each coin has two faces, humans in their quest to eradicate them will keep developing more advanced drugs.  Further we can hope to see the vestigial parts of the body disappeared. Since the physical work is reduced so much the physical strength of the human might be reduced as the evolution occurs. They can get more adaptive to the today's environment such as more tolerant to the Ultravoilet rays. the human race may become \"hairless\" over the time period and the cranial capacity might get increased leading to the increase in the size of the head. Over the time the human race may be able to evolve above the concept of religion and might start to think as a species. ",

            "answer_text": "There is no way to estimate what evolution will do to H. sapiens because we cannot know what future environments will be like.  However, I do not think you have considered how difficult it is to make evolutionary changes in large populations.  Whenever any species has a large population that is well-adapted to the environment, it is very difficult for any evolutionary change in that population.  It is the \"stasis\" part of punctuated equilibrium. For there to be an \"evolutionary step\" as you are thinking of it, a new allele, or combination of alleles (forms of genes) needs to spread to the entire population.  Evolutionary biologists speak of the \"effective population\" N, which is the number of individuals who can breed (for sexually reproducing organisms).  Even under severe selection, it takes at least 0.5 N generations for a trait to spread through the population. The total human population is about 7 billion.  Let's be conservative and say that only 4 billion are capable of breeding, with 50% male and 50% female.  A generation is 20 years.  With the current human population, 0.5 N = 2 billion and with a 20 year generation time that is 40 billion years for any trait to become fixed!  The entire species H. sapiens is not changing soon! An implication for this is that population sizes for H. sapiens were much, much less in the past.   And that is the case.  This paper -- http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1832099/ -- estimates the effective population size to be 3100 to 7500 for most of the history of H. sapiens.  This paper -- http://www.pnas.org/content/111/2/757.full.pdf -- estimates that the effective population size has been about 10,000 people until about 140 generations ago.   ",

            "answer_text": "There is a great deal of confusion about \"evolution\".  It is an unfortunately chosen word, to say the least.  Darwin spoke of \"survival of the fittest\", which is far better, and a complete phrase would be \"survival of the fittest through procreation\". There is actually no such thing as \"evolution\".  The word conjures up images of species becoming better, improving.  This was never the implication according to Darwin.  His term \"natural selection\" provides a better hint.  The key here is that statistically, in a given species and under given circumstances, certain genetic anomalies may cause particular members of a species to be better disposed to survive through procreation.  There is certainly chance involved, in two ways.  Firstly, genetic mutation results purely as a result of errors in the genetic copying process when eggs / sperm are generated.  Secondly, survival to procreation obviously has a great deal of chance involved, especially when procreation happens at the age of 14+ as is typically the case in humans. Next important factor.  Humans no longer have any significant natural enemies.  Sure, there is disease to some minor degree, but in most first-world areas the mortality as a result of disease is at a rate so low that it is pretty much insignificant. This last means that in any population of humans living in first-world conditions, there is no significant selective pressure.  Any number of these humans who choose to will be able to breed.  Selection for procreation amongst humans has become an issue of conscious choice, not one of survival. Long story short - there is no selective pressure on the majority of the human population.  We are not \"evolving\" and have not done so for a very, very long time. The correct answer to your question : There is no next major step.   There is no evolution.  We are a species at the end of our selective existence, unless circumstances change dramatically at some point in the future. A modifier on the above, just for fun.  The largest \"selective\" pressure being exerted on the first-world human population at present is due to the conscious decision to have few if any children by large numbers of humans falling in certain demographic categories.  I will leave the reader to contemplate the dominant characteristics of these humans.  They are being selected (are selecting themselves) for progressive extinction.   The humans still choosing not to limit progeny under most circumstances are being selected for survival.  Draw your own conclusions. ",

In other words, our technologies and cultures have been the implements making the human population \"smarter,\" not major physiological changes to our brains, themselves.  The big exception to this \"rule\" was the development of language, which may have happened in part as a result of sudden and dramatic downward pressure on the human population some 50,000-70,000 years ago. Whatever caused it, the development of language radically altered the cognitive destiny of homo sapiens sapiens. Trading systems, significantly more sophisticated tools and rich cultural practices all descended from our new ability to talk. It was literally the dawn of our species in its modern form.  My guess is that in our lifetimes or our children's lifetimes (much more if global civilization collapses first), humanity will start to see the beginnings of another shift that will be as profound as that one \u2013 a literal evolution of our internal cognitive capacities. I suspect that this shift will arise from the merging of computers + the internet with our brains.  The seeds of this massive overhaul are already being planted (implanted?) in monkeys and cognitively crippled humans. There are (very rudimentary) implantable brain-computer interfaces that allow people who can't speak to type out simple messages with the power of their thoughts alone. If you extrapolate that technology along a large enough horizon, you get to brains that can talk to the internet and an internet that can talk back to brains. If the world's mad scientists figure out how to safely and effectively implement internet-enabled brains, it's safe to say that the resulting animals wouldn't qualify as Homo sapiens sapiens anymore. Indeed, the differences between us and them would be as stark as those between pre-humans and humans. They would be post-human in every sense of the term. ",

            "answer_text": "Natural evolution will most likely not result in any changes in humans in the next 100 to 250 years.  There just isn't enough selective pressure to currently to result in any major changes in the gene pool.  Now, what I think could possibly occur is we might start doing artificial selection on our species or bioengineering/genetic engineering ourselves.   At a very simple level, people are already doing this.  There are groups such as the Fertility Institutes ( http://www.gender-selection.com/?gclid=CO241JaH-JgCFRxNagodVX7DnAthat ) that allow people to screen in vitro generated embryos to make sure the ones that get implanted do not have genetic diseases, and pick things like gender, etc.  Other companies such as gene security networks (Gene Security Network in race for prenatal test - San Francisco Business Times ) will allow couples to easily screen naturally conceived fetuses for genetic diseases.   If these type of technologies become more main stream, you may see increased selective pressure against deleterious recessive alleles, say if the parents choose not only to screen out homozygotes recessive embryos but heterozygous carrier embryos as well.  Of course these technologies will most likely only be available for the wealthy.  At this point I am getting into non-scientific speculation, but given enough time I wonder if there might be a divide between rich and poor not just in the distribution of wealth but the distribution of genetic fitness as well.  If the technologies become available to screen out negative traits, and potentially even select for positive traits in our offspring, one might expect a GATTACA (Gattaca (1997)) esc reality where you have a genetically \"superior\" upper class and a genetically disadvantaged lower class.   It's really hard to say though as currently, it is really hard to know what actually causes complex traits like intelligence, athletic ability, etc.   Synthetic biology could also come into play in the future.  For example, science can currently give monkeys that only have two color receptors a third color receptor, effectively taking color blind monkeys and giving them the ability to see in the full range of colors that non-color blind humans can see (Gene Therapy Cures Color-Blind Monkeys | Wired Science | Wired.com) .  Now humans have 3 color receptors, but some birds have 4 and can see in the UV spectrum.  Could we engineer humans that could see in the UV spectrum?  It's not that far fetched,  even with current technologies. What might future technologies allow for? I doubt humans will change at all through NATURAL selection anytime in the near future, but some subset of humans might be changed through artificial selection (ie genetic screening) or synthetic biology (bio/genetic engineering) applied to our species.

            "answer_text": "The next big step for human evolution is to reach Kardashev 1. Although it's technically a level of civilization rather than evolution. At K1, humans would reach a level where we will eradicate many chronic diseases, poverty, health span would reach over the hundred, energy and food would be essentially free. We would be able to stop catastrophes such as hurricanes, earthquakes and volcanic eruptions. We would have colonies on the moon, Mars and perhaps other moons such as Titan and Enceladus. Evolution works according to the pace of the environment. If an environment changes rapidly, evolution keeps pace to adapt to those changes. We have become hairless since we invented clothing. Whilst 6 months in the space station alters your body so much you would lose half your muscles and skeletal structure and would have much trouble walking back on earth. In that 6 months you were evolving into a space being. Humans on Mars would not have the same body structure as those on Earth. They would probably be taller and thinner and use less oxygen. Humans have directed our own evolution since we leveraged instead of using just our capacity. Using clothes, fire, spears and so many other tools which you can say as early technology. So our evolution has mainly been brains and being civilized. Brains and civility has been Sexy. Natural evolution as species in the wild is kill or be killed, steal when you can, rape when it's possible. It's not Evil, it's natural. Civility is to be above nature and above natural tendencies towards the ability to advance civilization towards a much greater cause and humans do love the good life. Who wants great Healthcare? Cheap energy, less work and more pay? Great entertainment? K1 will give us all that and much more. We are at k0. 8 now and could reach K1 by 2099. Not bad for a hairless ape. ",

Long story short, the idea is that we all carry smart phones around and are effectively rendered into cyborgs. The trick is that the connection between the phone and our brain is very low bandwidth, meaning information can only transfer as fast as your eyes can read and your thumb can swipe. The dream of a true BMI which Ray Kurzweil has been predicting for years will come in the form of cloud-connected nanobots, is the idea that the power of the smart phone can be connected directly to our brain in order to massively up the data transfer and enable things like brain to brain communication. Multi-Planetary Species Once we settle another planet, quite possibly Mars, a massive asteroid could vaporize Earth and the human race would continue. This fact of becoming multi-planetary is an evolutionary step because our biological instinct to seek new lands on Earth for greater safety or more abundant resources will be replaced by the desire to spread to more and more planets. That means that a portion of us could in fact become a star species, \u201cStella Sapiens\u201d if you will. There would be a distinct divide between those humans who stay on Earth and those who seek refuge on distant planets. Ammortality CRISPR is a gene-editing technology that may prove to be the greatest invention of the 21st century. It\u2019s explained wonderfully in this TED talk by it\u2019s inventor Jennifer Doudna. As the technology matures, it will ultimately mean that we can prune our DNA as easily as we\u2019d prune a rose bush. Once we can edit our genes with great precision, cancer, auto-immune disorders like MS or ALS, and all other genetic disorders will disappear. In addition, the pesky problem of aging will also disappear. Companies like Calico Labs view aging as a problem to be solved, not an inevitability. If you think of the human body like a car, we now have the technology to keep fixing the car and letting it run forever (barring some sort of freak accident\u2026hence ammortality and not immortality).

So the next urgent step in the evolution of the human species is not genetic but behavioural and social system structure and function --- change to rational process to run our social system and upgrade our social system into a rational system to accommodate this rational process. Only this way, human can open the way to far future. Otherwise all of us (in one ring of the chain of life in future) will be extinct and there is no need to predict our biological evolution --- there is no existence therefore no evolution. This prediction is based on the natural law of: natural process always brings destructive effects on manmade structure. And the fact that our social system had evolved into a highly manmade structure but still run by the good old natural process ever since life began 3.5 billion years ago. But there is another fundamental law of the nature that govern human relation with nature: any manmade interference into natural order will cause disordering effects in nature. Therefore, any manmade genetic modification that not following the natural laws will cause disordering effects on ourselves and cause deficiency or inefficiency of our own biological evolution. Order is beauty. Order is efficiency. There is power in efficiency. It wouldn\u2019t take a genius to predict that future human will be more beautiful and more intelligent therefore more powerful. All the so called aliens\u2019 images are fakes --- any alien species that have higher evolution level than us will necessarily be more beautiful and more powerful than us. These images are against the thermodynamic laws, therefore, untrue. No need to adore gods, future human will be more beautiful and more powerful than the gods you can imagine, if we can strictly follow the laws of the nature to open our way to far future. Stop thinking make manmade changes in our genetic structure and the natural order in the natural system to suit our \u201cneeds\u201d, start to make rational manmade change in the process and system of our society. That can open the way for us to reach far future by keeping the real value on the Earth in the best possible conditions and last the longest time span the Earth natural life span allow. Rationally and humanely planned use of the resources and arrange our population, minimise the consumption of real value and the production of use value, while maximise the production of creation, discovery. Change our focus on pursuit of material wealth and material power to spiritual pursuit of discovery and creation. That kind of social environment only can be made possible by changing our society to a rational process run rational system. It is not a fairy tale. It is realisable. \u201cThe sea of sufferings is boundless, turn your head is the shore\u201d. ",

            "answer_text": "Human evolution: there are a few trends in reproduction which will likely produce an noticeable overall change in the world's population within the next few hundred years. The tendency for educated, working mothers is: delayed conception, fewer offspring, more cesarean deliveries, and a greater likelihood of mating with a male who is genetically distant. As for the offspring produced in developed countries, we are seeing more autism, auto-immune diseases, obesity and taller children. Skin color is moving away from the extremes and toward medium pigmentation--mostly as a result of increased genetic variety in matings as immigration increases and cultural taboos fall by the wayside. Microbial evolution: the outstanding selective pressure on infectious microbes is the medical community's overuse of antibiotics. The exposure of bacteria that live in, on and around patients in hospitals to a wide range of antibiotics year after year is gradually (some people would say rapidly) leading to the development of strains of multiple antibiotic resistant bacteria such as the infamous Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). A similar selective pressure also affects eukaryotic parasites. The four species of the malaria parasite Plasmodium which affect humans are becoming resistant to chloroquine and other key antimalarial drugs. Much the same situation exists with resistant organisms that cause plant disease. Aquatic organisms: with influences such as warming temperatures, overfishing, oxygen depletion, acidification and effluent (sewage and runoff); marine and fresh water species of all types are finding their environment dramatically changed. The resulting trend is toward reduced diversity and increased microbial life. None of the above will directly result in an evolutionary change for a particular species, per se, until the selective pressure(s) provide an advantage for genetically mutated individuals to survive while the wild type (un-mutated) population dies off. That is, unless one considers extinction as an example of evolutionary change, in which case the next step in evolution will be achieved when the next endangered species disappears from the Earth. Sorry to be so negative, but nature is bloody in tooth and claw. There is a great deal more to discuss on this topic...the above is a start. ",

            "answer_text": "Given that natural selection has been basically eradicated from humans in developed countries (even the infertile individuals can produce healthy offspring!), and that we are not too far from successful complex genetic engineering, the most reasonable guess is that from now on human evolution will be by artificial, voluntary decisions.  Sure enough there will be heated debates about the need of regulating this practice, but let's face it, when the technology exists, it will be nearly impossible to ban it. Future generations will become more open to it because they will have already been born in a society which acknowledges the technology and will be using it extensively for a multitude of purposes in other organisms. Sooner or later people will want to do some engineering on themselves or on their offspring. But I guess it will be close to impossible to get all the population to agree on applying a certain mutation to the whole of mankind, except perhaps for some which prevent serious illnesses. Most likely individuals will choose different mutations, and possibly one of the regulations will be the requirement to maintain the ability to interbreed with all the rest of humans. So individual mutations will gradually get mixed with others in many ways. Very possibly we will become able to see better, to hear better, to breathe better, to better support physical fatigue, to smell better (although that might not always be a good idea), we will live quite much longer healthy...  One the physical side I have little doubt that we will change quite a bit. A much more uncertain question is whether we will be able to do anything regarding our intellectual faculties. ",

Ironically, the more we evolve in the social development and technological progress of our society, the less we\u2019re likely to evolve significantly in the next thousands of years, or rather we should say that the more likely it is that the evolution of our species will become extremely slow compared with those species that, unlike in our \u201cman-made world\u201d, depend entirely on the natural environment and their stricly biological adaptations. If we manage to avoid any big disaster or social-economic kickback, I\u2019d expect the next big steps for humankind to come not from natural selection and evolution, but from artificial processes, perhaps even including some meddling into our genome to eliminate certain genetic tendencies to disease or other unfavorable characteristics. Physically, as a species, though, my expectation and also my hope is that the natural pressures of evolution - which inevitably involve the massive death of all those who aren\u2019t fit enough for the new environmental conditions - will be much reduced, and we\u2019ll see only minor changes, for the better or for the worse, even in a very long period of 100,000 years or even more than that. Just consider that, even when we lived as simple hunter gatherers exposed to the many changes of the world (including severe Ice Ages!), we have still evolved only in slightly discrete respects in the last 200,000 years and, particularly, in the last 50,000 years. And that was before modern science and technologies reduced our death rate from an average 4\u20135% every year to just 0.5\u20131.0% per year. ",

Also, gene manipulation has a role to play as I see it.  In terms of gene manipulation, we have the opportunity to eradicate genetic disorders from the Human race, as well as to cure diseases in adults. This (if used right), gives us the chance to make the Human species less prone to disease, longer lived, age slower, be smarter, healthier, stronger etc. But the chance of misuse is high, and there is no guarantee the benefits will be equally shared.  In terms of merging with computers/technology, you are doing it right now! This has been a steady trend for many years that is speeding up due to the internet, wearable technology, cybernetic limbs, electronic implants etc. The internet has given the Human race a kind of central nervous system, and a means of sharing information, thoughts and ideas almost instantaneously. I can see a day not too distant, when people receive implants whereby their brains are directly linked to the internet, kind of like a giant Facebook, merged with Google. This would make paper or plastic money obsolete, since your body is part of the online world.  Both themes have the potential for good, or for harm. I am optimistic and see it heading in this direction. If a colony is established on Mars, then the next evolution will be tall, skinny, thin boned Martians. ",

            "answer_text": "Excellent question. I\u2019m going to give you what I expect will be a rather contentious answer. First off, forget biological evolution. Human beings are still evolving to better suit our current, decidedly unnatural environment, but that evolution is no longer very effective in terms of shaping the nature of our species. For one thing, we have managed to neutralize the process of natural selection. The vast majority of the people now live long enough to procreate many times over, regardless of their fitness for survival. In terms of the human condition, that\u2019s an outstanding achievement. But it\u2019s catastrophic for the mechanism that brought us to this point. Second, to the extent that evolution is still at work on our species, it is simply too slow to have any real impact given the pace of change in today\u2019s technological world. Put these two factors together, and biological evolution is essentially irrelevant to the future of our species. Fortunately, a new kind of evolution has taken its place: cultural evolution. The tenets of human cultures are transmitted across generations, not unlike genes, but they are subject to change within the lifetime of an individual. So, even though our brains are still grounded in our evolutionary habitat of the savanna, the way we think and communicate are changing rapidly. So the question really becomes: What is the next step in *cultural* evolution. I truly wish I knew the answer to that question. Here\u2019s the good news: The shift to cultural evolution means the future of our species is entirely in our own hands. We have become, in a very real sense, our own creators. Unfortunately, that\u2019s also the bad news. Our forager brains, with their deeply rooted me-and-my-tribe survival instincts, simply don\u2019t equip us for tackling problems on a global scale. Think about it. There are seven and a half billion of us on this planet today, and in less than 35 years that number will jump to ten billion. Supporting this many people in the style to which we\u2019ve all become accustomed (or are striving to achieve) is taxing the planet beyond its limits. Being a member of the \u201cduck and cover\u201d generation, I always figured that the greatest danger to our species was thermonuclear war, but it now seems to me that we\u2019ll probably just suck our planet dry of its natural resources before we can make the leap to other planets. Now comes the most contentious part. I think cultural evolution could take is in an entirely new and much more durable direction. I\u2019m talking about the leap from flesh and blood to silicon and steel. If we didn\u2019t live in such fragile shells with such demanding environmental requirements, we could easily be in space already and colonizing planets that could never support organic forms of life. Of course, this proposition raises all kinds of challenging questions. Is it possible? Is it likely? Would it still be \u201cus\u201d? Addressing those questions would go way beyond the original question, but here\u2019s quick preview: The answers are yes, yes, and, in the ways that matter most, yes. ",

Evolution is most easily viewed over geological time and there's no simple to conclusively assign a species' genome at one particular time as a concrete \"form.\"  The entire process is better understood as a continuum.  The more time that passes between genomic state X and the subsequent genomic state Y, the more changes are likely to have taken place. The following analogy ignores the fact that evolution concerns itself with populations not individuals, but I think it's still helpful in understanding the nature of change: If you have a child it's unlikely you'll notice any change in his appearance from day to day.  Early on even a month or two is sufficient to notice significant change, but it still occurs too slowly to be able to see it overnight.  Some people, unfamiliar with the concept of children, might spend a week or two with your child and wonder out loud if it's really true that these \"children\" things could ever possibly turn into adults.  That would be naive, of course.  But there is an illuminating question in there somewhere:  when does a child change its form from that of a chld to that of an adult? Never.  It's easy to look at a photo and say with reasonable certainty \"this is a child\" or \"this is a teenager.\"  But the fact remains that the days before and after each photo was taken the person looked essentially the same.  This is equally true of populations.  And since any given fossil is a single representation of one member of a population it's useful to try to place it somewhere in the phylogenetic tree.  But the fact is that I probably look quite different from you despite our both belonging to homo sapiens sapiens circa 2012.  Is this a limit of evolutionary biology?  I don't think so, and the precision of our understanding increases with every fossil found.  Critics who demand \"missing links\" are missing the point here.  They incorrectly assume that species A suddenly gives birth to species B.  But the reality is any differences from one generation to the next are so minor as to be visible only by sequencing DNA, if at all. If you were to phrase your question differently, setting either an arbitrary amount of time passed or an arbitrarily conspicuous amount of obvious physical difference then it would at least adhere to the way scientists think about evolution.   And then my answer would be I have no idea.  I don't even know what constitutes selective pressure for us now considering how much control we have over our environment.  Like the shark, we may be quite well suited to our environment and so remain comparatively unchanged for untold thousands of years.   Get back to me in a million years and we can both laugh about this. ",

            "answer_text": "It is possible that the next big mutation/advance (such as an even larger brain) occurred hundreds of years ago but might not ever be predominant in future generations. Natural selection works best in smaller populations in a tighter geographic spread and within less intelligent species, when a change in biology enhances the survivability of the species via individuals that do better at survival while those with only the former biology die younger, especially prepubescent. Human beings no longer depend totally on bodily adaptation to a harsh environment, because we use intelligence, mechanical machinery, chemical adaptations, medicine, artificial immunology, prosthetics, herding, farming, food manufacture, irrigation, fertilizer, insulated housing, and harnessing energy to manipulate the environment to promote our greatest safety. People born without vital organs can now live to procreate. With the exception of man-made pollution, antibiotic resistant bacteria, and retro viruses, mankind has solved almost every limitation of premature death. The leading cause of non-accidental death is self-inflicted: high sugar high fat diet in a sedentary environment, leading to diabetes, heart attacks, cancer, obesity, COPD, and possibly Alzheimer's, are all things that kill people after puberty therefore, therefore, whether a gene mutated to better handle these chronic conditions or not, would have almost no effect on human evolution. All that said, the one likely thing that could wipe out a very large portion of humanity is disease. In this case, it would probably kill many children and many women of childbearing age, changing the gene pool. The ones that survive will be the ones that already had a genetic predisposition to handle the deadly bacteria or virus, meaning, it probably has already been in our gene pool for several generations.

Or spit a material like spider web\u2026? well usually I like to provide some space for weird possibilities but in this case the possibility for such a big leap is highly low in close or long future\u2026 Let me explain my self. In order to evolution take place there must be a balance between death and birth. Lot\u2019s of children must be born and lot\u2019s of them must die due to a reason (famine, plague, wars, super predators\u2026or may be an alien invasion). And among these survivors lots of children must born again and lots of deaths should follow. After numerous cycles some of the children become more capable of dealing with this killing factor due to a difference in their body, in their mental capacity or else\u2026 Actually this process took place between the hunter animals and their preys. If any of the hunter or the prey has become more agile so the other as well. Because both are mutually dependent. For human evolution, it looks like there is no hunter animal exist (at least not yet) to exert such a pressure on humans. Among other things, I bet that a candidate with such capability will come into view from the micro world instead of macro one. And we humans are shaping this beast with our antibiotics.  When antibiotics resistant bacteria become common, lots of death among humans will occur. And in the long run this will cause pressure on human immunity system to evolve. So, the possible \u201cbig leap\u201d might occur in our immunity system but not in our appearance or physical powers. On the other hand, there is one possibility I mentioned in above paragraphs - among reasons that will cause deaths - that might cause a big leap. The possibility is an alien invasion (there are tons of explanations of how it is impossible for such an encounter\u2026but when you think the endless possibilities exist in the universe and beyond, there is still a minor possibility\u2026)  They might hunt us and cause an evolutionary pressure on our biology. The ones that manage to evade and reproduce will lay the way to our \u201cbig leap\u201d. Just watch this video of Neil DeGrasse Tyson for a comparison between chimps - human and possible aliens\u2026we might be chimps to them\u2026 If humanity encounter such an alien race, then there is a possibility for a big leap in our evolution, unless we are not wiped out.

            "answer_text": "Increasing genetic damage to human beings will likely feature more strongly in the century to come, so that gene therapy to correct diseases caused by defective genetics will become common, for the rich predominantly. The poor will be subjected, widely, to an increasingly industrialized diet (which has already started with the mass production of refined foods with a long shelf life from preservative use) and standardized healthcare, if they get any at all. Healthcare will be rationed, since the demand will always now outstrip supply of available services. Medical technology costs per intervention may reduce, but the overall costs of care will massively increase to an unaffordable level for many countries to have the best technology. This is not a new phenomenon. How does this work for or against any kinds of possible \u2018evolutionary\u2019 effects? For \u2018evolutionary change\u2019, I read \u2018adaptation, vigour and resistance to disease\u2019. FIRST: There are no other evolutionary changes possible, since man is not an evolved animal: There will be no \u2018evolutionary\u2019 changes in human beings, because the spontaneous increase of beneficial genetic factors and features in human beings has not been shown to be feasible in any organism, let alone mammalian life and human beings. There is simply no evidence that there have been any such events in the past, other than adaptive changes which all populations of creatures have built into their biology as a capability. Other than engineered changes made by medical science, other changes are very unlikely to benefit the human race. It is possible that there may be some major breakthroughs in medicine that could remove or reduce the effect of genetic destruction / damage with ageing, and so benefit populations as a whole. But this type of change is unlikely to be passed on as a permanent \u2018fix\u2019 in genes. It seems we are programmed to die, and nobody - scientifically speaking - really know why. But what do we know? I may be too pessimistic, and science may find a way to increase overall life expectancy again. Some of this likely increasing genetic damage to human beings may, nevertheless continue to occur: This will come from degeneration of the quality of the environment \u2014 pollution of fish stocks and the land with with heavy metals, carcinogenic poisons, and general long term destruction of the oceans from over-fishing - a tragedy which will take a hundred years perhaps or more to complete (and is increasingly damaging most food fish stocks, potentially irrecoverably). However, it will probably come, despite the environmental care efforts that some nations are making. Others, such as China are doing little if anything to to prevent it, and Spain, Japan, and many other nation\u2019s are effectively raping the seas. A slow deteriorating in agricultural food source quality is also likely, again partly due to pollution and overuse of soils, and manipulation of some food by inbreeding and incorrectly applied (harmful) genetic engineering. However this could be prevented by concerted international efforts to manage the survival of original strains of crops. Genetic engineering is likely to be successful at producing more tonnage of food, but there will be an effect of reduction of quality in some cases, due to adverse side effects, some of which are already known in food crops. Resistance to one problem, for example, can mean susceptibility to other diseases, or even increased parasitic risk. New side-effects and potential problems, as well as migration of genetically engineered crops and infection of traditional stocks of food crops with new diseases and genetic modifications could occur. Science would best try to avoid these of course with good management, to maintain variety and hybrid vigour. But that can only be done if the world is at peace and work can continue internationally to best effect. This is not the case, and the most vulnerable nations are those whose need is greatest for reliable food. All these things are likely to put significant pressure on the genetic load (damaged genes) in human beings, and genetic \u2018devolution\u2019 (damage and reduced health), not evolution, will come to pass. It is going to be a tough future surviving increasing population and high and higher technological civilisation, where there are few scientists whose conservation and preventative work is taken seriously by governments.

            "answer_text": "Given that our habitat stays reasonably the same (global warming considered as gradual, within range of sufficient human adaptation, or alterable and thus a non-extinction event), and lack of a significant and far-reaching mutation, the next stage may involve humans responding to the fastest changing thing in our environment: technology. In particular, this would include the exponential growth in hardware capability (including speed and miniaturization), the increased sophistication of programs, and the advanced integration of this technology into daily activities. Of course, those affected most by these will change the most, which might lead to evolutionary divergence based upon access to technology. The change would be more neurological at first, and neuroscientists are already studying it. There is strong evidence that the brains of younger people exposed to technology are showing signs of adaptation and possible physiological changes in brain function. Such favorable traits could then be passed on through natural selection.http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3432415/pdf/nihms390131.pdf http://www.rewireme.com/journeys/the-future-of-intelligence-is-the-human-brain-still-evolving/ Some neuroscientists see it as a threat.http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-565207/Modern-technology-changing-way-brains-work-says-neuroscientist.html Others see it as an eventuality to which we can adapt.http://blogs.kqed.org/mindshift/2011/02/how-technology-wires-the-learning-brain/ Biological and physiological changes could follow, but these would probably be more gradual. Integration of technology directly with human biology through implants or accessories could cause more rapid physiological change.  Though genetic manipulation of humans is also upon us, the goal at present is not to alter human evolution but to correct defects in our species that lead to disease and premature death. http://www.forbes.com/sites/daviddisalvo/2014/01/26/the-era-of-genetically-altered-humans-could-begin-this-year/  Therefore, I feel that the influx of technology and possible integration of technology will have more immediate influence on human evolution over the next 50 years. Either way, evolution takes time. Hence the theoretical situation where computer technology advances faster than human evolution, leading to some form of Artificial Intelligence that either helps humans or finds them irrelevant or a threat. Sounds far fetched to some, but it is a theoretical possibility with an undetermined probability. I hope somewhere smart minds are embedding code in common programs that will direct computer programs of the future to be protective of humans and human progress. Now is the time to outsmart them, not later. ",

Now, how does evolution takes place? Its simple- a charateristic that enables an organism to have more offsprings that will bring offsprings as well is the one that becomes \"dominant\" in his species. So all we must do is look at what enables us, humans, to survive.There's a problem, though. We humans, the majority of us, survives and brings kids. People usually have kids with one person. So a quality would spread through mankind not through surviving, because the modern world enables us to survive in western countries. Qualities would spread simply through a lot of kids. And I'm afraid that those who have alot of kids are mostly people in third world countries and religious muslims/jews. So one could say, as a wild guess, that our next \"\"evolutionary step\" is the need or will to make a lot of kids. How unfortunate. We killed natural selection. ",

In these days, due to birth control, only people who want children get children. Any genes that are in any way beneficial in wanting to have children will now have major advantages over genes that do not, much more then in previous times. Another one is: be able to flourish and get children in a megacity.If you don't like noise, don't like crowds, you would not have a major disadvantage in older days, most people lived outside the city. That is changing. If you can not flourish in big cities, in such a way that it influences you getting a partner and having children, your genes will die out soon. ",

            "answer_text": "The characteristics that will define us in the future will be the characteristics that mean the difference between life and death today.  Taking this into consideration in today's society, I see that a very large percentage of the human population is dependent on a steady supply of food and water delivered to them, sometimes across unfathomably large distances. Given the proper conditions (a blackout, a natural/man-made disaster, a crop failure/drought), people dependent on this system are far less likely to survive than those who live by fresh water and are capable of growing their own food. Survivors of such a disaster would learn to avoid such a catastrophe by growing food and obtaining water locally, without putting too much pressure on the environment. Because such unpleasant realities are not only possible but probable, I see our species naturally evolving to re-obtain harmony with nature, while also conscientiously striving to make ourselves more independent from nature's side-effects with our knowledge. For example, changing agriculture to make it use less harmful fertilizers and less water, while also optimizing production to better address local needs and demands. What many humans are doing today simply cannot go on; we are the creators of this inefficient system our existence relies on, and sooner or later it will fail us. We must adapt and reevaluate the relationship between the environment, our technology, and our needs, and make changes so that separately they will no longer determine our fate, but rather combined, insure our survival.

            "answer_text": "For those that believe in Evolution ? :) Evolution is not matter of personal choice - believing in it or not it is a fact (at least for now) and probably one not of many that is has all chances for withstanding the test of time. 1) Abundance of food. When this does not apply for all people on the planet it is something that is a fact (and would have applied for all unless there were so many conflicts). That in theory should make us less fat since the need of storing would no longer be to any advantage for survival. So we could become more thin`n`skinny. 2) Resistance. Very few people can claim and say that they eat 'healthy' in terms of clean, not contaminated food and water. The food that most people eat, the water that most people eat is far from the one our ancestors were taking. Probably that would make us more resilient to toxicity and it is quite possible that if you take a dude from say 10 000 years ago and feed him with what we eat/drink that would be the end of him. Furthermore - living in the city adds to resistance as well. Most books/tv shows tend to focus on how dangerous this is in terms of say a virulent infection spreading but they tend to miss how useful this is to developing resistance since you are exposed to much more pathogens. And you are still alive. :) So our bodies would become more resilient to pathogens.  3) Controlling our evolution. That I guess would be our biggest achievement. We are no longer subject to natural selection as before. We have created an artificial environment in which we more or less thrive. It is completely possible that in near future we'll start controlling the way we evolve or at least be able to control the process thus speeding up what otherwise take a millions of years (with no guarantees of success). We'd be able to change our bodies as we please.  4) Many, many more things that are direct effect of our current way of living. ",

            "answer_text": "Less death is good for individuals, but bad for the species. We will be taller, and will have a lot more disabilities. And bigger heads and narrower hips. Smaller brains.  This fella is a cave salamander. It\u2019s blind. It lost its eyesight because it didn't need it in a dark cave - in other words, having crappy eyes didn't stop them from surviving and having baby salamanders. Then having really crappy eyes had no effect either. Then having no eyes also didn't have an impact. So the entire species lost its eyes simply because salamanders with poor eyesight did not die off in the cave environment they live it. Most genetic mutations (brought on by background radiation) are benign, some of them are harmful (i.e. the first mutation that lead to Type 1 diabetes) and very rarely, some mutations give you a new useful trait [i.e. lactose tolerance so you can drink up that cow juice for extra energy]. Positive traits increase your likelihood of surviving and having kids which will inherit your trait, which in turn increases their chances of survival and having kids - on and on it goes until millennia down the line, A LOT of people are lactose tolerant. Go figure. The opposite situation occurs with negative traits, such as short-sightedness or type 1 diabetes etc. Historically, these things reduces your chances of survival or at least having lots of kids who survived to have their own kids. Basically, bad genetics[not suited for your particular situation] got weeded out through each generation. We now find ourselves in increasingly easier environments - short sightedness is fine, you don't have to spot a deer from 1000 yards, then chase it for miles like our ancestors and nowadays certain Ethiopian tribesmen [who seem to win all the long-distance marathons] do and spear it for food. Besides, we have glasses. \u2018Bad\u2019 genes are not being weeded out at historic rates which means they are increasingly promulgated in our species with each new generation which means each generation is slightly crappier than the previous one. The rate of genetic degradation is actually accelerating. There is a very respected theory now which is based on the current degradation of our genepool which predicts that the genetic degradation we are going through will be as bad, or worse, than global warming to the viability of complex human civilization. In a few centuries from now, we could have very few naturally healthy human beings - most child birth will be via C-section [women aren't dying in child birth from large baby-heads so more and more are born via C-section]. Eventually, natural births could be extremely rare. Good eyesight rare. Etc. Disabilities extremely common. How well could a civilization do when more than half of the population is [by today\u2019s standards] disabled? What if its 70%? or 90%? At what point is it no longer viable? Well that depends on our technology (i.e. whether we have implants that replace crappy eyes etc, or we simply use genetic engineering). On the flip side, tall men are more reproductively successful so average male height will increase. ",

For the first time in centuries a secure food supply and ready peace has been available across the Western world. This has meant two immediately noticeable changes.  Both men and women are growing to a fully nutritional based height which is usually anything up to 2-3 inches better than their parents. And for women it is also meaning an increase in cup size the average size going from a 34B to now a 36C There are also probably minor changes going on which are too minor to detect immediately but over a couple of annotated generations with concise records obvious differences will start to stand out. Futurists do some fun things like extrapolated outcomes based on longer term trend lines You end up with results like this    \u200b But the variables are constantly changing so the conclusion is based on a linear extrapolated outcome that doesn't allow for intricate random events to alter streamlined continuities.  What is best to say is that the future remains unwritten and undecided until the pivotal events take place. And under the best possible experience based predictions there is always glorious random chaos thrown in just to keep things interesting. ",

            "answer_text": "The most likely step in my opinion is not for individual homo sapiens to evolve into another species but for humans to coordinate and communicate so efficiently and cooperatively that we begin to act as if we are one organism. Humans have been trying to organize themselves in tribes, platoons, cities, institutions and nations for centuries. Our technology is now become sufficient to allow every human to communicate in concert. Typically, evolution applies to small groups where genes are then selected for due to outward pressure. This step is more analogous to the advent of multi-cellular organisms. The typically evolutionary pressures put on species barely apply any more to our species since we control our environments, food sources and predators. The main pressure that is evident in society today is our inability to communicate effectively. We focus our technological capabilities on whatever pressures we experience. This is why the cell phone continues to innovate. We want to function as a cohesive whole and those systems that do not facilitate this are succumbing to the pressure. How long this will take, or if we survive this transition, is not clear. What is clear is that communication is fundamental to our future. ",

            "answer_text": "The following thread was originally in response to \u201cFor those that believe in evolution, what changes will occur in the human body in the future?\u201d This thread disappeared for what ever reason so I have recreated it here.  Comments flanked by << and >> are those from Michael Howard. The rest are my comments.  Michael Howard <<lol, what if every question about gravity started with \"For those that believe in gravity,\u201d>> Gravity is not disputable but evolution is. Michael Howard <<Why isn't gravity disputable...? Why is evolution?>> Gravity can be confirmed any day of the week by anyone. Evolution can't be confirmed any day of the week. With Evolution, the best anyone can do is take someone else's word for it. Michael Howard << So are you saying you believe in gravity like you believe in God? >> I don't understand your reasoning. Gravity can be confirmed by anyone releasing an object at height. I never mentioned God but since you did, I'll say that God is probably logically deduced as cosmological cause. That would put God in a slightly different belief 'basket'. Michael Howard <<My reasoning was to deduce if you maintain an open mind on the theory of gravity, or if you hold it as an absolute truth. I'm still not sure of your position.>> Michael Howard << Even if you saw data to the contrary, and the world's scientists changed their opinion on the matter, you would still insist on the obsolete theory of gravity? >> I can't be sure till that happens but as long as the so-called 'scientists' weren't Evolutionists, they may still be credible. Michael Howard <<Ah, so you do have an open mind about gravity. This directly contradicts your statement: \"Gravity is not disputable\">> It is precisely because my words are too often taken out of context that I have to reiterate everything in minute details. I meant \u201cGravity is not seriously disputed but evolution is\u201d. Michael Howard <<It's absolutely disputable, but we do have overwhelming evidence that it's there and measurable. Just like evolution.>> Evolution is nowhere near the level of confirmation as gravity. I am sure you just take Evolutionists\u2019 word about the so-called \u2018overwhelming evidence that it's there and measurable\u2019. Michael Howard << Check out some of the answers here for a better perspective: Why do you believe in everything science tells you if you haven't been able to prove it yourself? What if something were a lie or just false?>> Michael Howard <<What is an \"Evolutionist\" and why are they not credible?>> I neglected the smiley at the end of that statement to indicate I was half joking. However, Evolutionists are never credible when their theories are based the idea of Evolution. That usually means their ideas of origins are totally wrong. An Evolutionist is someone who believes things can generally run against the entropy laws which must be among the most verifiable laws in science. So, instead of the entropy of life forms, chemistry, physics, and cosmology, they contrarily believe in Evolution of the Cosmos, Evolution of the Planet, and Evolution of Life. Michael Howard << Also, evolution has been confirmed for many days now. >> I suppose you are referring to the latest dug up primate jawbone touted as being evidence of human's Evolution. Aren't you just taking someone else's word for it, or do you have first hand evidence that the original owner of that jawbone had offspring with a lineage that can be traced to you? Michael Howard <<No, I'm talking about all the other evidence for evolution, like that we share DNA with trees and bacteria, and that we have a variety of dogs as pets, or that we eat corn.>> Your logic here is the same as an Astrologist using the rising sun and movement of other celestial bodies to \u2018confirm\u2019 astrology as being a legitimate belief. Just because a person of a certain belief can espouse truths for which there is evidence, that doesn\u2019t mean everything they say \u2018connects\u2019 with their belief. Just as Astronomy doesn\u2019t confirm Astrology, neither does gene-flow confirm Evolution. There is at least one much better theory. Michael Howard <<Watch these for an fuller understanding of evolution: YouTube... YouTube...>>  To reiterate what I wrote elsewhere and expand on the above\u2026 I strongly suspect you and 99% of Evolutionists confuse natural selection, which is real, with Evolution, which is pretend, so you think Evolution is real because you\u2019ve seen evidence for natural selection. The other 1% understand the difference (Being biologists or others with a real interest) but just mistakenly presume someone else has the evidence. Evolutionists give the name \u2018Evolution\u2019 to the over-arching principle of the uphill changes which happen just as real scientists give the name \u2018Entropy\u2019 to the real observable downhill changes. Evolutionists refer to the \u2018Evolution of the cosmos\u2019, the \u2018Evolution of the planet\u2019 etc \u2013 not just the \u2018Evolution of life\u2019. So, Evolution is not just Biological. It is the rearrangement of the Universe since the beginning. Biology is just one manifestation of the Universe continuum created by Evolution which first made the life-sustaining cosmos, then the life-sustaining planet, then the life-sustaining chemicals, then life itself. For this reason Evolution is Cosmological, Geological, Chemical and Biological. And, because Evolution fundamentalists deny anything other than Evolution\u2019s strict cause & effect material causes, Evolution must also be responsible for the pseudo-accidental firing of neurones and other workings in the brain, so Evolution determines not only our biological morphology but our neurological activity: It determines the way we think. If you don\u2019t like the way I think, you should blame Evolution. Evolution is the opposite of the Entropy laws. Evolution dictates information comes from nothing or chaos. According to Evolution, informational systems get more complex or \u2018run uphill\u2019. However, probably the most verified observation in science is the opposite: Without a mind creating a program to sustain that information, things run downhill, and information easily disappears on average when left to random events. When playing cards are shuffled, have you noticed how the deck gets more and more ordered the more you shuffle them? That's how Evolution works. Well, that's the theory. In reality, an ordered deck will become less and less ordered. That's entropy. Evolution Fundamentalists have made Evolution their god which has effectively created the Universe and life and sentient beings with a consciousness, hope, love, philosophies etc \u2013 all from nothing, which was previously the claim from monotheists with God, so the Fundamentalists have replaced one god with another. Really, what\u2019s the difference, and what\u2019s the benefit in Evolution over the competition? How did Evolution change anyone\u2019s life for the better? Check out countries in history where Evolution is strictly enforced as the state religion (eg. North Korea is a current prime example) and let me know if you prefer it to countries founded on Christian principles which allow freedom of religion. In case you haven\u2019t noticed, regardless of which belief, if any, teaches the true nature of the Universe\u2019s history, the \u2018origins\u2019 story that any given society chooses to believe then deeply impacts how that society operates. Biological evolution (with a small \u2018e\u2019) doesn\u2019t occur. The three \u2018R\u2019s of biological generational changes are: - \u2022 Recombination of existing genes. \u2022 Removal of existing genes. \u2022 Ruination of existing genes. All of this is real and evidenced and accounts for all biological changes. It\u2019s that simple. Some changes can be in a single generation so it doesn\u2019t require aeons. The above means great variety of genes may manifest in any given new and successive generation. None of it employs Evolution, and none of it contradicts the entropy laws. The Recombination of genes means that, even without mutations, the particular combination of (random) genes received from each parent in sexually reproducing creatures dictates the new generation\u2019s gene set. This new combination alone will create a creature with differences from the parents. Because gene information has not increased, this is not Evolution. The removal of genes occurs when the last survivor holding a particular gene dies, or the removal could be temporary in a lineage and regained when merging with another lineage that still does have the gene. Because gene information is lost, this is not Evolution. The ruination means gene information is lost. It may also be temporary unless the mutation is a hereditary one. Most aren\u2019t hereditary. Because gene information is lost, this is not Evolution. In the case of removal or ruination, the effect is loss of information. This is also known as devolution. It\u2019s possible that some of the removal or ruination could be beneficial such as may be the case with (A) fish losing their eyes in underground caves so one less prone organ set, and (B) beetles on windy islands losing wings, so less likely to be blown into the sea. However, the change is, nevertheless, loss of information and the trend means less functionality choice and less ability. Dogs are great examples of these three \u2018R\u2019s in action. Probably dogs all originated from a few breeding pairs being some kind of wolf. Humans have domesticated them over the ages and by artificial selection managed to keep out certain genes from lineages while simultaneously keeping in certain hereditary mutated genes. As a result we now have great variety of dogs with all all manner of mutated and mutually exclusive genes in their lineages producing varieties with short legs, droopy ears, long hair, high metabolism, dwarfism, missing snout, and the list goes on. Most of these traits are actually inheritable diseases you\u2019d never wish on a friend, yet are forced on \u2018man\u2019s best friend\u2019. Along with the disfigurement, the dogs may have lots of other worse inheritable diseases that have \u2018piggy-backed\u2019 on the breeding programs and become concentrated in their lineages through breeding with close relatives or others with the same diseases in their genes. Poodles are a typical example of this. Since few of these dogs can fend for themselves and generally require human care to survive, next time you see a pet dog, remember that you are probably looking at a 4-legged patient. Charles Darwin knew of the results of artificial selection and supposed it probably worked in the wild, too: That\u2019s natural selection, and it\u2019s real, so he was right about that. However, he made the mistake of assuming new genetic info could be created by nature and added to the lineages. That never happens, or if it has, it\u2019s never been recorded in a way that not easily disputed. Yet, if biological evolution were real, examples should abound. If you wanted to get an elephant\u2019s trunk on a poodle, the only way is through genetic engineering. Given a perfectly equipped laboratory and enough time, it would still be impossible through just natural or artificial selection because the new gene material would never surface before the accumulation of detrimental mutations makes the lineage extinct. That\u2019s right, in lineages these bad inheritable mutations will accumulate, and probably exponentially, till early death or sterility prevents procreation. For example, the male Baboon dog typically dies before reaching maturity, so it has almost reached the end of its line. In a best case scenario artificial breeding might make procreation possible, as with the silk worm moth. If the theoretical good new gene ever did manifest itself in a new generation, it will be outgunned by all the bad mutations. Where\u2019s the overall benefit in webbed feet developing, for example, when the creature has already lost the ability to swim due to other mutations? Contrary to expectations with Evolution, what we see in dogs, is the fate of all creatures. In the wild the inevitable is slowed by natural selection preventing the worst cases from surviving and procreating. Even humans will succumb, not as fast as pet dogs, but, because even unhealthy humans are encouraged to start families, it will be faster than natural selection would allow for. Contrary to those Evolutionary eugenics proponents like Hitler and Richard Dawkins, eugenics can only slow the gene pool's demise, not reverse it. Since many (most?) worst case inheritable mutated genes (= inheritable diseases) manifest themselves due to getting a pair of the bad genes (One from each parent), many lineages can be host to more and more of the bad genes and survive till paired from both parents. When that happens \u2013 wham! \u2013 the worst case for the disease is manifest in the new generation (Sickle-cell disease in humans is a good example). For any given creature, because siblings are just as likely to have the bad genes, procreating with partners furthest from one\u2019s own lineage will likely reduce the probability of the bad gene pairing \u2013 So the Biblical prohibition of marrying close family members was not just an arbitrary morality, but has a sensible biological function. Even by doing this, given enough generational changes, the bad gene burden will gradually reach a saturation point in the gene pool and, biologically speaking, finding a suitable procreational partner that is safe for making healthy babies will be near impossible. Maybe, in the future, people concerned for their future baby\u2019s health, and can afford it, will be first checking their potential partner\u2019s DNA before even courting like in the movie Gattaca. Well, that\u2019s the trend, but just like the Heat Death of the Universe, we should hope for divine intervention before anything gets that bad. I read that the world-wide increase in inheritable diseases is reaching epidemic proportions. We should not be surprised, unless we are Evolutionists who believe improvements should steadily occur as they have done for the supposed last 13 or more billion years.  Michael Howard << The chaos that life on Earth is being fed to order is provided by the Sun. The Earth is not a closed system. The universe is. >> Even that is is debatable because the universe is reportedly expanding. Michael Howard <<As we established, everything is debatable, but the universe expanding is already part of the theory... did you think they left that part out? That the universe is expanding is exactly why we predict Heat Death.>> I mentioned the expanding Universe precisely because it makes it difficult to predict heat death \u2013 which is the opposite of your last statement. If the Universe is expanding how can it sure to reach equilibrium? If you put gas in a closed room, the gas can eventually reach equilibrium. If the room\u2019s size is expanded, the equilibrium can be disturbed. If it is continually expanding, it may never reach equilibrium. As far as I know, this is simple thermodynamics. If you want a source for this info, do your own research. You ask \u201cDo you think they left that out?\u201d. Yes, it seems this was left out of whatever you read. But, even you didn't read it, it is logically perceived from the 'expanding room' thought experiment. In any case, it takes not just energy but directed energy to lower entropy. Michael Howard <<I'm not sure what this means, but I'll gladly read your source.>> You don't need a source. It's common knowledge derived from experiments you can safely do. In fact, I have already mentioned one: Shuffle a deck of playing cards. The shuffling is akin to the undirected energy. The predicted result is a deck of unordered cards. A more accurate representation of undirected energy is vigorously shaking the cards loosely in a big box. The result should approximate maximum entropy. Let me know if they become ordered as Evolution predicts. I would be mightily surprised if you get the same order twice in a row, or even twice in your life-time, or maybe even twice before the end of the Universe. I know you believe that undirected energy, such the sun\u2019s radiation hitting Earth, will create people, but that is an assumption from Evolution, not evidenced from any experiment. Evolutionists are starting with their version of \u2018truth\u2019 (Information and people from chaos) and using that to explain their version of history. People in other religions do similar things, too, so Evolution is not unique in this regard. Possibly, one religion teaches the truth, but we know it isn\u2019t Evolution because it teaches the direct opposite of the entropy laws which are possibly the most verifiable in science. But, back to the deck of cards\u2026conversely, if you put your mind to it, you can place the cards in order: Ace to King for each suite. This is directed energy. You have directed your energy to move the cards into an arbitrary order. You can do the same with your bedroom or garage: Randomly throwing stuff in the room won't make it orderly. You need to direct your energy to place stuff purposely to put it in order. I don\u2019t know why you think a source of information is required for this unless you think you need to appeal to authority \u2013 where an assertion is deemed true just because of the authority of the person asserting it. This is considered a fallacy in debating (Argumentum ab auctoritate). According to your logic, if you torch your home you'll increase its complexity. I don't recommend you test for this. Michael Howard <<No, that's a ridiculous straw man. A fire destroys bonds to release energy. It's not the same as cells collecting and organizing nutrients.>> OK, I was being flippant but, nevertheless, undirected energy has been released, and although this energy may not do anything for the house, according to your logic, just because it is energy, it can naturally assist in creating complexity of other things. How many bicycle frames do you expect to make from randomly waving a blow torch in a pipe factory? Plenty, according to your logic. Michael Howard <<This is a childish misrepresentation of my argument. Cells collecting nutrients is in no way similar to waving a blow torch around.>> No, it\u2019s not a childish misrepresentation of your argument. It succinctly moves your proposition from \u2018out there\u2019 to a smaller scale that is actually easier to concepultaze in terms of both time and resources and, more importantly, you can do thought experiments with. You must understand that it takes a mind to direct energy. Things do not naturally organise themselves unless it is part of their programming (= more directed energy). I don\u2019t know how else to make this clearer unless you tell me your hobbies or area of expertise so that I can think of a better metaphor or example for you that you can more easily relate to. Michael Howard <<Are you being serious?>> More serious than you. Michael Howard <<You are the one making ridiculous claims.>> And yet, you are the Evolutionist. Michael Howard <<Why don't you start backing them up?>> Because I\u2019d probably get prosecuted for arson if I started demonstrating with your home example. Neither do I own a pipe factory, or dogs, let alone a poodle or baboon dog. And I can\u2019t wait around for end of the Universe just to prove heat death may not happen. I do own a deck of cards, but it is probably more convincing if you do the experiments yourself instead of hearing it from me and this would be true of all the claims. Do your own research. You obviously won\u2019t buy into anything I tell you because it is too heretical for you. You will only only learn the truth if you truly seek it instead of indiscriminately sucking up all the Evolution stories. Michael Howard <<What are these sources of yours that are so much more reliable than \"Evolutionists?\" The greater readership is not going to blindly buy your lousy excuse. They will be looking for information. Post your source.>> Like I said, you are more likely to understand and accept the truth if you discover it yourself. There\u2019s probably no point in me or anyone pointing you to it because your personal bias will prevent you from following that path. Seek and ye shall find. In any case, I wouldn\u2019t want you to fall into a fallacy in debating and believe something simply because you were appealing to authority :-) However, for starters you could read in a previous posting what I wrote about gene-flow and look for flaws in it. I'd be very disappointed in myself if there were any that were contradicted by science (Being that which is observable and repeatably testable). According to your logic it's reasonable to believe that just the other day I pulled an iPhone from the garden that had naturally evolved from all the stuff in the ground. No sensible person would believe that but Evolution fundamentalists believe stuff exceedingly far more complicated like a 'simple' cell, a plant, and a human came accidentally from stuff in the ground. Michael Howard << That you think this \"runs against the entropy laws\" betrays a fundamental misunderstanding of everything that comes after. >> So, because you think you were accidentally made, it makes my less complicated iPhone origin story even more reasonable? You need to rethink how entropy works in reality and discard what you have been taught by Evolution fundamentalists. Michael Howard << The rest of your comment is just uninformed apologetic nonsense. I suggest you find a more reliable source. >> Although my comments may sound biting, I sympathise with you because I once believed probably everything you believed before I became a heretic. No doubt, you believe everything you read in the Evolution apologetic websites without questioning any of it. Michael Howard << What is your source, anyway? >> It's unlikely anything good can result from telling you that. Just look objectively at the Evolution dogma you have been fed. I don't expect to change your views but write this for the greater readership. ",

But evolution will continue by non-natural means, genetic engineering. Just as we now have genetically modified agricultural products we will have genetically modified humans. The first modifications will be to eliminate genes that cause defects like cancer and Parkinson's disease. So that is the \u201cnext step\u201d \u2014 elimination of defective genes. After this it is hard to predict. When parents can select the genes for their baby, obviously that would not want those that cause defects but after that, who knows? Perhaps body decorations will be in style, zebra stripes, glow in the dark green eyes? (I\u2019m not kidding it has been done in mice already.) The next step is genetic engineering. Contrary to what others have written here evolution DOES effectivly occur in \u201csteps\u201d. Of course it is a continuous process but the rate of change varies and is not constant. When there is a small isolated population and large selective pressure the rate is very fast and then as the population grows it slows. We see this in the fossil record, a new species shows up at a certain time and then do not change much over a longer time span. It is not really steps, just periods of rapid change and long periods of stability. Humans are now in an \u201cultra-stable\u201d period and will remain there until genetic engineering is common. ",

            "answer_text": "If you mean biological evolution (as a species): The process of evolution can be broken down into 4 steps: VariationCompetitionSurvival of the fittestPassing on of genesWith human evolution, the problem lies in the third step. Survival of the fittest refers to the fact that only the organisms with superior genes will survive. This means they can pass on these useful genes to their offspring, improving their species. But here\u2019s the issue: Now, your genes don\u2019t have that much of an impact on your chances of survival as much as they used to (apart from genetic diseases). What matters much more is factors such as wealth and where you live, which can\u2019t exactly be passed on via genes. Also, the death rate is much lower in general, with medicine having greatly improved over time. The stage of survival of the fittest now being \u2018outdated\u2019 means that it is harder for evolution to take place in humans, so there proably won\u2019t be any major changes in human biology anytime soon. If you mean developmental evolution (as a species): There could be any number of things, it\u2019s hard to guess. Do you think people in the stone age could have predicted cars, or people from 100 years ago could have predicted iPads? If we were to be shown technology from the future, we probably would have a hard time comprehending it. But there is one interesting poing about human development that I would like to bring up: \u201cThe worldwide ideological struggle that called forth daring, courage, imagination and idealism, will be replaced by economic calculation, the endless solving of technical problems, environmental concerns and the satisfaction of sophisticated customer demands.\u201d Does this world sound familiar to you? This is a quote from Francis Fukuyama in 1989 about the \u2018end of history\u2019. A time when major human advancement would end. And this quote sounds terrfyingly simular to our current state of affairs. Perhaps what we need now is an apocolypse so that the survivors can start developing society again. I hope this was interesting! :) ",

            "answer_text": "Ok so humans haven\u2019t stopped evolving. Although civilization hasn\u2019t been around long enough to see any extraordinary changes, we can nonetheless expect to see some as time draws on.The most plausible changes could be1) Less Toes- Before humans walked upright, our toes were used for grappling \u2013 much like our hands. As we have come to rely less on climbing and more on walking, our toes have slowly shrunk to their current size. With our feet now woefully incapable of grasping even the smallest branches, evolution has taken steps to rid us of our smallest fifth toe.Whereas our other toes \u2013 especially the biggest \u2013 serve to aid balance and walking, our little toes serve no purpose, and humans can get by very well without them. Because of this, and because of the problems which arise from its needless existence \u2013 being frequently crushed in shoes and stubbed on every prominent object, to name a couple \u2013 we can expect humans to eventually evolve into a four-toed creature. It is common for animals to lose digits through evolution: the horse, for example, used to have more than two.\u2028\u20282)Self improvement-Humans may eventually reach a point where they can force evolution upon themselves through the use of technology. Whether this is literal self-improvement, via bionic organs for example, or through gene selection, which has prospective parents choose their child\u2019s traits before birth, this is the most likely avenue human evolution will take in the near future. If permitted, gene selection in particular could quickly lead to a boom in so called \u201cdesigner babies\u201d \u2013 in which all defects and undesirable traits are removed. Should this become widespread, it could potentially force many negative human traits to extinction.3)Smaller Teeth-The most obvious change to our jaws will be the disappearance of wisdom teeth, which serve no use to modern humans, and which already have low occurrence rates among some ethnic groups. But aside from this, we can also expect our teeth to grow smaller. Throughout the evolution of man, there has been a general trend towards smaller teeth. Evidence has shown that in the last 100,000 years alone, our teeth have halved in size. No longer having any reason to accommodate such huge gnashers, our jaws have also shrunk. We can expect this trend to continue into the foreseeable future.\u2028\u20284)Brain Rewiring-Technology has already affected the way our memory works. The human brain, being a machine striving for maximum efficiency, typically remembers where information is stored, rather than the information itself. It is far easier to remember where you put the book containing juicy facts, than to recall the actual content of the book; and in the age of internet, this mental peculiarity has become especially important. How many times have you tried to remember something, and instead simply looked up the answer? That\u2019s your brain remembering where something is stored \u2013 on the internet, on google, on wikipedia, and so on. As technology becomes more and more advanced, our brains will adapt in order to maximize efficiency \u2013 perhaps to the detriment of our memory.\u2028\u20285)Increased Height-Human height has been growing rapidly for the last two centuries. Over the last 150 years alone, the average height of the species has increased by 10cm. It is believed that the main driving force behind this growth is the abundance of nutrition available to many of us. Famine has long been a curse for those aspiring to tallness \u2013 and in certain parts of the world, it has almost been eradicated.The more a child has to eat, the more energy he or she has to grow. As long as we have the ability to eat in excess, the species will continue to grow taller. Whether the sky is the limit, or whether biology will stop us short somewhere among the tree-tops, only time \u2013 and evolution \u2013 will tell.\u2028\u2028 and there could be a lot of other changes as well but who knows.I guess we just have to wait and watch!

            "answer_text": "Before we go far towards speculating the next step of human evolution. I would suggest us to understand the selective pressure that happens in the last 6000 years of human civilization. The sociocultural changes that happened might have changed the selective pressure(s) that applies to the 'birth' of homo sapiens sapiens. That said, if we must speculate, I would think that the greatest changes on human species happens in the cognitive aspect, though the physical changes can't be discounted. In the physical department, we reach sexual maturity earlier, we consume more food, spend (relatively) less energy, and our bodies grew larger than our ancestors. While in the cogntive department, we're dealing with more and more complexity, thanks to the socio-cultural changes that had taken place. Younger generations learn faster and adapt better to new technologies. It has also been suggested that the selective pressure that applies to human species is about the aptness in developing and maintaining social relations. But without real and objective researches on the selective pressure that applies to our species, there's no reason we could believe in any of these suggestions. ",

            "answer_text": "For about 500 thousand years the human species evolved through biological processes. We lived in simple hunter gatherer societies and reproductive success was determined through physical attributes such as strength, dexterity, speed, hunting and fishing skills etc. Starting around 20 thousand years ago, we have the introduction of culture. Now it is no longer the fastest or strongest male who has first pick among females. It is the king's, priests, nobility and other wealthy members of society who have managed to control and manipulate the social game. At this point, culture is evolving faster than biology can keep up and even starts to work in direct opposition to natural selection, like in the examples of inbreeding in many of the royal families throughout Europe. Culture evolves to the point of radical ideology in the form of fascism and this results in the second world war. In the process of the second world war, many new technologies are invented which eventually leads to television, nuclear weapons and the internet. These new technologies begin to break down the barriers between cultures and now we have reached the third stage of evolution, where technology is evolving faster than culture can keep up. This is the stage we are at now. Technology is moving faster than culture and it makes studying things like political science, anthropology, sociology and economics completely pointless. As Marshall Mcluhan once said: politics and economics are nothing but sideshows compared to technological development. ",

Currently developed countries have a birth rate approximately 1.8, which is below the 2.2 children required for sustained population levels. However, some people very much enjoy having children. These people find ways to have four, six or even more children. Because these \u2018many child-loving\u2019 people are more likely to have surviving offspring, any genetic component that contributes to their preference is more likely to be passed on. It is currently thought that the world\u2019s population will peak around the year 2100, then go into decline. Some worry the decline may be acute and permanent. However, super-fecund parents will probably ensure that there is a minimum level of human population as well as a maximum. ",

We humans still face selection pressure and will continue to for foerseeble pressure. I do not know how observable it will be in 100 years but here are likely changes that have been continuous for last few hundred years and are likely to continue.  The smallest toe of our feet might disappear. it has been progressively  becoming smaller and there are already human populations with very small fifth toe.Sense of Smell will become even weaker: Humans have already very week sense of smell. Isolated populations in Africa and South America can identify other individuals in dark just by smell but most \"civilized\" populations have lost this ability. This has likely happened in last few hundred years.Many muscles will disappear or become more rare. Some examples are:levator claviculae muscle: A small muscle in the posterior neck is now only present in 2-3% of humans but is found in all apes.palmaris longus : A small muscle in the arm is only present in about 15% of the population.pyramidalis muscle: A muscle in torso is only present in about 20% of populationPlantaris Muscle : This is a 2-4 inches long muscle which is used to move knee and ankle. This has already disappeared in 7-10% of human population and is very weak / redundant in the rest.Many head muscles including Occipitalis MinorOn a side note, Vomeronasal organ or VNO -  the second organ of smell - is found in 92% of humans but is not functional.

There are also ways to do it wrong (such as the Hitler method). I believe that our intelligence has been limited by food availability.  If we eliminate that constraint, we can grow larger brains.  The body as a whole may grow to handle a larger brain.  Things we would like to breed for are intelligence, health, longevity, good senses, athletic ability, and survival skills.  There are many sports, so athletic ability can go many ways.  I am somewhat negative on the bulky super strong build. Moral standards are good, but that is an area fraught with risk.  The powers that be expect obedience to the powers that be.  We might want to keep a few tribal people around to build skills that our testing doesn\u2019t test for. ",

Perhaps after A.I. becomes advanced enough to leapfrog human intelligence we could all be replaced within just a few years.

            "answer_text": "Since1) there's very little selective pressure or geographical isolation on the human population at this point in time, and2) the main driving force in the species closely associated with humans in the last 10.000 years or so has been intelligent design (just see how quickly poodles evolved from wolves or oranges from lemons), I would guess that, whatever changes that will happen to homo sapiens in the next few thousand years (assuming both the species and civilization survive) will be intelligently designed and not naturally selected.  If you increase the scale to, say, 10 million years, it depends very much on what will be the selective pressures during this time. In general, evolution behaves as a punctuated equilibrium, with large periods of relative stasis and short periods of rapid change. If there's one of such periods in the near future (it seems we're in a middle of one right now), the most probable outcome, for any species, is extinction. If not, the best bet is that the probability of a species not being extinct in the next X years is proportional to it existing for at least X years. So, since humans exist as a separate genus for less than 6 million years, I'd say that we being extinct of not would be a flip of a coin, in this scenario.  Therefore, the most honest answer would be: in the next few thousand of years, some designed change; in the next few millions, extinction. ",

This theory posits that throughout the evolutionary history of life on Earth, evolution works better in a controlled population living in a single habitat. Humans just don\u2019t operate within those confines. Reproduction also plays a role in the theory as anthropologist Ian Tattersall of New York\u2019s American Museum of Natural History is summarized by National Geographic, \u201ccrossbreeding makes it much less likely for potentially significant mutations to become established in the gene pool\u2014and that\u2019s exactly where we are now.\u201d Also, medical advances allow for even the weakest of our species to continue passing on their traits. Survival of the fittest can\u2019t operate if the \u201cless fit\u201d are helped to survive. A Changing Painting  Image credit: jorgen mcleman/shutterstock Another possibility is the exact opposite: we are still changing. According to this theory, environmental factors are no longer the driving force for evolutionary change, sexual selection has become what will define future evolutionary paths. Since people are now choosing to mate based on wealth and intelligence, traits that facilitate those goals will be maximized. This can be exemplified looking at the children of athletes. Sports players tend to be more attractive and therefore attract similarly attractive mates, making it more likely for those traits to be passed down to offspring. Some are seeing evidence in other ways as well. Research published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences actually found that females are currently evolving, becoming shorter and plumper with every generation. Human Body 2.0  Image Source: Trendy Techie Its no surprise that much technological advancement is currently aimed at the human body. Through gene enhancement or even tech implants, the body is getting its upgrades not from Darwin, but from robotics or genetic engineering. There is actually a philosophy aimed at this, called transhumanism. Whether genetically enhanced humans, bionic men, or uploaded beings, technology and its advancement is certainly shaping human development. Reach for the Stars  Image credit: MGM Mentioned above is the requisites for evolution: a controlled population and a distinct habitat. That may not exist for humans on Earth, but the minute we send independent space colonies, we are creating the perfect conditions for Darwinian evolution to continue. Perhaps Arthur C. Clarke and Stanley Kubrick had the full history and future of human evolution all figured out. More realistically, we may eventually see future generations of humans taking on a variety of shapes and sizes, dependent on their host planet and the conditions that best support the survival of our species.

After that, probably the elimination of deficiencies like the need for vitamins, essential amino acids, and omega-3 and six fatty acids.

Selection pressure = bears!Mutation = I\u2019m randomly ever so slightly better at running or climbing or hiding than youResult = I have kids (and grandkids and great-grandkids) who can live in bear-country, and you don't because you were turned into bear shit years ago.Evolution = After a few generations, everyone living round here is a good runner/climber/hider - Hooray! we all level-up!For humanity - we\u2019ve developed technology that largely protects us from environmental pressures of the drastic kind required for a mutation to propagate across an entire population. Medicine means we live when we should have died, agriculture and trade means we live (and have more kids) when we should have starved, central heating means we can sit around on Quora instead of freezing to death. Selection pressure = bears!Mutation = You can run fast, and I\u2019m fat and can\u2019t run 50 feet without collapsing\u2026 but I do have a rifle - bang!Result = Everyone has kids (and grandkids) who can live in bear-countryEvolution = er\u2026. everyone around here is really overweight and there are not many bears.We do continue to evolve, but it's slow. As an example, our current population is largely immune to diseases like the 1918 Influenza virus (because the ones who weren't immune died). We also appear to be immune to whatever caused the highly deadly \u2018Sweating Sickness\u2019 in medieval times. It can happen through slower methods (social preferences in a population might eventually select for women with longer legs, for example). Evolution doesn\u2019t do random \u2018big steps\u2019 and in the absence of a life & death selective pressure of some kind, it doesn\u2019t do anything. ",

Yet that is not so. Evolution is a random process every step of the way. For any particular species what follows depends on pressures from competitors and opportunities for random innovation to 'exploit' possibilities hitherto less likely. Evolution can step backward from the more complicated to the less complicated. Anguis fragilis, the 'slow worm', is an example; it is a lizard that 'lost' its legs presumably because its ancestors found a niche where legs were no longer an advantage. Perhaps humans will lose much of their intelligence now that computers, soon to be AIs, and automation are beginning to meet so many of their basic needs. Some might say that has begun since few in the younger generations can do mental arithmetic anymore. ",

The distinctions incorrectly identified as \"racial\" will gradually disappear as human populations intermingle and intermarry.  Humans actually have very little genetic diversity, even compared with other primates. All humans alive today are descendants of a small population in Africa that survived an evolutionary bottleneck, perhaps as recently as 75,000 years ago.  In the last 500 years or so, virtually all human populations have come into contact with one another. Technological and cultural advances have made possible a global population many times larger than before the agricultural and industrial revolutions. The accompanying revolution in transport and trade has fostered unprecedented global migrations.  In the future, most humans will be \"multiracial\" in the sense that they will have recent ancestors from many parts of the world.  ",

Every skin-cell in our body is a soul, every piece of grass, every microbe, every bacteria is a soul, so we can understand how rare it is for a soul to obtain a human body. King Pariksit says: \"In this material world there are as many living entities as there are atoms. Among these living entities very few are human beings, and among them, few are interested in following religious principles.' \"O best of the brahmanas, Sukadeva Gosvami, out of many persons who follow religious principles, only a few desire liberation from this material world. Among many thousands who desire liberation, only one may actually achieve liberation, giving up his material attachment to society, friendship, love, country, home, wife and children. And among many thousands of such liberated persons, one who can understand the true meaning of liberation is very rare.' \"O great sage, among many millions who are liberated and perfect in knowledge of liberation, only one may become a devotee of Sri Narayana, (Krishna). Such devotees, who are fully peaceful, are extremely rare.\" --Srimad Bhagavatam 6.14. 3-5 So the next step in evolution is an evolution of consciousness. One attains the human form of life after transmigrating through 8,400,000 species by the process of gradual evolution. That human life is spoiled for those conceited fools who do not take shelter of the lotus feet of Govinda. --Brahma-vaivarta Purana Krishna says: After many births and deaths, he who is actually in knowledge surrenders unto Me, knowing Me to be the cause of all causes and all that is. Such a great soul is very rare. (Bg 7.19)  ",

The way a new mutation becomes a \"step in the evolution of\" a species is for the last individual that lacks the new mutation to die out. The larger our population is the harder that becomes.  Take a plague, like HIV.  It is killing many people, however we are still probably thousands of generations from the last human who is not genetically immune to HIV from dying out; and in fact, that may never even happen. Whatever the next step in human evolution will be, it will probably reach fixation due to a cataclysmic event that kills more than 90% of the human population.  I suggest that you focus on putting off the next step in human evolution as long as possible.   ",

The ancient Egyptians that built the pyramids were just as intellectually advanced as we are, but were limited by the available technology. Our technology is advancing at an exponential rate, but we still have the same greed and struggle for power that we always did. Our societies are evolving, but the people in them aren't evolving into something better. As we develop more advanced technology without advanced wisdom to make the best used of it, we are at increasing risk of destroying ourselves. While humans as a species aren't really changing the artificial intelligence devices that we create are rapidly advancing. Many are predicting that in several decades that they will be smarter than we are and could take over. Hopefully they won't be based on the autonomous weapon systems currently being developed or we will risk extinction. ",

That more than half-century witnessed the self-destruction of Athens, as its imperial ambitions brought it into conflict with its neighboring city-states, especially Sparta, thus precipitating the Peloponnesian war in 432. A series of disasterous decisions led to Athens' ultimate defeat in 404. Plato\u2019s Parmenides is one of the most influential of all Platonic dialogues. At the same time, it is perhaps the most difficult to understand, and there is no scholarly consensus on its interpretation. Consider the scientific principle, all processes in the universe are subject to change, that principle is already implicit in the deeper meaning which Plato\u2019s Parmenides supplies to \u2018Heraclitus\u2019 maxim, \u201cnothing is constant, but change\u201d The Fragments are a collection of sayings and statements covering the nature of the physical universe, ethics and politics, but it is Heraclitus\u2019 metaphysical ideas which have retained their power. It is these we focus on here. The Logos The book begins with this statement: \u201cAlthough this Logos is eternally valid, yet men are unable to understand it \u2013 not only before hearing it, but even after they have heard it for the first time...though all things come to pass in accordance with this Logos, men seem to be quite without any experience of it...My own method is to distinguish each thing according to its nature, and to specify how it behaves; other men, on the contrary, are as forgetful and heedless in their waking moments of what is going on around and within them as they are during sleep.\u201d What does Heraclitus mean by \u2018Logos\u2019? The literal Greek translation is \u2018Word\u2019, and it is sometimes translated as \u2018account\u2019. He is saying that what follows in the book is an account of something timeless and truthful: an unseen force, not that different from the biblical \u2018Word\u2019. Heraclitus is trying here to distinguish between himself as \u201chimself\u201d (who is free to say anything about anything) and himself as the bearer of an \u201caccount\u201d who is bound by the constraints of that account. But at a deeper level, one is also led to ask whether the logos in question is not also possibly the logos of some divine messenger other than Heraclitus himself, and if so who/what that divine messenger could be and what makes its account so privileged. In the realm of wisdom, the cyclical idea of the cosmos appears to have originated with Heraclitus, the \ufb01rst evolutionist, and to have been borrowed from him by the Stoics, who thought that \u201c the history of the world and the Deity moves in an endless cycle through the same stages. \u201d Similarly as the stars appear or revolve around the firmament stage by stage, so is man sometimes under the shadow of the Divine attributes of Glory and Self-Sufficiency and sometimes he is under the shadow of His attributes of Beauty. Heraclitus is most well known for his doctrine that 'all flows' (panta chorei). This flux of all things is a perpetual becoming of life and death, which are unified in this process. More generally, he taught the dynamic unity of all opposites, that the flux of existing things is characterized by the transformation between pairs of contrary principles. This teaching is in apparent contrast with the static separation of substantial entities, since everything is One through the dynamic transforming of opposites into each other. Yet, Heraclitus sees structure in this flux, the structure being represented by the Logos that is present in both the world and the mind: \u201cListening not to me but to the logos, it is wise to agree or acknowledge that all things are one...They [the ignorant] do not comprehend how, in differing, it agrees with itself \u2014 a backward-turning connection, like that of a bow and a lyre.\u201d The minds of different generations are as imperceptible one by the other as \u201cPlatonic ideas,\u201d \u201cmonads,\u201d \u201cGeistesmassen,\u201d or as objects of conscious thought are called \u201cthought-objects.\u201d Evolution is not just a physical change in our environment, it is also a mental evolution, we often seem to forget that mind and matter have coevolved. It is a collective phenomenon for which we must prepare collectively. That kind of emphasis, upon relived mental experiences of original axiomatic-revolutionary discovery, supplies the student a proper referent for Heraclitus' famous \"nothing is constant, but change.\" This kind of change, axiomatic-revolutionary discovery, not sensual things, is then shown to be the event, the experience, the \"fact\" which correlates directly with the durable form of successful survival of mankind (increase of potential population-density). Then, consider the point: the durable survival of society is change, is the primitive form of manifestation of the notion of existence of mankind. It is not the sensual actuality of physical bodies of persons, nor any other counting of mere sensory objects, which measures the quality of human existence. That change which is necessary to perpetuate society's existence indefinitely, is the primitive ontological existence upon which one must premise the notion of a function of human existence. In all relevant cases, the quality of ontological difference between shadow and substance, is that emphasized by Heraclitus, and Plato after him, the famous aphorism: nothing is constant but change. Kepler\u2019s notion of gravitation illustrates the point. Kepler\u2019s correction of certain relevant errors in Tycho Brahe\u2019s observations, demonstrated that the planetary orbits are not of the regular form demanded by the reductionist ideologues who had been deluded into following the doctrine of such as Aristotle. Rather, the planetary orbits are approximately elliptical, with the Sun at one of the foci of the ellipses, and the motion of the planets along their orbital pathways is constantly non-uniform motion. Thus, a deluded faith in sense-perception is confronted by the evidence, that the planets\u2019 orbits are governed by a principle of constant change, as Heraclitus\u2019 famous aphorism makes the point. This characteristic requires an agency operating from outside the scope of sense-perception, an agency whose efficient presence is expressed as an intention, requires the discovery of a universal physical principle invisible to the senses. The experimental proof of that principle, now becomes a definite object of the mind, an object which exists from beyond sense-perception. The divine as a whole is eternal (Parmenides) or everlasting (Heraclitus), and unchanging; in respect of its parts it is subject to temporal process and change. For Heraclitus the account (logos) of the real is everlastingly true and describes a world that, despite constant change in respect of its parts, yet is one that is fundamentally a whole or unity, and as such a whole or unity everlasting. The account in question is not his own, except derivatively, but rather that being uttered everlastingly by the real itself and comprehended by the individual who takes the trouble to learn its language. Elsewhere Heraclitus suggests strongly that it is this real \u2013 in all its apparently divergent aspects \u2013 that is in fact the Divine [source of wisdom]. For Parmenides, likewise, the divine is knowable, but again it is only the divine as a totality [pan] which is so knowable, not a divine which is putatively fragmented. This divine as a whole is, as it is for Heraclitus, without beginning or end and changeless as such. The true account which describes this real is again derivatively that of Parmenides himself, but at base it is, analogously to that being uttered everlastingly by Heraclitus\u2019 \u201cdivine\u201d universe, the account propounded by a divinity, who in propounding it is also thereby the guarantor of its truth. For both philosophers there is only one route that can possibly be followed if knowledge of the real is to be attained. For Parmenides it is the route of \u201cis and necessarily is\u201d statements, its end-point a reality-as-a-whole that is both knowable and \u201cpointable-to in words\u201d. For Heraclitus it is that Real Being which is, did they but know it, \u201ccommon\u201d to all human beings. ",

            "answer_text": "I will repeat my answer to another question here, because it also happens to be an answer to your question. I don\u2019t think I can improve on it, although it will be interesting to read the guesses of other Quora members. That other question was; \u201cHow does evolution get coordinated among members of a species? Why do humans look the same all over world , while apes have much more diversity ?Why don't we see another version of humans who have, say, longer canine teeth ?\u201d Here is my Answer: Happenstance, gently steered by propensity for survival.That is how it works, with variations occurring in each generation of individuals in two ways;pairings of parents\u2019 genes among the broad possibilities of conception; and genetic mutations, some genetically dominant, most recessive.The results over adequate time create the illusion of a deliberate direction to exploit the environment of the species. There is however no mechanism at work discernible by science to suggest anything else is taking place. No other mechanism is needed to explain it, either. Small isolated pockets or populations of individuals, interbreeding frequently, make the process appear to move comparatively rapidly, while very large populations of individuals with widely dispersed mating behaviors slows the dispersion of new traits and minimizes the likelihood of permanent change, especially for recessive genetic traits. Anything which lowers the likelihood of differing individuals mating with the earlier variety of a species increases the chances that the difference will become the dominant trait of that population. Evolution is not too difficult to grasp; it\u2019s just that because our lifespan is frequently short compared to the speeds at which it moves that it was easy for people not to notice it\u2019s operation until careful scientific records of individual subjects and locations began to be kept and carefully compared and analyzed. Common sense explains why it was easier to recognize, and it was first officially reported, only when separated populations among distant islands (difficult for lifeforms from elsewhere to reach) were being cataloged and compared in scientific detail. Absent the right kinds of study and analysis, it is also easy to see why ancient thinkers and religious philosophers tried to explain the diversity of life on earth, as well as apparent similarities between different species, with inaccurate speculation and myth. Regarding your written thoughts commenting upon your own question, concerning humans and modern apes, once genetic differences become great enough that the interbreeding of different species does not result in conception the differing species no longer have any genetic effect upon one another and subsequent modifications of traits will not affect the disparate species. If any traits later adopted by the one species also evolve in the other, it would be by pure happenstance, and that is unlikely but not impossible. Humans\u2019 huge population and dispersed sexual interactions worldwide mean that evolution in humans will for the time being likely proceed at a very slow crawl. Of course, development of a new and genetically dominant trait might (relatively) rapidly begin to prevail. Nevertheless, eight billion is a big sea to dilute that trait in if the trait is only exhibited in a small number of individuals. Important differing traits are at this moment bubbling within the sea of human genes, but given the role of happenstance, predictions [of the next major step in human evolution] are all wild guesses.

The evolution of responsibility. From the era where Rama had sent sita just relying on the words of a common man, we are here in a world where politicians donot stand on their own words. Time and again with evolution, stringency of responsibilities had succumbed. A husband is deemed good if he provides the necessities to the wife, though he doesn't take good care of the wife. A wife's good if she complements the husband to be strong financially, irrespective of the her love for him. In short the responsibilities have been compromised and thus the expectations. A son isn't expected to stay with his parents till the last breath. People are considered saints to have least performing their profound historic responsibilities. This is the very reason why we don't understand the rationale of Rama's decision to let go off Sita. The significance of evolution is evident when the next generation Lava-Kusa questioned the act of Rama. The only entity who had been been fairly distant from this malignant tumor is Mother. None can imagine concessions on her responsibilities, none can be considerate enough to her being selfish. She is bound to love, expected to sacrifice. I believe when the ultimate Mother starts to forego her responsibilities, the deterioration accelerates. Strange if you donot know that it had already started. I always have a fantasy to live in a world where every piece of it is sane and responsible. Just imagine. Beautiful, isn't it? Difficult, is it not? ",

I\u2019m going to estimate that he could prolong expectancy by 50 or more years with it. Cyborgs would also end world hunger because you wouldn\u2019t have to eat.

It's depressing to consider potential catastrophes that could drastically reduce human population and reintroduce the \"nasty, brutish, and short\" lives that would bring natural selection back into full force.  However, if (when?) it does happen, genetic drift will have provided massive amounts of raw material for a burst of evolution.  The most important new traits would likely be of the same type as the most important recent ones - cognitive traits. ",

If human beings are going to evolve as a species (over a million years or so), they're either going to evolve into several species, or get extinct. But to answer your question on a shorter time scale to give you an idea of the amount of change evolution entertains, a few reported evolutionary trends over the last 10,000 years are: 1. A slight lengthening of the reproductive period and  reduction in cholesterol levels, blood glucose and blood pressure.2. Lactase persistence, an adaptation to the consumption of non-human milk and dairy products beyond infancy.3. Softer skins and finer hair, an evolutionary response to comfortable living.4. Drastically slowed down genetic change since the beginning of agriculture, due to larger interbreeding populations and reduced effects of genetic drift and geographical isolation. However, whichever way evolution goes, due to Natural selection human beings will only get more beautiful on an average as a result of it. #faltusawaal ",

It simply does not happen. Therefore since there are no steps or stages in evolution of species there is in fact no next major step in the evoloution of the human species.

If two animals have sex and get kids, those  kids will have the half of the dna by each parent with half the allels +  mutations. Allels that are more usefull to get more kids are, by logic  more frequent over time. Also new allels appear because of mutations.  Over a short time evolution shapes the species by the frequency of certain allels. (Imagine blond ppl. would be far more attractiv because our enviroment - allels for blond hair would become much more frequent after some generations). Over a long time, the mutations bring something that is somehow usefull = new allels that is usefull. It is only usefull if the animals that got it gets more kids. The more kids the better. The usefull allele can be lost if the carrier dosent get enoug kids.  There are serveral interactions of how short time evolutions shapes a species. But you know what? The topic of evolutions is very large. We had it for half a year in classes.  If you dont understand something, you can google it.  About your question: The allels that would havily decrease your chance of living if it wasent for the modern age, but that dont make you les attractiv or otherwise handycaped are the one that get more frequent. Example: Babys that have a large head take longer to brith, and they head gets deformed (nothing bad) which is normal. It also can cause the motehr or kid to die. With casarian delivery (when they cut the belly open) most of these babys are dilivered with their had still being overly big. So this big head becomes more frequent. ",

There are other fracture lines which could potentially cause isolation, but most of the geopolitical ones are temporary. The social ones, on the other hand, are stubborn and aren't fading. I have no idea where such a genetic experiment would go, but the brain would need to adapt over time in order to limit the drawbacks and heighten the benefits. However, you're talking half a million years before anything interesting happened. ",

The more children you can keep alive to maturity determines your genetic future. Anything that contributes to this guides evolution. The next step? Population pressure on the environment may influence the process. Pollution, over farming, and technology are all human adaptations to successful breeding in the twentieth century. Wars are inevitable, and are efficient at reducing population pressure but increase environmental damage. Whatever is coming for the human species must be able to cope with these inevitabilities. Only humans who can survive like cockroaches or rats in a filthy and violent environment may survive. What does such a human look like? Is this too dystopian a view? Or, is it all that different from thriving populations we can already observe in places like the slums of Nairobi, Cape Town, Karachi, Mexico City, Rio de Janiero, Mumbai, where living conditions are so wretched? \u201cThriving\u201d is not a common word for such places, given high rates of disease and malnutrition, but these slums persist. Do the survivors of these conditions actually forecast the future of humanity? Given the direction our so-called civilization is driving us, I think we have a strong argument that they do. In that case, the future of the human species may already be witnessed in such slums with the physical, cultural, and microbial adaptations that everyone must eventually have. ",

I guess an example might be: If the world experiences runaway global warming in the next few hundred years, those humans that are born with a higher heat tolerance will thrive and breed. Those who cannot stand the heat might not cope and will have fewer children etc or die early before they breed. Similarly, if viruses like Corona were to really get going uncontrollably in populations, some humans may have immune systems that can cope so they will breed and survive whereas those without the same immune systems may die or be weakened to a point where they cannot breed. If Yellowstone volcano blows and a cloud of ash obscures the sun everywhere, those that need less sunlight than others might do better etc etc. It is completely unpredictable. ",

            "answer_text": "Q: What is the next evolutionary stage for the human species? A: No way to know.. Well, we do know a few minor things, but since most evolutionary movement is in response to stressors, and we don\u2019t know what those stressors will be, we can\u2019t accurately project what the responses will be. In fact, it may be that our species doesn\u2019t make the cut in the next major stressor change, it may be kaputs for us. OK, so here\u2019s some things we do know. The human mouth gets smaller, and wisdom teeth are waning away. Our sense of smell may continue to degrade. The average height of our species still is growing somewhat, however this is more a response to nutrition and diet than to evolution. And with the survival of more and more of the edge cases in our species, perhaps we continue to build flexibility in our genome. Either that, or we are weaker as a species and more apt to succumb to a future change in a common microbe that could cause a huge die off of humans. Our species has been basically unchanged for the last 100,000 years, yet our entire technology explosion has only been in the last 500 years. So unless there is some huge external change coming, there is no reason to believe a big change in our evolution is coming. Then again, another argument is that humans do not need to evolve because it is changes in the environment which drives evolution. Species evolve so that they can adapt according to nature. But humans have now technological power to make nature adapt according to changing human needs (If not now, then maybe in a few hundred years). ",

Purely biologically, there is no way to predict. If we manage to maintain our resourceful lifestyles, then we will also maintain our brain. Otherwise, that will necessarily shrink as we won't have the energy to build it or maintain it (so either higher efficiencies or smaller brain sizes will be favoured).

If there's no genetic change, we just have genetic drift - tiny changes that take mnillions of years to show large physical changes. Dinisaurs lived in a worls perfectly suited for them for about 135 million years.  There were changes in species, in genus, but the dominant life form was dinosaurid for 135 million years.  There was no pressure, and no empty niches, so there was no reason for anything to change.  When they were almost all wiped out (the ones that survived are called birds today) there were all sorts of open niches, that were mostly filled by mammals that fit them best.  But some mammals fit better than others of their species, so evolutionary pressure forced the species in that direction. If there aren't any genetic changes, or any changes in available niches, we can expect man to be around in his current form, with slow drift over the entire species, for a very long time.  (We won't speciate into two or more different species unless we travel to the stars, and some colony loses contact with the rest of the species for an evolutionarily long time.) ",

I don\u2019t know the answer, but I\u2019m sharing my latest insight about evolution and abiogenesis: Evolution and the origin of life by abiogenesis are sort of a no-brainer, when you think about them this way: Abiogenesis is an example of \u2018the whole is greater than the sum of its parts.\u2019 Think of hydrogen + oxygen = water [H2O], which is so incredibly different from hydrogen and oxygen. Think of a functioning car vs the parts that go into it but don\u2019t do anything useful by themselves. Abiogenesis is a very complex example of a whole [life] that is greater than the sum of its parts.

Otherwise, there is no natural selective pressure for one trait over another. So, what sort of things can kill significant numbers of humans, where some might have mutations that can be selected for for better survival?  Global warming? Some people better adapted to a hotter planet?Pandemics? Some people carrying mutation for natural immunity?Maybe if we finally colonize space, some mutations will confer better resiliency against radiation, among other possibilities living in a radically different environment.However, there is plenty of opportunity for engineered change. Selective breeding, aka eugenics, was a thing for a while, although now it is considered pretty heinous. Genetic modifications are very likely. But that is engineering, not evolution.  ",

            "answer_text": "Evolution for the for most part is unpredicatable, owed primarily in part to the fact that organisms have no conscious control over which genes get passed on to their offspring. However, in the end the most defining trait that ensures one individuals survival over another is efficiency, specifically with regards to how energy is used and distributed. Certain organs in the human body have now become redundant; the wisdom teeth, the appendix, the plantaris muscle in the feet, some have even considered adding the little toe and toenails also; so much so, that differing percentages of people no longer have either one or more of these vestigial organs. In addition at one period in human history, the majority of all humans ended up being lactose intolerant after being weaned. Some human populations developed lactase persistence which enabled them to benefit from the ingestion of milk and other dairy products produced from farm animals. This led to a decrease over time in the percentage of individuals who were lactose intolerant. Eventually the entire human race will lose and gain certain traits depending on how beneficial they prove to be in the long run. However one thing is most assuredly certain... None of us will be alive to ever witness that day. ",

Cultural evolution has been the norm ever since the agricultural revolution 12KYA, when humans started to plant crops instead of hunting and gathering resources. A person no longer have to be proficient in various tasks such as identifying poisonous plants, making tools, gathering resources. One needs only to cultivate grain to be more or less successful. Especially today, one can be proficient in a single task and survive. You can practice healthcare and know nothing about making tools and be able to pass your genes on. This task specialization would be detrimental to that person without the necessary cultural infrastructure to support it (i.e. if you drop a doctor in the amazon rainforest and he lacks the dexterity, stamina and perception to survive). So even if you have less desirable traits, you may be able to survive and pass on your genes (i.e. your genes are more susceptible to diabetes). ",

Now we have dentists that fix teeth, so having good teeth isn\u2019t a requirement for our species anymore. So it could be that in the future mankind will have bad vision and bad teeth.

Those humans not up to the mark died young. Then as more medical advances got made and a welfare system was established the not so intelligent started to survive and thrive and breed. Because there were more of them this diluted the human gene pool of high intelligence. Nowadays people in everyday life are no longer required to think. Machines do it all for you and this is actually making things worse rather than better. Humans will only evolve if they have to and at the moment they don\u2019t. ",

Here in the first world, we don't have that.

So it's not unreasonable to predict that we might have started to \"slide backwards\"....with our eyesight getting worse, immune systems getting worse, and so on.
