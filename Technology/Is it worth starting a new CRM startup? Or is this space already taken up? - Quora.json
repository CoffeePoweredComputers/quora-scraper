            "answer_text": "The best way to research the market is by thinking like a person whos looking for a CRM solution. Customers are way smarter and good researchers compared to software development companies. When a customer is hungry and looking for a solution, they search the internet like a hungry bear. Do that and see what gaps you see. Read forums and see the problems people have. Saying that here's a tip.Even though there are millions of CRM softwares out there, they all have extremely poor mobile apps. Do a sophisticated mobile app CRM that allows you to do anything that the Desktop version does, and you\u2019ll get all the millennials and entrepreneurs who do most of their business on mobiles.

            "answer_text": "Here is a thought exercise: You have proposed features that are lacking in other CRMs - could you build them as a standalone product that integrates with all of the existing CRMs? A parallel past example: email click tracking and products/companies like YesWare. Jason M. Lemkin had an interesting post on here about room at the bottom of the very large CRM market. Obviously a big opportunity\u2026.but my bias would be to look at it from a perspective of how do I pursue my new feature angle with limited resources ($\u2019s and developer time). ",
