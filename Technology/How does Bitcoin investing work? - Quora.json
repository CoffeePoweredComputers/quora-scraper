            "answer_text": "Bitcoin investing is a great speculation. I\u2019m glad you\u2019re asking about it. Here\u2019s how it works: Create a bitcoin wallet. I prefer Abra but you can also open an account with Coinbase, Blockchain, Gemini, Kraken, tons of other wallet providers.Buy bitcoin.Wait for the price to get higher than the price you bought it for. Then sell it.If you\u2019re willing to wait a few years, you will likely have the chance to use some or all of your bitcoin tax-free in the US when you purchase normal things. You won\u2019t pay in bitcoin, you will have an app or payment option that instantly converts your bitcoin to your local currency. Some stores will have a service that connects them to the bitcoin network. Bitcoin will settle the transaction while the app or service will facilitate the conversion. Several projects are trying to make this possible. If not bitcoin, some other cryptocurrency. It costs almost nothing to settle transactions with crypto, compared to 1\u20133% using conventional payment systems. Gradually, more businesses will use these systems and the US government will exempt some amount of crypto from capital gains/loss. These are passive benefits\u2014if you\u2019re willing to wait a few years. You can also trade bitcoin, but I don\u2019t consider that to be investing. That\u2019s trading. I\u2019m vaguely aware of what goes into that but I myself don\u2019t trade. Sorry. You can also use your bitcoin. If you use bitcoin to buy things that will grow more quickly than the price of bitcoin, you can essentially leverage your gains (not literally, but you\u2019d get the same result). Some people use their bitcoin to buy alt-coins. You could look into that. I don\u2019t, because I\u2019m betting my bitcoin will be worth far more in the future than it is today. ",

            "answer_text": "Well, you just install a wallet, grab some coins on one of the cryptocurrency exchanges, and hold! However, for most people it is probably not the best way. Bitcoin is on the verge of exploding into a socially accepted technology. The recent BTC price rally has, of course, stoked the anticipation of holders whose gut-feeling of eventual success has been strong for years. But, even more importantly, the general public is paying more and more attention to bitcoin as a result. Validation, by the Lindy effect as well as the public\u2019s\u2019 increasing awareness of bitcoins\u2019 unique attributes of transparency and scarcity, is not far away. We may start counting in orders of magnitude and $10k per bitcoin is not far-off. Can we help besides just holding? Yes! How will Life Design the Bitcoin Explosion? The Great Transition\u200a\u2014\u200athe shift from pre-modern to postmodern Bitcoin culture\u200a\u2014\u200ashould be triggered by someone outside of the current ecosystem. That next \u201csomeone\u201d will have a larger headcount than us, they are older, and they won\u2019t use bitcoin wallets. These people value the piece of mind and the illusion of simplicity which includes a physiological fear of the new and lack of adrenalin needed to aggressively and proactively protect their personal capital. In 2017, Bitcoin is expected to become broadly recognized as a new asset class. Investors who are poorly educated on the subject or ignorant of bitcoin still treat it as something similar to cash or precious metals. What the intrigued asset managers see in bitcoin first is an asset class that is not correlated to anything. This phenomena is of a very high institutional demand: \u201cBitcoin certificates\u201d that are listed on a stock exchange and traded in the same marketplace as shares. A casual investor can, therefore, use her or his regular bank or securities broker to trade the instrument. These certificates will be displayed in an ordinary account where one will be able to track the development of the investment and buy and sell freely during trading hours. In most cases, these certificates will take the form of ETP (Exchange Traded Products). Different markets will come up with variations of those: Exchange Traded Notes (ETNs), Warrants, Mini Futures, Exchange Traded Funds (ETF) and Actively Managed Funds (AMF). The Only Two Bitcoin Exposure Tools at Present We would like to discuss the respected Gemini Trust and SolidX Bitcoin Trust but have to wait until they become real thing. Neither should we discuss hedge \u201cfunds\u201d and listed investment advisors who act as retail asset managers buying bitcoin \u201cfor their clients\u201d in a legally suspicious way. These kinds of dealings are numerous but hold very little value. Amazingly, googling \u201cbitcoin exposure\u201d and doing a surface research give us only two options. The Brave Two We should start with the thing that works in exactly the manner we should expect to be broadly accepted soon. \u201cXBT Provider\u201d is already used by traditional asset managers, for example, by Acatis (~$3.5 billion under management). XBT Provider\u2019s structural arrangement is worth taking notice of though. It is a Swedish company acting under the control of Swedish FSA (Finansinspektionen). The company used to be part of the KnCGroup, a bitcoin miner, which I\u2019m not sure is a good or a bad thing. Since very recently, the offshore Global Advisors (Jersey, Channel Islands) Limited is its parent company and also the fund guarantor which makes the construction even more bizarre. This combination of CISE (Channel Islands\u2019 \u201cSEC\u201d) listing and Nasdaq Nordic in Stockholm circulation makes my head ache. One way or another, the stuff works for bitcoin investments done by laymen in EUR and SEK with an acceptable price markup. I estimate it as ~1.5\u20131.6% for myself but you can try and calculate relative to your own effective price you normally get. Sadly, some of the more popular bitcoin-oriented services in Europe offer ever worse deals!  The second option seems to be the most straightforward structure that could be created onshore in the US, to date. Bitcoin Investment Trust is a private, open-ended trust with shares traded on the over-the-counter markets. The BIT\u2019s sponsor is Grayscale Investments, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, which\u200a\u2014\u200aagain\u200a\u2014\u200aI\u2019m not sure whether this is good or bad. The management fee is 2% but shares are of different liquidity class compared to XBT Provider (they are not exchange traded, just \u201cpublicly quoted\u201d) so the direct markup comparison would be unfair.  Show-stoppers Classified Why are there so few instruments? What stops bitcoin-based ETPs from emerging all over the world considering the high demand? To answer that, let\u2019s just look into the prospectus of the only entity that has managed to pass all local barriers. In the XBT Provider\u2019s case, there are three parties responsible in the face of an investor: Europe\u2019s regulator, Sweden\u2019s regulator, and the asset manager. It is quite interesting to compare their lists of considered risks and concerns. Europe\u2019s bureaucracy\u200a\u2014\u200aas the top authority in the chain\u200a\u2014\u200ademonstrates the wide vision and biases towards the rule of law. This is the essence of the risk analysis by European Banking Authority: Exchange hackWallet handlingPayment irreversibilityValue drops to zeroCriminal image or involvementTax problemsThe next authority\u200a\u2014\u200aSwedish Central Bank\u200a\u2014\u200ahas a different perspective that is somewhat more of a market and competition conception of life. Its top concerns are: Market valueNo real-time paymentsLow global usageLow trade in BitcoinAlt-coin competitionThe market player itself duly demonstrates the technocratic and managerial attitude: Liquidity risksPolitical risksDevelopers\u2019 conflictsCode bugs51% attacksLoss of confidenceWhile bureaucrats\u2019 concerns are obvious and boring, GABI (Global Advisors Bitcoin Investment) makes a very interesting addition to the lists with #6, above. The complete text for #6 on its list is: \u201cRisk for loss of confidence for the Bitcoin protocol and the Bitcoin network. Should miners for reasons yet unknown seize to register completed transactions within blocks which have been detached from the blockchain, the confidence in the Bitcoin protocol and the network will be reduced, which will reduce the value of Bitcoin.\u201d Busting the Fork Ghost The idea of a bitcoin hard fork is a serious matter. Here are a few questions for you: Should a bitcoin-based fund prospectus define what would be done in a case of a blockchain \u201cfork\u201d?If yes, should it close, split, leave both parent and child cryptocurrencies onboard, or choose a chain to follow?If the latter, how exactly to define what is Bitcoin and what is not? By the longest chain? What if a fork\u2019s PoW is easy to compute? By chain with the most work? By specifying the software version? How can an independent party objectively decide\u200a\u2014\u200abased solely on quantifiable parameters\u200a\u2014\u200awhich prong of a fork is the right one?How to define a fund\u2019s fiduciary duty of the forked coin?Should a fund state how it will store or liquidate the secondary coin?If a fund splits, what is the procedure to re-determine general administrative expenses and management fee?Should such a decision require an approval from investors or can that be left to a fund manager?Even if one can manage to answer a question, the following one(s) is likely to annoy you more. A fork may be accidental, political, or it may never happen. Some people argue that in the event of a split, one coin would \u201cquickly die\u201d being unable to take any economic power following it: [Ethereum is fundamentally different to bitcoin, those differences allowed a minority chain to survive. That would not be the case with bitcoin. To maintain a minority fork of bitcoin it would be necessary to change the difficulty level and the mining algorithm, such changes even would probably not be enough to maintain the forks value in the face of the economic pressure from the majority chain. After all those changes there is no question about what is and what isn\u2019t bitcoin proper, the only remaining question is why anyone would be foolish enough to try to fork without majority economic support and mining hash power combined as opposed to simply start a new alt coin, which at least has a tiny chance of life.] link I disagree. I suppose anything can happen. Anything. One can try to prove the existence or possibility of something but can never prove the non-existence or impossibility of something, including that of Bitcoin splitting into several currencies with more than one survivor. Actually, a few seconds of coexistence will be enough grounds for the filing of lawsuits. It may be hopeless for an investor to win such a suit but the potential legal fees and time still pose real threats. Regulators and asset managers must look into how to deal with this issue before they open a fund and invite investors. If they do not prepare and describe their course of action in a prospectus they will face troubles. Thus, right now, this issue should be slowing down the process of regulator\u2019s approval even if the possibility of its practical occurrence is next to zero. At the end of the day, the SEC is looking to protect and\u200a\u2014\u200aeven more importantly\u200a\u2014\u200awarn investors so they know exactly what are they getting into. So listing the choices for them is a must. The faster these disclosures are written the sooner we can enjoy the ride to the moon. By the way, if a fork does happen, funds\u2019 decisions\u200a\u2014\u200aexpected to hold a substantial amount of coins\u200a\u2014\u200awould affect the price drastically igniting a self-feeding spiral of death. So we really don\u2019t want to let these non-bitcoin focused organizations take control of processes like writing prospectuses without the community\u2019s close attention and reasonable advice. ",
