            "answer_text": "If a painting is just some pigments on a canvas, which can\u2019t I make an ink ball can call it a painting? It\u2019s a question where you can answer \u201cYes\u201d, \u201cNo\u201d or \u201ctechnically\u201d. IF you can get the ball of electricity to arrange itself into patterns of \u20181\u2019 and \u20180\u2019 precisely, and to run logical operations (e.g. 1 AND 1 becomes 1, 1 AND 0 becomes 0 etc.), then yes, you can run a program on a ball of floating electricity to prove your point. That is IF you managed to create a \u201cball of electric\u201d in the first place\u2026 In the real world, an electric ball not really manifestable. First, electricity flows from a region of high voltage to a region with lower voltage\u2026 hence it is quite hard to make electricity into a \u201cball\u201d. Most \u201cballs of electricity\u201d, or \u201cball lightning\u201d are plasma spheres with ionized gas inside. Since electricity of sufficient voltage in the air also PRODUCES plasma, most people assumed such phenomena as a \u201cball of electricity\u201d moving in the air. So those demonstrations in tech events where they use focused laser beams to produce a spark of \u201celectricity\u201d in mid-air does not actually PRODUCES electricity, they just heat up the air at a really small region to produce spherical plasma sparks. In the same way plasma is produced when electricity travels from the could to the ground in the form of lighting. tl;dr: During a storm, the lightning that you see are plasmas that are created when electricity passes through the air. Ball lightning and other floating spherical plasma spheres do not imply the presence of electricity. ",

These circuits need battery power, but the programs they run are recipes, procedures of steps and decisions in a logic task. A music box, POWERED BY just a spring, FUNCTIONS to play such a program, USING holes or spikes on a metal roll or ribbon. A mountain of Chicken Nuggets will not suffice to make you able to play guitar like Jimmy Hendrix, even though you are POWERED BY Chicken Nuggets. You need the guitar in your hands that FUNCTIONS USING a program in your head consisting of training and experience. That training and experience is what a new kind of computer program nowadays FUNCTIONS BY \u2026 called AI (artificial intelligence) or DL (deep learning) instead of a step-by-step receipe, this type of computer program learns skills like a child learns, by example, ingrained in repetition. Regardless whether POWERED BY a spring or a battery, power is the trivial part of getting a machine (or you) to play guitar. Either a RECIPE or TRAINING is what matters for you (or it) to function.
