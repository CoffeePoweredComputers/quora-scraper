            "answer_text": "Based on what is been leaked iPhone 12 will have the same style of the iPhone 5 from the outside edges and iPhone 11 back glass and maybe new colors. From the insides specs wise it will have A14 processor, rumor supporting 5G which is a big upgrade, OLED display etc\u2026 To answer your question yes it is better always upgrades are better but at the end of the day everything comes with a price is it worth the money to upgrade based on my opinion NO it\u2019s is not worth it but if you got the money or if you have an older phone then yes 100% recommended.
