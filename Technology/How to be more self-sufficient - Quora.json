            "answer_text": "I'm assuming you mean as an individual rather than growing your own food etc. It's about being comfortable in your own skin and enjoying your own company and making choices that match what you want. How do you get more comfortable in your own skin? Well it starts with looking at yourself and appreciating things about yourself. We tend to spend too much time comparing ourselves to others and often coming out of the comparison feeling second rate. So instead focus on you without reference to others and spend some time considering What you like about yourself What good things you've done consider even small things What you've achieved Then think about what you enjoy doing. What makes you feel at peace with yourself and comfortable with yourself. Then consider how often you do these things. Often if you like reading or walking or whatever it is it's tempting not to do these things if others don't want to go along. So you can spend time doing things that you don't really enjoy and deny yourself the things you do enjoy. This tends to increase any sense of discomfort. Recognising your worth through appreciating yourself and knowing what matters to you especially in terms of how you spend your time and energy is key to being more self sufficient. It then enables you to make choices that sustain you rather than deplete you with confidence, rather than following the crowd. Being self sufficient means making better choices. Better choices about how you spend your time and who you spend your time with. Over time the choices become natural as you know what matches your values and nurture you rather than being swayed by what others want and just going along because it feels easier. Work on liking and valuing yourself and understanding what matters to you and it will increase your self sufficiency. ",

            "answer_text": "Becoming more self sufficient is a complex process and I think it depends on your goals. What are you hoping to attain from becoming self sufficient? Do you want to rely less on the conventional grocery markets? Do you want to pick up skills that might be considered old fashioned by today\u2019s terms? Do you want to be properly prepared in case sh*t hits the fan? Determine what your goal is and come up with a game plan from there. For example: I wanted to be less reliant on the conventional grocery markets in my area because I wanted to be more in control of what I was putting into my family\u2019s belly. This meant learning how to garden, how to raise my own stock (like chickens, beef, rabbits, etc) and then butcher them. Something I would caution yourself against is being too hard on yourself. Everyone\u2019s goal (at least when first starting out) is to complete their goal in one easy step. To stop having to shop at the grocery store and so on. I highly reccomend picking one thing from that particular goal and becoming good at it. For example, if you want to be less reliant on the food system, learn how to can, or learn how to make your own butter/milk, or learn how to butcher your own stock, etc. Once you\u2019ve mastered that particular skill, move onto the next when you feel confident to do so. As for particular skills that I suggest to newbies to give them a decent foundation, I recommend the following: Learn how to gardenLearn cooking (like how to make things from scratch such as bisucits-etc) and preservation skills like canning, butchering, etc.Learn animal husbandry and then raise your own animals- start out with one particular animal and add a different type when you become more confident. I started out with chickens and then quickly moved onto rabbits and so on.Learn how to find and prepare water for safe drinking.Become familiar with CPR and First Aid- you never know when you\u2019ll need it.Learn How To Sew, Knit and CrochetBecome a pro at hunting and fishingLearn how to forage for foods like berries or herbsand so on. Everyone\u2019s goal list will vary and is compeltely dependent on your particular resources, your abilities, comfort level, and what your particular goals are. The important part is to start now and don\u2019t put it off for a \u201cbetter day\u201d. There is no better day than today. -Candace ",
