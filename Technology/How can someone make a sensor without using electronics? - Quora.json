Distance - count the circumference of a wheelweight - use aknown weight e.g bag with 10ltr. of water and a Differential scaletemperature - use the change of the length of a metal rodThere are many ways to make sensors you just need to look what was done in the old days. I was very impressed how the old power plants controlled the speed of their tubines, made a safety supervision of the pipes running 200m down to the turbine with sort of a spoon - if the pipe wold break the pressure would get down and spring would activate a lock and cut off the water - great engineering..
