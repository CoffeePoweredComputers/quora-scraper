            "answer_text": "I think microLED will be a plateau that will last for several years. Then I believe homes will be updated or built with Environmental Rooms with a 360-degree projection for gaming or relaxing in the midst of a pine forest with the birds' sounds and the aroma. Even sporting events with the effect of sitting in the stadium. Or sequester you in a quiet vestibule with hanging Monets\u2019 etc Just a thought\u2026 ",

I think it will be a while before they are affordable as well. I think Samsung was selling one of their very big ones which they call \u2018the wall\u2019 sor about \u00a3200,000 At that price have one in the bathroom, except it is too big to get in there !! ",

            "answer_text": "It depends on how manufacturing methods for micro-LED televisions evolve. Right now micro-LED is very expensive to manufacture because of all of the individual LED chips that are assembled one by one. Also, the pixel pitch is currently too large for making TVs in any size by \u201cpretty big\u201d. If the size and cost can be reduced sufficently faster than OLED manufacturing technology (which won\u2019t be standing still either), micro LED might end up winning. ",

            "answer_text": "Probably if the price can be low enough. The inorganic (normal crystal) LEDs last a lot longer than OLED. But AMOLED will probably still be used for tablets and phone screens because they include the touch screen capability in the screen itself. LED and LCD screens require a separate player for the touch control. ",

            "answer_text": "Eventually, yes - and that means that when micro-LED is cost-competitive with OLED at a given screen size, there will be no reason for OLED to remain. Micro-LED technology will offer all of the benefit of OLED, but at higher efficacies and without any concern over \u201cburn-in.\u201d However, it\u2019s going to be some time before that \u201ccost-competitive\u201d point will be reached.
