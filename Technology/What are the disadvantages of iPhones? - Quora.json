            "answer_text": "So u are talking about disadvantages of iPhones. iPhones have a lot of disadvantages to say. Storage : We can\u2019t add external storage to iPhones . If we try to upgrade storage while buying , the price doubles up. If we do it ourselves the phones compromised . Music : We got to pay for apple music and that\u2019s the only way u can download songs on your phone. You can\u2019t get songs directly from the web. If you have 3rd party music apps, Siri is blind to them. Headphones - With the all new innovative idea of removing the headphone jack in both iPhones and iPad pros, you are stuck with using either wireless or lightning headphones. At least, with 7,8 series and iPhone X,they included the 3.5 to lightning dongle. Now they don\u2019t even include that. The age of the 3.5 mm jack is gone with 2016. And if u have ipad pro 2018 with something like iPhone 6s plus or later, Ye got to give the 29 bucks for lightning earphones from apple or beats. Safari : By the time I am writing this answer u may not consider this as a fault , but earlier this was damn sloooooooooow . It was nothing as compared to what it is now. The pages would be incredibly slow. If we search for cats, it will show about dinosaurs.  Maps - iPhones have brought many changes in their software. But the one thing that has remained the same includes maps . EG. once we wanted to go to a place behind us. The map was showing \u201cgo 5 miles till the end of the street and then turn left , take a u-turn, turn right and continue straight\u201d when there was a legal u-turn at the signal next to us.Connectivity with other devices - U just can\u2019t use lightning cable to connect the iPhone to other devices. First u have to go to Apple , find how to download itunes for windows , and then specify the laptop\u2019s biodata on the portal , only to find that itunes can\u2019t be downloaded on your laptop coz u don\u2019t have a stable wifi connection. But u would have connected a 5g dongle from some high carrier.Poor packaging - You are giving more than a grand for an iPhone but still they don\u2019t give you a set of Airpods in the iPhones color or a lightning to type-c cable and either an 18w or 30w fast charger for iPhones and iPads.  LAST BUT NOT THE LEAST \u2014 Price : A single iPhone Xs max costs 1099 at 64 gigs . U want a 128 version, u can\u2019t have it. U want to pay in EMI take a specified carrier. But the gold color changes from year to year the gold version helps people identify which version u have.  and the all-new  After all this costs your phone cracks because of sponge falling on it from a great height. I am not telling this blindly but on my own experience\u2026 Also I hate that we have to swipe from down after face id has recognised your face . Please Official Apple Support respond if u see and read this. Show this as a major update in the next iPhone. Parzival Legacy of Tony Stark  ",

            "answer_text": "In the last 10 years, I\u2019ve used iPhones for 7 years, Windows Phone for 2, and Android for 1. Here\u2019s my list: The notch. All of Apple\u2019s current-generation iPhones have a large \u201cnotch\u201d at the top, which was necessary to house the advanced Face ID infrared camera, but is unsightly and is not something that anybody actually wants. You\u2019ve gotta figure that this will be resolved sooner rather than later, given how quickly other manufacturers have surpassed Apple in innovating around the problem. No expansion slot to add more storage. Apple would prefer if you pay them to get that storage upfront, even if you don\u2019t need it right away, rather than risk the possibility that you\u2019ll give your money to someone else. (They started doing this with Macs, too.) Limited dual SIM support. I think I\u2019m correct in saying that Apple was the last phone manufacturer to offer dual SIM support. Probably because they had such limited sales in countries like India, Kenya, Indonesia and Bangladesh (that\u2019s almost 2 billion people right there) where dual SIM usage is above 80%\u2026 they didn\u2019t seem to understand the importance of this. Limited NFC support. Again, only the newest iPhones fully support NFC, making them several years behind the Android competition. And while the hardware is there, The Verge described the software experience as \u201ca wonky workaround\u201d. I\u2019m sure this will get better, but it shouldn\u2019t be as bad as it is. No fingerprint sensor on new phones. Face ID is really good, but being able to unlock a phone without looking at it is a very useful feature that is no longer available. Meanwhile, the competition is doing clever things like building the fingerprint sensor into the screen, or putting it on one of the side buttons\u2026. Lightning port. The iPhone is the only phone that uses the Lightning port, which means you have to carry an iPhone-specific charging cable. Shoddy cables. Apple\u2019s Lightning cables don\u2019t last anywhere near as long as the phones do, so you\u2019re probably going to be replacing it. I know I go through 3 cables per iPhone. Anyone recall having this problem with their old cellphones? No? Didn\u2019t think so\u2026.  Headphone jack. Newer iPhones do not have a headphone jack, ostensibly for space-saving & water-proofing considerations, but more likely because they knew they were getting into the premium wireless earphone market and knew it would help sales. iPhones only run iOS. This sounds really obvious, but it does mean that you can\u2019t enjoy any kind of software freedom with the $1,000 device you just bought. You wouldn\u2019t accept this restriction from a similarly-priced computer, right? If you don\u2019t like iOS, you can\u2019t switch to Android or whatever. Can\u2019t organize home screen how you like. Look, I really like many elements of iOS, it\u2019s been very good to me over the years\u2026. but the inability to lay out my home screen the way one would like, using a combination of widgets, application icons, and empty space\u2026. it\u2019s fucking barbaric. They even brought this nonsense to macOS in the form of \u201cMission Control\u201d\u2026. instead of doing the thing they should have done, which is bring the Mac\u2019s ability to customize layouts to the iPhone. They\u2019re slippery. Cult of Mac\u2019s article \u201c10 things I hate about iPhone X\u201d puts it like this: \u201cIts curved glass panels, coupled with its size and weight, mean it\u2019s nearly impossible to go a week without dropping the iPhone X. And if you don\u2019t drop it, it will surely slide off something or slip out of your pocket.\u201d Battery is non-swappable. Before the iPhone, all the Blackberry and Palm road-warriors out there carried multiple batteries with them, often with a charger unit like this:  Battery running row? Just swap batteries and keep going! But Apple made it okay for manufacturers to making non-replaceable batteries, and it\u2019s us, the customers, that have to suffer for it. Any browser you like, so long as it\u2019s Safari. Apple has blocked Mozilla, Microsoft and Opera from offering their own web browser technology on the iPhone. Firefox and Edge for iOS are merely wrappers around Safari. This means you\u2019re always using third-place browser technology, as demonstrated by this chart from caniuse.com:  iOS App Store anticompetitive behaviour: The US Supreme Court recently declared that an anti-trust lawsuit against Apple may proceed due to anticompetitive, price-gouging practices in the Apple App Store. (WIRED coverage: Supreme Court Deals Blow to Apple in Antitrust Case) \u2026 issues about Apple\u2019s behaviour in this area keep coming up, like the recent (unrelated) accusations of anticompetitive behavior related to parental control apps, as well as the EU choosing to formally investigate over Spotify\u2019s antitrust complaint. And that\u2019s just from the last two months. The specific disadvantage to call out here is that the App Store places significant restrictions on the conditions by which you\u2019re able to do business with a software maker. Apple demands that they be the only middle-man, and they always demand a cut \u2014 not based on the cost of providing the download service, but based on the software maker\u2019s asking price. It\u2019s basically a sales tax: Regressive by nature, and disproportionately disadvantages people of limited financial means. We\u2019re paying more than we ought to be because of this racket. ",
