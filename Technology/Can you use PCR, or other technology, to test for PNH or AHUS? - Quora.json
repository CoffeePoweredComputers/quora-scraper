            "answer_text": "I had to dig on PNH (Paroxysmal Nocturnal Hemoglobinuria - NORD (National Organization for Rare Disorders)) and aHUS (Atypical Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome - NORD (National Organization for Rare Disorders)) \u2014 both nasty diseases. Straight PCR is not a good technology for these as they involve many mutations \u2014 you would certainly need sequencing. PNH is also tricky in that it is a somatic mutation (occurs after fertilization, probably much after), so you would need to target the correct cell population. PNH is due to loss-of-function mutations in a single gene, PIGA. aHUS looks like it can be driven by loss-of-function mutations in at least seven different genes but is inherited. Technologically, either a focused PCR panel or an hybridization capture panel followed by deep sequencing is probably the best genomic tool. Whole genome sequencing should reveal this as well \u2014 but with PNH a really deep PCR or hybridization capture will increase the odds of catching the correct cell population. Consult a genetic counselor or a hematologist if this isn\u2019t an academic question. They will know the status of current diagnostic tools and how to interpret the results. ",
