            "answer_text": "It\u2019s a contraction for Semi-articulated Tractor Trailer combination unit. Semi-articulated as there is a lot of motion available to the tractor trailer unit in the horizontal plane. Vertical plane not so much, only a few degrees of travel. Tractor or traction unit is the truck part. It, unlike other trucks, doesn\u2019t actually carry a payload. Trailer isn\u2019t a trailer like you tow behind your bumper that you can easily hit your car with backing up. It can be at a sharper angle than 90 degrees. That\u2019s where the articulation part of the name comes from. eighteen wheelers can also be ten wheelers.  Duals are often replaced with super singles. Eight less tires to buy. The tires are rather more expensive and a flat means a rim in the ground. These rims are 750 US Dollars each and are a coin toss if they are ruined or not with a flat. I\u2019m running a super single truck starting Monday but the company is going to dual from here on out on new stuff. Dual wheels can limp to a tire shop, singles get fixed along the road at twice the price. Super singles are lighter than duals and people bought into the notion that you could carry more freight and make more money. It seems that the expenses didn\u2019t make the fleet more profitable. ",

            "answer_text": "There are many configurations of 18 wheels, the most common is a ten wheeled tractor pulling an eight wheeled semi-trailer. It is the way the weight and axles are placed that makes it a semi-trailer. If the axles are at or near the back of the \u201ctrailer\" and a tractor hooks up to the front and takes about 50% of the weight it is a semi-trailer. You can have a truck and pup combo which also has 18 wheels. You can also have a single axle tractor pulling two semi-trailers with a converter dolly. In Canada we would call that an \u201cA\" train. We also have \u201cB\" and \u201cC\" trains and triples (three trailers) along with Rocky Mountain Doubles. In the 80's we could make a trip to Montreal and back to Vancouver and have different combinations on each leg. The only type mentioned here that a tractor could not pull would be the truck and pup trailer. This combination has gone out of favour for most companies as it lacks flexibility. You can see them as dump truck combos in British Columbia however. You can also see them in Washington State as a long draw bar can allow for a higher GVW due to their use of bridge laws. In conclusion a semi is a catch all word that really doesn't properly describe a large number of heavy combination vehicles, but nobody's nose should get out of joint if the word isn't quite correct. I just called myself a big highway mountain diesel truck driver. ",

            "answer_text": "They are actually referring to the trailer. It\u2019s a semi trailer as it carries its weight on it\u2019s back wheels whilst at the front it carries its weight on the trucks wheels. It is coupled to it via a fifth wheel. Over here the most common semi has 4 axles and is called a quad. They have 26 wheels or 28 if you use an 8 wheeler tractor. My truck and trailer has 28 wheels. 2 axle semis are mainly used for shingle trucks over here and generally referred to as artics (short for articulated unit). This means it bend in the middle. We mainly use B trains for freight over here also known as B doubles. It\u2019s 2 semi trailers joined together or we use truck and trailers ",

A semi trailer rests an appreciable portion of its weight on the draft vehicle, usually a truck tractor. Here's my truck, some will call it a semi, although it's really a tractor-semi-trailer-trailer, since there is a full trailer behind the semi-trailer. The rear trailer supports all its weight on the converter dolly  ",
