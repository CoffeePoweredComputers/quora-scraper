            "answer_text": "Hi, There is nothing in particular which you should learn before joining. Because, during training you will be trained on specific technologies as per companies requirement. It can be .Net, Java, HTML, Web, etc. But, if you want and if you have time, you can learn C and MySql because this two remains common in most of the trainings. Hope this helps. Thanks for asking. All the very best!! ",
