            "answer_text": "\u201cClean coal\u201d is mostly a thing of the past. The term was coined to justify billions of dollars in subsidies to coal research which was obviously never going to result in an economically viable product. There was no economic prudence test for the funds, and money was spent on anything from spraying latex paint on coal (the latex contains organic hydrocarbons which provide a minute but detectable improvement in combustion and therefore emissions) to really \u201cout there\u201d versions of gassification. All of this funding was available in the context of soot and smog, and never addressed carbon, although gassification technologies did promise higher efficiency, which would be achieved if the plants were not impossibly expensive to operate. Carbon is a pollutant like weeds are plants growing where you don\u2019t want them. We usually refer to 3p, meaning soot, smog and mercury, and 4p meaning the three plus carbon. The distinction is that the 3p pollutants are regulated in law because they have well defined and serious impacts on human health. We aren\u2019t actually seeing any regulatory pressure to control carbon or CO2 as a pollutant. Ironically, the United States is still on track to overcomply with the Clean Power Plan, and to meet or narrowly miss the Paris Agreement, in spite of the fact that neither objective has ever had any enforcement whatsoever. It drives the Republicans berserk, of course, and they are convinced that we are punishing dirty energy with these non-laws. The Paris Agreement was/is voluntary, and the Clean Power Plan would have been subject to requirements in 2022 for reporting only, and 2023 for compliance which all of the industry met about three or four years ago. I want to develop a graph that displays our actual progress but it hasn\u2019t happened yet. No one is building new coal so the concept of better or worse isn\u2019t relevant. Carbon sequestration raises the cost of coal by 70% and it isn\u2019t competitive with new wind and solar anyways, so sequestration isn\u2019t relevant to future coal use except for propaganda purposes.

            "answer_text": "\u201cClean Coal\u201d is an experimental process to marginally reduce the pollution and carbon emissions, but the most optimistic claims only show a very minor reduction in either. The bulk of the pollution will remain in the ash ponds of the coal plants and will remain FOREVER. Arsenic, mercury, lead, etc. do not have a half-life and are eternal. ",
