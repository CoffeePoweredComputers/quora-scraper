            "answer_text": "Assumptions:Since you said power bank, I\u2019m guessing it is a portable USB power bank. USB is a 5v standardI am assuming that the power bank has been fully depleted.Calculations:An 8000mah battery indicates that it has the ability to power a 1000ma (1 amp) USB device for a maximum of 8 hours. The reality of the situation is that it probably can\u2019t quite reach 8 hours, but more on that later. The 8000mah battery will also take a 1000ma (1 amp) charger 8 hours to recharge.The maximum charge current will be governed by two things:The maximum amperage output of the chargerThe maximum input amperage of the power bankA common USB charger will produce a maximum of 2.1 amps output current. We will just call it 2.0 amps to make the math easy. That would mean it will take 4 Hours to charge on a 2.0 amp charger. This is again assuming that the power bank can accept a charge that is that fast. If the power bank can only accept a 1 amp input, then the 2 amp charger will only produce 1 amp, and then the power bank will take longer to charge. Most power banks will have a label on them that lists their input and output voltage and amperage specifications. It should read something like \u201cInput: 5V 2A, Output 5V 4.2 Amps\u201d or something along those lines. That will tell you the maximum charge rate that it can accept. Then find a charger with at least that amperage output, and you will charge the power bank as quickly as possible.The power bank will charge at the lowest common denominator, so if the power bank can accept a 1 amp charge, and your charger is a 2 amp, it will still only charge at 1 amp. Likewise, if the power bank can accept a 2 amp charge, and you have a 1 amp charger, it will only charge at 1 amp.",

            "answer_text": "m-A-h is mili-ampere-hour. Like 1000 mili-meter (mm) makes 1 metre (m), 1000 mili-Ampere (mA) make one Ampere (A), which is a unit of electric current as metre is unit of length. So simply, 8000 mAh means: a) it can give 1 mA current for 8000 hours. OR. b) it can provide a current of 8 mA for 1000 hours. OR. c) 200 mA current for 40 hours\u2026. and so on. It is simple multiplication. Now to know the time to charge it, you go to the adapter back and read the amperage [Output section on the adapter]. In case of laptop/PC USB port, consider 500 mA as output. Now the time taken will be (hours) : 8000 / [output of adapter in mA] For ready reference: USB port will charge it in some 16 hours. a 1 A adapter will charge the bank completely in around 8 hours.** ** Please note that there will be some wastage in terms of heat and the efficiency of charging cable is also never 100%. The actual time taken would be higher by around 10\u201320%. Similarly, when you will use a fully charged 8000 mAh power bank to charge your 2000 mAh battery-device, you will be able to get a little more than 3 times full charge, AND not 4 full charges as around 15\u201320% is expected to get lost in heat and conversion.
