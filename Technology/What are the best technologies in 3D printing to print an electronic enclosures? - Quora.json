            "answer_text": "As many before me who\u2019ve answered this question has pointed, the ideal 3D Printing technologies that is used are FDM and SLS. If you are confused on deciding between these two technologies, then I would suggest you to use both IF you are applying 3D Printing for a consumer end use or client project which requires low volume and high quality production of the enclosures. Here\u2019s how I would go about in this above situation, FDM - Since it is pretty inexpensive and has faster turnaround time due to availability of plethora of FDM 3D Printing Services in the market, I would prototype the initial design with FDM until I am completely satisfied with the design.SLS - Once I have arrived at the final design, I\u2019ll opt for SLS to get High Quality, High Precision Outputs which are Consumer or client ready.But if you are looking for your own internal testings or hobby purposes, I would suggest you to stick with FDM.

            "answer_text": "It will depend on the quality and precision you are aiming to achieve. You can easily start with FDM technology and print simply enclosures for items like Raspberry Pi, Arduino chips, other electronic circuitry. If you want to print much complicated and critical enclosures then SLS/SLA/DLP are great as they have better print resolution, better finish with greater precision.But they can affect the design when the prints have lot of supports. This can affect the part at critical features. So the use of technology will depend on your requirement. It is important to note that it may not be justified to print all such enclosures using a costly jetting or sintering technology as it will not be viable to spend the costly material on a simple enclosure like a Raspberry Pi. So, choose wisely. You can 3d print using the FDM or SLS method. SLS is expensive and FDM is cheaper. If anyways this helps ping me back :) ",
