            "answer_text": "There are two ways to power a Ring doorbell. If you have an existing doorbell, it\u2019s just a matter of hooking the Ring up to the existing wiring. If you have no existing doorbell, you are going to need a transformer from Amazon and a resistor from Digikey. All that information is in the installation instructions. Just know that it takes a few days to get the resistor delivered before you can operate the doorbell. The resistor costs about $10\u201312. The transformer costs about $22.00 and there are a few choices on Amazon. You can operate the Ring doorbell on it\u2019s internal battery, but you\u2019ll have to pull it out and charge it about once a week. You\u2019ll also have to figure out how to run some bell wire from the transformer to the Ring. You may need an electrician to find a source of 110 volts for the transformer and run the wire. You can buy bell wire on Amazon as well. This makes a good project for a \u201cHome Depot qualified\u201d handy person and you will learn new skills. ",

            "answer_text": "Hi.. This isn\u2019t as hard as you might think\u2026I have a couple of friends who have a \u201cRing\u201d doorbell, and I\u2019m impressed with the video image it produces\u2026 The \u201cRing\u201d people, have already taken people without a standard doorbell, into consideration, with an inserted battery-operated device. I believe it's a little larger than the standard \u201cRing\u201d doorbell, but the finished product looked good on the video\u2026 OK..that being said, a simple \u201cGoogle\u201d of installing a ring doorbell, you find several DIY videos, of how this works, and installing a battery-operated Ring Doorbell. BTW, the battery for the \u201cRing\u201d doorbell is unique to the device, and I probably would purchase 2 of the battery inserts. One in-service and one on the charger... If you can reach Quora, you can do some \u201cself-help\u201d on the web with this\u2026 Good Luck Dave ",
