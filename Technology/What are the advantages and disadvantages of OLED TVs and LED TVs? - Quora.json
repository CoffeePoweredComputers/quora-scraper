            "answer_text": "OLED TVs are generally considered better than LED/LCD TVs mainly because of of the OLED panel technology , OLED screens have richer colors, true blacks, have better viewing angles and are significantly thinner than LED thereby making the entire TV very sleek and thin but its main disadvantage is that is come at a higher price than LED/LCD tvs and its not that you can't get good LCD/LED tvs , you can. so it all boils down to your personal taste, preference and budget So to summarize you can get good looking LCD/LED TVs but generally OLED tv have an advantage in terms of screen quality but they are more expensive. Some good options are the lastest OnePlus U and Y series TVs they have offer high quality LED as well as OLED options ( if you want further details let me know) Hope this was helpful ",
