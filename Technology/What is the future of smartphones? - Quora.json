            "answer_text": "The future of smartphones will be much more than you can even think off. Let me give you a simple example. Camera in mobile phones became one of the biggest achievements ever achieved (after successfully putting a chipset that can work off from a small DC battery). The first phone to have come with a camera from softbank mobile (model-J-SH04) and it had 0.1 MP camera with a CMOS sensor (ok, it was way small). People became amazed with its applications since you can get a quick photo from anywhere (unless the phone has charge in it) and you dint need a digital point and shoot camera to carry everywhere(if it was available at that time since reel cameras in smaller bodies were available, Kodak cameras being the most common ones). Following that, all mobile companies started to revolutionize this little technology and from there started the camera war, which even continues today. Apart from all others, one was NOKIA, which we all know to be the king of camera smartphones. And YES, nokia was first to involve CARL ZEISS optics, which includes a series of lens (first, it was 4 lens used together, then it increased to 5 in the lumias, and finally, the 6-lens system that became part of smartphone cameras comparable to that of DSLRs) that filter out excess light so that you can get the perfect image. It was actually Paul Rudolph, who first designed the TESSAR lens system for mobile photography. From there, Nokia completely revolutionized smartphone cameras to a whole new level that nobody ever thought. Bringing the brilliant lens system of cameras to mobile phones, combined with big sensors, probably bigger than cameras, Nokia first introduced 808 PUREVIEW.  This is the still the symbiant smartphone to use the second biggest 1/1.2\u2033 CMOS sensor (digital Point and Shoot cameras used nomally 1/2.8\u2033, 1/2.6\u2033,, now almost all PnS camera use the traditional 1/2.5\u2033 and a bigger 1/2.3\u2033), with a much useful XENON flash. That on a big 41MP camera. Output?, you can get high resolution pictures (upto 38MP) with only 20% decrease in details compared to mobile cameras at that time. Apart from that, you can get incredible PUREVIEW images at 8MP (also 5MP, 2MP) with almost 0% noise, extreme Details and exact Colours that are only possible in DSLRs. This technique got shifted into the LUMIA 1020 with a bit smaller 1/1.5\u2033 BSI CMOS and it came with more features. Also, Nokia introduced Lumia 1520 with similar hardware technique with added power. Then Microsoft introduced the LUMIA 950/950XL with its camera hardware based on old lumias ( 20MP on 1/2.4\u2033 BSI CMOS sensor, 2X loseless zoom, with 5th GEN OIS, Triple RGB flash, and upto 4K recording) that even clicked much amazing photos in any light. This was sure to be followed by android and iOS phones, but that aint happened as expected. They introduced other technologies like providing bigger sensors on small MP so as to create bigger pixels (HTCs Ultrapixel 4MP cameras), high FPS recording (apple had 720p 240 fps option, which was amazing at that time, xperia now has 1080p at 960fps too, its RX 100 IV specific feature), the more popular Dual camera system was first introduced by honor in its budget phone with a 13MP+2MP, then a 8MP dual camera, whereas LG introdced its dual system with an extra ultra wide 8MP with its usual 16MP, the other wide one got replaced with a monochrome, an optical 2X zoom. Even Apple and Google now have separate dedicated chipsets for their camera for faster performance and accurate photos. And still, they seemed to have made success in making smartphone camera better than ever, though not following the hardware trend. Future of smartphones will be better, but in which way we cant possible say that. It can be on anything. Chipsets, cameras, battery backup, screen, funtionality, all of these are getting better in unexpected ways. But predictions can be made that phones in future will have ; better chipsets in smaller sizes(less than 10nm), better processors, GPUs(to render 4K screens even better), Memory types(better than DDR5).Better camera hardware(probably high quality bigger sensors, better stabilization techniques, better Software algorithms, better imaging processes), increased higher resolution video recording at higher frame rates (more than 960fps)Better screen quality (probably higher resolutions 4K, 8K screens in small sizes, for better quality and clarity)better battery backup (smaller chipset sizes, software optimizations, bigger battery in small sizes)faster OS.Other technology included like mini projectors with Light sensors, Hologram projectors.",

            "answer_text": "My guesses: Near future (in some years): The name will not be smartphone, but PC again. Coming from \u201cpersonal computer\" but just called PC. (My PC told me\u2026 Your PC needs a version upgrade\u2026) A more integrated device. Better, smaller batteries. Perfect multi way voice interface. Perfect inter language voice translations. A device without any holes. Everything without wires. Better outside sensors, not built into the smartphone, but keeping \u201ctouch\u201d with the phone all the time. E.g. glasses. earpieces, cameras, mikes, body health sensors, tiny internet extenders. Auto connecting, without much setup. A bit farther future: More integrations with your body. One central unit and perhaps a backup unit.. For example a box. Probably in your pocket all the time. Or perhaps under your skin. Lots of sensors and small devices doing their separate functions. All communicating with the central little box. Some of these little devices will be part of your body. The display monitor will be inside your eye. Sensors would understand your words, murmurs, thoughts. Would play only for you inside your ears and eyes\u2026 A mike, a camera, an earpiece implant, a blood monitor under your skin, in your vein,\u2026 No batteries, your body will provide the energy, through some means. Or just tiny batteries that need to be changed after some years only. You will always be connected to central networks. So some companies will always know where you are and how to communicate with you. Alerts will be triggered automatically if you have health problems or if your data flow coming from you was interrupted for any reason. Extra guesses: First these features and services will be available only for selected groups of people. Then those will get mainstream and people will not be able to opt out. Police will be sitting behind giant maps and looking at blinking red lights. There will be no paper money, or cards. All incoming and outgoing payments will be personal and automatic through the device on or in you. ",

            "answer_text": "The Smartphone is dying. With the introduction of iPhone X, the mobile industry is just booming. The technology they occupy is really impressive and it evolves time to time. Apple, Samsung, Google and other notable tech companies in the mobile market thrive to make their products more efficient and awesome.  However, some other technologies are being developed in the shadows. Most people would not notice this change due to the excessive use of smartphones. but Augmented reality (AR) is rising behind the curtains. I\u2019m not talking about the technology, I'm explaining the possibility of wearable devices with AR technology which could replace Smartphones on a massive scale.  AR devices aren't much of a trend these days, but in the near future, AR devices will outnumber smartphones and create a new industry which will combine with a number of different fields such as entertainment, transport, telecommunication, education and so on. People like new things, it was the same when the first smartphone came out. Everyone who saw the product wanted one and it will be the same when a really advanced AR product is introduced. Google glasses sure was an innovative product, but comparing its capabilities with a smartphone, it is inferior.  When Graham-bell invented the Telephone, it was just lined communication, not much of a deal if you ask someone these days. That simple innovative product transformed the telecommunication sector, resulting advance devices that could do tasks which weren't even thought of back then. The same thing happened when Steve Jobs introduced the iPhone. This will be the same effect for AR. Google glasses could operate really well and it could be further developed to do tasks which weren't even thought of in the present era. Currently, a number of companies work on these devices. Smartphones are changing our lives, AR will revolutionize the world.  AR devices will be the next big thing. I\u2019m not saying that smartphones would be completely dead when this happens, but with the evolution of the world, smart cities, artificial intelligence, driverless cars and all these new things, smartphones seem a bit outdated. The world's evolving. Let\u2019s Embrace it # thanks for reading :) ~ Dinisuru Madawala ",

            "answer_text": "The modern smartphone is a metaphorical giant oak tree of a technology the world had previously never seen before. With a powerful camera, high-speed connectivity, touchscreen interface and millions of different apps available at our fingertips, it is a device that seemingly has no limits to what it can perform. You have heard the rumors of Apple\u2019s potential wireless charging feature for the upcoming iPhone 8. And chances are that you've been to a Starbucks and seen the Circular Powermat charging pads on the tables. But real wireless charging -- or as I like to think of it, wireless power -- where our smartphones don't need to physically be tethered to another device, is coming soon to a phone near you. Despite the obvious appeal of not having to search for outlets, buy a new power cord because you lost yours yet again and just having power available wherever you go, there are going to be some very interesting changes to the phone itself when wireless power is available en masse.  Let's jump to the future, where real wireless power (I\u2019m talking about a feature that works similar to Wi-Fi -- not the cradle/pad version) is ubiquitous, screens are transparent and our smartphones are byproducts of advanced AI. To truly appreciate the design process of a smartphone, we only need to look at the source and limit of all its features, the power unit of the phone: the battery. The battery size ends up defining just about everything we know and love in a smartphone: the computational power of the CPU, the resolution of the screen, the pixel count of the camera, the available memory on the device and, of course, the speed of the internet. Once the battery size is defined, consuming the battery's available power becomes the single most important resource. If a phone had unlimited power sent over the air, the battery would not have to store so much power. Without the need for extra storage power, the battery itself could be smaller, leaner and much more efficient, leaving room to develop other features within the hardware that were previously impossible. Now, let\u2019s look at the next obvious evolution for the smartphone: the screen. For years, different smartphone companies have imagined that phones would become transparent, AR-type devices that would integrate into the world around us. In 2013, Polytron Technologies general manager Sam Yu told Macworld that the transparent phone would become a reality by the end of that same year. Obviously, that never came to fruition. ",

            "answer_text": "Oh how I love answering this question... simply because it's purely based on speculation and trend.  Plus, I love giving \"Kristi's Crystal Ball View\" of the future of mobility. First, let me give you some background. I received my first Blackberry somewhere in the late 90's. Back then they looked like pagers with a full keyboard.  Since then, I've watched the cellular data market explode, built an incredible career in mobility and seen many trends come and go. With that experience, I have developed my theory on where we are headed at least in the enterprise; and believe me, I don't think we are too far from this. When you start a new job, you will be issued three things: 1) A smartphone2) A wi-fi tablet3) Your \"real estate\" or office space So here's where it gets fun... Your smartphone will be integrated with secure VPN -- thus, no need for a separate RSA code generator, your phone will know what code to enter for your secure connection from a remote location.  Your phone will be equipped with NFC, so as long as you have your phone, the building doors will unlock when you approach. Eliminating the need for a security badge.  Plus, with NFC your corporate credit card will also be integrated into your device, so you'll pay for that business lunch with a swipe of your phone. Like today, your office phone will be VOIP, allowing you to program your desk phone to ring to your smartphone. Don't worry, there will be a smartphone dock at your desk that auto-disables this when you're in the office. So what else is in that office?  You'll have a large monitor, a device that looks like a desk phone with no buttons connected to Ethernet, a wireless keyboard and mouse.  When you are working in the office, you will simply \"dock\" your tablet into that \"desk phone\".  At that point, the image on your tablet switches to what looks like a phone speed dial list and a phone keypad, auto-connecting to the LAN and VOIP system based on the ID in the device.  When the phone rings, a picture of the person comes up on the tablet, as well as, a smaller notification pop-up comes up on your monitor. You can answer with a headset or a normal handset, or for video calls, touch the notification for a face-to-face conversation with your colleague at the international office. But wait! There's more! (shameless infomercial reference) That docked tablet also connects you to a client system in the cloud. This system registers your ID and position, then gives you access to all the applications you will need for your job.  This \"terminal connection\" is rendered onto the monitor at your desk. Where you can either touch the application to launch it or use the traditional keyboard/mouse method. When you logout at the end of the day, any open documents will be cached on the tablet so you can continue your work later from home. So then, while working remote, you'll use the smartphone's hotspot feature to provide a secure connection to office.  Access it through your tablet and use the travel keyboard and mouse that came as accessories.  When you turn the tablet on at home, the applications and documents you were working on are right there for you to continue working. So, you lose a device? The company has GPS to locate them both, in case your kindergartner \"stole\" them for show and tell, but otherwise, a simple mouse click, disables both devices and wipes all company data. The company will be out $500-$1000, a drop in the bucket! In summary, if you think we are \"smartphone junkies\" now... I'm fairly certain that our future livelihood will depend on them!  ",

            "answer_text": "It\u2019s already 2018 and smartphone developments continue to impress us with their innovation and creativity. What more can smartphones possibly showcase in the future? Here are features that might continue or be included in the future lineups of smartphones.  Wireless - With Apple\u2019s introduction of the AirPower, portable wireless charging will most likely be possible in the future. Wireless accessories, such as Apple\u2019s wireless earphones called AirPods, will also most likely be a commercial possibility in the future. Thinner - Phones will continue to become thinner and lighter, thus making it more portable. How thin could phones get? A thinner hardware would mean lesser space for necessary computer processes such as microchips. Producing smaller but more capable chips would prove to become a challenge in the future. Battery - Batteries would most likely contain powerful and longer-lasting power. An idea presented in an article via Forbes on the future of smartphones, suggests that if phones are capable of receiving power over the air, batteries would not need to have extra storage power and can become smaller and leaner. Solar-powered smartphones are also a possibility. Transparent - With smartphones becoming more transparent, this removes a phone\u2019s back side and allows both sides of the phone to function. This is possible as long as we manage to figure out how to put and fit all the necessary phone accessories like the battery and microchip while unseen. Aside from the difficulty of producing this kind of phone, questions on privacy would surface as the content you would be viewing would be seen through your phone. Smarter - How smart can smartphones get? We still don\u2019t know how expansive software can get but as development for Artificial Intelligence and machine learning continues, it is possible for smartphones to be so smart that they can be able to predict queries or situations or already give out answers. Imagine yourself about to type a question, but before you could touch your screen, your smartphone has already predicted what it is and has already suggested your question on the search engine. That\u2019s possibly how smart they can get, or more. While we\u2019re waiting for these to happen, here are some of the things you can do with your smartphones: 10 Must-Have Fitness Apps (Part 1: Let\u2019s Get Moving!) 10 Must-Have Fitness Apps (Part 2: Let\u2019s Lose Weight!) 7 Mobile Apps to Help You Learn Coding on the Go Technology for People: Software Making a Difference Part 1 Technology for People: Software Making a Difference Part 2 ",

            "answer_text": "This is the thing about how people interact with technology, specifically with a personal computing device such as a laptop or smartphone. Most tech futurists and analysts point toward a future with seamless productivity. A future where people can browse the internet and watch their favorite YouTube videos, for example, through slim and elegant augmented reality (AR) devices. We are supposedly heading towards immersing ourselves in fabricated, 3D digital environments where upon any level of productivity and/or play should be possible and streamlined. Instead of holding a smartphone in our hands, we will have the capabilities of a smartphone available to us in this world of AR. Simply have your favorite applications launch before your eyes without have to touch anything physical. But here is the thing. People enjoy tactile feedback in their technology. Using a physical keyboard, even one on a touchscreen, is something that will be difficult to replace. Swiping through the air is indeed simpler and perhaps more intuitive once one gets used to it. But replacing physical technology with only gestures isn\u2019t something people will get accustomed to quickly, Considering all of this, I believe that at least the short-term future of smartphones and other personal computing devices will become more and more in tune with AR capabilities. They will slowly abandon more and more physical key pressing. However, tactile feedback will likely continue to be an option for those who want it. Whether that be in the form of wearable haptic feedback technology, I do not know. But, I believe some sort of option will be available at least for the short-term. In 40 years, I don\u2019t see any smartphones resembling those we have today. ",

            "answer_text": "It isn\u2019t an exaggeration to say that smartphones are certainly an essential future of almost all products and services. These smart devices with a six-inch screen and an internet connection have replaced innumerable objects in our lives and have certainly headed us towards a future that appears quite promising and convenient. But what could be the future of these smart devices? Do you think the smart devices could turn smarter? Well, as of now, you can control smart devices with the help of your smartwatches and you can also control the appliances in your home with the help of your smartphones. However, the future of these smart devices does hold something better.  In future, we can expect the smartphones to turn smaller and slimmer (slimmer than the present paper-smartphones which are being tested). And such slip products can be folded multiple times to keep them in your pocket, saving a lot of space. You would not need to take them out for any reasons as you can control almost every function in your smartphone with the help of a bracelet sized smart wearable in your hand and you can even clock the smart wearable to access the photos and videos in your smartphone in a digital format, just as you view the virtual keyboard and the virtual screens, without having anything physical. Just as convenient this sounds to be, it would be a securer technique and would offer nothing to the burglars and the pickpockets. Furthermore, we may see times when your smartphone would not be needed to be carried in your pockets. All you need is a smart wearable that stays connected with your smartphone all the time and you just need to wear the smart bracelet without facing any troubles with your smartphone. However, this is just a personal illusion and since I am not a technology enthusiast, my expectations and imaginations on technology are a bit meeker than the others. However, I would surely like to know your imaginations in the comment section. ",

            "answer_text": "There are some trends that are likely to continue: Larger screensLonger battery lifeThinner and lighter form factorsBetter biometric security (e.g. facial recognition, fingerprint scanners, etc.)However, I think one of the most interesting advances is the connectivity capability of the modern smartphone and where we can expect that to go. As few as 5 years ago, we used to have to choose phones based on what radio frequencies and protocols it supported. Most of the time, your phone would only work in one country on a specific carrier and you were lucky if it worked in more. The latest Qualcomm X55 modem supports a dozen protocols across over 30 frequency bands all in a single chip! New phones also support the latest Wi-Fi and Bluetooth standards making them a true \u201cswiss army knife\u201d of connectivity. The general idea here is that your smartphone will always be connected at faster speeds and lower latency than ever before. There are a lot of interesting cases that become available when connectivity improves. At the very least, it is interesting to consider whether we will still have \u201capps\u201d in the 5G era. Recall that for the first 25 years of PC computing we relied primarily on apps, but have now transitioned to spending most of our PC time entirely on the web. Downloading and installing programs is no longer necessary for most desktop / laptop usage. We are now about 10 years into the smartphone era. As 5G rolls out and smartphones have more connectivity, will we see the end of downloading / installing mobile apps? The next frontier looks to be wearables. Google Glass and Apple Watch are really only the very first forays into this space and are limited by the capabilities of current technology (much like the Palm Pilot and Apple Newton were the early forays into the smartphone/tablet era). Within the next 10 years, we may be expanding our ideas around what devices we use to accomplish the smartphone use cases of today. And the final frontier that we can currently see is one that has started via the evolution of smartphone system-on-chips (SoCs): the integration of communication stacks into the CPU/GPU/memory core. As this trend continues, all devices will have processors that include wireless functionality, so that eventually you will be unable to buy an alarm clock, coffee maker, or toaster oven that does not include the ability to connect to the internet. Thus, \u201cthe future of smartphones\u201d is that everything will become what we today consider a smartphone. ",

            "answer_text": "The entire smartphone market is converging to a singular point. Let's take a look at the past industry trend. In two perspectives, the first one internal. The phone have been getting insanely more powerful hardware then before. The new generation SOC's are breaking all the previous performance benchmarks. They are on par with many entry level laptops and with the ARM architecture, the performance is extremely optimised, being incredibly battery friendlyThe screen's are getting bigger by the day. The quality of display has improved drastically. The screen's are being used for media consumption at such a high rate that companies make it their mission to get it right.The battery life has been constantly increasing, with more capacity and faster charging speed. The phone's themselves are becoming efficient in their usage of power. The large capacity battery make sure that a full day's is completed on a single charge.The camera has been improving exponentially. Give are the days of point and shoot digital cameras. The phone's are performing much better than those cameras. Some phones have camera quality comparable to previous generation DSLR's.The internal storage has gone up. Phones with 64 GB of internal storage are common these days. The Ram on board the phone's is increasing as well, giving rise to multitasking and easy switching between applications.The barrage of sensors that phone come with these days is astounding. Apart from the obvious fingerprint sensor, gyroscope, accelerometer and light sensor, phones now have heart rate monitors, step counters, barometer, iris scanner, IR Blasters and a lot of others that I've missed.The phones today are coming with high quality audio. Not just the speakers but the inclusion of 24 bit DAC maha them ideal for music lovers.Now for the aesthetic changes or what I call cosmetic changes. The phone's are getting lighter. This making them extremely portable even with the increasing battery life and screen size.They are becoming much more reliable and durable. With IP rating certifications and other cool technology used to safeguard the phone, it's longevity has improved. Phones now are incredibly reliable as much more reliable due to construction and because of the materials used.Disappearing bezels, make the phone more aesthetically pleasing to look at. But it also makes more use of the phone body for screen.Now where does this all lead to, if the answer isn't obvious from the points mentioned above, then read them again. The smartphone of today has slowly started replacing individual items of technology which we used on daily basis. It has slowly taken over multiple devices and started to merge them into a single identity. The first industry to take a hot from this was the portable music player market, the market is currently extinct with almost no one using a specialized device for listening to music. Smartphones engulfed this market and emerged on top of it. Take the tablet market for example, this market is currently on the brink of extinction. This is due to the sole fact the smartphones have replaced them completely. The next market is declining rapidly is of the consumer camera market. The point and shoot digital cameras are slowly phasing out of existence. The next thing to phase out would be the entry level DSLR'S. Followed by the laptop industry. I personally don't remember the last time I used a flash drive. Well this is the case for most Androids. The huge internal storage serves as flash drive. Media consumption has never been higher than what it is now on the smartphone. Basic instruments which needed to be individually carried around are now integrated into the phone. So where is the smartphone industry heading, I don't know exactly but I can make huge speculation based on the trend that we see today. It's going towards a singularity. A singular device for all your needs. Be it work, gaming, photography, music, videos or any other thing that encompasses the general requirements. So I can safely say, in the not so distant future, everyone will have one device for all their tasks. ",

            "answer_text": "In its journey, humans managed to find a telecommunications device that allows them to still be able to contact the people closest to them without being constrained by space and time, called cellphones. The development of the device continues, starting from just calling anywhere, sending short messages, to playing simple games, now mobile phones exceed the expectations of most people. Thus, many things you can do with a cellphone today, such as visiting websites, chatting, accessing GPS, scanning documents, and watching a video from YouTube. The nature of human beings who will never be satisfied makes it to continue to bring something new, no wonder if at this time a variety of concepts of a mobile phone that is beyond the imagination or need can be found easily. These concepts are claimed to be able to simplify and improve the quality of human life. What kind of smartphone concept is there now? How many of them have been realized? Ear-Phone  In order to keep looking for easy steps for humans to communicate, an unnamed company presented a mini cellphone concept called The Kambala. The device is claimed to be the most compact device. Users simply attach The Kambala to their ears, so that every incoming call is received immediately, without having to make physical contact with it. The screen flexibility of the device is the key to its compact form. However, it seems that the concept will just disappear, thanks to bluetooth earphones that are already crowded in the market. Folding Sail  The concept of a cellphone with a foldable screen has been around for several years. Ever heard of rumors about Nokia 888? From the concept that is spread in cyberspace, the cellphone has a long enough size that is claimed to be able to be folded and adjusted to the shape desired by the user. Trusted Reviews At present, the concept of folding phones is starting to be realized, one of them by Samsung. The South Korean vendor is reportedly going to have one of the folding cellphone products, named Samsung Galaxy X. A prototype of the device was exhibited at the CES 2013 event, carrying the foldable display concept. 3D screen and hologram After Apple emerged with Retina Display, finally the smartphone manufacturers are now pinning 3D to smartphone screens. With the advent of the 3D screen, smartphone users can expect holographic projections, which are a combination of 3D features and projections from a smartphone. 3D display can be integrated with movement elements when users interact with smartphones. For example, users can resize photos using their hands to 'pull' or 'compact' holographic photos that appear in front of the user. There are a number of technologies that will be available and pinned on smartphones in the future. -Ricard Efendi - ",

            "answer_text": "The functionality of Smartphones comes down to a few fundamental things: Connectivity between peopleConnectivity to the internetPersonal tasks (like planning, notes, games, reminders, etc.)Great UI/UX (ease of use)Over the years, as accessibility to better tech emerged, Smartphones could offer more services to their users. For example, before the time of 3g connectivity, watching Youtube videos on a Phone was unheard of and Video calls were impossible.Before Smartphones could handle several GBs of RAM, having so many Apps running simultaneously was impossible, having games with detailed graphics was impossible, and having a super responsive and intelligent OS was impossible. So the answer to the Smartphone question is in emerging tech. Let me highlight some of these: Mobile Payment and CryptocurrenciesBlockchain and distributed ServersAR, VR and MRAI, Analytics and Big Data5G and IoTWearablesLow Power devices and Energy HarvestingEven better RAM and onboard memoryDigital identities and miniature biometricsBCI / NCI - controlling devices through thoughtQuantum Computing (Not really sure of this, since it has its own pros and cons and complications)My calculated guess is that Smartphones will cease to exist in the next 20 years and will be replaced by a new generation of Personal Devices. These devices will be either worn or embedded in our bodies and will be able to instantly identify the user.These will be devices that are so deeply and well connected to each other, that they go beyond the concept of being independent devices and start behaving as nodes (like neurons of the brain) of a singular larger global device. Each of these devices will be continuously picking up authentic data about the user, the environment, traffic, weather, etc. and sharing it with this closely knit network.The concept of cash and cards will cease to exist with these devices, and cryptocurrencies will be transacted securely and instantly.All these devices would be thin clients on a near zero-latency network, meaning that the Cloud would be so accessible that it would feel like it\u2019s running on your device.These devices will be controlled by your thought. So the future of Smartphones is pretty clear, there isn\u2019t any. But there\u2019s a lot to look forward to in what could replace Smartphones.Whatever it is will be an extension of our body and mind and will bring the people and devices of the world together to form one big supercomputer.

Some futurologists and industry experts predict that in years to come mobile phones will become remote controls for our whole lives, while others forecast that in the future mobile phones will literally run our lives for us. One thing\u2019s for certain: the technology involved in mobile phones and mobile networks has developed so rapidly over the last few years, it's going to be an exciting ride but, can be devastating too! Some experts believe that in the not too distant future, mobiles will change the way we learn and teach. With more than one-in-three school children owning a mobile phone, a future where camera and voice recorder phones are both learning and teaching tools is highly possible. We have already seen some education authorities using texts to alert parents to the truancy and even to notify pupils of classroom changes. Companies are always looking to make their products more environmentally friendly, and phone makers are no exception, with researchers looking into biodegradable materials and cleaner energy charging. For most of us nowadays though, this sentiment applies to our smartphone. From setting alarms and reminders to checking our Facebook feed, doing online shopping and managing our finances, we reach for our phones as soon as we wake up and don\u2019t really put them down until we\u2019re ready to sleep.

Because then, they\u2019re easy to move around, and convenient to use. Plus, they look better. Nobody likes this:  #2: Convenient.  Using a phone is almost like a race. You need to be able to quickly unlock, find what you\u2019re looking for, and then quickly put it back. This is the reason Fingerprint-Scanners were put onto phones. This is the reason why you\u2019ve got voice-conntrol. This is the reason why your important apps are always docked. #3: Graphics.  Most of our phones are now 4K.

            "answer_text": "I still remember the June of 2008 when I brought my first phone, the Sony Ericsson W700i with a dedicated music button, audio synthesizer and a 2 MP Camera that rocked. Steve Jobs dropped the biggest innovation in the world by releasing the iPhone which was a disruption because it discarded the need for a keypad on a phone. All these were impossible things to do at one point of time in life but were made a reality through technological innovation. Here are a few similar innovations that can evolve the way we interact with smartphones Controlling phone features using our mind: Not impossible since I\u2019ve heard of the recent AlterEgo technology which has helped convert thoughts into words. It\u2019s not far away when we carry out operations like sending a text, browsing the internet or simply reading a book on the phone through a tony stark like device fitted on our heads.Dockless Charging: Wireless charging as a term does signify freedom from charging cords but you still need to have the phone kept on the charging dock, this means you are unable to use your device when you\u2019re charging it \u201cwirelessly\u201d. Hence Dockless Charging could be a big innovation which would change the way we charge our phones.AR and VR: While AR and VR have already been released in smartphones, the technology is yet to evolve in terms of its application. We have only scratched the surface and deeper use of AR and VR in shopping, travel and tourism, communication is yet to be exploredAcute Personal Assistant Customization: Remember Jarvis from Iron Man. Imagine what if you could have an assistant who understood you\u2019re behaviour and helped you enhance your mobile experience. This could be the disruptive revolution of smartphone usage.",

            "answer_text": "We\u2019re seeing examples of data centers (Amazon AWS Snowball & Microsoft Azure Data Box) that are physically distributed versions of extremely robust processing centers. As a result, we will soon witness phones without processors as we know it. This means we will no longer have phone processing at the edge but close by in the cloud (on site at every primary cell tower or close by). One may call this fog computing or pervasive computing. Without a processor, you\u2019re left with sensors, a wireless modem, antennas, a much smaller battery, and some kind of visual interface. Batteries may even go away with wireless power or leverage miniature super capacitors (charge for a few seconds and you are good for the day). With the advent of Augmented Reality and smart glasses, I opine we will soon see (~10\u201315 years) elimination of the smartphone, tablet, and personal computers. Our whole world will be transformed where we can completely eliminate the physical world (immersive ourselves in Virtual Reality) or switch to Mixed Reality and \u201caugment\u201d our physical existence with information and visualizations formed around what we are interacting with. The only key for this to happen is having a truly robust wireless network everywhere we go where processing only is a few thousand feet away. We\u2019re well on our way with an available 5G standard, but the wireless carriers must do even better to provide robust connectivity (significant bandwidth to large populations with extremely low latency) in indoor and large outdoor areas. A daunting, but achievable challenge. ",

A few possibilities below:- But first let\u2019s see the past trend as below\u2026when the cell phone was invented it was mostly for voice calls and was about 9 inches to 1 feet in length, in approx the 70\u2019s/ 80s.It began then to shrink due to technology upgrades in 20 years or so then came the popular smaller Nokia\u2019s., with added sms features \u2026 it upgraded to features with music facility and radios(fm). And we got smaller and smaller cell phones..Then came the smart phones with bigger screens and apps.Now the cell phones are comparable to computers in some aspects with DSLR quality photo capability, and bigger screens.Going forward the trend might be that the phones might integrate with some kind of google glass type technology, where the display could be floating in front of the user and only be viewable to the user and the voice could be a cochlear implant types or a small Bluetooth like device for the ear.Integration of cellphone into a watch like device with a floating display like a projector and a ear piece Bluetooth..A flexible display , kind of a roll out sheet with a ear piece..No one know how some unknown technology or innovation might just integrate with the cell phone to create a more flexible and different product in the future..Upvote and comment..

The current black/blue/red slab with a screen on the front face is an evolution based on the initial devices created in the 70s for voice and from 2007 by the iPhone for the apps and the multimedia content. All of them linked by the SIM and the Google /Apple account. 5G and eSIM will change something very important.: the ability of the user to move their digital avatar in the different locations of his /her life. We will be able to move the number from device to device seamingless. Then use the same account in the self driving car, the smart house, the mobile office and so on. It means that in the future phones might become niche products to use between the other devices we are going to have. That will give them the opportunity to evolve again: flexible screen or new design more easily pocketable, modules to be added or removed based on needs. ",

Most computers and smartphones will be replaced by biomicroprocessor chips that can be implanted into your body, working with your central nervous system/neurons and using the brain for additional \u201ccomputing\u201d ability and storage, assisted by a built-in neural engine/AI. You\u2019ll be able to project images directly through your retina into your eyes, similar to Augmented Reality and like HUDs. They will also allow you to capture images through your eyes. These chips will allow have receivers and transmitters with high encryption standards, so future humans will be able to make & receive calls and hear audio through bone conduction, connect to each other and transfer information/feelings/thoughts, or connect to open/secure networks to gain access to any information available on the internet. You\u2019ll be able to experience \u201creal\u201d sensations in a virtual world - even playing multiplayer games will be more lifelike. These chips will be mega efficient/green and be powered by body heat/electric fields - no more need for additional hardware, batteries or inevitable electronics waste. All parts will be easily upgradable. A cyborg revolution will take place as people move to become more and more machine like to assist and improve their lives and gain access to infinite knowledge instantly. This will lead to a world of factions (human & cyborg / cyborg only / human only) and a major event will trigger a world war between the factions. The outcome of this war, who knows.

You have a chip embedded in your body that has your identity and data.It can transmit information directly to your retina or project it on any convenient surface nearby, if you want to share your display with someone else or if you want to give your eyes a break from immersive visuals.These surfaces range from tabletops to windows, doors, and walls.These surfaces sense your information and show you information that only you can see, thanks to your retina data personalizer.Phone calls (and all sounds) are directly routed to embedded transmitters that route voice through bone conduction without interfering with your hearing.Your neural channels are mapped to data entry and control parameters that you can watch form in your retinal map, allowing you to input information and chat/work/write Quora answers.There are cameras everywhere. At any point, you can draw up all the available images of you in this moment and pick one to customize and save as your photo/video.This chip and these sensors run on your bio-electricity and need no charging. Upgrade replacements can be done surgically depending on your budget and enthusiasm for these things.That, I believe, is the future of smartphones and all digital devices.

Possibly the most exciting thing about smartphone technology is that the field is still wide open. It's an idea that probably hasn't found its perfect, real-world implementation yet. Every crop of phones brings new designs and new interface ideas. No one developer or manufacturer has come up with the perfect shape, size or input method yet. The next \"killer app\" smartphone could look like a flip phone, a tablet PC, a candy bar or something no one has conceived of yet. Perhaps the most challenging consideration for the future is security. Smartphones may be vulnerable to security breaches such as an Evil Twin attack. In one of these attacks, a hacker sets a server\u2019s service identifier to that of a legitimate hotspot or network while simultaneously blocking traffic to the real server. When a user connects with the hacker\u2019s server, information can be intercepted and security is compromised. ",

But Samsung again launched it with some tweaks.Self Charging Phone - I would love to have phone which I would not required charging as I constantly use my phone throughout the day I have to keep charge atleast 2 time a day.

In 2008, Nokia and the University of Cambridge introduced Morph, a nano-technology phone concept that showed how mobile phones might become stretchable and flexible, enabling users to bend their devices into different shapes. Its key feature then would be the ability to bend, so it could be worn on the wrist.  In the subsequent time, we might change the parts of our smartphones according to our needs such as adding more RAM to it, adding a new and better camera or perhaps a powerful speaker. Companies like Google and Moto are attempting to bring us there with devices such as Moto Mod and Google Project Ara.  In future smartphones, we will have a faster processor, more RAM and graphics and all our data stored in the cloud there is still more possibility that we will control our smartphones through the cloud. Smartphones will come to a match with personal computers.  With the voice assistants such as Siri, Google Assistant, Cortana we will have the seamless handling of our smartphones. We will be capable of booking flights, order foods, receive directions, take pictures, use an app with no touch on the screen of our smartphone at all. Although voice assistants are in preliminary stages but are also growing at a prodigious rate and are right on par with human intelligence and this is all been possible owing to AI learning.Smartphones companies are attempting to change from a 2-D display to a 3-D display the primary occurrence of this can be observed in Apple's Retina display.

First introduced mobiles..  Mobile 10 years before.. Nowadays,mobiles like iPhone X comes with bezzleless screen,processors better than even some computers,taking 4k videos and surfing with a lot of applications..  But in future these mobiles phones are likely to replace the computers and laptops,coming with more powerful Snapdragon and mediatek processors ,browsing with more data speed {5g,6g,7g etc.}, The future mobile phones can come with a 3d portable smart display{PSD} with foldable technology giving a new reality of viewing to the screen as well as provide a better experience to the user .  And with a high quality wireless ,better long distance connecting virtual sound it will definitely give the user the best experience it can have\u2026 So let's see what the future brings in its surprise. whatever it brings sure it will be beneficial\u2026 ",

Here are some of the ideas which can prevail in future to make mankind achieve inumerable feats! Nanochips:This chips are less than 5nm and are twice as powerful as our current chips. This save space for other components in smartphone thereby generating less heat and more power thus saving costs on cooling systems and making technology more affordable.Human embedded chips: Imagine a chip is embedded near your heart and in case it stops beating( or cardiac arrest) takes place,this chips send an message to your smartphone and automatically calls nearby hospital thereby increasing your survival chances! Wouldn't this be a great idea? But it's hazardous effects on health could be a concern.Neurolinks: Imagining a situation where you are mute or deaf but your brain is connected to your smartphone (sound's weird doesn't it?) but you want to wish your valentine ASAP wouldn't this be great? your mind will generate an impulse which will be converted into an Electronic signal and will be send to your smartphone which will analyse it and will send the message meaning you don't even have to use your hands!Handheld robots: smartphones are becoming more powerful day by day ( for eg. iPhone XS MAX is more powerful than a 2016 iMac) what if they could order groceries automatically based on our previous purchases or preferences? Or even answer calls on our behalf?(I know that Google's assistant,Siri can do it still they are in developing stage)So, this are just an few examples and technology is developing everyday and also we don't know what our future holds for us!

The question is not how to make evolve a display by adding functions on it, but how to integrate most of these functions in a more ergonomic/natural way. Why need a smartphone anyway, when the network is everywhere ? Perhaps the smart things around will replace smartphones one day. Perhaps images can be projected on other surfaces than a smartphone displays (like anonymous objects or your retina / brain). But really, are\u2019nt you tired to change your smartphone so frequently without having much value in return ? Are\u2019nt you tired to pay attention not to broke it or just use his small screen ? In the next future all these questions will find answers that will radically change the smartphone the way we know it today. ",

Touch free interface- By that i mean you can do everything in your phone by only speaking to it.True wireless charging- Not the type of wireless charging we see in galaxy note 8 or iphone X. Soon there will be smartphones where you will just switch on a charger connected to the socket and the phone will get charge irrespective of where you are in the room.For now I can only think of these. I will update my answer when I get some new idea. ",

Carrying the computer everywhere with you is not really a feasible option. So now it time for the smartphones to shine. Its something you carry everywhere with you. Its a basic necessity even as of today. And it will be of utmost importance in the coming future. Communication being the least of what a phone provides, it will serve as a gadget that helps you in tons of ways. M-commerce is trending and in the near future will be a primary method of payment. So bye bye cash and credit cards. All you need is a phone. Phones might have nfc tags that hold your unique identity codes that help you get along various areas or to produce identity proofs as and when need be. They can serve as a replacement to everypossible thing you carry as of now, from driving license to debit cards, cash to identity cards, its all here and its all integrated. PEACE OUT! ",

Because that is possible . camera rays can detect your eye retina to unlock Screen then it is possible that we can use Electronic items seen in movies like matrix clone war . . In future smartphones can have actual HD Slr camera like Nikon, Canon, Kotak, etc Which won't blur even if u zoom for 8 pixels. We can get actual 3D speaker with loud and clear Voice with mini woofer. A Bluetooth or hotspot or wifi range which can connect 500 metre range. 4D calling, network excess even if we are on 100th Floor. Forget about phones . If our Indian experts get permission then they have the capacity that they can introduce such machines- that a man can fly. Don't even underestimate the power of a common technical student. ",

But this is just our own idea of what might happen and we want to know what you predict! Share your thoughts with us in our comments section. Forecasting the technological future is tricky at best. Back in the 1980s, the thought of carrying around a small, portable phone seemed to belong in the realm of science fiction. Then in the 1990s, imagining a phone that would allow you to browse the World Wide Web -- something that didn't even exist until 1990 -- was outlandish. Today, smartphones can surf the Web, run applications, play games and those with a near field communication (NFC) chip can act as a transaction method for purchases. Oh, and they can still make phone calls too. ",
