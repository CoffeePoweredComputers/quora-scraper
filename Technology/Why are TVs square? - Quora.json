            "answer_text": "TV\u2019s were never square. They were either round or later rectangle. When TV\u2019s first came out, they were round and the top and bottom were blocked off to give the illusion of being similar to the movie theatres.  All pictures and movies were captured in rectangles and that begs the question: If pictures and movies are rectangles, why are the camera lenses round? That is a question for another time. But back to your question. Everything you look at and see is a panoramic view with your two eyes which tends to look like a rectangle to you. In order to replicate that, cameras were developed to capture a rectangle. The original movies were a 5 X 4 rectangle which meant for every 5 inchs wide it was 4 inches high. The first TV\u2019s came out as round due to limitations in the development. That then had quite a loss of the picture display because of the rounded sides. Eventually in the 1960\u2019s, they developed a 5 X 4 rectangle set. Meanwhile movies started making wide screen movies to try to stay ahead of TV\u2019s. Those were a big draw to the theatres and gave a more immersive experience. In the late 80\u2019s, tv manufacturers developed HD TV which was to be wide screen in a ratio of 16 X 9. It really didn\u2019t become feasible and cost effective until the early 2000\u2019s. As you also remember Movies started doing even wider movies and went back to 3D movies to keep bringing people into the theatres. Now most of what you buy or rent on disk has wide screen shows that produce black bars on the top and bottom of your screen. You see the full wide screen effect but at a smaller size. Eventually sets will be much wider to accommodate the full wide screen picture as the film makers intended. ",
