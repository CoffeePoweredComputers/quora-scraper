            "answer_text": "Educational software is a term used for any computer software which is made for an educational purpose. It encompasses different ranges from language learning software to classroom management software to reference software, etc. Benefits of Education are Societal and Personal. Those who get an education have higher incomes, have more opportunities in their lives, and tend to be healthier. Societies benefit as well. Societies with high rates of education completion have lower crime, better overall health, and civic involvement. When technology is integrated into lessons, students are expected to be more interested in the subjects they are studying. Technology provides different opportunities to make learning more fun and enjoyable in terms of teaching the same things in new ways. For instance, delivering teaching through gamification, taking students on virtual field trips and using other online learning resources. SkillPal is a new medium of education. People who need mentors and trainers can join SkillPal. Here you can review your ideas and skills from experts. What is more, technology can encourage more active participation in the learning process which can be hard to achieve through a traditional lecture environment. The first thing that strikes me about education is knowledge gain. Education gives us a knowledge of the world around us and changes it into something better. It develops in us a perspective of looking at life. It helps us build opinions and have points of view on things in life. People debate over the subject of whether education is the only thing that gives knowledge. Some say education is the process of gaining information about the surrounding world while knowledge is something very different. They are right. But then again, information cannot be converted into knowledge without education. Education makes us capable of interpreting things, among other things. It is not just about lessons in textbooks. It is about the lessons of life. One thing I wish I can do is, to provide education for all: no child left behind and change the world for good. The main purpose of education is to educate individuals within society, to prepare and qualify them for work in the economy as well as to integrate people into society and teach them values and morals of society. Role of education is a means of socializing individuals and to keep society smoothing and remain stable. Students who are engaged and interested in things they are studying are expected to have better knowledge retention. As mentioned before, technology can help to encourage active participation in the classroom which also is a very important factor for increased knowledge retention. Different forms of technology can be used to experiment with and decide what works best for students in terms of retaining their knowledge. No one learns in the same way because of different learning styles and different abilities. Technology provides great opportunities for making learning more effective for everyone with different needs. For example, students can learn at their own speed, review difficult concepts or skip ahead if they need to. What is more, technology can provide more opportunities for struggling or disabled students. Access to the Internet gives students access to a broad range of resources to conduct research in different ways, which in turn can increase the engagement. Higher levels of education are associated with a wide range of positive outcomes - including better health and wellbeing, higher social trust, greater political interest, lower political cynicism, and less hostile attitudes towards immigrants. Students can practice collaboration skills by getting involved in different online activities. For instance, working on different projects by collaborating with others on forums or by sharing documents on their virtual learning environments. Technology can encourage collaboration with students in the same classroom, same school and even with other classrooms around the world. Some students don\u2019t have a college where they live. Others do, but can\u2019t quit their full-time jobs or leave their family to study at a university. In the United States, online education has become a popular way to earn a college degree while balancing family and professional duties. From 2002 to 2010, the number of U.S. students enrolled in at least one online (also called distance learning) class more than tripled, with nearly 20 million logging on from home, the library or the local coffee shop. While online, these distance learners join in virtual lectures, chat with fellow students, pose questions to professors, take virtual exams, conduct research and much, much more. This is the most appealing bene\ufb01t of online education for students with many duties to balance. Since everything is available online, accessing class materials and submitting work is very convenient. Exactly when and where this takes place is up to the student, as long as assignment due dates are met. The era of SkillPal begins here. SkillPal has the best mentors and teachers for supporting student\u2019s ideas. SkillPal is one of the best platforms for providing education. In SkillPal there are so many mentors from different fields. They will come to the students via the internet or web to provide knowledge and help them to grow up. Interested candidates will ask the mentor for a video session and the expert will send a suitable message to the candidate in 7 days. By using technology in the classroom, both teachers and students can develop skills essential for the 21st century. Students can gain the skills they will need to be successful in the future. Modern learning is about collaborating with others, solving complex problems, critical thinking, developing different forms of communication and leadership skills, and improving motivation and productivity. What is more, technology can help develop many practical skills, including creating presentations, learning to differentiate reliable from unreliable sources on the Internet, maintaining proper online etiquette, and writing emails. These are very important skills that can be developed in the classroom. With countless online resources, technology can help improve teaching. Teachers can use different apps or trusted online resources to enhance the traditional ways of teaching and to keep students more engaged. Virtual lesson plans, grading software and online assessments can help teachers save a lot of time. This valuable time can be used for working with students who are struggling. What is more, having virtual learning environments in schools enhances collaboration and knowledge sharing between teachers. Education might be important for some and might have been accepted as a social obligation but it does not guarantee that you will be successful with whatever you have received by spending so much time at the educational institutions. You can communicate effectively so that is enough education, i.e. you can write, read, and are not dependent on others for these needs will be sufficient. ",
