            "answer_text": "I know this isn\u2019t what you mean, but at first I read the question as, essentially, should you study CS because you don\u2019t like math, which, no, that would be a bad reason. Some great answers here, including David Zhang's, although requiring Calc III is becoming less common. Different programs/schools have different math requirements. At http://blackburn.edu, we require about as little as you\u2019ll find: only Calc I and discrete math, and most people who like programming either like discrete or find it less painful than calc. At the far end, programs in engineering colleges may require you to take Calc I, II, III, differential equations, discrete math, linear algebra, and probability and statistics; this was what drove me away from the field at first, and we don\u2019t use much of this, or at least much of what is usually taught by math departments under these topics. If you look at math requirements, you\u2019ll find schools at various points between two and eight courses. There are programs where CS and math faculty overlap heavily and where you can guess even CS coursework will be math-intensive (don\u2019t confuse this with combined math/cs departments, which are common, but don\u2019t imply that they have a lot to do with one another). Given your preference, I would not recommend programs at the \u201cmathy\u201d end of the spectrum. Most of my students don\u2019t like math. We do have some math/CS double majors or major/minor combos, but for most of my students, getting through just calc and discrete is very exhausting. However, I haven\u2019t yet had a student leave the major because of the math. In terms of \u201chard\u201d, I would say that a diligent student who is taking calc in year 12 will not have much of a problem. If you have a decent handle on arithmetic and basic algebra (believe it or not, the concept x=x is confusing for people, and for a variety of reasons), you\u2019ll be fine. If you double-major in art and CS, you are well-positioned to get a job as a technical artist (the need here is much higher than for \u201cregular\u201d artists, since you need good tech skills, but those jobs are open to you; they\u2019re just very, very competitive). You can even go into modeling & rendering tools, although that requires math (specifically, linear algebra). Very few people outside of the industry know what a technical artist is or does, which is good news for you. I think that Autodesk gives free software to anyone with a .edu address, so you can probably get Mudbox and Maya, etc., for free. Sketchup is free, and Blender is free and open-source. Start building a portfolio and really understanding the tools. I\u2019m not in animation, but in games we do a lot of modeling and game studios use technical artists, too. Go for internships even this year. If you are in Canada, there are some AAA game studios (I don\u2019t know about effects companies or other places that do 3D animation) like Ubisoft in Montreal and I think EA has an office in Vancouver, and you should apply for an internship this summer. You won\u2019t get one, but you will get on their radar, which is where you want to be. You should probably do the same for animation studios, but I don\u2019t know their culture. Good luck! ",

            "answer_text": "I didn\u2019t major in Graphics/3D modeling but you need to be good at spatial geometry, matrices, vectors, trigonometry etc to help you understand transformations. They\u2019re not hard. Now the question is how bad you really are at Math. Are you failing to comprehend simple concepts and getting a C or D on every test? If this is the case, then may be you need to rethink. If not, the feeling of not liking something is most often psychological because you don\u2019t spend enough time on it. I can share similar experiences with Math. After 10th grade, I tossed my Math text book with a relieved feeling that I don\u2019t have to study Math ever again. I hated it, found it boring, didn\u2019t understand why I had to differentiate, integrate, sin, cos and blah. But somehow I ended up getting good grades. So, overnight I decided I will go back to studying Math in 11th and 12th grade. I fell in love with the same differentiations, integrations, sin, cos and blah to an extent that I solved every example problem and the problems after every chapter from the text and many other books. Here are some of the benefits I enjoyed after doing that: It improved my logical thinking and problem solving ability to a great extent.It gave me confidence to major in CS because coding requires logical thinking and problem solving.I passed many technical phone interviews though I didn\u2019t finish coding the whole logic. When I asked for feedback, the hiring managers told me they liked the problem solving approach.I don\u2019t think I could\u2019ve done any of the above if I didn\u2019t study Math. So, if you feel Math is boring and you\u2019re still doing good, I suggest you spend more time on it especially on the topics that help you understand 3D modeling better. To sum up, you need Math. ",
