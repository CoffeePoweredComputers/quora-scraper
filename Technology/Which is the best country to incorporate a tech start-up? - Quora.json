            "answer_text": "If you ultimately are going to seek funding from angel investors and / or venture capitalists then you\u2019ll want to incorporate as a Delaware C-Corp. Why Delaware? The state has a well-developed corporate law and judges/former corporate lawyers in the Court of Chancery who understand business disputes really well. So investors really like that and have pretty much made that the standard state to incorporate in if you're starting a high-growth tech startup. The Advantages of a C Corp Shields entrepreneurs from personal liabilityVCs don\u2019t generally invest in \u201cpass-through entities\u201d such as LLCs or S-Corps for tax purposesCheaper to set up than an LLC in states that require publication fees for LLC\u2019s.Flexible stock structure/easy to issue different classes of stock, also easy for investors to use different financial documents (like convertible notes, SAFES, warrants, subordinated debt)Best structure to raise equity capital through crowdfunding sites like KickstarterMaximize medical coverage tax deductionsEasier to get foreign investors (S corporations, by definition, cannot have any nonresident alien shareholders.)Minimize employment taxes.- shareholder-employees of S and C corporations pay FICA (Social Security and Medicare) taxes only on wages they receive.The Disadvantages of a C corp Can potentially be expensive (if the corporation is doing business in a state different from the state of incorporation)A lot of corporate formalities/record keeping requirements, compared to an LLC, which is contract based.Double-taxation (corporate and personal income tax), since a C-Corp isn\u2019t a \u201cpass-through entity\u201d, like an LLC or a S-Corp.If you\u2019re interested in incorporating as a C-Corp in the U.S. then I invite you to stop by LawTrades. We\u2019ve helped connect many foreign based companies with American business attorneys to complete their legal needs. We offer free initial consults & affordable flat-fee pricing. Good luck! ",

            "answer_text": "I've been having some fun poking around with this website: Doing Business - Measuring Business Regulations - World Bank Group. If you really, really have a global product and you can live anywhere in the world, then you don't have to constrain yourself to developed nations.  Qatar and the UAE seem to win on the \"lowest amount of time spent\" on taxation and filing and so on.Total overall tax paid looks like it is lowest in Macedonia or Vanuatu.Hong Kong, Singapore and Ireland do well on various measures.For \"starting a business\", New Zealand, Canada and Macedonia rank very well.There's a measure there about enforcing contracts, which measures lengths of time court cases take. Singapore and New Zealand resolve things very quickly, but Iceland and Luxembourg resolve most cost-effectively.As a start-up you might be interested in handling of credit (protections etc.). While I'm not sure this can be reduced down to a single ranking, New Zealand, Australia and the USA do very well here.So on balance, the answer would probably be New Zealand (as an Australian, you have no idea how much it pains me to say that), although Singapore and Macedonia do very well. Having said that, if your start-up is more of a life-style choice (i.e. the goal isn't so much to make vast amounts of money, but to achieve a measure of happiness and self-fulfilment) then consider Vanuatu as it achieved top ranking in the 2006 global happiness ranking. (It doesn't seem to have been surveyed after that, but Lonely Planet still ranks it #1). Having worked there a bit, I can attest to this. ",
