            "answer_text": "It is a misconception that Nokia\u2019s 5G tech is inferior to Huawei\u2019s tech. Nokia has already signed 5G deals with more than 42 operators which is more than Huawei. It may be true that Huawei\u2019s product may supports more features than Nokia and customers may not even use those features even after 10 years, but, having more features in a product doesn\u2019t always mean it is more advanced. Given the billions of dollars of funding received by Chinese government, Huawei\u2019s R&D expenditure is more than Nokia, Erricson and Cisco combined. In fact they are planning to surpass top companies in R&D expenditure (Google and Facebook ) in coming years. Having 2\u20133 times the number of developers than Nokia, Huawei is able to provide more and more configuration options and more and more features much ahead of time when they are actually needed by customers and that too at a price 30\u201340% lower than Nokia. Also, due to unlimited amount of money in hand, Huawei is able to supply large number of executives for on-site support. From business perspective, Huawei seems to be much more attractive to Service providers. Only those who understand the long term strategy of Huawei and Chinese government tread with caution. Also, in terms of field performance Nokia is one the best. Historically Huawei is known to have copied \u201ccode\u201d from Nokia, Erricson, Cisco, Nortel, Motorolla and many other companies to come up with products in a matter of few years which took decades of hard work from their western counterpart. They have also been reported spying in few European and North American networks. Since it\u2019s inception Huawei by default gets majority of the contract from all the Chinese companies. These facts show the malicious intent and reason behind fast rising of company which was non-existent 2 decades ago. Huawei is also known to fudge the performance tests by doing deep packet inspection and enhancing the throughput of test devices based on their IMEIs etc. As far as 5G tech is considered, Nokia is the only vendor which supports end-to-end solution (wireless, fixed-line and cloud based) in the most open and secure way. In terms of field performance, Nokia has a proven track record in past and has the most advanced 5G network in the Korea and US market where 5G is launched already. Now, it\u2019s upto the readers to decide what is the best choice for Operators in any given country. ",
