            "answer_text": "No It is not that much faster. Nor better. 5G is very much hyped. It is Release 15 of 3GPP standard. It is a bit better than Release 14 but not dramatic. That leaves the paradoxic: it will replace 4G very fast. Because it is such a small increment it can happen easily. And then we have 5G without anyone noticing. ",
