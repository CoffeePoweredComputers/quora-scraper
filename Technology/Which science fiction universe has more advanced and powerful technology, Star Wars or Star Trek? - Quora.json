            "answer_text": "Which science fiction universe has more advanced and powerful technology, Star Wars or Star Trek? I would say that it is a matter of apples and oranges but in this case it is a matter of magical apples and apples. See, Star Trek is science fiction that, on a scale of 1 to 10 measuring the rigor of the science fiction with 1 being the first season of the original Lost in Space and 10 being (parts) of 2001: A Space Odyssey, averaged from 4 to 6. It tried but its world was first imagined in a context of 1960\u2019s TV by a guy who knew enough about sf to realize that the TV standard for sf was pure drek but really wasn\u2019t very scientifically literate. The series and films that followed did what they could while mostly sticking with the idea that Trek needed to be fun, optimistic and hopeful in its depiction of future adventures. But Star Wars was never science fiction. It is pure fantasy with space ships taking the place of magic carpets, shiny light sabers taking the place of swords and the Force making magic. The machines in Star Wars did what they needed to do to tell the story and what in science fiction would\u2019ve been examples of technology - the droids - were integral characters, albeit fairly magical in themselves.

            "answer_text": "Star Trek is more advanced, if you can believe the technology. Transporters, replicators, and Gene Roddenberry\u2019s original dream of total social organization\u2014these characterize Star Trek. In sharp contrast, Star Wars gives us the Black Empire of Lord of the Rings set up in a futuristic Wild West era. What a stark choice: the hyper-regimentation of the Empire, or the (to some) dog-eat-dog world of \u201cfrontier justice\u201d? Lawful evil\u2014or total chaos? But, though Star Trek has the better organizational structure, Star Wars has the better weapons and more fearsome capital ships. But again, the ships of Star Fleet are more maneuverable, and can place boarding parties using a method Imperial admirals could never anticipate. ",
