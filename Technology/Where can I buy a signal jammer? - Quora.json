            "answer_text": "Although i work within this area of expertise, in jamming mitigation (anti-jamming) by many methods, but i give you some tips first, rather than the place to buy it. First you have to know the frequency band that you need to jam, if you don\u2019t know specifically as the transmitted signal hops between frequencies, so you need a jammer that can scan all the frequency band and send a jamming signal in all bands untill it found the transmitted signal hopping pattern. Second, there are many jamming techniques such as narrow band jammer, wideband jammer, frquency hopped jammer , etc. Finally you need to know how the transmission is done, on which frequency and if it hops or not. I hope this help. Thanks ",

If you Depending on the frequencies you are interested in, you will find them advertised online and/or overseas suppliets. Import may be illegal. Sophisticated jammers that jam selectively / e.g. just knock out a cellular broadcast channel may be on restricted sale/know your customer. Note thar their use (transmission) in licensed frequencies (e.g. cellular) is generally illegal. ",
