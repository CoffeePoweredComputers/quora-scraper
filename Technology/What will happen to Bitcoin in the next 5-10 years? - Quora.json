Nobody knows will happen in 5\u201310 years. Please tell me what better answer you expect. I get into these blogs and then give up. When Bitcoin was 600$ I had absolutely no idea it will go to nearly 20K. I chllnge anyone here to make a valid prediction on Bitcoin or anythings else for that matter. I told the truth. What will Apple stock sell for 10 years from now? What about IBM. We are fools to make such totally baseless predictions. ",

I mean seriously, buying stuff online is actually really complicated - even with a credit card. Hopefully we\u2019ll see some good network upgrades, i\u2019m aware Lightning is working. There\u2019s always plenty off stuff to be improved. Bitcoin is a work in progress - so many people overlook this. Should be fun times ",

Because miners will pay more and more to mine BTC and we will have trillions of more money into Bitcoin and the crypto market. In fact, Tim Draper said he thinks the crypto market will reach $80 trillion in 15 years.  ",
