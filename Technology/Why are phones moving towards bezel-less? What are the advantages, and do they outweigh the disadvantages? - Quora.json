            "answer_text": "Speaking as an average user (at least, I think I am an average user), I think the only reason for this move is to have yet another fairly unimportant feature to tout as cutting-edge innovation and thus maintain sales volumes. I use my phone as it was intended to be used \u2014 a communication device. I make phone calls on it (imagine that!), I send text messages, I send chat messages. I use it as the device for dual-factor authentication. I have a special mail account that is only used by my phone to receive failure alerts from computer systems I am responsible for (I do not read email on my phone). Very occasionally, I use it as a wireless access point to provide internet connectivity to my ancient WiFi-only iPad. I almost never use my phone for anything else, because no matter how big of a screen your phone has, it\u2019s still really too small to browse the internet or read books or play games on \u2014 that\u2019s what various flavors of tablets are for. And I have never, ever, been distracted from the task at hand by the presence of a bezel around the screen, or its thickness. Any phone I chose needs to be able to do all of the above, while maintaining a small footprint (fit comfortably into any pocket) \u2014 everything else is secondary. I believe that most people whose life does not revolve around Instagram and selfies would agree. Instead of awing us all with curved screens and lack of bezels, I would be much more supportive of the manufacturers\u2019 efforts to design a good quality wearable communication device with AR and hands-free interface. I am not talking about iWatch \u2014 while I\u2019m sure it\u2019s a terrific product, based on everything I was able to learn of it, the people that benefit the most from having an iWatch are the people that have a need to count how many steps they took today, and how many calories burned. It\u2019s a glorified (and expensive) pedometer. I can\u2019t really see myself having a phone conversation using an iWatch, or exchanging texts on that tiny screen, or having a conversation with Siri without a pair of headphones. The Google Glass project, on the other hand\u2026 I can\u2019t wait until someone picks up where that left off. I\u2019d be the first in line to get something like that that actually works properly. Bottom line is \u2014 I see neither advantages nor disadvantages of bezel-less screens to the consumer. The only advantages I see are to the manufacturer/retailer. ",

            "answer_text": "\u201cBezel-less\u201d is an marketing gimmick over 15 years and starts from east Asia, this concept first used by LCD monitor manufactures, like EIZO and Samsung, especially the Samsung N series, the \u201cN\u201d is for \u201cnarrow-bezel\u201d. Later this concept is widely used for PMP (portable media player) manufactures in China, the east Asian market have a strong preference for smaller, lighter and thinner portable device, since the high density cities and public transit network. people are more frequency using mobile electronics on bus and train. In mid-2000s, the \u201cS1\u201d(turnkey) PMPs use screen size to define their price range(just like iPhone use capacity of storage), and with same screen size, narrow bezel design means smaller and lighter device (and mostly lower battery capacity, but in the impulse buying market, that flaw have been ignored). That\u2019s why Chinese or even east Asian manufactures are more aggressive in the \u201cbezel war\u201d than western manufactures such as Moto, Nokia, Palm, Blackberry and even Apple (That\u2019s true, iPhones except iPhone X are \u201cwide bezel\u201d in Chinese social media).  \u201cThe subtraction of Meizu smartphones\u201d - source: \u9b45\u65cfMX3\u8bc4\u6d4b_\u5355\u673a\u8bc4\u6d4b_\u592a\u5e73\u6d0b\u7535\u8111\u7f51PConline Some of the most famous PMP manufactures become smartphone manufactures today, include Meizu and BBK family (Oppo, VIVO, OnePlus, all of them are/were subsidiary of BBK Electronics). In 2011 or even earlier, Meizu, start using \u201cNarrow Bezel\u201d in their adverting of Meizu M9. (The previous phone from Meizu, M8, is the most famous iPhone \u2018clone\u2019 released in 2007). It might be the start of \u2018bezel war\u2019. Since then, the \u2018Narrow bezel\u2019 or \u2018Bezel Less\u2019 is widely used in Meizu and its Chinese competitors, includes Xiaomi, Oppo and Huawei. Since the strong growth of smartphone market in China, Apple starts make thinner bezel, but not Google, because Pixel is still \u201cRacecourse bezel\u201d []~(^_^|||) ",
