            "answer_text": "Having the right sunglasses is very much important to the well-being and health of your eyes. If you\u2019ve ever had a pair that wasn\u2019t the perfect fit before you understand how uncomfortable they can be. In fact, without finding that perfect fit your eyes can become permanently damaged. Eye doctors can perform a range of tests to ensure your eyes are perfectly fitted to your pair of eyeglasses. What sets apart a good pair of sunglasses from the others is durability, flexibility, and most importantly, comfort. So, the best option is - buy at least one sunglass from each of these two brands and find out which one is better suited for you. Because both Ray-Ban and Oakley are two big names in the eyewear industry and both of them produce quality products. You can get them from their original online store that will ensure you the best quality, but, will cost you much more. On the other hand, if you got a low budget you can try for other E-commerce sites like GreatMall8, who sales different designer stuffs at an affordable price. Ray-Ban vs Oakley Founded in 1937, Ray-Ban is an American eyewear company. It is arguably the most popular high-end sunglasses brand in the world. The company is an automatic inclusion in any list of the best eyewear brands. Ray-Ban sunglasses are so hip that they\u2019ve appeared in many movies, including \u201cThe Blues Brothers,\u201d \u201cMen in Black\u201d and - perhaps most memorably - \u201cTop Gun\u201d arguably making them the best sunglasses for men. It was bought by Italian eyewear giant Luxottica in 1999 for $640 million. It is a popular brand among sunglasses enthusiasts and casuals. The Wayfarer, Clubmaster, and Aviator sunglasses are the most popular products offered by the company. Some sunglasses enthusiasts might argue that the quality of Ray-Ban suffered a drop-off after it was sold to Luxottica. Oakley represents the American dream in action. In the mid-to-late 1970s, a young man named James Jannard drove around Southern California in his Honda Civic and sold motorcycle parts. He then began creating sunglasses to sell too. Today, the company is a leading manufacturer of sunglasses under the parent company Luxottica. Wraparound sunglasses from Oakley have long been in demand, but they may have gained extra cachet at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro when numerous competitors wore them. Retro sunglasses from Oakley are selling very well, and this product defines a cool throwback vibe for this company. Wishing all the best! ",
