Unless they can vastly improve the lenses in the device this is just a wast of time form a quality point of view. My own camera is a Mirrorless System camera by Olympus and has a 16MP sensor that when fitted with one of Olympus\u2019 Zenza lenses will out class any thing from a mobile telephone. Go to; Pro Gallery | OLYMPUS OM-D and see what sort of imagery can be done with a GOOD setup. BTW, yes, an increase in MP does relate to an increase in date to store. Unless, there is a huge amount of compression and that usually means some data and resolution loss. So what will be the point? OH! of cause, it will sell \u2018phones to the gullible as is the usual reason for these \u201ctechnical advances\u201d. ",
