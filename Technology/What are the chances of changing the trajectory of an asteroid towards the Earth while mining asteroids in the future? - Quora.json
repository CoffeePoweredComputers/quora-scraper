            "answer_text": "When you understand the physics you won\u2019t think about the question any more.  The chances of a particular asteroid hitting the Earth is so small as to be trivial, it\u2019s only that there are so many of them that it happens at all.  Once you understand a body\u2019s orbital properties, you can predict if it has any chance of coming close to Earth.  If that is known early enough, presumably true if you are on it long enough to do mining, the slightest effort can be applied to change the orbit to miss Earth. ",

            "answer_text": "No. The spaces involved are so mind-bogglingly huge and the energies needed to change the orbit so large that doing it accidentally would be impossible. It is like saying it is too dangerous to start your car because you might run over Barack Obama, Vladimir Putin and your mother-in-law at the same time. ",
