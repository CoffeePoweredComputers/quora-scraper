            "answer_text": "There are great answers here. My take\u2026\u2026 I would: Listen emphatically and with gratitude (customers often suffer in silence, vote with their feet, or keep interesting ideas about your product to themselves).Assess whether it\u2019s a core product issue or something that\u2019s either an edge case or outside your products intended use.Assess the potential impact across your base in terms of possible losses (accounts and revenue), market impact, brand damage, general reputation capital.Get the customers perspective on what resolving the issue looks like (whether it\u2019s appropriate or not is still TBD) .Provide firm commitment on a timeframe to get back to them with a \u201cresolution\u201d plan. Resolution is in quotes because it\u2019s possible resolution isn\u2019t appropriate or possible.Then gather your team and open the floor to internal opinions on all the above. Don\u2019t have a preconceived notion of a plan. Make it safe to raise any ideas no matter how far out they might seem. Once that\u2019s done, it\u2019s time to decide how to proceed. How you do that depends on your leadership style. Personally, having listened carefully to my team, I\u2019d probably have an idea of the best course of action. Depending on how strongly I felt, and my team\u2019s style, I\u2019d either put my opinion out of mind and get the team to come to consensus, try and narrow the options to achieve consensus after eliminating certain ones, or try and guide consensus. You always reserve executive privilege if you\u2019re not sold on the outcome. It may be appropriate to tell the customer you can\u2019t address the issue at this time. It may make sense to divert resources to solve it ASAP. The impact on the rest of the base is important. Regardless, do it with transparency and get ahead of he issue with the rest of the base if needed. ",

            "answer_text": "If a customer is frustrated, disappointed, or even angry with the performance of your product and service, the best thing for him is that he/ she finds somebody who really understands his/ her situation. That\u2019s the most important thing and (from a customer perspective) the horror scenario that you either can\u2019t get through or they don\u2019t understand or acknowledge and understand your situation. Don\u2019t make any promises or start any actions until you fully understand the situation. That may only take a few m8nutes and questions for a differential diagnosis, but you need to make an effort to understand what\u2019s going on. If you don\u2019t understand it there is only a low probability that whatever happens makes even any sense at all. Active listening and a true openness without jumping to conclusions is the challenge here. If you hear certain things several times a day, it is easy to jump to conclusions, so your customer service reps need to be well trained and prepared to not lose their cool Nd treat every single incident as exactly this: a single incident until you have done your analysis of what\u2019s going on. If your Product Management is any good, you have a differential diagnostic guide developed by you Customer Service team leader who will help you to analyze the situation, ask the right questions and analyze the situation. You should arrive at a known and pre-defined situation, so you: a) already have a fix or can point the customer in the right direction, b) you find out that this is not the right product for the customer and either point to an alternative or let the customer go, or c) this is truly a big problem, because it was not covered in the product definition but fits the uses case and intended application and target market. Again, this should not hit you as a surprise, because, even if it\u2019s rare, it may and will happen, hence you should have a simple procedure for it. Any half decent organization with a Quality Management system has a procedure to react to \u2018non-conformity\u2019, because that is exactly what this is: It\u2019s like a defect of a product, because everything else is how it is supposed to be but this one thing is not working. It doesen5 matter whether it is broken once or you just didn\u2019t think of it during development. No difference for the situation. It s just something that is broken what is supposed to be working. Your quality department will handle this, typically with a standard procedure (4d or 8d report), starting with containment action (what else could be affected, any immediate measure required\u2026), what is the root cause of the problem, how can we prevent the problem fro. happening again in the future, and corrective action: what do we need to do to remedy this situation. From a customer perspective it is important to be understood and being kept informed. It may require some time to fix it, but the customer should not wait until The final fix to be informed. You simply tell him/ her what you do, when you expect the next step and what can be done in the mean time. Also, inform the customer if nothing can be done or you don\u2019t have a timeline, yet. That\u2019s ok. But let them know. And thank them for bringing it to your attention. Ask them for input. People typically love to contribute and being ask as an \u2018expert\u2019 on their opinion. But don\u2019t make any promises about the outcome 7nless you truly know. Everybody understand that things can go wrong. You will be judged by how you handle the situation if something goes wrong: do you understand the situation, do you react swiftly and inform about the next steps, are you transparent (also by telling if you can not say certain things because you don\u2019t know yet), or do you try to cover up, accuse the customer of doing things wrong, go silent or even misinform or overpromise. Nobody asks you to nail yourself on the cross, but simply say what you do and do what you say. If you can\u2019t or won\u2019t do it, don\u2019t promise it. If you don\u2019t know, tell them but tell about when you expect to know. If you talk about ANY date or action in the future, make sure that you follow up by that time. This is how you build trust that you actually mean i5. It is really not that difficult- once you thought it through to the end. If you run you business based on instant decisions because you did not plan and think ahead, don\u2019t be surprised by some curve balls\u2026. You asked for it. ",
