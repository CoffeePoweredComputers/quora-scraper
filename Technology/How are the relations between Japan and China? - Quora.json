            "answer_text": "A lot of Chinese people think China and Japan are similar. Granted, I felt this way too, before really understanding Japan. However, I would now dare so far as to argue that China actually has more in common with America than with Japan. Both China and America are multiethnic and multicultural states. Diversity is celebrated in both countries, and both countries practice some form of affirmative action when it comes to minorities (as in, allegedly, it is easier for minorities in both China and America to get into colleges). Japan, however, is a monoethnic state that emphasizes on doing everything the Japanese way. The only ethnic minorities are the Ainu, whom I believe were not even officially recognized as a minority group until about ten years ago.Both China and America place heavy emphasis on individuality over conformity. In China and America, speaking your mind is very important, and you frequently see employees talk back to their bosses, waiters talking back to customers, etc. A lot of Mainland Chinese schools do not even wear uniforms, for that matter, just like in America. People who go to work (salarymen) in America and China tend to wear business casual, or whatevery they want. In Japan, conformity is very much stressed. People are not expected to stand out. In fact, the weird for \u201cweird\u201d (\u5909 or \u5909\u308f\u3063\u3066\u3044\u308b) means \u201cto be different\u201d. Calling a Japanese person, \u201cnormal\u201d (\u666e\u901a\uff09is a very big compliment. And if you go to Tokyo, you will realize that all of the adult males wear full suit and tie 24/7.Noise is an integral part of life in both America China. In Chinese, being \u201cloud and noisy\u201d (\u71b1\u9b27) is a part of life. Both Americans and Chinese are known for talking in extremely loud volumes in public places. On the other hand, in Japan, being quiet is very important as to not bother other people. Even on trains, you are not supposed to answer the phone.Both Chinese and Americans care greatly for the cleanliness of their own homes, but neither could care less about the public cleanliness. If you go to Chinese and American cities, you will notice both are very dirty with trash everywhere. Chinese cities fare slightly better than American cities, because they have armies of blue collar workers who are always cleaning the sidewalks. However, Chinese cities are far closer to American cities in terms of dirtiness. In Japan, despite the fact that trash cans are very rare publicly, Japanese almost never litter.Neither Chinese or Americans tend to place a lot of emphasis on traditions, while the Japanese are heavily invested in tradition. China had the cultural revolution, but that isn\u2019t so surprising. Every time a dynasty ends in China, the new dynasty will destroy all traces and culture of the previous dynasty. America doesn\u2019t place a lot of emphasis on tradition because it\u2019s a fairly young country full of immigrants, so it doesn\u2019t have that much tradition to begin with. Japan, on the other hand, is full of traditions. Even today, Japanese people sit on tatami floors, wear yukata, etc.Both China and America have their own definitions of greatness. China\u2019s definition of \u201cgreatness\u201d is to be the big brother of East Asia, hiding under the guise of liberating its Asian neighbors from American influence. America\u2019s definition of \u201cgreatness\u201d is to be the big brother of the whole world under the guise of spreading freedom and democracy everywhere. Japan, on the other hand, is content being Japan.Of course, I should emphasis that my post contains generalization, but I really do believe that China is more similar to America than it is to Japan. Despite being right next to China, Japan couldn\u2019t possibly be a more different country. ",

            "answer_text": "I am pretty sure the answer you want is the relation between China and Japan in the modern world. It is very complicated. With both love and hate. Let me first talk about hate HATE: #Nanjing massacre  (I won\u2019t put more photos because they are too graphic) 300000 ROC soldiers and civilians of Nanking died. Japanese soldiers raped, killed, stole, robbed, burned, tortured, etc. They were animals. And yet the Japanese Gov still does not want to admit and apologize for the crimes till today. We Chinese hate Japan for this. #Japan gov refused to remove war crinimals from the Yakusuni shrine and Gov officials still pay visit to it.  This is disrespectful to all those who suffered and died in ww2. (Korean, Chinese, Southeast asian and etc) #still no official apologies from the officials for the war crimes.(Comfort women, chemical and biological weapons and so on)  Today there are still lots of Japanese medias or even people think China and Korea are trying to fabricate fake history. More than 30millions Chinese soldiers+civilians died in the war. #They are still a potential threat for China even in today. Japan has a close relation with the U.S. The U.S. has millitary bases in Japan. We all know what are those Millitary bases for.. To restraint China. American puppy, another reason why we don't like Japan.  As you see, China still has a rather bad relation with Japan mainly because of the ww2 and Japanese unregretful and unshamed attitudes after the war. LOVE: #anime!! Needless to explain. I will just put a pic of my fav anime character below xD  #Tourism You\u2019ve heard so many anti-Japanese comments from Chinese. You thought all the Chinese hate Japan? Actually no. Japan is one of the most popular destination for Chinese tourists whether you believe or nor. And the number is still growing. (I personally love to go to Japan for traveling, too xD)  #similar cultures Japan learnt lots of things from the Tang dynasty of China, or even earlier from Wu during three kingdoms period. For examples you can still see a lot of Tang style architectures in Japan but you can rarely find any Tang architectures in China anymore today. (I am studying the historical buildings of China. And I prefer Tang architectures over Ming-Qing architectures)  \u9063\u5510\u4f7fDuring Tang dynasty, Nara period. Japan sent students and monks to Tang empire to study and bring back advanced technologies, gov system, laws, clothes, buddism sutras and so on. During Nara period the Emperor of Japan try to \u201ccopy\u201d Tang to make itself stronger and more advanced. \u5927\u5316\u306e\u6539\u9769  Byodoin temple in Kyoto. (Very typical Tang style architecture.) So when Chinese go to Japanese cities like Kyoto and Nara they can experience the Tang dynasty that they can not experience in China. The similarities of cultures make Japan and China have a closer ties. Let me just quickly list some cultures that Japan learnt or refered from ancient China. -Kimono -Sumo -Ramen -Tea culture -architectures -kanji -karakami -literature -Art -Buddism Etc\u2026\u2026.for more details:How much was Japan influenced by the Tang dynasty? I am a ancient China history student, therefore I like Japanese cultures a lot since it resembles and reminds me of the Great Tang dynasty of China, and there are a lot of people who likes Japan because of the same reason as me. (Ehhh, At least lots of my friends think so\u2026) #economy No matter how bad the political or historical crisis have risen. The economic bond between two countries is still going strong. I grew up eating and using Japanese bands\u2019 snacks and stationaries and i did not even realise they were all japanese. Lots of Chinese are quite ideological to say \u201cban all Japanese products\u201d in China. That would be impossible and super weird. There are too many Japanese bands in China: electronics, stationaries, daily goods, foods and so on. Same goes to Japan, they can not longer live without \u201cmade in China\u201d xD China is the second largest export destination for Japan($113billions). And Japan is the fourth largest trading partner with China ($312billions). Numbers don\u2019t lie, datas don\u2019t lie. So overall, i hope Japan can finally give an official Apology from the Gov(not a half-assed apology but a sincere one). And i hope China and Japan can finally improved their relation. It\u2019s better if you have a good relation with your neighbour, isn\u2019t it? PEACE in East Asia(&the World). I pray. ",
