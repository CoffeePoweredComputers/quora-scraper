            "answer_text": "How about 2015? I\u2019m not actually sure of the exact date, but the first person was treated for aging. Elizabeth Parrish, the CEO of BioViva was treated with two genetic modifications. One was to remove a specific limit to growth of muscles (we all get weaker as we get older). I understand she also had a muscle wasting disease. The second was to increase the length of her telomeres. The treatment was successful. Her muscles stopped wasting and became strong. And she has deaged by about 15 years. This is not considered to be a complete age reversal, but it is a very strong step in the right direct. And, my understanding, is that the treatment is on the market. Still quite a bit pricey though. Her treatment cost $1,000,000. While the price has come down, it is not yet in my budget. ",

What has been discovered is how certain things which are part of the aging process can be reversed or halted. That has been going on for several decades at least. A complete understanding of aging won\u2019t happen in the next decade and is unlikely to happen in the next half century. ",
