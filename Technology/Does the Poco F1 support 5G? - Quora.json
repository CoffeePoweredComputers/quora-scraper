            "answer_text": "No, the Snapdragon 845 platform has got a 4G modem only. 5G modem is not even available in 855 but if the manufacturer is interested they may use 855 mobile platform with Qualcomm\u2019s newest 5G modems. This is the reason we are seeing 5G phones with 855 and their price is sky high. It is rumoured that 865(rumoured name) will be having two variants. 5G and 4G (both integrated to the SOC). Hope it helps! ",
