            "answer_text": "That\u2019s a damned a good question! I\u2019m a Strat cat myself, but I do like a well played Les Paul as well! What would I own? I would go with a Night Hawk, it\u2019s a Gibson product, I think Epiphone makes them now. Long story short, It\u2019s a very versatile guitar, using features from a Strat as well as Les Paul. It\u2019s shaped like a Les Paul, it\u2019s scale is half way between a Lester and a Strat, and it has a slant humbucker at the bridge, a single coil in the center and a mini humbucker on the neck, with a coil tap to boot. I\u2019ve never owned one nor played one, but everything I\u2019ve read of them was very favorable. It seems like a good way to get a lot of versatility for a good price, a used Epiphone will run you around 3 or $400.00, it's Gibson counterpart(providing you can find one)  is about 7 to $900.oo, much less than a Lester or Strat. That\u2019s the direction I would go if I could own any. Thanks! Robert ",

            "answer_text": "it would be one of two, a 1951 prototype fender precision bass that someone posted a picture of asking what it was. I recognized it instantly, it had Leo Fender\u2019s fingerprints all over it by the way it was built. there was no question about it. he had hand made this bass. the other was a Gibson Les Paul old hickory that my brother had bought. there was a hickory tree in front of Andrew Jackson\u2019s home that was there since he was alive. it died and fell over. Gibson bought the tree and made 100 Les Pauls out of it. it had old hickory on the 12th fret marker and Andrew Jackson\u2019s picture on the headstock. fully documented with a special case. he ran into some hard times and ended up selling it before I found out. I'd have bought it from him in an instant. ",
