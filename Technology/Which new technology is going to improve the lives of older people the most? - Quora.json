            "answer_text": "That's easy. Simple video calling, using seniors video phones. \u201cWhat? Surely a technology as old as the hills has nothing new in it for older people? Surely video calling barely improves life quality?\u201d \u2026I hear you ask. First, some facts about the major problem faced by most older people: Social isolation and loneliness are linked to poor sleep, depression, dementia, high blood pressure and morbidity. There are numerous studies on each of these associations.As a health risk, social isolation is worse than smoking. (Would you encourage your elderly parent to take up smoking? Of course not! Would you let her live at home alone or in a nursing home with barely any contact with family or friends? \u201cWell, yes, doesn't everybody\u2026?\u201d)About 50% of seniors in aged care have at least one symptom of depression.The number two cause of death is dementia. It's the number one cause among women. Yes that's right, above cancer and heart disease.So how do we stop this neglect of our elderly parents and grandparents? It isn't hard and doesn't require drugs: An OHSU study led by Professor Alan Teo shows that only Face-to-face contact, specifically with family and friends, minimum 3 times per week, reduces social isolation and HALVES depression risk.Phone calls and text-based communication had no measurable benefit.Just 1 visit per week had no measurable benefit. (How often do you visit?)Contact with strangers, such as staff, doesn't cut it either. Has to be with family and friends.A second OHSU study, published March 2019, shows that Skype video calling also reduces social isolation and halves depression risk. This is a HUGE result\u2026 set to change the course of how Aged Care will operate, worldwide.A third OHSU study, this one by Prof Dodge and team, showed that just 30 minutes of daily video calling measurably increases cognitive function after just 6 weeks. The study results were so encouraging that video calling is suggested in the research paper as a preventive measure and treatment for dementia, and National Health funded two 5-year studies to quantify the longer-term benefit in delaying Alzheimer\u2019s and dementia onset and slowing its progression.Dodge's paper notes that an easy user interface is critical to acceptance and adherence (continued use).A UK study found that 82 percent of elderly are willing to try video calling.There are now, on the market, Skype-based seniors video phones.So in summary, simple seniors video calling technology will, and is, making a huge difference to the health of older adults. The biggest obstacle is getting the word out that isolating our elderly parents is incredibly bad for them. Links to studies to follow in comments. Thanks for your question and best wishes for you and your elderly parents. ",
