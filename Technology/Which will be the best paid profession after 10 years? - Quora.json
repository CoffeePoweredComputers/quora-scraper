It is likely that many wont even attempt to do something non-traditional just cause it is tough.Everyone doesn't become a rocket scientist even though it pays you a bomb! And why is that so - Cause it is Rocket Science!!It is very hard to predict what job will be at its peak after 10 years considering the world technology is changing so fast. But do something which not many people would attempt to do it and people will surely try to value your talent and pay you your amount just cause there is scarcity of that talent. ",
