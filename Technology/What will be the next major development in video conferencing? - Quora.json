            "answer_text": "Here are some of the tendencies that are going to be critical in video collaboration area. BYOD and Mobile First Approach Businesses tend to move away from the conventional video conferencing. The employees often need collaborate while staying in remote locations such as hotels, lobbies, or home offices, and they often use mobile devices. Alternatively, when people huddle in meeting rooms, they need to have the shared content at their fingertips, i.e. their tablets, smartphones, or laptops. That is why video conferencing developers will do their best to adapt their solutions to mobile platforms and withdraw traditional video conferencing endpoints. Smart Huddle Rooms Greater expectations are now set for the technologies used in conference rooms. Businesses do not have time for complicated setups and want to run their online meanings as quickly as possible. This brings an idea of smart video conferencing activated as soon as someone enters the conference room. Besides, users take a close interest in the meeting room control systems (e.g. PTZ camera control systems) Finally, there are more AI cameras trained to frame speakers and recognize people in the meeting room. 4K 4K is the next big thing for businesses, and more and more companies want to run 4K video conferences in their meeting rooms. This brings a necessity for video conferencing software and hardware vendors to provide 4K UltraHD quality. So far, there are only few 4K offerings on the market, but in the next few years this trend is going to be mainstream. ",

Video as a technology is truly embedded in the way we now operate. It is no longer considered an upgrade from a standard call. The progression from here is two fold: ReliabilityAIReliability The requirement for a stable connection from a bandwidth and CPU perspective is extensive. At present, there is no true way of reducing this or providing stability in an unstable environment. Large part of the current connections available are out of control of the providers and solely reliant on the user. However, and this isn\u2019t the fault of the user, but the user isn\u2019t aware the effect an unstable connection can have the meeting experience. The main aspect video will look to be improving on in the future is the reliability and stability of the service to ensure the user experience is as consistent as it can be every time. AI This is a term that has been kicking around for some time. You read posts such as: Can Artificial Intelligence Teach Us Self-Awareness? talking about the development of AI. This is almost certainly the next step for video conferencing, and any level of communication. Using AI to understand the participants mood, thoughts, and potential outcomes of the discussion. Whilst an AI could also auto assign tasks, generate future meetings for tasks and even organise calendars whilst the video call is being actioned. AI will ultimately remove the meeting minutes and all the complexities around video conferencing. ",

            "answer_text": "The next great advancement I would guess would be the capacity to record parts of the video by every separate participant. But it is a guess only. For now, I think the recording option is realized in a great way by many web conferencing solutions. Being an employee of one of them, I may be a biased contributor. But I do suggest you look into a demo (they are mostly free of charge) before you buy. This will give you a gist of what a solution can or cannot do. ",
