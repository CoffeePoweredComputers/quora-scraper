            "answer_text": "No. That is magic. Once the laser gets to be at a power density where it breaks down all solid objects, it ionizes the air. That sounds good, but it stops the laser beam in its tracks. You actually need a lot of beam path conditioning in laser cutting equipment to prevent ionization, thermal blooming and other atmospheric effects from high power lasers. Of course, on the Moon, you wouldn't have those problems. However, you still have issues with the solid material ionizing and getting in the way of the beam. ",
