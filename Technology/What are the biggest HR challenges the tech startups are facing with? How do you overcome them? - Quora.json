            "answer_text": "I think the toughest challenge for tech startups is knowing how to add HR leadership, strategy, and talent. How do you pick a great HR leader? How do you make sure your HR strategy becomes a winning part of your business if you don\u2019t know how to gauge people success? All are big challenges that most tech startups don\u2019t adequately address. How do you overcome them? My experience has been that in startups, the single most critical way to overcome challenge is to have a top leader, executives, and management team who thrive on doing whatever it takes to make individuals and groups successful. Why is that one thing so critical? Simple. People (talent) is attracted to people who give them opportunity to grow and take risks. In a practical sense, that means people are attracted to and stay with great bosses. Almost anyone can relate to and longs for that boss who meant the most to them developmentally on multiple levels. Those are the same bosses that people say time and time again they\u2019d work for them again in a minute if the opportunity arose. Good luck and hope that helps. ",

            "answer_text": "All businesses face challenges. The personnel challenges are very similar in both tech and non-tech firms. Everyone complains about how hard it is to find appropriately skilled workers who have a solid work ethic. Part of the solution is to be a good place to work by having policies and systems in place that make it easy to be an employee. People also want to work for people and companies they respect and believe offer them opportunities for growth and development. Being able to address these concerns is helpful in recruiting and retaining personnel. The second issue is offering benefits. Startups are by definition lean because they don\u2019t have developed sources of revenue yet. It makes it hard to offer the comparable benefits larger and more established firms can offer. The solution to this is to make the workplace personable, enjoyable and one that creates a sense of belonging and participation. It\u2019s hard for the larger companies to compete in that environment. ",
