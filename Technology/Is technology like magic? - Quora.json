            "answer_text": "I started working on the it industry just over 40 years ago. At the time my grand mother always used to talk about how magical it seemed when building societies in the UK were able to print a transaction on her passbook. She used you ask \u201chow does it know how much I have?\u201d so to answer your question my best answer is it depends.. it depends on who you talk to and how it literate they are. If you roll the clock back 50 years what we have today may seen magical, if you talk to someone who has limited understanding it'll be magical. To me no, it's not magical but all logical steps. People talk today about ai being magical, sorry, ai is a laudable goal closely followed by the machines are talking over, it's interesting to see what the scientist can achieve but true ai, no. To me the next big thing is mind control of computers.. this is actually happening today this will be the next revolution in our society. After this quantum holds some interesting possibilities, but it's not there yet and may not deliver the benefits being speculated. ",

            "answer_text": "As a real magic magician, not an illusionist, I can tell you that real magic obeys natural law, albeit, natural law not presently understood by science\u2026but science is getting there as they work in Quantum Mechanics, Physics, Psychology, and other branches of science. Magic cannot violate natural law like you see in movies or Harry Potter books, there is real magic and then there is fictional magic that makes for good and enjoyable reading. There are certain things that are necessary for magic to work and if that is not done, the spell is doomed to failure. If they are done correctly, then the spell must work. So yes, magic is a form of very advanced technology. However, our technology is to magic, as vacuum tubes and transistors are to quantum computers and practical warp drive. ",
