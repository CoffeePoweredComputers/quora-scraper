            "answer_text": "Online or Mobile App It\u2019s possible to change your PIN using your bank's mobile app or online banking website. This feature is often located in the customer service or self-serve area. Typically, you\u2019ll need to log in to your account and specify that you want to make a change, then follow the prompts to do so. Changing your PIN online or with a mobile app requires you to remember your current PIN, so be prepared to provide it. By Phone Sometimes, when changing your PIN over the phone, you will speak to a person at your bank. Other times, you may find yourself changing your PIN using an automated system. If you know your old PIN, the automated system will generally allow you to change your PIN on the spot. If you don\u2019t know your PIN, or if you speak to a representative, the bank will likely opt to mail your new PIN to the address they have on file for you. At the Bank Many banks will let you bring your debit card into the branch to change your PIN using a simple debit card programming machine. One advantage of this method is that it allows you to make the change on the spot. Plus, you get to pick the PIN you want. While it\u2019s easiest to do this if you know your current PIN, going to the bank in person is also your best option if you have forgotten your PIN. Bring identification, and once bank teller verifies your identity, they will allow you to change the PIN. ",
