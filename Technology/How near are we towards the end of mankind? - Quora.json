By that time, humans would have already left the Earth. Global warming /Climate change and pollution do remain an issue but these issues WON\u2019T eradicate the entire mankind. Sure, many people might die, but many will also remain. I think that it\u2019s mainly the rich or those who can afford proper housing and standards of living will live in the upcoming generations. Unless a huge asteroid doesn\u2019t impact, mankind won\u2019t decease. ",
