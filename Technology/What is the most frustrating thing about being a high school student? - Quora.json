            "answer_text": "Policy. I have been done high school for a while now, but the part that drove me up the wall was policy. At seventeen I was basically a functioning adult. I had a job that pulled 30\u201350 hours a week, a social life, an older boyfriend who worked on the rigs, five high school courses a semester (standard is four here), one college course a semester, and volunteer work at church. I was in school from 7:15 - 3:45 or 5:30, depending on the day, and worked until 10pm or 1am. I was still expected to help out at home, with cleaning, cooking, grocery runs, and fixing dad's pants after he ripped out yet another belt loop (the silly man hitches his pants up by the loops, and is endlessly ripping them out!). All this to say, I didn't have a ton of spare time, nor enough sleep. Such is adult life however, and I can handle that. What I could not handle were policies that managed to both treat me as a child and make my life harder. The school had a policy that said to call in sick you must have a parent call you in sick. Ok. Makes sense, right? Not really. I was eighteen by the time I had to call in sick, towards the end of the year. Legal age here is eighteen. I could buy alcohol, vote, get married, and join the military, but I could not call myself in as sick. Understand, I had never called in sick before. Not once. I had to get my mum to call in, while she was a work, and had been at work since four am. She was so thrilled. Another of my favourites was pep rally's. You not only had to be in the gym all after noon, completely wasting tons of time that could have been used for homework, but could be given a detention if you failed to participate. I eventually settled on a set of ear plugs and pretending to participate whilst frantically doing homework. You were not allowed to do work for other courses in class, which was frustrating as I had taught myself to work fast and was often done my course work before my class mates. Instead of being allowed to move onto the work for the next subject, I was either given busy work which was not graded or forced to do nothing. This policy was supposed to help teach us real life skills. If my boss at the time had seen me doing nothing and simply waiting for her to give me a new task, I would have been fired. Real life skills indeed. No highheels were allowed as part of the dress code. This drove me crazy, as I preferred to wear my work clothes of a skirt, blouse, blazer, nylons and heels to school and then to work rather than dealing with a clothing change. This meant I had to bring three sets of shoes every day. (Gym, school, and work) Perhaps the very best was parent teacher meetings. I'm fairly confident my parents had no clue what courses I was in let alone wether I was doing homework and studying for them. Nonetheless they had to attend each one and proceeded to stare at the teachers blankly. One last anecdote, pertaining to a teacher who didn't give a f* about policy, and was perhaps the best teacher in the school. Ms. H was awesome. The one night I had done an erend for my family business which had involved driving 16 hours overnight. The moment I walked in, Ms. H took one look at me and told me to go get a cup of tea and I could use any extra time in her class that day to sleep. ",

            "answer_text": "Oh man, I have a whole list. Dress codes. Even at my all-girls private school in a liberal area of a fairly liberal state, asshat nuns still get offended when our bra straps show or our skirts are more than two inches off the knee.Tests. They're all based on memorization, and unless you're taking an AP class, the focus isn't on understanding the material, it's on knowing the material, however briefly.GRADES. There are so many problems with this. First, your GPA is based on grades, and they mail out your \u201cfirst honors\u201d or \u201csecond honors\u201d certificates, which leads inevitably to severely inflated egos and dangerous superiority complexes, when everyone feels the need to immediately text friends about it. Another problem, at least in my school, is that if you want to go into the next year\u2019s honors course for any class, you need to get a high grade in the class before it. I got a B+ in honors physics freshman year because I'm not good at physics, so I was placed in regular chemistry. I'm much better at chem than I am at physics. I tried talking to the teachers to see if they could get me into honors chem, but they wouldn't. I got a 100 on both semester finals and over 95 both semesters. (This is just to show how it would have been much more beneficial to place me in honors, not to brag.)Stress culture. A normal conversation at my school would go something like this:\u201cOh my god, I'm exhausted. I was up until like 1 AM writing that persuasive essay for Ms. Smith. I got like 5 hours of sleep.\u201d \u201cYou got 5 hours? You're so lucky. I got 4 hours of sleep, and I had to work on my Spanish presentation and I had to make the bibliography for that history research paper that was due at midnight.\u201d \u201cYeah, well today I have lacrosse practice and then I have to go to my brother\u2019s soccer game, so I won't get home until like 9:00, and then I have to have dinner, and then start my homework. I'll probably have to pull an all nighter just to finish that religion project Ms. James assigned a couple weeks ago.\u201d \u201cYeah well\u2026\u201d (And so on). People get competitive about who is more stressed or sleep deprived. I'm not going to lie, I've been in plenty of these conversations, and even though I can't stop, I hate it. Damn it, writing this out just made me annoyed about how soon school is starting back up. I have like 3 weeks to look forward to all of the above, and then I get to actually experience it again. And it'll probably be worse because I'm going to be a junior. Anyway, If I think of more, I'll add them. Edit: Since this answer is getting a lot of attention, I thought I would just make something clear: I love school. I really love it. Even with all of these things that I've mentioned, it's a great place to be. So if you're a kid going into high school next year, please don't let this make you anxious or unhappy with going to school. I promise you'll have a good time there. You'll find your place, settle in, and have a great time. Thanks for all the views/upvotes! ",
