            "answer_text": "The short answer: Neither.  The biased answer: Canon The long attempt at a more objective answer:  When I was in my early 20s, my nephew was born and some months later, he was sitting on a chair smiling this incredible ray of sun and I realized right there and then that I needed to kick my tendency to procrastinate and go buy myself a camera. I hopped on Craigslist and for some unknown reason (probably because my dad shot Canon), decided to look for a Canon DSLR. A few days later, I bought a brand new film Rebel. I shot hundreds of rolls of film with that camera and captured some amazing moments - with hardly any regret about the quality of the shots as they related to the camera.  Right before business school, my dad bought me a Rebel xTi with a 10-22mm EF-S lens, adding to my 50mm 1.8 and my 28-70mm Sigma. After converting to digital, I could shoot lots more, review my pictures immediately and in general, improve my technique faster. At grad school, I went crazy, buying a Sigma 18-200mm then returning it for a 70-200 f/4 L which I subsequently returned for the 70-200mm f/2.8 L. And I bought a 100mm 2.8 macro lens.  I had a blast and shot lots of pictures, becoming my class historian in business school and enjoying every minute of it. At heart, I was a die heard Canon fan. But in business school, I met other photographers and one of those instances was during social event of some sort where a professional photographer was shooting Nikon. I had a chance to peek at his pictures on his viewfinder after he'd taken some and though I absolutely loved my Canon camera, I found myself truly admiring his gear.  Over the years, I've worked with other Canon gear and seen professional and amateur photographers who work with top-shelf bodies and gear from both Canon and Nikon. Here's the simple conclusion: in the hands of an experienced photographer, either system is great and has its advantages and disadvantages.  Take a recent experience I had. We recently had our first child and we decided to commemorate the occasion with both a pregnancy shoot and a newborn shoot. The pregnancy shoot was shot by a professional photographer buddy using a Canon 5D MK III with L-series lenses. We've chopped it up over the years about Canon gear and he's used the 1D series - Canon's top equipment which he loves. The newborn shoot was shot by a distant acquaintance using a mid-range Nikon DSLR body (wasn't familiar with it) with average lens. It was clear from talking with her that she was an experienced amateur photographer. I knew far more than her.  So in theory, I should have LOVED the Canon pics but actually, my wife and I both preferred the style of the newborn pics shot with a mid-range Nikon. It captured our style and our family much better. Both photographers used post-processing effectively and clearly knew how to manipulate images well. But in the end, it was the shots from Nikon gear that won us over, primarily due to the photographer's style matching ours.  So I write all this to summarize the debate this way: it really depends on what you mean by \"better\". Generally, many photographers will probably agree with the statement that Nikon tends to make bodies that produce wider dynamic range which means that colors seem to be richer and scenes are captured with slightly more vibrancy. And that Nikon bodies might have the edge in low-light situations. While Nikon might have the edge on bodies, Canon glass (their lenses) is probably superior to Nikon. Canon's L series lenses are generally built like a tank, have amazing sharpness and are used by pros in highly demanding situations. If you look at football games, you're likely to spot Canon glass before Nikon glass.  But this technical summary is a generalization that is a bit funny. Canon and Nikon bodies within the same range tend to be roughly comparable with the key differences boiling down to individual photographer preference and where each company is with respect to its latest model. Until Canon came out with it's 50MP 5Ds/r series, Nikon reigned in the megapixel battle.  Ultimately, I think it boils down to individual photographer preference and those are in turn influenced by who photographers hang out with and their own personal experiences. Had my dad shot Nikon, I'd like be a \"Nikon guy\". Many serious photographers end up in one camp or other initially because of their first foray into either Nikon or Canon and then usually stay there because of the massive subsequent investment in gear for that particular system. Having bought all my Canon lenses, it would be unlikely for me to switch to Nikon simply because they come out with a \"superior\" body.  So hopefully, I've demonstrated that neither is necessarily \"better.\" The real proof though is in the pictures. There are amazing photographers who use Nikon and there are amazing photographers who use Canon. An experienced photographer using an entry-level Canon camera can produce a dramatically better picture than someone using advanced Nikon gear if the latter doesn't know how to use the gear or doesn't know photography basics. A mediocre chef using thousands of dollars of kitchen equipment won't make a Michelin-rated dish while a professional chef might with standard kitchen gear. Same principle.  Personally, I think the best way to decide is to find photographers you know and whose work you respect and get their opinion. Find out about the idiosyncrasies of each system (and they both have 'em). Find out why they went with what they did. Find photographers who shoot in the style you're interested in. Do you want do landscape photography? Portraits? Weddings? Action? As you dig deeper, you may find more photographers in a particular style/region gravitate towards one or other other for practical reasons (easier to find one or the other, borrowing gear from buddies, etc.) Then try both systems if you can and go with the one you like best.  Ultimately, the one you're most comfortable with is the better choice for you. But as for me, give me Canon any day :) ",

            "answer_text": "It\u2019s the paper or plastic, Coke or Pepsi for photographers\u2014Canon, or Nikon? While one photographer will swear by his Canon, another will insist her Nikon is the better option. So which camera is best? That\u2019s a matter of opinion\u2014but that doesn\u2019t mean the individual camera brands don\u2019t have characteristics that may make them more suited to one type of photography or one type of photographer over the other. When comparing Canon vs. Nikon side-by-side, there are a lot of similarities, like solid image quality and a wide range of accessories, but there\u2019s a lot of differences too\u2014some subtle, others, not so much. Canon Vs. Nikon: Sensors Both Canon and Nikon offer cameras powered by similarly sized sensors, but there\u2019s a lot more that goes into image quality than just the size of the sensor. Just when one manufacturer seems to leap forward in sensor technology, the other catches up.  Most of Nikon\u2019s latest DSLRs use a new sensor design that allows them to eliminate the optical low pass filter without an abundance of moir\u00e9, or distortion in fine lines and patterns. The filter is one more thing for the light to pass through before hitting the sensor, so eliminating it allows the camera to pick up more details and perform a bit better in low light. All of Nikon\u2019s 2015 APS-C sensor cameras don\u2019t use an optical low pass filter and a handful of their full frame professional models have eliminated it as well. Canon\u2019s latest DSLRs, on the other hand, seem more focused on the megapixels. Most of Canon\u2019s DSLRs still use an optical low pass filter, though there are options like the Canon EOS 5DS R that do without. Their latest big announcements come in the form of full frame DSLRs with a whopping 50 megapixels. While judging a camera on megapixels alone is like judging a book by its cover, the EOS 5DS does capture a 8688 x 5792 resolution, where the Nikon D810 with 36 megapixels captures at most 7360 x 4912. The higher resolution allows for larger prints and more cropping without affecting the image quality. While the two are focusing on different areas of sensor technology, Canon and Nikon DSLRs both have excellent image quality. That doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019ll get the exact same image when shot with two different cameras, though. Colors between the two options can be noticeably different, for example. Which one produces better color is a matter of personal preference\u2014they are simply different, there\u2019s no right or wrong answer. Canon Vs. Nikon: Speed Canon and Nikon come in pretty even as far as the speed of their autofocus, but there\u2019s a subtle difference in their burst speed rates. Speed is hard to come by in DSLRs\u2014where it\u2019s not uncommon to find a mirror-less camera with a 10 fps burst mode, DSLRs have more gear to move to take a picture and it\u2019s tougher to reach those high speeds. Canon tends to have faster high-end DSLRs. The Canon EOS 7D Mark II ($1,799) hits an excellent 10 fps burst rate, making it one of the top DSLRs for sports shooters. Nikon\u2019s fastest APS-C camera, on the other hand, is capable of 6 fps, the D7200 ($1,199). Getting even further into the advanced options, Canon\u2019s full frame 1D X hits 14 fps, where the similar Nikon D4S gets 11 fps. When it comes to the entry-level, more budget friendly models, however, Nikon offers more speed. It\u2019s usually just by a frame or two though, as when comparing the Nikon D7200\u2019s 6-7 fps to the Canon T6S\u2019s 5 fps. Canon Vs. Nikon: Operation Performance between the two brands is pretty similar, but there are some noticeable differences when it comes to operating each camera. The terminology on a Canon is different from that on a Nikon, for starters. The \u201cS\u201d on the Nikon\u2019s mode dial and the \u201cTv\u201d on the Canon both indicate shutter priority mode, for example. Nikon also uses simpler terminology for autofocus modes\u2014it\u2019s a bit simpler to remember what Continuous Autofocus is versus Al Servo Autofocus (they\u2019re both the same thing). There\u2019s also often a significant difference in battery life, with Nikons generally able to take more shots on a single charge. For example, the Nikon D7200 has double the battery life of the similarly priced Canon T6S. That\u2019s not the case with every model, but, more often than not, Nikons have a better battery rating. Canon Vs. Nikon: Video Quality Canon, traditionally, has offered better video quality sooner. They were the first to develop a hybrid autofocus system allowing the camera to refocus while recording. Canon is known for their better autofocus tracking while recording, and they also have a selection of lenses designed specifically for video. Answering which brand has the better video quality two years ago would have been much simpler. Where a few models ago Nikon didn\u2019t offer autofocus while recording video, their latest DSLRs offer continuous autofocus. Comparing models individually across the brands, Nikon even has some cameras with a 60 fps frame rate for smoother motion where the equivalent Canon has 30 fps. Canon traditionally offers the better video, but Nikon\u2019s latest developments put them much closer.  Canon Vs. Nikon: Options When it comes to the more advanced DSLRs, there\u2019s pretty much a Canon to match every Nikon. That\u2019s not always the case though. Nikon hasn\u2019t yet come up with an answer to Canon\u2019s speedy 10 fps EOS 7D Mark II, and Nikon has a camera designed specifically for astrophotography, the D810A, where Canon\u2019s similar option has a smaller APS-C sensor. When it comes to entry-level options, however, Canon\u2019s selection doesn\u2019t quite match up with Nikon\u2019s models. There are older Canon DSLRs available for around $500, but the current models (as listed on Canon\u2019s website) start at $899 for the body only for the EOS 60D. Nikon\u2019s D3300 offers full DSLR capability to beginners for a $650 list price\u2014and that includes a kit lens. Canon offers a model priced fairly evenly with the enthusiast Nikon D7200, the T6S, but there are some pretty significant differences. The D7200 has no optical low pass filter, 51 autofocus points, 60 fps HD video, 6-7 fps burst shooting and an 1,100 shot battery life. The T6S, by comparison, has an optical low pass filter, 19 focus points, 30 fps HD video, 5 fps burst shots and half the battery life. Where the specs are close in the high-end models, Nikon often offers more in their entry and enthusiast options (though again, that\u2019s not always the case). Canon Vs. Nikon: So which one is best? Buying a DSLR is a bit different than buying a compact camera, because once you start accumulating lenses, it becomes much more expensive to change brands. Since the two brands operate a little differently (and with different terminology), switching would also mean relearning a few minor things. So, then, which manufacturer is best? Which camera brand should you choose? The answer? There isn\u2019t a winner\u2014both Canon and Nikon offer excellent cameras with solid image quality. If one brand offered a better camera every time, the other would\u2019ve gone out of business a long time ago. But, that\u2019s not to say one brand isn\u2019t more suited to one person or the other. Beginners would likely be happy with a DSLR from either system\u2014but Nikon offers a more affordable option that\u2019s still full of features and Nikon\u2019s terminology is a bit easier to understand when starting from scratch. Sports photographers can capture the action with a DSLR from either manufacturer\u2014but Canon tends to offer more speed in their high end models. Quality videos can be shot on both\u2014but Canon typically has a smoother autofocus and offers lenses specifically for cinema. When choosing between camera brands, it\u2019s best to compare each camera individually\u2014where Nikon may have a better entry-level DSLR, Canon may have a better DSLR for sports. When making the choice between Canon vs. Nikon, here are a few things to consider: What is the most important thing in a camera to you? Speed? Resolution? Video quality?What does the manufacturer offer at your current experience level and for your current budget?What does the manufacturer offer that you might be looking to upgrade to in the future? While you probably won\u2019t be looking at the same options in five years, if they offer something in that range currently, they\u2019re likely to continue to making updates to that line.What lenses would you ideally like to add to your kit? Does that manufacturer offer those lenses?Canon or Nikon? Neither one is a bad choice, which means it\u2019s not an easy choice. ",
