            "answer_text": "I believe ways it is being used currently include: robotic assisted surgery\u2014probably the da Vinci which I would love to see in action is best known/discussed You can argue things like the voice to text abilities help as that\u2019s one of the things where docs have to spend a TON of time\u2014on their notes\u2014probably makes sense to have an assistant read through to clarify anything that seems iffy, however, while the doc has a chance to remember and clarify. (I really don\u2019t believe people CAN be effectively replaced). We DO have image scan analysis software now, so that is a great plus as there is so much reliance, esp. in certain fields, on imaging studies. There are some \u201cvirtual nursing assistants\u201d out there though I have never seen any in action and would be HIGHLY concerned about using them based on interactions I\u2019ve had with other ALLEGED AI systems for many things. I do NOT believe those will EVER be of much use: too many accents, speech impediments, idioms, slang, etc. AND a lot of folks have to POINT or use their hands to convey something. For RUDIMENTARY things, sure, you could use a form of AI to get SOME info, but I think too often it\u2019s going to miss the boat. Again, I have NOT seen these in action; I just know they are being developed so maybe I\u2019m not on target with my issues. Clearly things like Watson, developed by IBM, for taking large amounts of data and helping in assorted ways to spur on research/sort through data, exists and is very promising. Though probably NOT \u201cAI\u201d in the sense meant, I think things like the assorted genome type projects are a form of it and will be able to truly help us advance. I also think that you could stretch AI and say that something like UpToDate service is a form of AI as well. To me a term like \u201cAI\u201d means different things to different people. I don\u2019t think anyone can really argue on the image scan analysis, but I can see people objecting to saying UpToDate IS an \u201cAI.\u201d In any case, \u201ccomputers\u201d to use a very general term ARE already significantly integrated in health care and will be more so with each year. I think, again NOT AI, but things like that CGM (Continuous Glucose Monitoring) device which provides a LOT of data, will be extremely helpful in better treating patients. The more data someone who knows what he is doing can access, the better. To me, ultimately, ALWAYS a human still needs to do the evaluation and implementation. I think some are fantasizing about \u201crobots\u201d \u201cperforming medicine\u201d or some such nonsense. There will NEVER be a true substitute for a doctor. There is too much that goes into the practice of medicine for that to happen. ",

            "answer_text": "The technology is in its early stages. However, i truly believe that AI will contribute alot in the medical field. Human doctors work with logic and first prinsiples. A doctor will use several sources of data, personal knowledge and experience to put together the pieces and make a diagnosis. An AI will analyse the symptoms completely differently. It will be able to process every single symptom together with all the biological information about the patient such as age, health, medical history e.t.c. Among that i think it will also be able to analyse the DNA of the patient. That is a lot of processing! Something the human brain is simply not able to do. This is from the book How doctors think by Jerome Groopman M.D. It is about mistakes that doctors have made and now confess on what they did wrong. Impeccable logic doesn't always suffice. My mistake was that I reasoned from first principles when there was no prior experience. I turned out to be wrong because there are variables that you can't factor in until you actually do it. And you make the wrong recommendation, and the patient doesn't survive. I didn't leave enough room for what seems [sic] like minor effects--the small fluctuations in oxygen levels, which might amount to one or two or three percent but actually can signal major problems in the heart....[The proposed treatment] is very sound logic. But it's wrong...These children developed right heart failure and clinically they became worse. There are aspects to human biology and human physiology that you just can't predict. Deductive reasoning doesn't work for every case. Sherlock Holmes is a model detective, but human biology is not a theft or a murder where all the cues can add up neatly. In 2016 Google\u2019s AlphaGo beat the best Go(a traditional Chinese game) player in the world.[1] When AlphaGo beat the best human Go player you can see that the AI did not use conventional strategies and suprised everybody with its moves. While Go style is difficult to encapsulate, one could say that AlphaGo's strategy embodies a spirit of flexibility and open-mindedness: a lack of preconceptions that allows it to find the most effective line of play. As the following two games will show, this philosophy often leads AlphaGo to discover counterintuitive yet powerful moves. -Google Deepmind[2] My point is that an AI will \u2018think\u2019 completely differently. Its ways of \u2018thinking\u2019 is highly adaptive to the situation. The human brain has not developed to calculate all the different variables that cause a disease in a biological system. An AI in the medical field will be specifically developed to calculate all the variables and give a highly accurate diagnosis. So where exactly are we at with the development of AI in the medical field? In a study[3] researchers tested AIs to diagnose the absence or presence of tubercolosis. Tubercolosis is one of the top 10 causes of death worldwide[4] . The AIs first trained by analysing 1000 X-rays with both positive and negative tubercolosis patients. Then the AIs were put on the test by analysing 150 X-rays which where exluded from their training. The AIs achieved a accuracy of 96%. A higher accuracy than many human radiologist. Encouraging results have also been shown in other branches of medicine such as oncology, pathology, ophthalmology (eye diseases), and cardiology.[5] I want to clarify that I do not think AI will replace human doctors. Simply because of the connection between humans. I do not think most people will trust a metal box doctor. Being a doctor is also about understanding the patient and being able to show empathy over the patients emotions. Something i do not think AI will be able to do. Therefore, most certainly AIs will be a resource to doctors as a tool. The AIs will be helping the doctors diagnose patients with the highest accuracy possible.
