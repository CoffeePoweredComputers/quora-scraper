            "answer_text": "How does design influence behavior? Design allows playing with emotional/mental and sensory signals of any species to change their perception of things, events and other fellow species and hence their response, in most cases resulting in habit formation. Few examples are: A. Placing a scary toy in a room can keep children away from that room. B. Creating a fun app which is simple to use can get people addicted to it and make them play it at home and at work. C. Placing a scarecrow in farms keeps birds from eating grains. D. Creating kitchen appliances to ease life let people save time and most people don't go back to older ways of cooking. E. Placing a traffic police patrol or traffic police station on a particular road/highway will naturally regulate the traffic on that highway. F. Compared to a lion or tiger in a natural reserve, a caged lion or tiger will be mellow and domestic for life. G. Having dangerous pets like tiger Cubs at home limits burglary and can allow you greater freedom to leave the door open to all with no fear. Now we will not discuss about more extensive areas like \u2018toys' here. ",
