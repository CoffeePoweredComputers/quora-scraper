            "answer_text": "The full suite of microsoft office is a paid application but in case you want to buy one just use the online version of Office 365 . Office 365 Login | Microsoft Office It comes with all the major apps required for office and home use . Just don\u2019t go for all the KMS activator stuff. They mess up the System Registry quite bad , and more than often can even contain viruses. If you prefer to use an offline office version just use the several free alternatives : WPS office : Free Office Download (Word, Spreadsheets,Presentation, PDF, Templates) for PC & Mobile, Alternative to MS Office This one is a brilliant application , comes complete with a pdf viewer & editor . I haven\u2019t looked back towards Microsoft office since using this one. The UI is streamlined and influenced from MS officeLibre Office : LibreOffice - Free Office Suite - Based on OpenOffice - Compatible with Microsoft This is an open-source alternative that comes without any advertisement or push to buy the premium version . The icons look a little outdated , but that again can be fixed with a set of icon packs that are made by the libre office community. Almost all features of Microsoft Office are present here .",
