            "answer_text": "Q: If prolonged disuse of Li-ion batteries is bad for them, how do factory sealed phones last so long sitting in stock? A: Because the trolls on the internet are lying to you I was one of the earliest engineers to design lithium battery packsProlonged disuse of lithium batteries does is not as bad for them as the trolls make it seemLithium batteries can sit on the shelf because they rely on the laws of battery chemistry (physics) and not the words from trolls for their actual real world behaviorWe charge lithium batteries to 50% before we put them on the shelf for consumer purchase or when we put our own electronics in the drawer for long term storageThe lithium battery chemistry slowly reduces its own self discharge rate when 50% charged and unloadedIt really takes a physicist/chemist to explain all the complex interactions that go on, fortunately I already had one on my team that figured that out so I didn't have toThe lithium battery will then self discharge extremely slowly which slows down the chemical aging processThis is one of those things that is strange but trueYes I have ancient iPods and original generation iPhones in my drawer that sit there unused for years and when company with kids come over for a visit I care those devices up and lend them to the kids who use them successfully for the length of their stay, I have been doing this for over a decade and none of them has had a battery replacement, so I know for a fact that it works from my personal experience",

            "answer_text": "Lithium batteries have a correct charge state for storage. That\u2019s about 60% charge usually. Whatever it actually is, the manufacturer knows it, and the phones left the factory at exactly the right charge state for best shelf life. Disuse is not terribly bad at between about 30% and 80% charge, outside that there is potential for damage if the temperature changes a lot. There\u2019s an optimum somewhere in between. But most people don\u2019t leave phones sitting around between 30% and 80% charge, they\u2019re either fully charged or fully discharged, and it isn\u2019t good to leave a battery sitting at either end point; if the temperature changes, it ends up over charged or beyond fully discharged.
