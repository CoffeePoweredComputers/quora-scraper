            "answer_text": "First off, I can\u2019t recall a year where I haven\u2019t heard \u201cIt\u2019s the year [fill in the blank], so where are our flying cars?\u201d Consider this little tune from 1984:  I thought by now I\u2019d walk the moon, (it\u2019s the eighties where\u2019s our rocket packs?)And ride a car without no tires, (it\u2019s the eighties where\u2019s our rocket packs?)And have a robot run the vacuum, (it\u2019s the eighties where\u2019s our rocket packs?)And date a girl made out of wires, (it\u2019s the eighties where\u2019s our rocket packs?)No, things don\u2019t change that much, do they? (do they?)We are still out of touch,By now we should discover just how to love each other,Like Klattu\u2019s robot man, your looks have killed again.(It\u2019s the eighties where\u2019s our rocket packs?)I thought by now we\u2019d live in space, (it\u2019s the eighties where\u2019s our rocket packs?)And eat a pill instead of dinner, (it\u2019s the eighties where\u2019s our rocket packs?)And wear a gas mask on our face, (it\u2019s the eighties where\u2019s our rocket packs?)A president of female gender, (it\u2019s the eighties where\u2019s our rocket packs?)Though progress marches on, new day, (new day) Our troubles still grow strong,And my expectancies become my fantasies,You turned my blood to sand, The Earth stands still again. The truth is, there have probably been a hundred flying cars by now.  The Curtis Autoplane, widely considered the first roadable aircraft. This is from 1917\u2014we\u2019ve literally had flying cars for more than a hundred years now. Many more followed.     Many have been made. Few have been practical. Most have been, well, fugly. I think, though, that the advances that brought us hobbyist camera drones are going to be some of the same advances that bring us practical flying cars. Most of the \u201cflying cars\u201d we\u2019ve seen to date have focused on being both airplanes and cars, two vehicles that don\u2019t have as much in common with each other as many would like to think. If we can shed the requirements of being an airplane, we might find a way to do without wings and large rotors. If we can shed the requirements of being a car, we might be able to do without the weighty, all-purpose wheels and expectations that come with that. Flying cars are probably going to look a lot more like drones with passenger pods.    To my knowledge, those are all photos of working prototypes that are currently in development. We\u2019ll get there\u2014aviation is a stodgy field that progresses slowly, mostly in the name of not killing too many people along the way. As for jetpacks, hoverboards, and the like, most of the above holds true for them, too. Just substitute the word of the futuristic technology . . . and the year. ",

            "answer_text": "The FAA and NTSB are never going to allow flying cars, at least not like the cartoon The Jetsons. Not happening. Ever. Keep dreaming. Technically, there are a few actual so-called flying cars out there, but it is unclear if these are even available to the public. In order to pilot an aircraft, a person needs a lot more than a standard-issue drivers license. Both of my parents have pilot\u2019s licenses and I can assure you, that earning a pilot\u2019s license is no easy task, this is grueling and extremely difficult. New pilots must log many hours and are subjected to a battery of tests before they are granted a license. I cannot emphasis enough how difficult it is earn a pilot\u2019s license. Likely less than 1% of all licensed drivers would have the time, money, and ability to ever pass. A flying car is no different than any aircraft. If the FAA and the NTSB were going to just take an anything-goes approach, can you imagine the carnage if, in addition to the 30,000 traffic fatalities on the ground every year, now many more would no extend into the sky? Accidents and fatalities would no longer be confined to road ways, you could have flying cars fly into buildings and kill or main people there. Air space has a complex system of protocols that will never accommodate flying cars, until there is a very detailed set of rules that would need to amend the existing set of protocols. There are plenty of bad drivers on the road as it is, the last thing that anyone would wants would be some of those same folks taking to the sky as well. Let\u2019s all be glad that there are NOT flying cars, at least not in the consumer market. ",
