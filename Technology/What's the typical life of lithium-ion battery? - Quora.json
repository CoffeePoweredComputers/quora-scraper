            "answer_text": "Nowadays, lithium ion batteries are found in a great deal of devices, including digital cameras, laptops, cellular phones and lots of other electronic devices. We recommend that you follow the tips provided below, if you want to maintain your battery pack and extend its life. These tips will protect your smartphone and other apparatus from harm. Continue reading about Lithium Ion Battery Pack. Charge your batteries first Once you buy a battery pack, be sure to charge it for 12 hours prior to placing it in your device. As a matter of fact, all producers recommend charging these batteries at least 12 hours before first use. In fact, if you have a lithium ion battery, then this approach is essential. Unlike the normal batteries batteries are pre-activated. Because they have a low pace, make sure you control your batteries first. Use the Ideal charger All of us take decent care of our electronic gadgets however we have a tendency to discount the outcomes of using the wrong charger. When you buy a charger, be sure you opt for the original charger. If you can't get the first one, we recommend that you pick a high-quality charger with overcharge protection. Purchasing a low-quality unit is not a fantastic idea as it might result in fire/explosion, battery failure or run time. Do not overcharge Ordinarily, low-end chargers end up overcharging the battery. What occurs is that the substance inside the battery heats up, which may reduce the battery's lifespan. It's better that you fully charge your batterylife. In some cases, overcharging may cause the battery to explode. Don't touch the metal contacts For highest performance, make certain you clean the battery contacts on a regular basis. When you take the batteries , you may want to prevent the contacts from touching metal things like your car keys. This is important if you do not want to face a circuit. You might wind up damaging your battery if this happens. In a scenario, explosion or fire can also happen. Huizhou JB Battery Technology Limited has been designing and assembling custom battery solutions. We provide battery pack assemblies in all chemistries and for all electronic applications, all built to match our customers\u2019 unique requirements.

            "answer_text": "The Li-ion battery works on the principle of electron-ion exchange, similar to most of the batteries. During discharging, the electrode with the high electron affinity will release electron (which is known as anode) and the electrode with the low electron affinity will gain electron (which is known as cathode). This electron would travel through the load and thus allowing the battery to supply energy. Each component however has a specific function to perform. Cathode primarily determines the battery capacity i.e. higher the amount of lithium at cathode, the higher is the battery's capacity. The anode enables exchange of lithium ion from/to cathode while charging/discharging. The electrolyte is one of the most important components of the battery. The salt present in the electrolyte allow only the passage of lithium ions and thus forcing the electron to be move via the external circuitry only thereby supplying the required energy to external load. The separator further facilitates such movement of lithium ion through its internal microscopic hole while also forming a physical barrier between the electrodes. Let us now understand the (few important) existing battery technologies of lithium ion: Lithium-Cobalt-Oxide (LCO): One of the earliest commercialized chemistry (in 1985) for Lithium ion batteries were the LCO batteries. These batteries had high stable energy capacities which allowed them to be utilized in applications in laptop, mobile phones, etc. However these batteries had higher thermal runaway, meaning that there was a fair chance that the battery possessed risk of exploding if it were damaged or overcharged. This directly led to compromised safety and life span of the battery.Lithium Iron Phosphate (LFP): Discovered in 1996, LFP batteries offered good electrochemical performance with reduced resistance, excellent safety and long life span but moderate specific energy and a lower voltage than other lithium-based batteries. Its excellent thermal stability and enhanced safety enabled it to be utilized in applications which needed higher load currents and endurance, for ex: EVs, solar PV plants, UPS.Lithium Nickel Manganese Cobalt Oxide (NMC): One of the most balanced performing lithium ion batteries is NMC. The cathode combination ratio which is usually one-third nickel, one-third manganese and one-third cobalt means that the raw material cost is lower than other types of batteries. Such combination further also allows NMC battery to be either utilized as a high energy battery or a high power battery. The battery found its application in EVs, medical devices, industrial applications, etc.",
