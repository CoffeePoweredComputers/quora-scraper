            "answer_text": "Sorry, you cannot connect it to your laptop like you would do it to your monitor. But there are a few options to get the display onto your laptop. VNC: The easiest method is to connect your Pi to a monitor once and enable VNC. After this is done, you can connect to your Pi from your laptop using VNC viewer. Username :pi and Password :raspberry.SSH: If you don't have a monitor around, then you can connect your Pi to your router where your laptop is connected too. Now, you can get your Pi\u2019s IP address from the list of devices connected to your router. With that IP address, you can use SSH to access Pi\u2019s terminal. You can enable VNC from this terminal and after this you can connect in the regular VNC method as mentioned previously.",
