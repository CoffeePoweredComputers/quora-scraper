            "answer_text": "I currently use an iPhone 7 and my previous phone was iPhone 5c. The screen - yes, small! If you have ever used a 4.5 inch screen sized phone or bigger you'll think of your iPhone SE as a tiny(though powerful) toy! It is small. Though I sometimes miss the ability to use my phone with single hand, iPhone SE is a bit too small. You'll especially feel that way while using YouTube or viewing pictures. If you don't have issues about that, then it still is an amazing phone! ",

But you are gonna get something under its cover. It has far more capabilities than its twin- iPhone 5S. Its upto your proffesion man.. rather you need a big one or fit-size. Like iPhone SE. I rather recommend this phone because it has got far more than iPhone 5S. You can check it out on apple website- iPhone SE Thank You. ",
