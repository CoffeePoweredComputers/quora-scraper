            "answer_text": "You drive your car. Think of pollution from its emissions. Have you ever thought why does the tyre wears down after 70,000\u201380,000 kilometers drive? Where does the rubber go? You cook food, and switch on the exhaust or electric chimney. All fumes go outside. Where do these go? You take a bath and use soap, shampoo, conditioner etc. After the bath, you apply hair oil or gel. Next day, you take a bath again. You need to use hair oil again. Why? Where does it go? Unfortunately, most people think it is only the industry that pollute. A few, however, think though other sources exist, yet, industry is the biggest source of pollution. I recall, when I was a small kid (maybe 10\u201312 yrs old), my mother asked me sometimes to bring a pack of detergent- 500 gm pack. In a family of five, a pack served for a month or more. Now, my son stays in other city, and me and my wife stay together. We use washing machine for washing clothes, and maid maybe loves the detergent. The consumption now is to the tune of 5 kg per month. That too after repeatedly asking my wife to reduce it. She can do nothing but to remind the maid every second day to use less detergent, of course with an inherent fear to get branded as \u2018miser\u2019! There are several government agencies to control industrial pollution. The check and control industries. Maybe one or two mills are really polluting, but believe me, most of them (at least 90\u201395%) are following the law. The most unfortunate is that no government agency is allowed to check you at your homes. How much soap, shampoo, conditioner you are using while taking a bath, how much hair oil you apply, how much detergent you use for washing your clothes. Behind the closed doors of bathrooms, we pollute a lot, and blame our industries more and more. My request is to read the matter written again twice, and think- \u201cWhat is your personal contribution to pollution prevention?\u201d ",

            "answer_text": "In United State, industries are the single largest source of air pollution. People who think they cannot control the industrial pollution are wrong. If they take individual or collective action to reduce it, then they will certainly do it. Do adopt the below mentioned steps for the said purpose:- - You must read labels and reject the products which are using questionable ingredients such as solvents, acids and heavy metals find their way into or environment through storm drains or landfills. When no one bought these products, then industries will no longer manufactures them. - Reject the companies who are discouraging in recycling of their products. Many of the products are coming with unnecessary packaging and they are using plastics that has toxic ingredients.. Prefer the companies that use a minimum of packaging. - Proper investigation should be done in relation to the location of the company's plants. If its manufacturing plant is located in some poor country it means the company is trying to avoid the stringent U.S. environmental regulations to save money and cut labor costs. It will be better to avoid the products that company , as they are contributing to pollution. - Read reports from environmental groups such as the Sierra Club and make yourself aware of some of the worst polluters, especially local ones. Contact your local Environmental Protection Agency branch, which you can locate on the EPA's website, or your state health department, and demand enforcement of the law. - If need be call or write your congressional representative or senator and request them to take action regarding industrial polluting activities that fall outside the law. It will be better if you will get some like-minded people to sign a petition in support of your request. - It will be also good to support the companies that promote \"green\" methods of production and products. As they make more money and gain a greater market share, their polluting competitors will pay attention and be encouraged to change their ways. -Visit industries and check whether they are using air pollution control structures. If no , then give them proper time. If still they do not follow the norms, bring the fact before the concerned department, who will themselves take action against them. ",

            "answer_text": "Since I can\u2019t tell what country you are in, the answer is specific to the country in question and the laws which are available. In the U.S. we created the Clean Air Act in 1965, but it didn\u2019t have a lot of impact until the 1972 revisions. You can read the entire history on Wikipedia. And it depends on the pollution in question. I can\u2019t give you a simple concrete answer without knowing a lot more. Perhaps this will help: Identify the problem you are trying to solve - specific sources, and specific chemicals or pollutants. Identify the harm being done, in as clear terms as you can.Learn what your legal options are. If you have none, or they are inadequate, find out who has done a good job of addressing the sort of problem you face in another country or another part of your country.Learn as much as you can about the pollutant and the industry you are dealing with.Identify the decisionmakers. This can include the corporate management, the parent company if one exists, local and higher political officials, and if you have good laws, the regulators.Figure out the best strategy to approach the easiest pathway to the solution you want. ALWAYS know as much as you can possibly know about the solution you want. Most of the time people ask for solutions, but don\u2019t know what they are asking for, so the person who is being asked still doesn\u2019t know what to do. It\u2019s possible to get a response by pointing at a smokestack or drainpipe, but it is a lot more likely to work if you know what they are doing, what their options are, and sometimes good activists even know what the options cost.Enlist as many people as you can who care about the same thing, and have a means of getting them all to chime in if there is a focus for the conversation, including hearings, obstinate decisionmakers who need to know there is public support or pressure, and think about identifying supportive newspersons.Try to keep civil. A lot of times people get angry before they start a conversation. It\u2019s very hard for people responsible for many jobs and a lot of production to respond to a challenge to their operation when the people raising the problem start off angry. Corporations are often willing to be good citizens if they don\u2019t feel like they have already lost public support no matter what they do.If that doesn\u2019t work, sue the bastards.That last one was for fun. Sometimes it is necessary. But most often, the hardest part is identifying the problem and solution clearly enough that people who have authority understand and agree with the solution you propose.Last, but not least, consider alternatives, including boycotting products, helping the company move to a less polluting process or technology, and forcing or supporting them to move away from the community which is being affected.Good luck. It\u2019s good work! ",

            "answer_text": "BY FIRST IDENTIFYING IT! Most corporations & businesses do not think about pollution, what is or what damage it causes. Then you HAVE TO CONTROL THE GREED that surrounds humans. The basic human being is lazy, kicking back in the sunshine is nice. There very few nut cases like me that love to work and so for long hours every day. I am an artist, I love to create so yes I would rather be working on some project that sitting in the sunshine having a beer\u2026 and yes more than one girlfriend has moved out because of that. Next you have to deal with advertising which since being in the business of making money is going to do or say what ever is necessary to get a paycheck.  Now consider that in 2016, some Native Americans on THEIR OWN LANDS, were tossed off for an Oil pipeline to go through. The Native Americans upon eviction or military assault, burned they wood & cloth and some other possessions they did not have time to take with them\u2026 MEDIA played it UP AS THE WORSE ENVIRONMENTAL DISASTER! The Native Americans wood & cloth was WORSE THAT BP GULF OF MEXICO SPILL\u2026. yeah Mass Media & PUBLIC don\u2019t want to think about it. Do you HEAR MASS MEDIA call a forest fire a POLLUTION EVENT? Or the homes burning down in a \u201chuge city fire\u201d\u2026 Nope, because the Oil Industry wanted that land\u2026 A list of just SOME of what that Oil Industry provides for PROFIT to you\u2026  So THE NEXT TIME someone tells you that plastic bags don\u2019t need to be removed, think about how plastic bags are AN Oil Industry Product & THE NUMBER ONE KILLER IN YOUR OCEANS! Or think about how SOLAR is too Expensive & FREELOADING on a $10 Million USD a year funding tax break\u2026. While the OIL INDUSTRY GETS $100 BILLION PER YEAR IN TAX BREAKS\u2026 and who knows how much under the table. Think of how expensive Oil is when you add up the decades of time needed to heal a oil spill zone. Exxon Valdez was in the 1980s, that Bay has yet to recover, sure the media tell outsiders it is fine, but the people living there & environmentalists & scientists have DATA which shows otherwise. So first change the human behavior pattern, the things people worship, the way they decide what is right or wrong. Then you can look at the pollution issues and take measures for LIFE OF THE WHOLE PLANET, not just for the humans who think nothing else matters. Otherwise, you are like the painter who opens a can of paint in a room and closes all the windows, you are not even thinking about the damage to yourself! Look at how long politics has been corrupt & everyone \u201cJust accepts you can\u2019t do anything about, SO WHY EVEN TRY\u2026\u201d Read this TRUE STORY of my attempt to change the world, AND THE POWER OF A SINGLE PAGE LETTER\u2026 then think about how many times you or someone around you said \u201cWhy Try?\u201d WOW, I GAVE the world a $1 TRILLION USD for free! \u2013 Peter Vanderhoof \u2013 Medium While I was not totally successful in my attempt, I did produce the LONGEST PEACEFUL COOPERATION OF NATIONS WITHOUT ANY WAR OR VIOLENCE in history. The International Space Station is 34 years old. Not even a fist fight on the ISS, NO GUNS OR BOMBS EITHER! Currently 15 NATIONS ARE DIRECTLY INVOLVED! I wrote a letter about the creation of the ISS to president Reagan in 1983 and 4 months later, Pres. Reagan read it to the world. Yes, I wrote it for them to steal the idea\u2026 so nope, I have never made a penny off of it\u2026 But no one has done better either!  ",

            "answer_text": "A15 Hello!! Thanks for asking As you know industries are one of the most important factors of the growth of our country as well as one of the biggest contributor to the pollution. The industries pollute the environment in various ways. Now it is the need of hour for industries to step-up and take responsibility for the environment. I'll list some of the ways they can do so Air pollution: modifying their machinery to pollute less, using less polluting fuels, using electrostatic precipitators (Electrostatic precipitator - Wikipedia), filtering the waste air properly, using less polluting raw materials, shifting the industries away from cities etc.Water pollution: proper treatment of waste water, disposing off chemicals with proper treatment, not cooling the equipments in water bodies with life, not disposing industrial waste in water, etc.Soil pollution: again proper treatment of the wastes, avoiding land fillings, not disposing harmful chemicals or the waste or leftover products in the land, etc.Sound pollution: proper machinery, repairing oor replacement of damaged one, using sound barriers, establishing the industries in outskirts of the major cities, etc.There are no easy ways to do this. But the proper and stricter implementation of laws and rules made to keep pollution in check is the most important thing. Self awareness and realisation is also necessary. Pardon me for any mistakes. I hope it was something you were looking for. If you want to add or suggest or share something, you're most welcome. Thank you Take care of it, it is your environment. ",

            "answer_text": "INDUSTERIAL POLLUTION All industrial and non-biodegradable waste like plastic, tires, rubber tubes etc. can be converted as Ethanol, Electricity & slag Conversion of industrial smoke as ethanol is very much possible. These are possible by Plasma Gasification. It controls Air-Pollution and we get ethanol. Waste of old cars, refrigerators, air-conditioners, geysers, old batteries etc. can be converted as useful metals or Rock Wool or slag. Only Nuclear waste cannot be destroyed by Plasma Gasification. India can utilize Plasma Gasification unit to recycle the waste of automobile, air-conditioners & refrigerators. Auto-shredding plants save foreign exchange & preserve natural resources like iron ore. It reduces dependence on import of 5-6 million tonnes of shredded scrap. Recycling metals reduces energy to produce steel instead of using virgin ore. 74 % of energy is saved when we use steel scrap. It saves 40 % water &58 % reduction in CO2. 1.6 billion tons of stuff world throws away every year. Each Plasma Gasification unit can be utilised for this purpose. We get not only recycled material we produce electricity also. We can come across COMMERCIAL PLASMA WASTE PROCESSING FACILITIES in Asia, Europe, North America and Japan. It is utilized to convert, Automobile Shredder Residue, Aluminium dross asbestos &, old batteries to electricity, sand-size aggregate, and mixed metal nodules, Wastewater sludge, tannery, Fly ash, unprocessed MSW and medical waste can be converted as ethanol, electricity and slag. In India we do not have processing facilities. ",

Now to control industrial pollution there are methods that can be installed to minimize the pollution. But the factory owners are after minting money only and that is the only reason that they bypass the system. And above all there is no political will in our country to eleminate pollution. We the people of this land called India have become very corrupt and very mean and really very cunning, so the chain reaction has started which has no end. One day slowly we will become physically very weak and will be overpowered by another country. So we are going to be doomed one day.
