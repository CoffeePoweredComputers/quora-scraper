            "answer_text": "You can see what posts a person likes and comments on by following them, going into your notification section, and then swiping to the right. Taking a step back, the notification section is divided into two subsections: \u201cYou\u201d and \"Following\". The \u201cYou\u201d section generates the orange-pink \u26611 notification icon when anyone likes your post. Swiping the entire section to the right brings you under the \u201cFollowing\u201d portion of the notification section. This means you are able to see the likes and comments of everyone you follow (excluding their likes of private posts that you might not follow) in a manner that is updated in seconds, chronologically. PS: If you really wanted to track just one person that might be hard if you are following hundreds of people, but easier if you are following very few. Happy Instagraming! ",
