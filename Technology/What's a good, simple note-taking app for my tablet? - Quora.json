I'm an Android Developer and my Organizer for Ultimate Mobility Note Taking is very easy to find on the Google Play Store. Simply search for my name as the Developer By typing: Alexander Madani My note taking app has a Free version (which will be retiring soon and I don't recommend). But I also sell a Pro Paid version of my App\u2026which is currently on sale for Free. So if you're using Android, check out my easy notes Organizer. I think you will like it. If you tried it and liked it\u2026please help me share word about with others. And also kindly take a moment to provide my ongoing development efforts and costs\u2026your awesome Stars and Feedback on our play store. Thank you so much Alexander Madani ",
