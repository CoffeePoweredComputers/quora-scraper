            "answer_text": "If technology reached a point that every single job was destroyed, we'd have it made. You wouldn't have a job, better put, you wouldn't have to work, and we'd all be free to binge on netflix into infinity.  Now staying somewhat grounded in the realities of this millennium, my answer is still 'no.'  Technology doesn't do anything but create jobs. Jobs are needed to create technology, to manage technology, to organize technology etc. The jobs that technology destroys (now) are low-skilled/low-payed jobs. As technology advances, it will replace more and more advanced jobs. But that's beside the point. For now, technology is replacing low-skilled jobs. This has a couple major effects 1) technology creating/managing jobs go up 2) low-skilled jobs go down. The low-skilled worker is out of work, but changes fields, gains education and moves to a slightly-more-skilled position, the slightly-more-skilled worker goes to school and finds a position in robotics or whatever. So, through a longer/more complicated-than-described reorganization of the workforce, everyone still has a job and we still have more technology. To add to that, somewhere along the line 2 technology jobs were created for that 1 low-skilled job it destroyed. This is a result of technology's efficiency/productivity; it frees up resources (jobs) to be used elsewhere (to create more technology--and so on and so forth). In general it does a job better or facilitates a job to the point of justifying the creation of more jobs. That's what technology is: Efficiency. How can we be more efficient yet have less productivity? The main issue with this question given my aforementioned netflix-binge fantasy, isn't whether technology is going to kill our jobs. That's cool. It's if it kills our productivity. From an economics standpoint and granting ever-advancing technology, we'll never reach a point in which technology is cannibalizing our productivity. If technology isn't economical (it doesn't add value given it's cost) it simply won't be implemented. For example, even if we reach a point in which technology destroys more productivity than it creates (effectively being more costly per unit of productivity), we'll stop implementing right there and continue with the status quo. But technology is creating evermore productivity than it destroys. It is evermore efficient. The more advanced technology becomes--how efficient/productive it becomes--that will just justify the cost of inputs even more. It would pay six-figures to just have a person plug in computers all day, if you're really worried about job security. So is technology destroying jobs? No. Is it destroying the percentage of jobs/units of productivity occupied by humans? Yes. Does it matter? No. ",

            "answer_text": "I am reminded of a cartoon I once saw. An economist is walking on a straight path. Looking ahead, he sees the path continuing without interruption. He does not see the abyss separating the path into two paths, one on each side of it. Economists love to see past as prologue. And it\u2019s often true; certainly, it has been true with accelerating automation and unemployment. In fact, economists sometimes point to our current situation and say, \u201cwhere is the job loss due to technology?\u201d There are two problems with this argument this time. First, it misunderstands or ignores the fact that we are now in the extreme change period of technology; that time when the exponential curve stops resembling a line and starts looking like liftoff. Computer power has been doubling, and doubling at an increasing rate, for decades. Currently, the rate is ~18 months per doubling. This is the force driving technological change on this planet. (Aside: some believe that the end of Moore\u2019s Law, anticipated to happen very soon, means the end of this process. Moore\u2019s Law is a special case of Kurzweil\u2019s Law of Accelerating Returns, which will continue for decades, according to most estimates.) Second, we have now reached the point in the evolution of technology where AIs and the robots they control can learn like people learn, through observation, trial, error, and correction. However, these deep learning systems can do so much faster, and once a single such system masters something at a human level of competence it can be transferred to unlimited copies of itself. That is new. That is fundamental. No regime or program of retraining for human workers will offset that development, which is admittedly still narrow but rapidly widening in scope. Also, all of this has been accomplished and is accelerating without artificial general intelligence (AGI), which will be the beginning of superhuman intelligence, and can be tied to superhuman senses of perception built into robots. AGI is imminent, especially thanks to a foundational breakthrough. (In a historic moment for AI, computers gain ability to generalize learning between activities - ExtremeTech) The end of work as we know it is coming. We can either ignore/rationalize away the above facts and their implications, or prepare. Some of us are preparing. ",
