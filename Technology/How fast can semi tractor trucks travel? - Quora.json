            "answer_text": "While semi truck tractors are often capable of reaching speeds in excess of 100 miles per hour, a truck\u2019s true top speed on the road will be limited by a number of different factors. For example, the aerodynamic properties of the trailer \u2013 whether a box trailer, a tank trailer or some other type of trailer \u2013 can significantly impact a semi truck\u2019s efficiency and actual top speed. This is why many tractors have aerodynamic bumpers, mirrors and roof fairings to reduce drag and improve overall performance. Trucking companies will often install trailer rear fairings (also known as \u201cboat tails\u201d) and other aerodynamic components on trailers as well. While the goal of installing these components is usually to improve efficiency (miles per gallon of fuel), they can also have the side effect of increasing the truck\u2019s top speed. Another major factor in determining a semi truck\u2019s top speed is the weight of its cargo. A truck that is loaded to its maximum capacity (under federal standards, the current maximum gross vehicle weight (GVW) for a tractor trailer is 80,000 pounds) is going to accelerate far slower and reach a much lower top speed than a tractor transporting an empty trailer. Tire conditions, engine maintenance, road conditions and numerous other variables can all impact a semi truck\u2019s top speed as well. However, perhaps a better question than how fast can semi trucks travel is: How fast should they travel? Government data show that there are tens of thousands of commercial truck accidents every year \u2013 thousands of them fatal \u2013 and it is well-documented that speed plays a primary role in a significant percentage of tractor trailer accidents. Commercial trucks are subject to the same speed limits as passenger vehicles. In certain high-risk locations, commercial trucks are even subject to lower speed limits than cars, vans and SUVs. These posted speed limits reflect the maximum safe driving speeds under ideal weather and traffic conditions. When it is raining, or when there is heavy traffic, truckers may need to drive well below the posted limit in order to avoid putting themselves and others at risk for serious injury. A semi truck\u2019s weight and cargo load can impact its safe top speed as well. Consider, for example, the fact that many rollover accidents occur on highway onramps and offramps. Why is this the case? Because heavy trucks carrying too much speed into turns are especially prone to rolling over. Finally, driver ability is another critical factor in determining a semi truck\u2019s safe top speed. Simply put, a truck driver should never exceed the speed at which he or she is able to safely maintain control of the truck. Rollovers, rear-end collisions, jackknifes, T-bone collisions at intersections and other common types of truck accidents frequently result from inexperienced truck drivers carrying more speed than they can handle. Truck drivers need to know their limits and their trucks\u2019 capabilities. When inexperienced truck drivers attempt to brake harshly, run red lights because they are unable to stop and make other mistakes, they end up creating dangerous situations that could \u2013 and should \u2013 have been avoided.

            "answer_text": "Most in NZ are electronically limited. 93 kmh is the most common then 95 then 100. Our Aerodyne has the limiter off and it\u2019s flat out at 107. Some of the Japanese ones used to be able to do 120 or 130. A guy called Ashtray who is a fuckwit got clocked at 136 kmh in a fully loaded truck and trailer. That was the last straw and he got demoted to a labourers job. Most companies here don\u2019t tolerate speeding. My truck and trailer does 100 but I usually set cruise control to 93. In the old days trucks used to be limited by engines revs and usually did 85 to 110 kmh at full revs usually about 2100 or so. The newer ones tend to run at about 1500 or so at 90 odd kmh so are electronically limited. Also a lot of companies have what\u2019s called a Driver Buddy. It\u2019s the electronic equivalent of a prison snitch so there\u2019s not much speeding going on. I can tell who\u2019s got one because they generally are slowed right down when they hit a 70 or 50 zone whereas I start slowing down after I\u2019ve passed the sign. And usually on the other side I m doing 93 by the time I pass the sign and they don\u2019t start accelerating until they pass the sign ",
