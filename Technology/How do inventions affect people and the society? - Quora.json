The impact of the SAK is incalculable. Never leave the house without it. Don\u2019t carry on the plane, those rat bastards in the TSA confiscate and keep them for themselves. Don\u2019t give them the satisfaction. Buy a new one wherever you land. The Nail clipper hasn\u2019t changed in a thousand years, I have a dozen of them, one of the most effective tools in the galaxy. The Astronauts on the moon and planets wouldn\u2019t leave Earth without several of them. The Toe nail clipper isn\u2019t far behind. The containers that are a bit narrower at the top than the bottom have saved trillions of spilled liquids. The monokini is unrivaled in the annals of fashion statements. My next high impact tool will be a Drone. ",
