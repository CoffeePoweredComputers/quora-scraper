            "answer_text": "The origins of technology can be dated back to industrial revolution where technology was employed and enhanced at a rapid rate to exploit the market. Technology is the line which demarcates modern civilization from the medieval one.Technology, without an iota of doubt has significantly contributed to advancement of human civilization but it also carries a significant risk in wiping out the same. As over reliance on technology has increased the carbon footprint to threatening levels. We have become willing slaves; letting it clandestinely seduce us into eventual catastrophe. Hence, technology for need is a necessity but for greed can lead towards biblical doomsday.Coming back to the original question as to whether we can live without technology? I, firmly believe, we can. For example, there are many civilizations that live cut of from society. They exist in perfect symbiosis with nature. They mainly exist in the dense jungles of Amazon. Our Indian subcontinent too boast of a remarkable tribe of Jarawas who inhabit the Andaman and Nicobar island. Until a few decades ago they lived in complete isolation away from rest of humanity. As per research, the tribe has continued to inhabit the island for more than 60,000 years without any aide from outside world (without technology).Study suggests that they not only survived but thrived and prospered. They display remarkable understanding of the ecosystem which even baffles our scientists and researchers. In addition to that, there is compelling evidence to suggest that their understanding of (the essence of) humanity is at par with ours and in some cases even more evolved.However, before answering the question, we need to distinguish between needs and wants. Needs are those which are essential for sustaning human life,i.e, oxygen, food, shelter, sleep and water unlike wants. Therefore, technology is a want and not a need. To put it succinctly, Mahatma Gandhi said that \u201cThere is enough(on this planet) for everyones need but not not enough for anyone's greed\u201d. Therefore the onus lies on us as to how do we view technology, as a need or rather as a want?",
