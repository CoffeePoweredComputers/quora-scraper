As far as what\u2019s written, only Caleb and Joshua entered into the promise land carrying the baton of Moses and Aaron. The promised land was Canaan, or Palestine. It\u2019s present-day Lebanon, Syria, Jordan, and Israel. It was also known as Phoenicia. *That means that in Drews' theory, the \"Red Sea\" or \"sea of reeds\" of Exodus was actually the Lake of Tanis. The lake \u201cwas a shallow brackish lagoon, and that was the ideal place for these papyrus reeds to grow,\u201d says Drews. \u201cSo if you want to find a sea of reeds, even today, that's it.\u201d He\u00b7brew /\u02c8h\u0113bro\u035eo/ Learn to pronounce noun 1.a member of an ancient people living in what is now Israel and Palestine and, according to biblical tradition, descended from the patriarch Jacob, grandson of Abraham.

I\u2019m waiting for the afrocentrists to invade this comment section and claim their pseudo-historical ,inferiority-complex caused theories about the mysterious disappearance of the native \u2018black\u2019 population. On a serious note though, the modern Egyptian population genetically resembles the ancient Egyptian populations. Looking at a chronology of post-bronze age Egypt: Nubians: Didn't colonise Assyrians: No colonising Persians: No colonising Greeks under the Ptolemaic: Greeks colonised the delta, but not enough to cause a big enough genetic change in the area to change the demography of the region. Romans: Some elites and officials, but apart from that not really. Arabs: Not really; like the romans though some elites and officials mixed with the population. Turks: Some elites and officials mixed with the populations, particularly in regions like Alexandria. Brits: No, not at all. And finally, the native Egyptians albeit Arabs( as a cultural identity now) and predominantly muslim rather than the old Egyptian religion. But most importantly, still Egyptians! ",

The invaders from Central Asia, the nomadic and horse riders, the Hexos, as our History books call them, were able to conquer and settle then vanished as the Pharaohs were able to rise to power again. The Greeks came in, got absorbed and mixed with the local populace as time went on. The Romans, the Arabs, Even the French, the Britons, each had their DNA deposited in the wombs of Egyptian women.
