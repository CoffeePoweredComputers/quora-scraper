            "answer_text": "You seem an AI enthu. Or you just want to avoid it. In my opinion, there\u2019s too much AI which we\u2019re absorbing around us. Either way, whichever is your case, I\u2019ve found you names for all things AI in every field. So you might want to explore or avoid :p Links are in the bottom as I like my answer look clean. For Marketing GrowthBot: You might want to chat with GrowthBot if you\u2019re seeking somebody (or someboty) to answer your questions about a competitor or any website; primarily around their SEO efforts, PPC campaign planning, CPC allocations and budgets, and others.Acrolinx: If you\u2019re into producing content (like me), you won\u2019t mind some AI advice on how to improve writing.Invoca: Try exploring Invoca if your business heavily rely on calls a a mode of communication. It gives you campaign attribution insights, why people are calling you, what did they speak, etc.Gmail: You must\u2019ve noticed this already. The predictive text guides you to compose your email drafts based on it\u2019s AI. I share a love-and-hate-relationship with. Though, if you want you can always turn it off like this: For Business owners (more like entrepreneurs these days) X.ai: See if you can rely on AI / assistant booking and scheduling meetings for you.Hunter: This is something useful. Lets you obtain work email addresses of people you may be planning to reach to to. Sneaky, eh?Lusha: Similar tool as above to get contacts of people on LinkedIn. These two require you to add extensions to your browser.ParallelDots: Savvy business minds expect more even out tools like MS Excel. If yours is also such case, empower your excel with ParallelDots ML and AI.For Productivity LegalRobot: Analyzes your legal docs and checks for fairness and clarity. Don\u2019t expect legal advice though. That\u2019s just optimism.Siri/Cortana/Ok Google: Probably the most typical yet useful. Harsh truth, we\u2019re becoming slaves of reminders and constant nudging. So to embrace it, start utilizing these as I\u2019m assuming you already have them.For Ad Tech ImageKit: If you\u2019re somebody who works with images/ads almost every day, you might want to try out this image optimization tool.AdPushup: If you\u2019re someone who also supports advertisers to run ads on your website, you\u2019d definitely want to experience the platform\u2019s intelligence working to help you harness your ad revenue. Because revenue matter the most, right? Some weird ones Ruuh: An AI based chatbot developed by Microsoft. You\u2019ll find her on Facebook messenger and might really get surprised with her quirky attribute. Worth a chat, at least once!:) Affectiva: That\u2019s how they represent it. Can you expect an AI that let\u2019s you analyze people\u2019s facial expressions. That\u2019s what their website says. Not kidding.Hope this list answers somewhat of your expectation. You\u2019ll find the links in the bottom, as promised. Marketing: GrowthBot | Acrolinx | Invoca | Gmail (really need it?) Business: X.AI | Hunter | Lusha | ParallelDots Productivity: LegalRobot | Siri/Cortant/Ok Google (again?) Ad Tech: ImageKit | AdPushup Weird ones: Ruuh | Affectiva ",

            "answer_text": "Modern day web app development is increasingly focused on building a customer-facing front-end presence with the use of Artificial Intelligence.  Web apps, use Artificial Intelligence not just for intelligent automation, but also for building recommendation engines, website implementation, and image recognition, among other application areas. In this post, we look at five key areas, illustrated by real-world examples, where web apps are employing Artificial intelligence to automate some part of their system. Engines of Amazon and Netflix Curating content based on the user\u2019s context is one of the most widely used AI features in web apps. Amazon , for instance, uses item-based collaborative filtering for product classification.  Amazon\u2019s recommendation system uses a combination of goods-based recommendation (users are recommended for those similar to what they liked in the past) and buddy-based recommendation (users are recommended things which their Facebook friends like.) Not just for their recommendation system, Amazon has been using AI for multiple tasks. Their AI Management Strategy is called The Flywheel, where one part of Amazon acts as a catalyst for AI and machine learning growth in other areas. Another popular example is Netflix, who revamped their recommendation algorithm based on visual impressions. One of their research projects indicated that the artwork was not only the biggest influencer to a viewer\u2019s decision to watch content, but it also drew over 82% of their focus while browsing Netflix.  This made them develop a new image recommendation algorithm which works in real time to project the image it thinks the user will respond to. They use implicit (user behavior) and Explicit data (user activity) and then feed this data to machine learning algorithms to figure out the relevant content for each user. For each title, users get the image with the highest rank based on their profile. Side by side, it continues collecting data from its 100 million other subscribers to improve its engine\u2019s performance. code helpers using AI Intelligent coding assistants are gaining popularity with their ability to understand the code and provide right suggestions at the right time. They can analyze code on the web and give fast and smart completions.  Codota for Chrome is a smart web-based IDE which can build predictive models of code and suggest code completions and related content based on the current context present in the code. It combines program analysis, natural language processing, and machine learning to learn from the code. Users can look for Codota\u2019s Icon on every code snippet on their browsers \u2013 in GitHub, StackOverflow and others. Another example is Deep Cognition\u2019s Deep Learning Studio \u2013 Cloud. It is not exactly an IDE, but it features AI-powered drag & drop interface to help design deep learning models with ease. It features assisted modeling, for automated tensor size calculations and real-time validation. It also has AutoML feature to automatically build a neural network. Even though AI is a great choice to enhance your web apps, an important facet to keep in mind is ensuring fairness, accuracy, and transparency of your web apps. For instance, web apps powered by natural language should not discriminate people based on caste, color, or creed or hurt user sentiments. Similarly, those using neural networks for recognizing images should ensure the filtering of obscene images. artificial intelligence Chatbots Web-based chatbots are just like read more ",

Questioning existing business standards and brainstorming innovative AI solutions. Whether you are searching for anticipation or dissipation at the emergence of AI, machines are here to stay in one way or another. Combining this new technology with the best features of the specific human mind offers many possibilities that still need to be thoroughly investigated. People who work with tech firms tend to offer the most positive outlook for the future opportunities AI will provide. Sharing information on the opportunities that AI provides will be an essential factor in helping people feel comfortable embracing such new technologies. The most productive members of society will collaborate with AI in the future, creating a robot to person relationships, rendering their actions much more effective. It's important to share knowledge with everyone on how to do this properly. To get an in-depth knowledge of Artificial Intelligence programming, you can enroll for an Artificial Intelligence programming course by 4Achievers. ",
