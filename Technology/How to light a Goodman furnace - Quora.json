            "answer_text": "If there is a pilot light , which would be a gas flame that's always burning, waiting for the thermostat to call for heat. When heat is called for the gas valve opens and the pilot light lights the main furnace burners. Most furnaces today don't have pilot lights , they have gone to spark ignition which sparks the main burners when heat is called for. This is for more efficient as there's no gas being used unless for heat. The lighting instructions will be written on the inside of the panel covers , just lift and tilt outward to remove . Read the instructions carefully and light the furnace pilot light or let the furnace go threw it's ignition sequence. Make sure the thermostat is set for heat , and raise it higher than room temperature prolly about 10 or 15 degrees higher than ambient room temp. The furnace should work , also make sure gas is turned on also. ",

            "answer_text": "My new Goodman furnace lights the gas with a red hot glow plug. Much better than spark ignition. If you have an older furnace that has a pilot light, set the gas valve to pilot, follow the small aluminum tube from the valve to the pilot light location, depress the appropriate button to get gas to flow to the pilot light, light with a long lighter, after several seconds, release the button and see if the pilot light holds. When you have a lit pilot light flame, turn the gas valve setting to burner position. ",
