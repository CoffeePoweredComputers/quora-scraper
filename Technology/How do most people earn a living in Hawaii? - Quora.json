            "answer_text": "Same as anywhere else \u2014 earning as much as they can, and spending as little as they can, by any means possible. As Jeff Torda points out, that often means multiple jobs. In 2001, I was working full-time at a dot-com in the travel business. Life was great, then the dot-com bubble burst, the company got bought by folks on the mainland, and 9/11 happened. I didn\u2019t want to move to the Rocky Mountains when winter was coming, so I found the cheapest old termite-eaten \u201cworker\u2019s cottage\u201d left over from the sugar-plantation days, in the lowest-income census block of the cheapest island, and lived in it. To put it in terms that will resonate with a lot of Americans, my property tax was $25 a year. One girl I know was even cheaper \u2014 she bought a piece of land covered in jungle, bought a plastic garden shed for a few hundred dollars, and lived in it. She\u2019d stop at a county gym to shower on her way to work. I started working part-time jobs, more and more of them, peaking in late 2007 when I had five part-time jobs, one of them through a temp agency that had me working for two different customers. And I volunteered a lot of evenings and weekends at a place that gave volunteers free meals dinner. Minimizing expenses other than housing was important too. I sold my old car to a student friend around 2006 and walked or biked or took the bus or used shared-ride taxis for $2 a trip. I grew bananas in my yard, and neighbors with orange and tangerine trees were happy to share with me. I rarely traveled anywhere unless one job or another was paying my way. In 2009, I finally got full-time work \u2014 and medical and dental insurance \u2014 again. But I didn\u2019t buy another car (from a student friend) until 2011. ",

            "answer_text": "In short, most people in Hawaii live from \u201cpaycheck to paycheck\u201ddue to the high cost of living. So it\u2019s not uncommon for people to work at two jobs; for example, one might work at CVS Longs and later at one of the bakeries. Some work long hours at construction, while they can as long as there are projects to complete. Then they are compelled to collect unemployment compensation until a new project opens up. Others are school teachers. Many are cashiers at Costco, Walmart, and convenience stores, while others work at restaurants and hotels. You take whatever you can, unless you are skilled in engineering or computer technology. Even then, such jobs are limited. I don\u2019t mean to paint a bleak picture, but people here are struggling. Such is the price of living in \u201cparadise.\u201d ",
