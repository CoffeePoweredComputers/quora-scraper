            "answer_text": "Windows 10 allows you to automatically lock your computer or tablet when you step away from it. To do so, you first need to pair your device with your smartphone via Bluetooth. Then select the Start button on your Windows device and go to Settings > Accounts > Sign-in options. Under Dynamic lock, select the \"Allow Windows to automatically lock your device when you're away\" check-box. The computer will automatically be locked after about one minute if the Bluetooth connection between the computer and the mobile device is broken. The range of Bluetooth varies depending on the device but generally, it's around 10m. How to lock a Windows 10 device remotely If lost, stolen, or you think your device has been compromised, you can use the following steps to lock your computer remotely: Note: Although it may be obvious, remember that for this feature to work, the device must be connected to the internet using a Microsoft account. Open your Microsoft account online.Click on Devices.In the \"Overview\" tab, click the Show details (or Manage) button for the device you want to lock.Click the Find my device tab.Click the Lock button on the top-right side.Click Next.Create a short message with return instructions that will appear in the Lock screen. For example, Please do the right thing. If found call this number 555-123-4567.Click the Lock button.Click the Reset password (recommended) button to change your current password if you think the account has been compromised, or click the OK button.Once you've completed the steps, if the attempt to reach your device remotely is successful, Windows 10 will sign out any active users, disable the local users, and show your message in the Lock screen. However, administrator accounts will remain active, but any unauthorized access will be blocked. After you recover your device, nothing will be different. You can sign in to your account with your original or with the new password that you created during the locking process. ",
