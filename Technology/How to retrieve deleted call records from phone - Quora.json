            "answer_text": "Hi! So you wish to retrieve the deleted call log or call history from your phone? Since you have not specified whether you use an iPhone or Android, I will list some simple solutions that you can implement on either of them. Sync them with the cloud If you have an iPhone, then you might already know that you can sync your call logs with your iCloud account. The same is applicable for Android users as they can sync call logs with their Google account too. Now, you can go to your phone\u2019s iCloud or Google account and turn on the option to sync back the call logs. If you call logs were already synced before, then they will reappear here. Use a Recovery Tool If you have not synced your call logs before or their backup was not there, then you can use a data recovery tool instead. For instance, Dr.Fone \u2013 Data Recovery is one of the best solutions to recover all kinds of data from an Android or iPhone. It is the first smartphone data recovery that can get back your photos, call logs, contacts, videos, and so much more. You can just connect your device to the system, launch the application, and perform a basic click-through process to recover all kinds of data. The interface would even let you preview your content before you save them to a secure location of your choice. ",

            "answer_text": "If you are talking voice mail on a smart phone, call yourself, press \u2018#\u2019 when the phone company answers your call and enter your password. If you want a copy, ask your service provider (phone company) for a copy. If you have a legal requirement, your attorney will be able to subpoena the phone company for copies as long as you have not deleted them. You can always hook up a microphone to a recorder (PC will do) and play the voice mail into the mic. Some providers will automatically text you a transcript of all voice mail (Verizon does for a fee.) ",
