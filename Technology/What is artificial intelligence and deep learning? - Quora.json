            "answer_text": "Artificial Intelligence is the science and engineering of making intelligent machines, especially intelligent computing programs. It is related to the similar task of using computers to understand human intelligence, but AI does not have to confine itself to methods that are biologically observable. Any learning technique that enables computers to mimic human intelligence, using logic, if-hen rules, decision trees, and machine learning (including deep learning). It perceives its environment and makes decisions to maximize chances of achieving its goal. It includes vision, robotics, machine learning , natural language processing, planning, etc. It is basically a guest to build software running on machines that can \u2018think\u2019 and act like humans. The subset of machine learning composed of algorithms that permit software to train itself to perform tasks, like speech and image recognition, by exposing multilayered neural network to vast amounts of data. Deep learning is a branch of machine learning based on a set of algorithms that attempt to model High-level abstractions in data by using multiple processing layers, with complex structures or otherwise, composed of multiple non-linear transformations.
