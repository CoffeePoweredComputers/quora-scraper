            "answer_text": "Do they? I have an extremely difficult time finding 3D blu-rays in the states. Usually I have to find a vendor overseas that will ship to the US. Also, just because there are no \u201cnew\u201d 3D TVs (hint: there are still new ones, they\u2019re just all active and generally require additional hardware) doesn\u2019t mean that the ones that were already sold no longer exist. There are plenty of people with passive and active 3D TVs who would like to use their discontinued technology. Regardless, these production studios spent a good chunk of change on converting the film into 3D (or shooting the film in 3D as the case may be) - and if they can get that work out there for little cost to them, but potentially a fair profit, then they\u2019re definitely going to do that.
