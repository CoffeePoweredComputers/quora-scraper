            "answer_text": "Human is nothing without love. Without a bit of love, a human does not fit in the definition. Love for parents, towards fellow brothers, towards colleagues and also towards his country. Humanity is alive with love. Without it we become a piece of stone who just exsist but becomes dead inside. Infact love is just a powerful feeling that only special people can describe it in words. Love toward anything gives us the motive to do good. It brings us the motivation to stay alive and work for good of othersA man working hard day and night just for the benefit of his family.A soldier waiting to die for his country anytime just not because he considers this as his duty, but he has a strong connection of love for his countryParents love toward their Ward and their willing to do everything for them is one of the greatest examples of all timeAmong all this also love can also be seen in bits of everything. Nature can also be taken for example. Not only humans, animals also show a great example of love and affection. Mother and her kids love, love among the fellow breed, all these can be seen in nature too. With these I can say that love definitely exsist in nature in different form. We just have to view this from our different perspective and view point. Yes love exsist and it makes a human to become a perfect and a abled human . ",

            "answer_text": "It doesn\u2019t. Love is not exclusive to just humans, other animals love, too. When an elephant in a herd dies, it\u2019s been observed that the rest of the herd will completely stop, and start gently caressing the body of the fallen elephant with their trunks, almost as if they\u2019re remembering fond memories that they had together. The herd also begins covering the body of their fallen with branches and fronds in a sort of ritual burial. From this, we can gather that the herd loved the fallen elephant, enough to give them a proper farewell. You can also observe, quite evidently, that dogs love their masters unconditionally. They leap with joy when the master comes home from a long day away at work, or protect their master fiercely, with their own lives if need be sometimes. A creature wouldn\u2019t do that for another animal they didn\u2019t love. Love is not exclusive to humans. It\u2019s a quality of higher-functioning life in general. Now, not all life is capable of love. You won\u2019t find any bacteria or viruses that love anything, they all function off of pure genetic programming. But higher-functioning life forms, anything with a brain more complex than a cockroaches, I\u2019m convinced, can feel some sort of equivalent to love. Only humans can put a word to this feeling that we feel, but other animals can feel it just as deeply as we do. ",
