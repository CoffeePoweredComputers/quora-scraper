            "answer_text": "Normal UsersWithout a doubt Safari is the safest and most secure web browser in the world. Safari is given away by Apple along with its open source, and in that case it is called WebKit. Webkit os so widely respected that it is the most used foundation to create other web browsers. Companies like Google and Microsoft both have Webkit deep in their corse as the foundation to their latest web browsers (Chromium, Chrome and Edge). The problem with these companies is that they add a huge member of gimmicks to make their version of WebKit to seem be different and of course the more hillocks you add the more security problems and bugs you inject into what started out as being the safest ad most secure web browser in the world.Paranoid UsersParanoid users should still use Safari/WebKit however they often use Tor.Tor is not so much a web browser as it is a VPN system that also offers a web browser for your convenienceParanoid users assume that Tor is secure but I have never seen one actually admit the source code so there of no proof that it actually is secure, no proof at allSafari/Webkit is used as a foundation in many web browsers (at one point 95% of all mobile devices used WebKit based web browsers, since all those companies decoded to hide that they used WebKit by renaming the WebKit foundation, we can\u2019t tell how many are using it now (it could still be 95%) which means that Safari/Webkit has been audited many times and is constantly being reviewed and audited so we in fact know that it is safe.Tor is monitored by the FBI (by now all the major world governments are likely to be monitoring it as well) because pretty much all worldwide criminals use Tor, so all your activity is being monitored in some way, because criminal activity is being monitored. It does take the government some effort to match up the user to the activity but in reality it makes no sense to use Tor is you don't want to be monitored, because in fact al of Tor is in some way being monitored. There have already been several criminals sentenced to severe jail sentences after they were tracked through Tor.UPDATE: Other World Computing (OWC) Has reported the discovery that Google Chrome browsers have a severe security fault where the browser indicates that it is up to date but in reality it is extremely out of date. This is a severe violation of user trust because a user would expect the browser to always be secure by it being up to date, but Google Chrome is now subject to hacking from active attacks that are happening in the real world, so Google Chrome is not recommend because it cannot be trusted.

            "answer_text": "Currently the most secure is Microsoft Edge. Not to mention the fastest with less load on Battery life in Laptops and tablets. Reasons why it\u2019s the most secure: Chrome is Open Source(Every Weakness it has can be found by hackers)Mozilla is Open Source(same as Chrome\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..)Edge Is the most secure, and not because it\u2019s the most widely used but because a hacker cannot see or know it\u2019s weaknesses. Another thing that rarely gets brought up online. Microsoft acquired GitHub knowing that everyone has access to Facebook apps as well as many other Open Sourced apps and projects. It is in these that hackers play around and sample code by forking it or being actual developers working within. And Facebook who is attacked daily by Cross Site Injections through API\u2019s and mobile Apps is working with Microsoft to insure it\u2019s security and to prevent it. Vulnerability only stems from hackers knowing your code. And if they can see your code, Chrome and Mozilla\u2019s code they will find a way in. Google also uses it\u2019s own custom version of JavaScript(A-Big-Hack) for your machine when running Chrome. And when JavaScript in your machine is removing/over-riding your Machines up to date and Modern JavaScript. They essentially are creating a giant hole they cannot control. Compromised\u2026 Mozilla currently has stepped ahead of Google Chrome in both speed and in preventing advertisers open season on your Social Data. But in Security it still lags far behind. Mozilla would be second used by a hacker for Cross Site Injection knowing they have little or no filtering for them. And Mozilla has too many developers working Within. Tor isn\u2019t the most preferred Browser for Hacking. Governments use Tor for things unimaginable. Hackers will use a either a modified WebView which will not give their location and or IP if set correctly. And where they can control what is requested and received through their software. And use a fake browser crawler/scalper to hack which is the most preferred being a non browser advantage. And have full reign on JavaScript Injections with no filtering. Common Sense ! An Excerpt from two Chrome developers on Wired: \u201cThough Google is obviously aggressive about gaining Chrome users, and has built a whole ecosystem through Android that relies on Chrome, Schuh and Tabriz note that the browser is still underpinned by a massive open source project. And they add that in addition to publishing the code base, Chrome is also very intentionally developed in public, with contributors from around the world and discourse publicly visible in the Chromium forums. Google has even paid out more than $4.2 million through its bug bounty program to researchers who submit Chrome vulnerabilities.\u201d Having To Basically Buy Off Hackers? One would think ! \"It's possible to open source things without having them be open development,\" Schuh says. \"But our external wiki pages and mailing lists\u2014anyone in the world can subscribe to them. And a lot of the people working on our projects, they\u2019re not using corporate Google accounts, but independent Chromium accounts.\" And I prefer Google Chrome as it is still the best Search Engine !
