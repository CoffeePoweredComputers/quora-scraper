            "answer_text": "I honestly haven\u2019t tried code.org yet. I enrolled my daughter in WhiteHat Jr a couple of months ago and she\u2019s enjoying her lessons so far. WhiteHat Jr offers classes to kids from 6 to 14 years old. You must check out their trial sessions first but I recommend booking one as soon as possible. The slots available are usually limited. In terms of pricing, WhiteHat Jr fees are fair and reasonable. They are not cheap, but you will certainly get the value of every dollar you spend. After all, their classes are one-on-one and live. The teachers are competent and belong to the top 0.1% of certified teachers. They are experts in coding so your child can ask pretty much whatever he or she wants. Also, WhiteHat Jr offers four different course levels. It starts with Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced, and the final course is Professional. All levels have 144 classes each then subdivided into three. There are goals per course that the student needs to meet. When the goals are successfully met, then the student can proceed to the next course level. The classes are ideally held three times per week so it doesn\u2019t interfere with your son or daughter\u2019s regular classes. In fact, after starting with WhiteHat Jr, my daughter started having better studying habits. She would always study and do her homework first so she can practice coding or start her coding class. Coding and programming are not the easiest things to study, in my opinion. That\u2019s why I\u2019m surprised how some apps and games would say they are teaching kids to code when it\u2019s pretty much-telling kids what and how coding is. You need to apply your learnings in order to say that you successfully learned, right? That\u2019s what the student can expect when enrolled in WhiteHat Jr. Even the beginner level course includes building apps and a commercial professional-looking game. Based on my daughter\u2019s experience, this is definitely a good place to start learning how to code. ",

            "answer_text": "Coding Websites for Kids in Elementary School 1. Blockly  Ages: 8+Pricing: Free Blockly teaches programming principles and introduces JavaScript using a block-based programming approach. It\u2019s just like doing a puzzle, except you connect pieces of code and you don\u2019t end up with any missing pieces under the couch. Puzzle pieces will appear on the screen and the goal is to complete the \u201cstory\u201d that makes up the software program by completing the puzzle. Each puzzle piece represents a block of code, which is similar to a paragraph in a story. Kids can drag-and-drop the puzzle pieces to create a sequence of code. As long as your child can read, he or she can learn coding with Blockly. However, some of the games include using the number of degrees to define the direction an object moves and others concepts that may be difficult for really little kids despite it using a gamification approach and simple graphics. Overall, Blockly is a simple, straightforward coding website for kids who don\u2019t have any experience with coding. Its aim is to prepare kids to learn conventional text-based computer programming languages. 2. Code Combat  Ages: 5-17Pricing: Free for core levels. Monthly subscription for additional levels.
