            "answer_text": "You will need two types of sensors for this, one is the LDR(Light Dependent Resistor) and PIR sensor.LDR will vary the Resistance with the variation in the ambient light. You will have to input analogous signal from this sensor. PIR sensor is basically an Infrared sensor which is readily available in the market. You can find different Interfacing circuits on net. ",
