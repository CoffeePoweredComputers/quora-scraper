            "answer_text": "Thanks for A2A. Let's be real here, I believe soon cellphones will have an app that will correctly recognize speech and translate it directly in matter of few seconds. It's a logical step forward. However, that is not to happen for some time at least. I never liked languages, really, but I happened to have brain to get the grasp of them quickly. I don't really learn language to do a job with it, but for it to help me do a job, or just allow me to enjoy a vacation, or enable me to talk to people who have that language as their native. You see, getting a proficiency in language takes 10-15 years if it's just a side thing that you do or don't do, and even if you are extremely dedicated (having little time for other stuff) you need at least a year. It's not a small time for a lifetime. What you should get though is a feeling of accomplishment - you know something that others don't, you took the time and you are a bit more versatile now. Basically I never learned languages because I need them, I learned them because I can. From a purely economic and rational standpoint, every translation system will have some delay, or will require equipment and supplies to work. Your knowledge doesn't need any time or equipment to do it's job correctly. Also, while translation systems are advancing, you will be in huge advantage for next 10-15 years, until they are literally embedded in our brains to the point that you can download language pack and know it. If you really need a language, you should learn it anyway, it's not too much work. If you like a language, you should learn it, because you like to do it and you should do it. ",

            "answer_text": "It\u2019s an extremely interesting and certainly the most relevant question. This is relevant from the point of two aspects: 1. In the current context of Governments and certain parents sending their children to English medium at the cost mother tongue; 2. People are helpless. In order to get the recognition in the job market they study any other language than their mother tongue. Many a time, both the politicians, and the educators say that our languages are in complete, insufficiently developed, lack professional vocabularies and inadequate to used in higher education. Further, they would say there is n\u2019t much written in these languages in terms of the compiled knowledge. Lack of textual material in each and every discipline will be a problem to conduct class room teaching, and learning. Billions of bites of information and knowledge is constantly created and recorded in certain languages. The languages of the developing nations cannot cope of with this situation, because, not any worth the name research is being done every day. In some cases where there is no knowledge is created, producing knowledge texts takes the backseat. Countries with less or no translation experts cannot really carryout the translation of all and every information and knowledge that is produced. A majority of modernized societies demand translation for each and every byte that is produced elsewhere. The latest computational technology drawing power from some amount of Artificial intelligence has relatively made easier to translate automatically from one human language to another human language. Large quantities of aligned parallel and enriched corpora and the advanced machine learning algorithms supported by the artificial intelligence can simplify our efforts of creating machine translation systems. Gone are those handcrafted rule based MT systems. Today we have the huge amounts of storage and processing tools at lightning speed involving artificial intelligence can facilitate the development of real-time fully automatic at least domain bound speech to speech machines that would certainly relieve us of the burden of learning a language other than the mother tongue. Gone are those nightmares of grammar and practicing sessions to master a foreign language. Already there are some successes in this area, though, today they are not qualitatively good but certainly, in a decade the problem will be solved and any body can access any text in any language in the user\u2019s choice language. There will be no endangered languages anymore. ",
