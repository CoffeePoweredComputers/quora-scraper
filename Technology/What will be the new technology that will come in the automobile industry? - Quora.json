            "answer_text": "The rate of technological development in the automobile industry is improving year by year. What was thought to be concept few years back are now a reality. Here are few examples: Flying Cars: Flying cars are finally about to enter production. Prototypes were being built and tested since the early years of twentieth century.  Electric Cars: The first practical production electric cars were built in 1884. But soon they were eclipsed by the efficiency of Internal Combustion engines . With the development of new battery technologies since 2008, performance of electric cars rapidly increased to compete with Gasoline cars. Soon, fossil fuel based cars will be considered obsolete. Autonomous Cars: We are familiar with fully autonomous cars from science fiction movies like i robot. Autonomous vehicles appeared as concepts and prototypes since 80s. The world started taking it serious when Tesla offered its autopilot system to its customers in 2014. At present, Tesla autopilot is not considered as fully autonomous but Elon Musk promises that this system will be more efficient and safe than human drivers in the near future.  Smart Cars: Every gadget is getting smarter everyday with the help of IOT(Internet of things) and Artificial Intelligence. In future, cars will get smarter and gets integrated with other technologies such as home automation.  Bio-metric Vehicle Access - We are not going to need a key in our pocket to access the car. Our fingerprint or eyeball will do the job. Head-Up-Displays - HUD had been used in military aircraft for many years. But now, the technology is getting cheaper that it will be available on car windshields in the near future.  These are just few examples of many interesting technology that are transforming the automotive industry. ",

            "answer_text": "Going through an article published in The Economic Times, Auto Technology I was astounded by some of the really fascinating innovations in coming future. There could be so many new innovations but let's talk about those only which we might experience in near future. So here are some of them. Pre-Collision Technology - Top carmakers such as Ford and Hyundai have developed a pre-collision assist and pedestrian detection technology. Besides helping the driver detect blind spots, this technology also alerts the driver when he/she is not paying attention on the road. And if the driver falls asleep and does not respond to the warning, then the system applies the brakes on its own. V2V Communications - In February, US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration announced that it will begin taking steps to enable vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication technology for light vehicles. This technology would allow vehicles to \"talk\" to each other and ultimately avoid many crashes altogether by exchanging basic safety data, such as speed and position, ten times per second, to improve safety. Land Rover's Invisible Car - In April, Tata -owned JLR introduced a new technology to give drivers a digital vision of the terrain ahead by making the front of the car 'virtually' invisible. The technology \u2014 named Transparent Bonnet \u2014 enables a driver climbing a steep incline or manoeuvring in a confined space to see an augmented reality view capturing not only the terrain in front of the car but also the angle and position of the front wheels. Aumated Manual Transmission(AMT) - In the 2014 Delhi Auto Expo, where more than 70 vehicles were launched, one that pundits hailed as the most important was Maruti Suzuki's Celerio, the first affordable mass segment gearless hatchback. Celerio comes with AMT (automate manual transmission) sourced from Magneti Marelli, component arm of Fiat. AMT is an electro-hydraulic mechanism for automating manual transmission, which derives from Formula 1.

            "answer_text": "Right here: Most EVs are nowhere near ECO-friendly because they are usually still massively coal-fired. You should NOT make a successful EV to be or look like an ICV. Also: Compared to our non-produced TRiCAR, TESLA hysteria has seen no more REAL BENEFIT progress since 1895 EVs. Here are some of their massive problems: compared to our TRiCAR, MANY THINGS (are quoted to) SUCK RE TESLA which is too BIG for an EV; its about 40 times too heavy; it\u2019s horsepower is 100s of times too much like a clunking race car where 1900s big cars had 4 to 8 hp though our TRiCAR has a mere 1/4 hp with 8 gears; battery cost over 100 times more than ought at $5,000 after 500 charges which could be not much more than a year reportedly for some drivers; total vehicle cost about 35 times too much + I read about scores of TESLA faults to be or not to be fixed, unlike none on TRiCAR for over 26 years. EVs should have small bike wheels like ours which have a strip of tough tyre material between inner tube & tyre for puncture protection. TESLA has a mass of computer junk & we all know how unreliable that can be & can you sue them? Similarly, a fatal Software flaw in MCAS in 2 new Boeing planes has killed both planeloads of passengers = not enough reliable foresight or planning being paid. We need no charging points; instead a 46-watt home or carried Solar panel soon charges its battery, or charges 2 replacement batteries, if not mains charged, 1 being an extra for range. For emergency, TRICAR easily carries a reclining patient, or our folded long-range Chinese FREEGO micro electric K scooter. If people only realised the poor technical problems & were bothered with the technical specifications of Tesla, there would be no future. Guess they will find out when a $5,000 battery has to be changed, especially when no more cheap lithium around!!! TRiCAR should cost less than $1,000 - many times cheaper to buy & cheaper to run. Amazing how nobody seems curious? People support self-driving cars by 2040? Sure hope not as contributors often find driving far more fun than being driven like a taxi. Also have you never heard of a computer failing or flat batteries? Also have you ever heard of a computer being sued for its life?? How do they know when to slow & what to do with snow around? Or a flying plastic bag? Or when 100 miles from anywhere with flat batteries or breakdown? Or if must pullover for police, fire brigade, funeral or ambulance? Or if you are too injured to drive the monster off the motorway?? All such vehicles will have to have a continuously-running evidence camera. Curious how nobody wants more FREE details! BACKUP OPTIONS: Still nobody seems to worry if a massive CV like Tesla is caught out 100 km from humanity in bush or desert with a flat battery or broken down. We have several simple solutions to recover or avoid our TRICAR from similar: We easily carry 1 bigger or up to 2 more small batteries for vastly greater speed & range than 50 km. We can pedal somewhere to get home, or take the battery somewhere to get charged, or buy a new standard battery, or I can easily lift the vehicle into a small van, or even hitch-hike to some great distance with scooter. If too far to pedal, TRICAR easily carries our folded long-range Chinese FREEGO electric K scooter. A reclining patient is easily accommodated\u2026 We can carry a small folding 46watt solar panel to open on the grass; or we could carry a tiny model plane motor + generator to charge the battery. Plus if TRICAR did breakdown, being homemade like bolted Meccano, it\u2019s easy to fix or lift into a small van. To charge the 50 AH gel lead or Lithium battery - unlike other EV batteries costing $5000 - needs only a home 46 w solar panel, if not on home mains. Also for quick home charge, simply switch batteries. Anyway why not have 2 dirt-cheap TRiCARS? Incredibly, when you legally Hitchhike in Fiji, all private & public vehicles including taxis can charge up to no more than the cheap buses for most anywhere at any time - unless you call for a taxi, else pick it up at the rank - about $1 which is massively emission & crowd avoiding! We were doing this as an experiment at a TasmanianCollege in 1975. Of course here they would probably insist on a police good conduct card here. But to see vastly less traffic, a taxi making more than usual single fare & private cars or trucks stuffed with 6 passengers is amazing any time day or night & anywhere is a miracle! Such effect if it became universal would be enormous. ",

            "answer_text": "Wait for the vehicles to be released in the market for consumers to buy, and then experience the \u2018new\u2019 technology. Each automotive company will have dedicated R&D teams working on technologies that are intended for commercial use 5 to 6 years from now, at any given time since the technology has to last the product life cycle. Off all the technology being researched for automotive purpose, probably only around 10% will become of widespread use and most often these technologies aren\u2019t too mysterious. The electric vehicle existed well before vehicles with combustion engine came into place which was more than 100 years ago, but only recently has it become popular mainly due to Tesla. Google should always help if you are looking out for articles purely for the intent of feel-good factor of the knowledge of \u2018new\u2019 technologies. Please excuse me if I come across a little crass, its just blunt honesty. ",

This is the thing in buzz now.. and it's gonna be launched soon as we can see it's development is going good everyday. In Dubai as I saw it somewhere they are going to use private choppers as the new age cabs in their city. Another thing is TESLA this is the company or can call it a legend is now up for building an super car which is battery driven. It's upto my knowledge. I must say we can always expect new things happen and at this point of time inventions may happen over night. So nothing can be predicted. ",
