            "answer_text": "Vehicles made before mid September 2014 don\u2019t have autopilot. Ones made after that have the capability, but when the current hardware was introduced in late 2016, the hardware became much more capable. The software in cars with the original autopilot hardware has improved dramatically over the years and continues to improve. However, it\u2019s unlikely to receive any additional features. It works well for what it does, but by early 2017, the version that runs on the newer hardware started pulling ahead. It wasn\u2019t until 2018 that the new hardware started making the transition from merely tracking and following lane lines from the front camera to a system that uses a neural network to track input from eight cameras that surround the car. That resulted in a dramatic improvement in the car\u2019s ability to track everything else on the road. While the first generation of hardware supports automatic lane changes, that means that after the driver confirms that it\u2019s safe to do so and uses the turn signal, the car will move from one lane to another. It will refuse to do so if there\u2019s a car in the blind spot, but if there\u2019s a car in the next lane that\u2019s far away and traveling at a high speed, only the driver would be able to determine that a lane change would not be safe. With the newer hardware, lane changes are truly automated. The car has an excellent ability to track surrounding objects, and the only problem I have currently is that the car is too overcautious. For example, if I want to change from lane one to lane two, there is plenty of room, but when I am 1/3 into the new lane, a car from lane 3 changes lanes and zooms up behind me, the Tesla will abort the lane change and assume that the car behind is a threat. A human driver would recognize that while the other driver might be an ass, the driver is well aware of what\u2019s in front and isn\u2019t about to have an accident. Over time, the current hardware version will act more and more like human drivers. Since it\u2019s likely that drivers take over in this situation, Tesla\u2019s computers become aware of situations in which the car predicted one thing, but drivers commonly chose to do something else, which turned out to be safe. The current hardware is capable of full self driving, although it needs a free upgrade to do so. However, that\u2019s different software from Autopilot. Many people confuse the two, but Autopilot is designed to assist a driver, not replace one. Autopilot in future releases on current hardware might be able to do some things in a fully automated way, such as freeway driving, and not need driver intervention. But it won\u2019t follow the route given by the navigator, except for changing freeways and taking freeway exits, where the driver takes over. That could be the case for enhanced Autopilot, but not standard Autopilot. It\u2019s likely that drivers will still have to pay full attention since the car would not be able to handle the entire route and it\u2019s unquestionable that the driver would need to take over at some point.

            "answer_text": "Nearly all Tesla vehicles with Autopilot are equipped with essentially the same exterior sensors and are running essentially the same Autopilot system software. All Tesla vehicles receive free regular system software updates via WiFi or 4GLTE cellular Internet connections. No other automaker has an online software update program or capability - vehicles must be physically taken to a dealership for service. All Tesla vehicles manufactured after October 2016 are equipped with Autopilot Hardware 2 or equivalent exterior sensors. That includes all Tesla Model X and Tesla Model 3 vehicles, and most Tesla Model S vehicles. These vehicles all have a forward-looking radar, 8 HD color video cameras and 12 bumper-mounted 26-foot ultrasonic sensors. Autopilot software for Hardware 2 vehicles was released in February 2017. It included traffic-aware cruise control and autosteer on divided highways. The Autopilot and system software in these and newer Tesla vehicles continues to be refined, enhanced and updated regularly. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla_Autopilot Tesla Model S vehicles manufactured between October 9, 2014 and the end of October 2016 could be equipped with Autopilot Hardware 1 sensors and software by MobilEye. They were limited to a single forward-looking monochrome video camera, a forward-looking radar and 12 bumper-mounted 16-foot ultrasonic sensors. There\u2019s a lack of clarity about which specific software features actually constitute Tesla \u201cAutopilot\u201d and \u201cEnhanced Autopilot\u201d. The latter was discontinued as an option package last November 2018; in its place, Tesla now offers a basic \u201cAutopilot\u201d option and rolled more advanced features into their expanded \u201cFull Self-Driving\u201d option package. Some features have become part of the automatic active safety system included with every Tesla vehicle, and even that system is undergoing constant refinement and enhancement.
