            "answer_text": "Originally, I wasn\u2019t thinking of answering this question because the best answer, the most accurate answer is \u201cit all depends.\u201d And that\u2019s not really an answer, is it? But it all depends on what type of music you\u2019re talking about, doesn\u2019t it? If you\u2019re talking about classic rock and roll, the guitar is very important. On the other hand, if you\u2019re talking about Bach\u2019s harpsichord etudes, it\u2019s not important at all. So, the answer really depends on what type of music you\u2019re talking about. Once you know that, you\u2019ll almost automatically know what the importance of the guitar is. ",
