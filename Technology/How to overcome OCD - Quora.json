            "answer_text": "I don\u2019t know if anyone can every actually get rid of OCD, because OCD is just a way of describing how your brain functions. I feel like I have mine under control. That doesn\u2019t mean that it doesn\u2019t occasionally intrude on my life, but it doesn\u2019t control my life or prevent me from doing the things I want to do or the things I need to do. I\u2019ve learned to accept it as part of what makes me me. I truly believe that coming to terms with your diagnosis and accepting it as part of yourself and what makes you unique is a big part of learning to live with condition in a positive way and to controlling it. I take 2 medications prescribed by my psychiatrist daily that regulate my anxiety and my OCD. If it weren\u2019t for these medications, my neurochemistry would be such a mess that no amount of \u201cwill power\u201d would enable me to have mastery over my symptoms. With my brain in balance, I can function and I can tell when OCD is trying to rear its ugly head and I can cut it off. I also have medication to help me sleep when I am having an episode of insomnia, which is something many people with anxiety disorders (OCD is an anxiety disorder) experience. I don\u2019t have to take it all the time, just when I am having trouble sleeping. This helps because not getting enough sleep exacerbates anxiety disorders. I also have a prescription for a medication that I can take if I feel a panic attack coming on that I\u2019m not going to be able to stop via mindfulness and meditation. Over the years I\u2019ve trained myself to be able to stop or prevent most of my panic attacks, but occasionally I still need that little pill. I find mindfulness and meditation to be two of the most helpful nonpharmacologics in dealing with anxiety and depression. There are many books, websites, and YouTube videos that you can use to help with these. Therapy is also a big help. And its something you can go back to whenever you need it, even just to help through a rough patch. The trick is finding the right therapist for you. If you meet with someone and you don\u2019t feel comfortable with them or it\u2019s just not the right fit, don\u2019t give up on therapy entirely. There are plenty of other therapists. Keep trying until you find the one that is right for you. I find that certain activities have also benefited me. I have always found coloring to be extremely soothing and calming and coloring has now been discovered by the larger society, so there are lots and lots of great coloring books out there that aren\u2019t just for little kids. If I am feeling anxious, I\u2019ll put on some soothing music and get out a coloring book (I have a huge collection) and some colored pencils and after about 20\u201330 minutes I feel my anxiety melt away. I find journaling/writing to be helpful as well. Just writing out my thoughts and feelings about a situation can help me because then I no longer have all of that swirling around in my head. Another thing that I find helpful is using a Bullet Journal to keep myself organized. I always found making lists to be helpful because then I didn\u2019t have the things I needed to do on a repeat loop, but the Bullet Journal for me is an improvement on just having loose papers of lists to keep track of. You don\u2019t have to make it all artistic and pretty and have a ton of \u201cspreads\u201d like you see on YouTube and Instagram. If you go to the Bullet Journal website, the guy who invented the system, Ryder Carroll, explains the basics of it and you can adapt it from there to best meet your needs. Regular exercise and eating a healthy balanced diet are the two areas that I know I personally need to work on that I know are scientifically proven to have mental health benefits, not just physical benefits. I\u2019m a lot better about the diet now than I was when I was younger. I\u2019ve had some personal health problems unrelated to the OCD that have impacted my ability to commit to a regular exercise regime, but now that my health is beginning to improve, it\u2019s one area of my life that I am determined to improve. Even taking a simple walk outside every day has immense benefits. It doesn\u2019t have to be anything complicated or expensive. I have several other hobbies that I find that if I engage in them regularly, my mental health state is much better than if I don\u2019t do them. Anything that brings you peace and joy is a beneficial hobby. Anything that stresses you out or increases your anxiety is not. Finally, having the support and understanding of your significant other, family, and friends is extremely important. My husband knows exactly what to do if I am having a panic attack to help me get through it. He knows what my triggers are and does his best to help shield me from them and when that isn\u2019t possible how to mitigate their effects as much as possible and to support me through dealing with them. He takes on certain things that my anxiety and OCD make if very difficult for me to do (having to make phone calls is very difficult for me, so he handles most of our appointment making and dealing with issues over the phone). He encourages me to do as much self care as I need and is understanding about my need to sometimes just have some quiet time all alone to \u201crecharge.\u201d I cannot emphasize enough how important having your SO in your corner supporting you is. I\u2019ve had SO\u2019s in the past that made my anxiety and panic and OCD worse and I got very mentally unwell as a result. Over the years I\u2019ve learned to cut people out of my life if they are someone who is always doing things that make my mental health worse. I hope you find this helpful. Best of wishes to you on your journey. I hope you find the success and peace that you are looking for. ",

            "answer_text": "From my own personal experience, OCD can be managed but not cured. My first major OCD episode came when I was 18 and caused tremendous anxiety and was very debilitating to the point where I\u2019d only get out of bed to go to the bathroom or to eat. At that point I had never even heard of OCD and had no idea that I had this disorder. Looking back I realize that it\u2019s actually been there my entire life in one form or abother, although I never had a major episode until I was 18. Luckily I had a good support system around me and was able to get treatment that same year. The treatment taught how to manage my obsessions so that they never reach the point of becoming debilitating. I was on antidepressants for 5 years, however I\u2019ve now been off medication for 7 years and don\u2019t plan on ever going back on them. Bottom line: I can\u2019t stop my brain from coming up with new obsessions - apparently my amygdala is a creative genius. But I can control how I react to the obsessions. If I start checking/looking for reassurance/freaking out/etc, it adds fuel to the fire and makes it worse. If I accept the risk of whatever new thing my brain has decided to obsess about then it tends to eventually go away. What I\u2019ve found is that during periods of heightened stress the OCD tends to sneak up on me, often with a new obsession. It would typically be the major topic of my thoughts for a few days/weeks until I suddenly remember that I have OCD and that this is most likely that f**ker acting up again. And then I default back to my management tools that I learned 12 years ago. I\u2019m also constantly learning new aspects of my OCD and how to handle it better. There will always be some minor irrational thing that I\u2019m worried about, but it only takes up about 5% of my thoughts vs 80% of my thoughts when I had my first major episode. I will occasionally have days where it is like that, but I quickly snap out of it because I learned how to do that. My fiancee doesn\u2019t have OCD and I\u2019d say experiences even less anxiety than the average person. Being with her has opened my eyes to just how much of my life is affected by anxiety and OCD. Things that would cause me to go into obsession-mode just bounces off of her. It made me realize that I still have some work to do and that this is just a part of me that will never go away completely. Spending so much time with someone whi doesn\u2019t have to deal with this has helped me get a much better handle on my OCD than ever before. All that said, I\u2019ve accepted that having OCD is just part of who I am. And I am also completely fine with it, because as long as I continue to manage my OCD it comes with a some huge benefits: My brain approaches things differently. Having a massive sh*t-hits-the-fan detector means that I don\u2019t miss small important detailsI am hyper-aware of small flaws in my life/surroundings which drives me to constant self-improvement. This is extremely beneficial as long as I keep this limited to a healthy levelBecause I\u2019ve become accustomed to experiencing temporary heightened anxiety on a regular basis due to irrational fears, I\u2019ve become very good at managing anxiety. So when I get anxious due to real-world problems - the \u201cnormal\u201d kind of anxiety that most people experience - I already have the tools to deal with it and am able to effectively get a grip on it and deal with whatever\u2019s in front of me. Most people don\u2019t experience heightened anxiety that often, so when they do experience it they are more likely to go into panic mode, which rarely solves anything.So to summarize, I don\u2019t think you can ever be cured of OCD, but you can absolutely have power over your OCD. As long as you learn to accept the uncertainty of whatever you\u2019re obsessing about you\u2019ll reach a point where it never becomes debilitating and you eventually just reap the benefits of being a type A personality.
