            "answer_text": "Your question is too vague to reply but i will try my best . It would definetly depend upon the end user ,how he/she engross it. PC (informly indicate Microsoft Windows):- For a gamer or person belonging from low,medium income group .i will highly recommend to get a PC which will certainly do the daily job . Pros:- A very high range of hw support.(High Weightage)Cheap and affordable.More Users.Better UI and sophisticated UX( I think so bcoz Apple just boast about there mac OS (Sierra and after High-Sierra,they only introduced apfs as default) but endid Windows wins at various instance.)Cheap and Plethora of Free Apps (not available under mac OS ,most of the softwares available at Apple store worth much little than they actually demand.Cons:- Nothing comes across my mind against execept a negligible ones,that can be compromised like better customer support and highly professional audio /video editing softwares and linux power of binaries. In short .I find Mac a trash ,which has changed unix to a professional OS with high capital investment and advertisement.(very few utility apps are available from other than Apple that can be worth its price.

            "answer_text": "Ok. An architect. A pro. Let\u2019s assume price is no object, not if it helps your productivity. If you REALLY want an all-in-one, then the 2 things making the most noise right now are the Surface Studio and the new iMac. If you\u2019re an Apple lover and think the pen/touchscreen is a useless gimmick because Apple hasn\u2019t done one, buy the iMac. If you are a PC user and think the touchscreen is a gimmick, and you can live without the AIO form\u2026 buy a top-end gaming tower. It will run all your software with power to spare. You don\u2019t really need the GPU, but it won\u2019t hurt you - and you never know, you might play a game now and then. If you love the touch-screen, buy a good gaming tower, and add a Wacom Pen Display The Surface Studio? I love the concept. It\u2019s an undeniably sexy piece of engineering, and a huge step forward for MS\u2026 but it\u2019s more than a little underpowered for smooth use of Autocad, 3ds max, photoshop\u2026.etc. If you really want one, (they really ARE cool) I\u2019d strongly suggest waiting for the 2nd gen.
