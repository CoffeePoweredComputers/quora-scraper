            "answer_text": "Yes. Tesla\u2019s Free Energy tower was never a generator that could make energy out of nothing. That's just impossible. In reality it was a massive, very inefficient, wireless charger. Tesla wanted energy to be free the same way using public roads is free, paid for by the taxpayer and distributed to anyone with a receiver free of charge. Of course that never worked out, partly because utility companies took the role of energy providers and they wanted customers to pay for their product, and partly because Tesla\u2019s energy transmission tower was just extremely inefficient and transmitting energy, and partly because there was no way to control who was actually getting the energy. Well, today there's finally a few places where you can get free energy, and they're even named after Tesla. Of course that's only for those who bought a luxury electric car from a certain brand with the free unlimited supercharging option\u2026. ",
