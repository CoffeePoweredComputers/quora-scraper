            "answer_text": "The Market dynamics in smartphones has changed in few years and what Indian consumer is asking today is good quality phones, internal circuitry like processors, RAM etc. and clean OS. Problem with Micromax is that they stuck with Mediatek which did not go well with the consumers & most of the models brought out by company were rebranded phones from China. Now, the way to revival for Micromax or any other Indian mobile phone assemblers (not manufacturers) as most of them are ready made in China and only rebranded will be invest on R&D, work on new designs and bring in new processors at value priced like Pocophone to beat the competition. Thanks & upvote if helpful. ",
