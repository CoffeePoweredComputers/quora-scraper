            "answer_text": "Golden rule: Quick top-ups are better than the long haul  Phones these days have Lithium-polymer batteries (Li-po) which are not as problematic as Li-ion batteries of the older generation smartphones. So plugging in overnight, for a long duration etc won\u2019t harm them much. So the bottomline is, Charge your phone once in the morning to 90%. Use it through the day until it comes down to 20%. Beyond this you can plug it to charge whenever needed, and until you need your phone. Nothing will happen if you quickly top up your phone with a little charge everytime you need it. Afterall, all phones can give you a day\u2019s power in half an hour these days (Yes i borrowed the line) ",

            "answer_text": "There must be over ten similar questions with detailed answers on Quora, but a quick answer is the more frequently you do shallow charges, the better for your battery as opposed to long deep charging. The reason is there is less heat build-up during short charges. Heat degrades the Li-ion chemistry more than other reasons, in general. I keep my cell phone and laptop plugged in as often as possible. The batteries are always in good shape after 3-years when I upgrade to another model. The BMS in any device using Li-ion cells will stop charging at around 90\u201395% full and stop discharging at around 5% from the bottom to try to maximize service life. ",
