            "answer_text": "Bitcoin investment can be one of the best things to do with your money if you want to increase your savings in a relatively short period of time and gain a desirable financial status / worth. Before I proceed, I would like us to have a knowledge of what Cryptocurrency is all about, so you can read more by clicking on the Wiki Link below. Cryptocurrency - Wikipedia While there is no single choice for the best way to invest in Bitcoin that is suitable for everyone, there are plenty of options available to help you make the best decisions regardless of whether you\u2019re looking to invest in it for the first time or you\u2019ve been trading Bitcoin for a long time. Without wasting much of your time, below is what i consider to be the best option if you are looking to invest in Cryptocurrency; The Halving of Bitcoin has already arrived on 12, May 2020, and hundreds of people are already benefiting from The BITCOIN HALVENING COUNTER-BALANCE PROGRAM (BHCP) A historic supply shock for bitcoin will occur at the very moment different governments continues to inject trillions of dollars into the fiat system which could make the demand explode as the year progresses Sure, it could pump to $20,000, but in the short term (3 months), I see $15,000 much more likely. It would just be weird, if we were never to see $15,000 for Bitcoin again. That being said, I see a lot of potential for altcoins in the short term, since altcoins are still pretty much at the same price as when Bitcoin was around $4,000. Bitcoin is currently a wild ride for investors in the BHCP group currently on the atomic benefit referral program, In reality, in recent investment opportunities I was able to share with my investment community, most of my members made a 30% ROI this month alone on investment opportunities that usually pay 20 percent. If you've been interacting with a Bitcoin enthusiast at any time, you've definitely been told (maybe several times) that moments like that are what the cryptocurrency was designed for. Some of its most passionate supporters have argued that because the digital asset is \"uncorrelated\" to conventional assets such as bonds, it is a \"safe haven\" from market declines such as those we are experiencing. By the way, if you want to be part of the BHCP Investors group and you need investment guidance and plans, and you if you currently have a crypto portfolio exceeding 3k send me a direct message on my telegram chat app [@y0ujjin] Or Email InspiredEvolutionInvestment@protonmailcom Investing in Bitcoin today is investing in the future. Bitcoin is the future. What would your fate be after the pandemic's over? How do you start all over again? But when you invest now in bitcoin and exchange wisely, even after the entire pandemic scenario is over, you'll have plenty to show for that. Bitcoin is the future of investing today. ",

First of all, BTC is the most valuable cryptocurrency in the crypto market. The highest price of BTC has been to 14,000 dollars in 2017. But because of the bull market, the price of BTC once fell into 3300 dollars. Sometimes maybe you have such concern, you never know what time is the best time to invest in BTC for profits. Regular investment can help you solve this problem. How to do regular investment: chose an amount of BTC you want to invest for each time.chose which time you decide to invest.just do these two step regularly, and when you get your ideal income, you can sell and do regular investment again.Today from CoinNess news, BTC has been to $6084.
