            "answer_text": "Yes, of course. It\u2019s almost too late. As time passes very quickly with webs connections, there will all too soon become only two types of journalism stories available in any country on any web. 1) Totally unreliable and often malicious false news stories written with the slick expertise and style of \u201cestablished\u201d media. These outlets masquerade as \u201csatire\u201d but they are really a cynical and brilliant psychological way to sow illusion, delusion, and confusion among targets segments of the population over whom the backers of this \u201cpost-truth\u201d operation wish to recruit and control. By the way, the Russians are grand-masters at this kind of deception. 2) A limited number of supposedly independent publishers of deliberately edited and fact-checked \u201cnews\u201d narratives may be widely \u201ctrusted\u201d for not publishing falsehoods, and for calling out falsehoods, as well as for an absence of covert opinion by the writers or the editors. Some of these outfits may be financed by very rich people who can withstand downturns and fight off brutal retaliation by those who are not fond of being seen as they are. Journalists for such media will be disrespectfully treated and even ridiculed by big shots, who will turn their little shots against reporters and try to intimidate them, probably even jail them. If there occurs a terrible calamity, like the beginning of a war on our lands, to which media will you turn to get your information, provided there is any media still operating? The New York Times? Or a \u201csatirical\u201d replica of the Times that contains stories that are whole cloth lies and distortions? The AP? Ot the fake AP? ABC News or the fake ABC News. Twitter can be and will be commanded and controlled by paid and trained \u201chackers\u201d who inject pre-written lies prepared by expert psychological warfare teams to stir dissent and mistrust of the President and the entire Federal structure, or anyone else they care to damage. The internet for the public in the post-truth era, as anyone who has eyes can see, is increasingly riddled with paid-for lies. Members of the same family with different media feeds can see the world in an entirely different way, and both will believe they have been informed by \u201cthe facts.\u201d ",

            "answer_text": "There has always been such a separation in Moser U.S. news organizations. If anything, it's more recent developments live the 24-hour news cycle, the \"all news\" channel and the Internet that have blurred it. There was a time when commentary, columnists and their view, opinion, and op-ed were all clearly labeled. We need to find a way to demarcate those lines clearly in the Internet age. ",
