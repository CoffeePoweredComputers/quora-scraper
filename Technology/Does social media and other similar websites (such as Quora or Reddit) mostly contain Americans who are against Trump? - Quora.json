            "answer_text": "Nope - it\u2019s just that the Pro-Trump section is pre-dominantly not that good at these things. Quora and Reddit tend to be populated with more educated and more challenging crowd. It\u2019s not that easy to push narratives that have no factual basis and not face significant resistance from the crowd. Most of the pro-Trump comments to my posts end up with name calling or other types of insults as opposed to fact based push-backs and challenging counter-arguments. There is a good number of conservatives on this platform whom I respect a lot - difference in opinion and world-view has nothing to do with this. And I\u2019m glad to see that the vast majority of those are not in the Trump cult-wagon. Therefore when some pro-trumper or a content-farm contract poster posts some weird stuff it either gets reported or gets washed down with facts and reality and simply dissipates away. Twitter and Facebook, where you can much easily create echo-chambers is where you will find the vast majority of pro-Trump cultivists and cult-goers congregating. The better educated one is (in science, history, philosophy and economics) the more one will steer away from that crowd and become a liberal person. (I\u2019m putting all the business executives who have nothing to do with being conservative and everything to do with being anti-regulation and do whatever they please therefore vote GOP the big-government, big-spending, big-taxcuts party\u2026 yeah, you heard right. Go check the numbers and see which party actually made the government bigger and the spending more by simply doing ignoreconomics (trademark pending, I coined it, mine!)   The better educated one is, the more liberal that individual is. There\u2019s a reason why conservatives don\u2019t like higher education.  So, that\u2019s why. Quora and Reddit have more well-educated and smart users. Facebook and Twitter has the rest\u2026 ",

            "answer_text": "Generally yes, most people aren\u2019t open about their politics, most republicans aren\u2019t open about their politics (~3/4 of them) and even fewer Trump supporters are open about it. Then you have the overall stat that most social media sites are left biased in user base (to nearly double on Twitter for example) Then you have left bias in organisation. ect. In short, old people tend not to use social media as much as young people and men don\u2019t use it as much as women, which creates a bias towards left wing politics by coincidence, which is only compounded with rules that tend to favor the left wing with \u201cmisgendering\u201d rules that affect the terms republicans use to create their arguments or the outright censorship done by platforms such as Facebook, youtube and Twitter as it has been revealed through leaks and court cases, with Facebook openly admitting it at one point. Take me for example, I am an outspoken Trump supporter but I work, I have duties, I have hobbies and I come on here once or twice a day, while a more left wing student who has yet to assume those responsibilities simply has that much more time to spend on the platform, influencing it\u2019s content more than I can.
