To be honest, if you do not know what is required to start a call center, you will most likely fail or get ripped off by fraudsters and scammers. I have worked at three call centers. The first was a single location, the other two were large multi center companies that were spread around the globe. If you want to operate a call center, you need: connectionsbusiness connections so you will have clientsphysical connections as in data, phone, data center, etc.capital - lots of capitalcontracts so you will have calls to answerlawyers to make sure every contract is properly written and that the business is run legally including having non disclosure agreements if necessarysecurity for the buildingbackup power systemsredundant network, telephone, internet, and data centerstrainers to train your employees for the contracts you sign with clientsthe right partners and managers to operate a call centeretc.",

            "answer_text": "First of all, plan on real things, not like quick rich scheme, no risks etc.. If you planning call center business, with thoughts of , easy returns, no risks , typing jobs, support etc.. then do not start, you sure get scammed if do. As its never easy to survive in any new business, with proper guidance and support, hard work , consistency you can only do it. Risks always there, in Call center, if you can arrange staff who can give you steady performance, then you can earn good profits. Otherwise, vice versa. You must choose correct category to start operations, like above mentioned, non voice category, inbound process are looks good, but its like too good to be true kind of .. Non voice campaigns already outdated from market. companies are not fool to waste money on such simple tasks in this digital world. and Inbound process arent outsourced in open market. you are just a start up, so unless you develop yourself as a center, no one gives you a chance in such. Note, your infra, computers are not a company.. look around, there are tons available with only infra. No offense. Being a start up , Outbound is only option , like or not , it is only. Doing sales, lead generation, for various products and services in UK or USA or Canada market. Earn good commission on performance. Investment could be approx. 3lac to 4 lac for databases, 10k for dialer crm, 1lac to 1.5 lac for VoIP . with good team, you can expect good profits. but to achieve such, you must do necessary changes in team time to time.. such as replace those who are not able to perform. consistency etc. There is not particular place, website or shopping site for such projects , not even a fix mathematical formula , you get business with reference or network known to you . I know one of genuine client from long time.. Instead of trying with consultant , i would suggest you work/talk with direct client like Mr. saleem +91 7386034574. Sure he does have long term projects in usa and uk region , more than 10 years now. Hope it helps. regards Mrs. Rutuza Deshmukh ",

Even before getting to work out the logistics, a company will have to obey the guidelines and regulations for that particular location. Once the paperwork complies with the requirements. To start a call center you will need to: Have a strategic business plan - Having objectives will allow you to shape the kind of call center you want to establish. A business plan will prepare you for potential growth and expansion. As well as this, the expenses need to be managed. Having this plan gives the company a guideline to follow to ensure sustainability. Identify the purpose of your call center - The most common being either inbound or an outbound call center. Or maybe the less popular telemarketing. Is it going to be based on sales, customer service or informative support? It may be a mixture of all of them. Choose a suitable location - There are many factors to consider. If you need multilingual employees, maybe situating the call center in a big city will give you the skilled people you need. If you are proving a local service, a smaller town will be more appropriate. The distance from headquarters is vital. Not only does it build brand awareness, but if there is a problem, it makes it easier to help solve the situation. There are many other factors, such as the budget that needs to be considered. As experts say the three most important things in marketing are Location, Location, Location.

You'll also need a phone system, CRM software and a stable internet connection. All tools need to be durable and reliable. A slow call center will quickly fail; quality is a must. Good luck! ",

            "answer_text": "The call center business in India has been expanded for the last few years. There are two types of Call centers in India: Inbound Call Centers ( A Place where business calls are received from the prospective customers)Outbound Call Centers (A Place where business calls are made to the prospective customers)Call centers play a vital role in a company. Not only a sales perspective but also it helps companies to establish their customer relationship. If you want to start your Call center, Following steps will help you to start your own: 1. First of all, You need to have a business process so that you can decide which call center you have to setup. Like if you are running a third-party business, You will be required to start an outbound call center process, but if you're some kind of manufacturing or customer service, You will need an inbound process. Likewise, if your business is to process paperwork, Non-voice/data processing call center will be required to be set up here. 2. To start a call center, first, you have to prepare the requirements such as computer systems, Vonage, Toll-free numbers, etc. If your business process is service-based and you want your customers to directly pay through your sales team, the Payment gateway will be required there. 3. Prepare an RFI and RFP. Get a technical team to install the systems in place. Please identify the most feasible phones, lines, and other systems as this will be an irreversible capital investment. Cisco and Avayas are the widest phones in India. Desktops may be average. Try having a good solid NOC and IT Infrastructure team. Their main function will be to ensure 100% up time of links and servers at ALL TIMES. We do not want instances of applications going down and calls being queued up with no-one to help the customers out. 4. Prepare the necessary policies and procedures in your workplace. Make sure you've listed every process like call flows, SOPs, inter-Intra department communication channels, etc. You should have a robust, simple, and easy-to-follow process laid down for your customers. 5. If you're into the inbound process, prepare a proper estimate for the amount of inbound traffic you're expecting. Hire workforce staff first and then go to hire operational staff. These steps are just an overview. If you want an experienced consultant for starting your call center, You can contact through this phone number +91-9821399320. ",

            "answer_text": "It really depends on the area you focus on, whether you want to establish a smaller or bigger call center, if your call center should be placed in one location or your employees will work remotely. As I don't have this information, my suggestions will be a little bit more general.  First of all, it is important to ask the following questions: Job description and tasks - Do I really need the call center? What tasks do I have for them? Is it enough of work or can I delegate it to another department in my business?Budget - What is my budget for call center? Is it enough for all the salaries? What will be my costs connected to call center - for equipment needed or call center software + call credit?Employees - Where can I find the right people? How will I train them to provide excellent service? What structure do I want to have in my call center?Once you go through these questions, these are the most important steps: #1 Find the right people and educate them continuously & give them regular feedback #2 Decide whether you want to have an on-premise office or run a virtual call center (call agents are working from different locations). #3 Choose the right call center software based on your budget #4 Buy equipment needed - PCs, hardware phones or headphones, etc. I perceive crucial to choose the right call center software I prefer the ones which are cloud-based, as they provide you with much bigger flexibility, your employees can work from any location and you can always access your call center data from anywhere. So here are a few suggestions on how to choose the right call center software: Make initial research of the best call center providers on the market - you can use for those different directories like G2crowd, Capterra or GetApp. These are top provides on the market in my opinion: CloudTalk (Capterra rating - 4.8/5) - $15/per month/per user RingCentral (Capterra rating - 4.2/5) - Contact vendor JustCall (Capterra rating - 4.1/5) - $25/user/month Aircall (Capterra rating - 4.2/5) - $25/user/month (min 3 users) 2. Set your priorities and expectation from the right call center software Have a look at the features you\u2019ve been using most frequently. Figure out what are the most important ones for your team and treat these as a priority. 3. Test the solution Most software providers offer free trial periods, usually for more or less two weeks. This way, you can see if the app works smoothly, which features are included and whether you actually enjoy using it. ",

            "answer_text": "Since you have decided what kind of business you want to run, then, you should run a feasibility study to determine if it will make you any money and which niche will you be targeting. Then, you need to build your business plan which will include your marketing and digital plans. Here is what I tell my clients: Plan what you want to do and then do it. First pick something that you would like to sell. It can be anything to start. Keep it legal, socially acceptable, and fun for you. Then run a feasibility study on it. You can get help for free online. If your study says don\u2019t do it, then don\u2019t do it, find something else. Repeat. When you find something that appears to have a demand, then put together your business plan. So, you want to start a business, any business, anywhere. Or, you want to introduce a new marketing channel. Or, you want to modify your marketing plan Start by deciding what business you want to conduct. Use a feasibility study to help do this. Then create a business plan that contains your marketing plan which in turn has your web presence plan. You will be required to determine the effectiveness of your plan as you put it together. Let me quote Benjamin Franklin: \u201cBy failing to prepare, you are preparing to fail.\u201d Once you have the business plan completed, you will have a road map for where you want to go and the milestones along the way so that you can measure your progress and to make sure that you stay on course. Your business plan will have the results of your research and budgeting. Your research phase will help you find out what rules you will need to follow in whatever geographic area that you want to headquarter. Budgeting is one of the least prepared for part of your plan, so look at it hard. You really need to make sure that you cover your resources and marketing efforts thoroughly. And, take a hard look at crisis management as well. If you don\u2019t have a clue on how to build the business plan, I suggest you hire a business consultant. With their help you will get a marketing consultant and me (maybe) as your web presence consultant. You don\u2019t have to hire anybody if you are inclined to do it yourself. Search online for business plans. You\u2019ll get all sorts of templates and some help on how and why to use them. I recommend Sean Castrina, he has outlined a plan that you can download for free. I\u2019d like to quote Sean Castrina here: \u201cThe mere exercise and discipline required to write a business plan separates those who think they want to be an entrepreneur from those who will be an entrepreneur.\u201d ",

Either way, there are a few universal minimum basic fundamentals: Facility: Unless your going to use a virtual workforce or work at home model, you\u2019re going to need space. You\u2019ll want to be strategic in site selection and balance cost against being located close to your ideal workforce demographic and accessibility. People: You\u2019ll need to create an ideal employee profile of what skills are needed, and a plan for recruitment and training of staff and leadership personnel. Technology/Infrastructure: You\u2019ll want workstations and high bandwidth network capabilities along with an ACD platform to support contact management. You\u2019ll need a CRM system to manage transactions for your customer base. Process: You\u2019ll need to have mapped out your contact flow, recommended scripts or verbiage, call handling procedures as well as department policies. You\u2019ll also want to have goals and expectations communicated well along with roles and responsibilities. In addition you\u2019ll need to be prepared to handle forecasting, scheduling, reporting, along with quality assurance to ensure optimal performance management.

Because you are not searching for real bpo business. or real call center projects. For example.. You arranged few computers , some furniture, few ac, cabin , chairs etc . Now you think your CALL CENTER office is ready to start. Search for projects.. What type projects exactly\u2026 most of time, you searching for data entry, copy paste, form filling, or something easy where you get assured billing for hitting keyboard keys. When your business plan is something like this , why not, you get only scammers in places. In reality, you see many big mnc\u2019s doing something easy jobs and earning in crores. wake up dear..

Unless your role is not productive , forget you get any genuine project. AT first place, you need to understand one thing very clear , whatever projects you gonna get, if its easy money for simple tasks, sure scam.

Result.. fall for any scam offer, company close in next 2 or 3 months. and blame all bpo industry, all are scams in such. etc.. Dude, its you, who invited them. Instead, be realistic, work on lead generation, thats only entry for you as fresher , company start ups no matter what is your personal work experience in mncs.. when you start your own business, its fresh start only. Be prepare to do investments, not to purchase projects.. never do that. To purchase quality data sets, to hire quality staff..

Data sets always differs with project to project. do not be overconfident you can arrange everything.. follow guidance, its for your own good. Never think, you have all connections, if you did, you wouldnt be searching for projects , you doing that means those expert resources of yours are not up to mark and lac of actual business skills. NO OFFENSE. with all these negative, just think and remove it from your thought, plans and start fresh.

You may start with a Call Agent who would work for a limited time until you are solvent enough to begin running shift, while you focus on pitching the need for your service to potential customers. It sure would take some time to build believers in your services, especially in Nigeria as most businesses do not focus resources in this critical unit of their business. Not forgetting, you will require the basic gadgets to smartly receive and make calls to potential and existing customers. Note that your service is essentially to provide Third-party sales support to an audience professionally. ",
