            "answer_text": "It might not be a surprise that this question has not been answered quickly. Who would claim to have found most plausible construction technique for building the Egyptian pyramids? Certainly not me. I will present here my own theory of pyramid building using ancient escalators, elevators, travelators and skylight divider. My theory does not support the widely accepted assumption of ramp use. So if you think that ramps are the most plausible building technique for pyramids then you can skip the rest of my answer. Based on my analysis, my theoretical escalators and elevators would have been possible thanks to anti-gravity pulling mechanism (weight vs. counterweight) that was materialized by the common descending passages of many pyramids. The common descending passages as a sliding slopes for skewers of counterweight stone disks may be plausible (I do not claim the most plausible) if one looks carefully how they were made, how they were consistently similar in design, high precision. I have already detailed them in other Quora answers so I won\u2019t repeat them here. There is also another major element of my theory: The skylight divider. This element is also plausible based on the artifacts that I could find. Here is a sketch that I made to show how a \u201cSkylight divider\u201d looks like:  So what is the \u201cSkylight divider\u201d for? I have discovered that the \u201cSkylight divider\u201d would have been the best way to build the pyramids \u201dfrom the inside out\u201d as the Greek historian Herodotus had reported based on accounts of ancient Egyptian priests. This is why I believe that the \u201cSkylight divider\u201d is quite plausible because it seems to fit in Greek historian Herodotus\u2019 account on two major points: The pyramid was built from the inside out and from the top down. Herodotus said that the ancient Egyptian priests reported to him these two fundamental features of the pyramid building of their ancestors. The \u201cSkylight divider\u201d would have allowed the ancient Egyptian architects to bypass all the costly ramps (too long to explain all the drawbacks of ramps). Based on my study, the \u201cSkylight divider\u201dis a giant vertical gap (skylight) that starts to appear once the building of the base of the pyramid (the part that hosts the so-called descending passage) is done. The skylight divider cuts the pyramid into two building sections at the left and the right of the mouth of the descending passage. These two building sections rise independently from the skylight divider therefore the stone block laying keeps raising the stone courses. The \u201cSkylight divider\u201d is where the \u201cescalators\u201d are set up by hooking to the stone courses step segment by step segment. The Step pyramid would be evidence of how its six step segments would have been used to set up such escalators. Each escalator could be roughly from 10 or 20 meters/yards high. Each step segment has a flat platform to receive stone blocks before they can be raised again to the next upper step segment. The step segments of the \u201cSkylight divider\u201d would be what Herodotus called \u201cabatement\u201d in his account. The vertical axis of the Skylight divider must be on the same vertical axis of the descending passage for a reason: To be in line with the axis of escalators in order to provide the fastest way to rais stone blocks up to the pyramidion level. A sketch of layout of step segments with escalators inside the \u201cskylight divider\u201d of the Red pyramid, looked from the lateral side:  The skylight divider can be made on north-south axis (axis of descending passage) and also on east-west axis to set up more escalators on four faces of the pyramid. The \u201cSkylight divider\u201d may explain why many pyramids have eight sides instead of four. In the case of the Khufu pyramid, all sophisticated structures were all built inside the same central vertical plane, and that can not be a coincidence either. These sophisticated structures like the Queen chamber, the Grand Gallery, the King chamber and even their airshafts are all located inside the \u201cSkylight divider\u201d of the pyramid. Not only that, the descending passage and the ascending passage share also this vertical plane, and that must have been for reason. This \u201cSkylight divider\u201d technique would have allowed the high skilled worker teams to be isolated inside their worksite and not be disturbed by the stone laying workers around them. For the Khufu pyramid, the two lateral building segments of the Skylight divider could be finished before the central structures were finished therefore looking from afar, it may look like the pyramid is finished at the top first then further down. This is probably what Herodotus mentioned as \u201cPyramid built from the top down\u201d based on accounts of ancient Egyptian priests. There are at least three artifacts that support the \u201cSkylight divider\u201d technique that I know: The mark of skylight divider on the Khufu pyramid (Look carefully at the two vertical parallel marks from the pyramidion down to the top of the main entrance of the pyramid):  The huge vertical and well parallel gash of the Menkaure pyramid. The demolishers would have likely looked for where to extract loose stone blocks first and could have found two vertical lines somewhere along the \u201cSkylight divider\u201d then started from there.In the complex of the Djoser pyramid, a giant rectangular pit with spiraling staircases that scrawl along the walls show that this pit would have been already a skylight divider itself and would have given the idea to build the pyramids later on with the same technque.Most temples of Ancient Egypt have the facade that reminds a pyramid in construction with the skylight divider still visible: Look carefully at the funnel shaped gap above the entrance of the facade of this ancient Egyptian temple of Horus at Edfu. If one continues to build the two left and right walls upward, at some point they will touch each other to become a face of a pyramid with a vertical gap reaching the pyramidion. Based on my assessment, this vertical gap mirrors my theoretical skylight divider of pyramids. It may not be an accident that the ancient Egyptian architects chose this architectural design over and over again to build their temples. For me, it is likely that they took it from the pyramid building technique. In other words, the facade of the ancient Egyptian temple would be a replica of pyramid in construction with the skylight divider still visible and both lateral sides of stone courses raised above the floor of the skylight divider. Let\u2019s not forget the high entrance of the temple reminds also the entrance of the descending passage of pyramid too.So to conclude, it is plausible that the Skylight divider would have been likely an invention of the ancient Egyptian architects to build their pyramid efficiently (no ramps to build and to destroy later), fast (escalators and elevators), safe (no cascade stone falling possible), cheap (no waste of stone blocks for ramps, no excess of workforce just to pull stone blocks). There are also many things about this technique in my book.
