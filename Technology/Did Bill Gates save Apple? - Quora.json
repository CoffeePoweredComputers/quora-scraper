But if you are old enough, you\u2019ll remember the dark times when Apple computer was close to bankruptcy. This was memorably captured in June of 1997 when Wired magazine ran this famous cover story: 101 Ways to Save Apple  And years later, this article was discussed quite often after Apple was returned to success - Here were some of the crazy ideas floated to keep Apple from going out of business in 1997 A number of factors rescued Apple. Steve Job returned to Apple through the acquisition of Next computer, new products were introduced like a new generation of Macintoshes, products were modernized. But one critical factor was Microsoft stepped in and invested $150M to rescue Apple (or at least Apple\u2019s stock). Microsoft also committed to continue publishing Microsoft office for the Macintosh computers. This has also been covered in many articles like August 6, 1997 -- The day Apple and Microsoft made peace. The agreement with Microsoft may have come at a time of great desperation for Apple, but it worked out quite well for the company. The investment was a stock purchase, and didn't directly put money into the hands of Apple. But, it did act to stablilize Apple's stock. At the time, the company's stock was trading at 86 cents a share adjusted for dividends and the three splits since then. It truly took off in 1999, once it became clear that Apple was truly back. More importantly, perhaps, was Gates' promise to continue delivering Microsoft Office products for the Mac going forward. Along with the stock, Apple's financial position soon stabilized, with the original iMac arriving the following year as Apple's most successful new product in years. And, any betrayal that Apple partisans felt about the embrace of Bill Gates failed to have any lingering effects. Why did Microsoft do this? Well, Microsoft was in the middle of antitrust investigation by the US government, and if Apple had failed, it would have made Microsoft\u2019s monopoly position more negative. Microsoft also had a great business selling software for Macintoshes, so perhaps Microsoft saw this as a way to preserve that market. Whatever the case, Microsoft helped keep Apple alive until they could get their new products ready. Macworld Boston 1997-The Microsoft Deal  And:  ",

            "answer_text": "Did Bill Gates save Apple? Here\u2019s the story as I remember it. Jobs left Apple in May of 1985 after a the Board of Directors removed him from Chairman of the Board. With NeXt and Pixar in his pocket he returned in 1997 as interim CEO. Apple was on its\u2019 last legs, close to running out of cash. So Steve called Bill Gates and they had a discussion that revolved around the possibility that if Apple went out of business, Microsoft might well be at risk to be investigated as a monopoly. As I understand it, Gates/Microsoft wrote Apple a LARGE check to ensure that Apple would remain in business. And with Steve back leading Apple\u2019s product design and development, the rest is history. I assume that Microsoft ended up with Stock so that proved to be a very smart investment!!! ",
