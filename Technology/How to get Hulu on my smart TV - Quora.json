            "answer_text": "Smart TV operating systems are able to connect to the internet via WiFi or ethernet cable to access online content like the Hulu app. If you own a smart TV, you don\u2019t need any other accessory to help you watch your favorite show on Hulu. Some smart TVs will come with inbuilt applications like Netflix, Hulu, and others. If your TV set doesn\u2019t have a Hulu app, simply download the app to stream online. Here\u2019s how to get Hulu to work on your smart TV: Press \u201cHome\u201d button on your remote to go to the hubSelect Apps and search \u201cHulu\u201d on the search box at the upper-right cornerFollow on-screen prompts and install the Hulu appLaunch the appSelect the \u201clog in\u201d and specify log in on this deviceEnter your credentials and press \u201cLog in\u201dChoose your preferred profile and start streamingIf you previously created your Hulu subscription using Apple TV, then you\u2019ll have to change a few tweaks and go to complete account setup before logging in to Hulu with your smart TV. I recommend you to try XOOMTV on your smart TV. This app has more shows from different streaming providers and it\u2019ll be cheaper for you to watch everything there. ",

            "answer_text": "The best way to get Hulu for your smart TV is usually to download the app from it. A lot of smart TV\u2019s will have some type of app store where you can download it. Do be aware that sometimes Hulu stops updating their app on the appstore which has happened to me personally where I could no longer play it because Hulu stopped updating their app. You can always play it on your laptop and then connect laptop with HDMI cable to your TV. Like Richard also mentioned you can use an Amazon firestick and download the Hulu app so you can watch it on your Smart TV ",
