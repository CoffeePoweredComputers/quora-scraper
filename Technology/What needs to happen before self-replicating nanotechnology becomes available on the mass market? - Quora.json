            "answer_text": "One matter of vital importance is some way of switching off their ability to reproduce. With nano-disassembly robots, there is the prospect that, if let loose without any viable reproductive inhibitor technology, they could reduce the entire earth's surface to gray slime in about two weeks. My own guess is that, like modern laboratory strains of Escherichia coli, they would have to be fatally sensitized to oxygen. That way, they could only function in artificial atmospheres. Any \"leak\" or escape would automatically terminate. For an interesting take, read \"The Assemblers of Infinity\" by Kevin J. Anderson and Doug Beason. This hugely promising technology is one of the biggest double-edged swords since the nuclear bomb. For instance, what if terrorists reverse engineered the oxygen sensitive species and \"turned off\" that feature? In the book I mentioned, they needed the high temperature plasma of a hydrogen bomb as part of their \"containment\" strategy. Unlike kitty litter, that is hardly a simple or easy-to-implement \"spill control\" agent. ",
