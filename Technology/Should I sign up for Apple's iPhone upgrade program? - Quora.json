            "answer_text": "I am not convinced. I will explain why. Take iPhone 8 64 GB for example. \u00a3699. For the sake of a simpler comparison (the actual cost of the phone minus maintenance), let\u2019s exclude cost of Apple care. iPhone upgrade program for iPhone 8 64GB would cost \u00a337.95 per month for 20 months and \u00a369 upfront payment. This includes \u00a3129 cost towards Apple care. If we deduct that cost from monthly payments, the monthly amount changes to \u00a331.5 per month with \u00a369 upfront payment. Now, if you are on the upgrade program, you will pay \u00a369 upfront and make 11 payments out of 20, before you are eligible for an upgrade to the next iPhone. Therefore the cost incurred by you after 11 months would be (11 * 31.5) + 69 = \u00a3415.5. If you subtract this from the original cost of the phone (\u00a3699), you will see that by not paying for the remaining 9 months, you are saving \u00a3283.5. So as per Apple, your iPhone 8 is worth \u00a3283.5 after a year. However, if you had paid the full amount upfront and bought the phone outright by paying \u00a3699, I am quite sure it would fetch more than \u00a3283 if you sold it online! This means more money in your pocket towards the next phone you want to purchase, should you want to upgrade. Of course, if you do not have the financial means to fork the phone cost upfront, then upgrade program makes sense. Bear in mind that you will have an entry on your credit history every year when Barclays finance cancels your previous finance contract and creates a new one for the next iPhone you will upgrade to, should you choose to upgrade to the next iPhone and stick with the upgrade program.
