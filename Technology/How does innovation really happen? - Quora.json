            "answer_text": "Wikipedia defines Innovation as the application of better solutions that meet new requirements, unarticulated needs, or existing market needs. Or put more simply, find a way deliver more value to exisiting users. Value being the benefit gained from the product or service. As always, this will come about by innovating at the 3Ps, product, people and process. IMHO, people matter most of the three. Many a successful company or organization have innovated their way in to dominance of value delivery for a given category only to not be able to repeat the feat in another category or in the face of change in their incumbent category. Why? A: Figuring out what works is messy, hard, and conflict ridden. But when you do figure out how to create an innovative product or service you want to capture how in a process, to replicate it for a consistent user experience and then to scale it to meet demand (if that is your goal). By the time you pivot from people, to product, to process you have built many reasons not to rock the boat of success. The organization gets codified and resistant to people wanting to hit the reset button. This resistance is due to that very human tendency of loss aversion. A bias which researchers have found two be twice as powerful, psychologically, as gains. That\u2019s when innovation gets stuck. Alternatively, you can maintain a cultural center of gravity valuing people over products or process even at the expense of current success. In general, innovation begins with understanding what benefit a user needs and why. From that basis of value definition, one can work backwards along the value delivery system that exists and find countless ways to do deliver better value. Often this begins with reconsidering how a product or service is created and asking \u2018what ifs?\u2019 along the way for alternative approaches and considering how that proposed change would affect the final benefit. The sky is the limit in how creative you could approach this innovation path, so I will decline to be any more specific than I have already been, other than to make a note of caution, while new technology is one way to insert alternative approaches into value delivery, its usually not enough. Consider the example of the introduction of the electric motor to the manufacturing floor. At first, it was simply an alternative power source and it had little impact to the value delivery system. Later on, when people began to innovate with the new possibilities presented by electric engines, they began to base work, not around a single power source, but around a process flow of the product through the floor with multiple power sources of smaller scale, and so this coupling of the 3Ps, finally produced the promised benefit from the new technology. As such, one must always approach innovation with a systems thinking mentality. Finally, I would argue that value proposition is a better innovation of the value premise as it adds cost to the equation for looking at innovation, where Value = Benefits - Cost. Point being, sometimes the same value delivered at less cost, or risk, is an innovation. ",

It\u2019s about creating the right environment, hiring the right people, and then getting out of their way. Here is how Google innovate, they uses designing thinking to innovate.  There five basic principles that guide every successful innovation process: Good ideas can come from anywhere.The more the ideas, the better they are in terms of value.The more diverse the source of ideas, the more superior and varied the idea quality.Better employee engagement and cross-functional collaboration spawn better ideas.The open/ hybrid innovation model yields quicker results than the closed innovation approach.You can read more about it from here: Measuring Innovation Performance - Innovation Management Resources ",
