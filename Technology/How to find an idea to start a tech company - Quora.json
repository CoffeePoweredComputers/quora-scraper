            "answer_text": "FIRST: Start a google doc or journal for ideas. In your google doc list out the following categories: Ideas - semi-fully fleshed out ideasProblems - unmet needs without a solutionDisruptive business models (e.g. subscription services)Disruptive technologies (e.g. autonomous vehicles)Trends (e.g. smart home)My personal strengths (e.g. programming)My areas of market domain expertise (e.g. students)Inspirational companiesNEXT: Spend some time brainstorming ideas every day. Don\u2019t filter out the bad ideas initially , just write down anything that comes to mind. You don\u2019t just need to think of ideas, use the other categories above as well. Brainstorming across all the prompts will help nudge you towards ideas of your own, which you can record in the idea category. CONCURRENTLY: Read this article by Paul Graham on startup ideas.Read TechCrunch everydayOnce you have a long list of ideas, you should filter that list down to 1 or a few ideas to explore further. Pick an idea that you are passionate about, is solving a real validated problem, and has a large market. You don\u2019t need to be the first person solving a problem. Google was not the first search engine and Facebook was not the first social network. If you look around in the room that you are in you will see products all around you were started and sold by companies into saturated markets. Competition is ok but you should think about how you are differentiated from the competition. ",

            "answer_text": "Currently in my 2nd start up. It really is about taking action on a idea you have. People have dozens of small ideas a week, you may not even realize its a idea. More of a \"way to improve something you are annoyed with\" For me, my 2nd start up was co-founded on a idea that appeared in my head while reading wired. My first start up gave me the confidence to act when I should when I have a good idea. It may overwhelm people to think that sure I have an idea, but how do I go about doing it?\" Well thats why you validate that idea, does it fill a market need? how so? Finding a mentor is probably the best thing you can do for yourself. When you have something you want to know, you go ask your mentor and say how can I do this or that. I was lucky enough to find those mentors during college, and I ended up dropping out to pursue the idea, and still have the full support of my old teachers. Good luck. ",
