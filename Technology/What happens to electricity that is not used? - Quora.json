            "answer_text": "Lots of good answers here! Mostly based on electricity generation from fossil fuels. Not all, certainly, but I want to focus on the answers based on traditional power generation, which is largely fossil fuels or hydroelectric generation. One thing I'm not seeing in these answers is the increasing effect of solar and wind energy production related to the posed question (What happens to electricity that is not used?). Unlike traditional power generation these are relatively unpredictable (especially wind). They give lots of power at times and none at others. And while you can turn them \u201coff\u201d in times of excess, that just means that energy is unavailable to the consumer. So what do you do with the excess solar electricity you get? It's a very good question. Every spring (late spring, May-ish) California makes a huge excess of solar power. Spring is a time (at least in California) when you're not heating or air conditioning your home (and office buildings, etc.) because the climate doesn't need you to, but it's also a time when the sun is shining at almost peak amounts. Hence the excess of solar electricity. Where does this excess go in this particular case? Simply put, they give it away\u2026(https://www.latimes.com/projects/la-fi-electricity-solar/). (I don't agree with everything that that article says, btw, but I think it's relevant to this subject.) Bottom line is that this is why energy storage is such an important part of the equation. If we can store excess energy when the sun or wind is dumping loads on us, then we can use that later when we need it. Aside from hydro, I can't think of any renewable energy that can regulate output on demand. (Nuclear not withstanding; it's clean, but not technically renewable.) Admittedly, this hasn't been a serious issue so far, because we're a very power-hungry society, but energy storage will be a very very important issue as we go forward. Batteries are the most obvious solution, but there are other options also... But that's getting off topic to the question at hand. Anyhow, I suspect strongly that this isn't the angle that people that have been responding to this question, have been considering (and honestly, that the questioner was thinking about either) and their answers have been, in my opinion, quite informative and accurate, but I thought this was an angle that was worth thinking about\u2026 ",

            "answer_text": "There is no extra electricity in the power grid. A fact that surprises many people is that when a generator is supplying power it is hard to turn. Reduce the power demand by switching off some devices, and the generator becomes much easier to turn. It makes perfect sense, of course, but it still surprises people. So, if power demand decreases, the generator would tend to speed up. But that can\u2019t happen. The speed of the generators is rigidly synchronized with the power grid to be (in the US) exactly 60 Hz, so what happens is that the amount of steam to the turbine is reduced, keeping the generator turning at the same speed. Reducing the steam demand in turn means backing off on the fuel (in a fossil fired plant) or reactor output (in a nuclear plant). Normally, since power plants are providing electricity to a large area, changes in demand are smoothed out by the average of all consumers. Demand does change throughout the day, but usually in a predictable manner. An exception can occur when a breaker somewhere trips, and a large fraction, or even all of the load on the generators must be shed. You can shut off the steam to the turbines, but that steam has to go somewhere\u2014and right now. Allowing the boiler to explode is considered bad form, so a very large relief valve opens up and the entire boiler output is vented to the sky until an orderly shutdown can be accomplished. When that steam valve lets go, many of those within a thousand-yard radius will need a change of underwear. But no, \u201cextra\u201d energy never makes it onto the grid. Edited to add: With the increase in solar and wind power, which is generated without any particular link to demand, the need is becoming apparent for \u201cgrid storage\u201d which allows power generated during off-peak to be stored and used later during peak periods which may occur during nighttime or calm wind periods. Several methods have been contemplated or tested, including flywheels, pump storage (where water is pumped up to hilltop storage), and others. One idea, which becomes more feasible as electric vehicles become more plentiful, is to use the combined battery power of vehicles plugged into chargers as a distributed storage device. As of this writing, no significant percentage of the grid is capable of storing energy for future use, but times are changing. ",

            "answer_text": "There is one kind of electrical power that we could regard as \u2018unused\u2019, in a practical sense, as in \u2018unutilized\u2019. That is power that goes to earth, for particular reasons. What happens is that a conductor (wire or whatever) is connected to earth\u2014meaning, connected to the ground, the soil, the planet, for example through a metal stake driven into the ground, or through the copper water pipes that run through the ground. The planet is capable of absorbing any realistic amount of electrical power without problems (though the area of soil immediately around the earth connection might become temporarily dangerous if the power is high enough). A practical example of this might be if a wire got loose in an electrical device and touched a metal casing. The metal casing will be \u2018earthed\u2019 or \u2018grounded\u2019 by another wire that ultimately connects to earth or ground by one of the means mentioned above (it has to be, by design and by law). So any electricity carried by the first (loose) wire will be directed off to the earth. In the process, a fuse or circuit breaker will probably be tripped. Either way, any person touching the metal case should be safe from electrocution. Ultimately, any kind of excess or unwanted electrical power in a system that cannot be stored will most likely be \u2018earthed\u2019 this way. So for instance if a spinning generator was suddenly disconnected from the power network, it would be earthed to dissipate its excess energy\u2014though probably not as directly as a simple connection to earth. Of course not all power that goes to earth is \u2018unused\u2019. Many devices (most?) use the earth connection as a working part of their circuitry. Some rural power grids use earth as part of the circuit to save on overhead wires. The planet forms a key part of most electrical systems. Earth is essentially the resting or null point of all electrical systems. All this is a simplification. But the short and simple answer to your question is that all electrical power that escapes human usage returns to the planet. ",

            "answer_text": "Lots of good answers\u2026.and I\u2019ve tried to explain this many times. (I worked in power generation for over 35 years\u2014I\u2019ve watched it daily for years). There are three factors in power, all about how electricity works: Voltage, Current (Amps), Frequency. Wattage (Power, what you are actually buying) is a mathematical term obtained by multiplying voltage and current (W=VA). (More or less in reality, there is also something called reactive current, but I won\u2019t go down that rabbit hole). So, in reality, the first thing that happens when \u2018extra\u2019 power appears on the grid, is there is a small INCREASE in voltage. When W decreases, and A is constant, V has to go down. In response to that, the voltage regulator on the generator makes an adjustment, and load decreases by feedback all the way to the steam valve. All of that take time. The voltage change is instant. I did like the example given of ants on the truck\u2014because it really does look at the large scale situation. One individual at one house turning off a light or turning on an air conditioner is such a small change in the big picture that it\u2019s invisible. The effect of frequency is critical. In the US, we run at 60 Hz (60 cycles per second), which means in reality that the generators are all synchronized at a rotation speed to produce 60 cycles. Most fossil generators run at 3600 RPM (60 rotations a second, 1 rotation = 1 cycle). Nukes usually run at 1800 RPM, Hydros run a LOT slower, so do windmills. In net, all the generators are running at a constant speed\u2014and yes, there is a speed governor on each one\u2014but in reality they all MUST run at the same speed because a single generator cannot \u2018buck the system\u2019. It\u2019s as if there is a single generator, not thousands. What happens when there is a LARGE decrease in load, is that the system frequency will move off of 60 Hz and increase\u2026and the generators will speed up from 3600 rpm to say 3602. This isn\u2019t a big deal, and the governors will take over and slow things down over a few seconds time. However, if there is a big swing, then bad things start happening. At 5% overspeed, the generators are designed to immediately shut down (trip), to protect the equipment so it can restart another day. Suddenly, now, there is a loss of generation at a point. If that trip comes close to balancing the load decrease on the system\u2014all is good. If not, another generator will trip, and so on. All this can happen in a few seconds\u2014before any person can react to what is happening. The opposite also happens: A generator, running smoothly, can have a problem of some kind, and trip. If the system is straining to keep up (hot summer day), then the imbalance goes the other way, and frequency can drop. At 5% under frequency (57 Hz), the generators are overloaded, and they will trip. All of this can create a cascade like we saw in August of 2003 in the US. The whole system works because there are many generators spread out over a large land area. Small increases and decreases in a locality (even as high as a 1\u20132% change) can be readily managed and no one even notices except for the system operators. Locally, your house voltage might actually fluctuate between 110 and 125 volts pretty frequently\u2014-but unless you have very sensitive electronics, you\u2019ll never know it. It\u2019s when there is a major imbalance (such as a big transmission line that overheats on a hot summer afternoon and shuts down, or a big generator has a fault and trips off at a time of maximum demand) that bad things happen across a large area.

            "answer_text": "This is an interesting situation of what happens in the immediate short term and what happens in the long term. If the Power stations' energy is balanced by many loads then all is well. If one load changes very quickly, say it decreases, then the extra spinning energy will be instantaneously given to the other remaining loads, while if some load increases, the increase in is gained through a slight loss in the other loads. If the change of load it too much such that the parameters of the power station in voltage and frequency level are surpassed then protection devices as shedding steam come into action.After the immediate action takes place then the automatic system will take over and since energy is due to the prime mover then the energy to the prime mover is adjusted so that to retain a balance of energy. In actual fact there is always a balance of energies, where part of the energy is used on a continuous basis and some of the energy is used to accelerate or produce a change of state of the masses involved.Engineers have a brain/mind which deals with invisible and silent functions and ALL PEOPLE SHOULD CONSIDER THAT ALL THE TANGIBLE GUARANTEED COMFORT THEY HAVE INSIDE AND OUTSIDE THEIR HOME IS ALL DUE TO THE HUMAN ENGINEERING BRAIN/ MIND REACHING THE HIGHEST LEVELS, MUCH HIGHER THAN PHILOSOPHERS OR VOCIFEROUS PROFESSIONS WHO DEAL WITH OPINIONS AND NEVER GUARANTEE ANYTHING THEY EARN A LIVING WITH.Yet most people have not the slightest idea what engineers handle. Most people deal in emotions and not facts and distributing emotions to people earns one a better living than giving the people tangible guaranteed comforts. Many people tip the barman and the waiter.......... but they never tip the engineers who CONTINUOUSLY provide them with electricity, sewers, running water, machines to grow their food, all transport by land sea and air, all surgical tools, all instruments at hospitals, all their furniture at home, their clothes, shoes, and socks, manufacture all their medicines, all their entertainment devices, dispose of their home rubbish, bottle their beer and whiskey, manufacture their paint and all the support for artistic functions including instruments for music, theatres, all make up for women, children\u2019s toys, etc etc............. that is life, so children should be advised to take vociferous professions which never guarantee their product and to stay away from engineering which always requires one to deliver a tangible guaranteed product, at the cheapest price! Some professions have nature on their side to take over when they are absent from their patients and others can defer a court case for six months without the people grumbling too much. NO ENGINEER CAN DEFER OR POSTPONE HIS WORK NOR DOES HE HAS NATURE ON HIS SIDE TO HELP HIM IN HIS ABSENCE FROM THE LOCALITY OF HIS PATIENT/ PRODUCT.People are so cruel to practical engineers, but they love and respect all those profession who simply pump them up with emotions, and there are so many of them.

            "answer_text": "Electrical power in a grid is consumed at the same moment it is created. There is no \u201cextra\u201d electricity that has to be stored or disposed of. The power grid (which is typically the combined output of dozens of individual generators, at dozens of individual locations) produces exactly enough electrical energy to meet the current instantaneous load - no more, no less. That\u2019s not to say that all the electrical energy is doing useful work. There will always be losses due to leaking insulators, resistance in conductors, and all alternating current systems experience a phenomenon called \u201creactive power\u201d which does no useful work, and represents an inefficiency in the network. This can be minimized by careful system design. About the only time that there can be \u201ctoo much\u201d power is if an individual running generator operating at a high load factor suddenly gets disconnected from the network. If that happens, safety systems in the generator need to operate to immediately reduce its output voltage to zero, or it can suffer severe mechanical damage. A bigger and more common problem is when there is not enough generating capacity to supply current demand. When that happens, power grid operators will bring additional generators online to meet increased load, or start importing power from adjacent location networks that may have the ability to supply supplemental power. But in general, the power grid operates no differently than the alternator in your car. That alternator might have the ability to supply up to 200 or more amperes of current at maximum load, but generally it produces much less. If the load in your car is only 4 or 5 amps, the alternator will supply just that, and no more. If you increase the load by turning on the headlights, air conditioner and radio, the alternator will produce more current, but again only the exact amount that is actually needed at a given moment.

            "answer_text": "Electricity we don\u2019t use is the electricity that the generators commit to the grid. If there is low demand then the actual voltage level of the grid goes up. When this happens, generators can reduce their production somewhat, but only to a point. The signal the generators get may be the higher voltage (but this is often constrained to a part of the network with low demand) or they get a price signal from the energy markets. If in fact there is simply too little demand and too much generation, the generators get fined (actually they have to bid with a negative price). Since coal, nuclear and gas take some time to \u201cspin up\u201d it is expensive for them to turn off equipment to reduce generation. To avoid fines and costs, the generators may have a beneficial arrangement with a high demand manufacturer such as a metals smelter. Aluminium production is a huge electricity consumer (aluminium is sometimes called \u2018congealed electricity\u2019). Aluminium produces can also turn up and turn down their demand. They might get this excess electricity for cheap or for free. If you are saving energy, the electricity you did not consume that might otherwise have consumed is called \u201cnegawatts\u201d. There is an emerging field of research on how to reward people for producing negawatts. Hopefully you can reduce your electricity demand and be rewarded for this. ",

            "answer_text": "Good question\u2026understanding this is the key to understanding the grid. So in an over generation condition, either the frequency will increase, voltage will increase, or both. Frequency is generally used by local gen systems as a control signal so they will spin lower and thereby will generate less and match the load. In a grid that is as large as the eastern US, power will flow from the high gen areas to low voltage or low supplied areas \u2026 there is no mechanism to absorb the excess energy\u2026.the load and gen are matched at all times, by using the freq/voltage as measured at the generator to self regulate - if that fails, gen units will trip off line (thereby reducing gen vs. load too). Electrically nearby gens, will typically trip first. Some loads may trip automatically, but typically are not as sensitive as the generators are to freq/voltage. If you get into this rare tripping situation, seldom does the lost gen match the loss load - so you can a ratcheting type collapse of the gird. A generator tripping due to frequency is a rare event\u2026as in widespread power outage rare. During the last east coast power outage, many gens in the end started tripping due to freq problems. Frequency is kept very close to 60 Hz. Its rare for it to deviate more that 0.3 Hz away from 60 Hz. The grid is designed and operated to take multiple gen tripping and still remain functioning - by having standby generators available and ready to go online within minutes. During those minutes where gen doesn\u2019t match load, you\u2019ll get a freq/voltage response that is outside nominal\u2026.ie a voltage that is hi/low than normal and/or a freq that is higher/lower than normal. Your fans may run faster/slower, your electric oven may heat up faster/slower, lights burn brighter/dimmer, motors run faster/slower,etc. The grid has a certain amount of robustness to it, the loads typically have a certain amount of robustness to variances in their power supplies. For example, I remember as a child watching the TV picture shrink right before the North East power blackout. The TV was able to op with a lower voltage. Another thing is that the interconnections between the utilities may trip (ie disconnect) between utilities if they become to large (as in burn the wire type large). Again a line reaching its maximum power typically doesn\u2019t occur unless its during the utilities peak season and the line is already heavily (but safely) loaded. Even so, the lines have emergency limits that they may continue to be overloaded for up to say 15 minutes. There are stories about maxed out lines reaching the 15 minutes and the operators about to trip manually\u2026.but the line automatically trips\u2026saving the operator to having to explain himself. Also, the nature of the grid will suck power automatically to the part of the grid that needs it\u2026even if the power schedules do not have that power flow scheduled\u2026.accounting will make this up later. However, some utilities have devices that can control the power flow - like a valve in a water system. I believe they are call phase angle regulators (pars). Also, some utilities have DC interconnects that can be used to isolate freq problems, but also control the amount of power flow\u2026.but these are few and far between, so the power flow will find a different way to get to the load. Finally, as far as adjusting for the load during the day, in the US, regional power coordinator, tells each utility what it needs to gen (forcasted on historical weather and season factors and current load) every xx seconds or so. The utility then splits up the incremental change to the load following gen under it's control allocated based on economics and expected response factors of each unit\u2026 ie economic dispatch. There are other considerations that may come into play that can override economic dispatch such as inter utility xfers, grid stability, gen temporary limits due to gen specific component issues,etc. ",

It is Generation=Demand , that is only that much electricity is generated which is in demand\u2026 when considered for a long run. However, there can be a mis match for small period of time. In those times if supply overshoots the demand then Generator instantly corrects itself by decreasing the Power output. Also when demand is more than generation then Generator instantly increases the Power output. This is called as Automatic Generation Control(AGC) or Free Governors Action. Where does the extra energy go in those small period of power mis-match? The extra energy is storred as Rotational Kinetic Energy of the Rotor and the rotor starts accelerating. Power frequency is strongly linked with Rotor speed. One can expect 5% increase in frequency. It can go higher upto 52.5 Hz for 50Hz systems.Similarly when demand was higher than generation then extra energy is taken from the Rotational Kinetic Energy of the rotor and rotor starts deaccelerating. Frequency can drop upto 47.5 Hz.In a large interconnected Power System, frequency does not swing that much for minor disturbances. However a large disturbance ( Like a sudden unscheduled power outage of an entire State due to series of failures) may swing the frequency so far that generator fails to operate. This is called loss of Synchronism. ",

The governor detects the drop in speed and increases fuel to the engine, until the speed comes back to the rated value, which is determined by the supply frequency (50 Hz in India). The increased bit of fuel provides the additional power required by the kitchen blender. Let us say the housewife now switches off the blender. This reduces the current requirement on the grid. The prime mover, however, is being driven by fuel in excess of its requirement. The prime mover will speed up and the supply frequency will rise. It is the governor\u2019s job to sense this and immediately reduce fuel to the engine. This is not unlike when you are driving a car on a level road, at a speed that you consider reasonable and safe. Suppose the road suddenly dips in a steep descent downhill. The mechanical load on the engine sharply reduces. The engine immediately speeds up. The driver senses this over-speeding, and releases the pedal of the accelerator to come back to a safe, acceptable speed. The driver acts as the governor here.Similarly, when the car runs into a steep climb, the load on the engine increases and it slows down. The driver has to press on the accelerator to increase fuel to the engine so that it does not stall.The Governor\u2019s job is to always maintain the correct speed of the generator by monitoring the frequency of power supply accurately. It continuously adjusts the amount of fuel to the prime mover, and, thereby, controls the correct amount of electrical power being fed to the grid. ",

            "answer_text": "Most of the answers under this question are \"correct,\" but they are still incomprehensible for those without electrical knowledge. Below I am going to use a \"relatively accurate example\" to help you understand the \"power system supply & demand dynamic balance\". Imagine the following scenario: Suppose there is a big truck with limited & adjustable power. Truck power = generator output We describe \"The motive power of Big Trucks\" as \"output power.\"  50 revs/sec = power system frequency 50Hz Once the truck is running smoothly, it will always move at a constant speed of 50 rev / sec. We describe \"rotational speed of the tire\" as \"frequency.\" We describe \"the state in which the truck is stopping to stay still\" as \"halt.\" If the truck is moving at \"speed below 50 revs/sec\", we describe it as \"low frequency\" and vice versa as \"high frequency.\"  The ants randomly getting on and off = electricity load Its passengers are ants who randomly jumps on and off of the truck. We describe \"these ants that get on and off at random\" as \"load.\" If the truck is moving at 50 rev / sec, but an ant passenger is not there, we describe this state as \"no-load operation.\"  When the truck was running at no load at 50 revs/sec, the first ant got on.  After it got on, the forward speed of the truck changed to the corresponding tire speed of 49.99999999999...revs/sec.  Then the second and third ants got on.. At this point the truck's forward speed slowed down a little bit. By the time there were 10,000 ants on the truck, the wheel frequency had changed to 49.99 revs/sec, but they were still unaware.  When 100,000 ants were accumulated on the truck, the wheel frequency became 49.5 revs/sec. ( When it is not enough, the \"mechanical energy stored in the generator\" is converted into electrical energy, which slows down the speed and causes the frequency to drop. ) At this time, the ants noticed that truck's speed was slow and protested to the driver.  The driver started to give it output and let the tire speed increase a little to return to 50 revs/sec.  After a while, the ants getting off the car gradually got more than got on ones. The load is getting smaller, but the truck's output remains unchanged. When the number of ants getting off is not enough, it is difficult to detect the increase in speed. When more and more ants getting off, the truck speed is increased to 50.5 revs/sec. ( The unused/superfluous electricity on the power grid can only exist in the generator shaft in the form of mechanical energy. It will be converted into the mechanical energy of the generator, increase the speed of the generator, and cause the frequency of the power system to rise.)  At this point, the driver began to derating the output and let the speed return to 50 rev/sec again.  In this continuously updated dynamic process, the driver invented an instrument for monitoring tire speed --It gives some output when the frequency is lowered, and it reduces some output when the frequency increases. (Note: The power system uses the regulating output of prime mover to maintain \"dynamic balance throughout the supply process\" rather than \"absolute balance.\" ) The above is the \"Power System Dynamic Balance Process\". PS: Since the truck \"output\" always has an upper limit, when power reaches its maximum value and the number of ants still increases, the tire speed will only become slower. This situation is called \"overloading.\"  At this time, the driver will yell: \"Get off here. Our tires are getting slower and can't load you all.\" Then he took out a spade and shoveled out a lot of ants. We call this situation \"under-frequency load shedding\".  ",

            "answer_text": "Some people are writing wrong answers here, at least partially wrong. First of all Electricity companies regulate the demand so that it does not exceed the supply. However if the demand is low, no electricity is \"wasted\". (in ideal condition) Because there's nothing called as \"unused electricity\". Here few people have given right answers explaining voltage in an open circuit does 0 (zero) work. Whenever there is less load, less force is required to rotate the generator shaft. In case of a hydroelectric station, if more load is connected to the grid, the kinetic energy of the water exiting after hitting the generator's turbine is lesser. If heavy loads are removed from the grid, kinetic energy of the water leaving the turbine is MORE. because that's the unused energy of water. Similar concept applies to all other power stations like coal/nuclear. In a nutshell, more loads means more current which means more current through the coils of generator which means more opposing force encountered by the generator for the same rpm. No loads=no current (open circuit)=no force required to maintain the rotation (ideally). NOTE: The above explanation is extremely simplified, I know there are lots of other factors which come into play for an accurate description or simulation. I just tried to explain without any formulae or equations or technical terms, please feel free to correct me if my explanation is wrong. ",

            "answer_text": "Usually the national grid is managed so that power is transferred to where it is needed most. If not, extra energy is usually stored: Hydel power plants automatically store energy - they can reduce flow to the turbines and the water will accumulate in the reservoir. The water is an energy buffer. Some power stations pump water into temporary reservoirsCompressed air, Liquid air, Hydrogen and Battery storage, Flywheels, Thermal sinks are all used in various places.For some power stations, especially coal powered ones, the output is so high that the excess energy cannot be stored - in such cases it is not possible to modulate the output, nor is it possible to shutdown and restart the plant within a short period of time. So the energy is essentially thrown away. This is one danger that renewable energy sources can cause in a country where most energy comes from thermal power stations. Renewables cannot ever handle baseline 24x7 load, but they cause the non-renewable power plants to simply continue to consume resources and pollute. It's sort of like hiring an extra employee who is efficient and cheap, but comes and goes at random times - so you are forced to retain and pay the older 24x7 guy, who has nothing to do when the new guy is around.

            "answer_text": "As far as electrical power is concerned it has to be utilized at the same moment it is generated. It can not be stored (except for small quantities in the batteries) Electrical power output of the generator is equivalent to mechanical input minus losses in generator (quite minimal & hence can be ignored), and that mechanical input (e.g steam in case of steam turbine generator) has to be equivalent to the load which is connected (for the sake of simplicity ignore the losses in transmission line by assuming that load is directly connected to the generator). If we try to increase the mechanical input (which you think would increase the generated power) would actually result in over speeding of turbine and hence frequency would increase (Governor however will respond to this increase in frequency by reducing the mechanical input in actual case) because there is no excess load which can be fed as a result of increased mech. input. Lets take the simple case of 10MW steam turbine generator (above-mentioned assumptions hold true for this case too): lets suppose load of 6MW is connected, so mechanical input has to be equivalent to this. Now lets assume you increase the mechanical input without load is being changed, it will result in increase in the frequency (which is undesirable as loads are sensitive to change in frequency). Note: this is very preliminary explanation to make you understand the concept, however actual scenario is much more complicated. Note 2: Energy is nothing but the amount of power generated multiplied by time. (1kW power generated for 1 hour is 1kWH of energy which is nothing but 1 unit). Hope this helps. ",

That would be beyond its capacity. But if you had a 6.5Kw generator, it could drive the 1000w light. Think of it like this: a little child can push a wheel barrow but only just manages to do it. His father can push the same wheel barrow. But he could also push the wheel barrow even fully loaded because he has extra energy available. His body only produces the energy when needed.

If they can\u2019t use it they have not had any storage for over 100 years. They actually dump it by shorting it to ground. A friend worked for a major utility and he even tried making Hydrogen Off Peak at night to use the excess. They would give the power away or even pay others to take it since many GRID are connected to each other. He said he entire 30 year career was a failure trying to use the excess and still have enough for the Peak Needs during the day. They used NG plants as Peaker Power and would start and stop them trying to match the use to the loads. One small success was getting electric vehicles in recent years. They can be programmed to charge at night Off Peak. They have also stared adding battery storage in nice long lasting non toxic batteries like the Tesla Power Packs by the Mega Watts. This will take time but is making a huge difference in the GRID. It will save money, be more efficient and allow more Renewable Energy. Electric vehicle battery storage is the Holy Grail for power Utilities. ",

            "answer_text": "There is no extra supply. That would violate a basic principle of grid stability as expressed in what we power engineers call the Swing Equation as well as the Equal Area Criterion:  Basically this equation states that for the grid to be stable, the mechanical power of the generator as expressed by the mechanical characteristics of the generator motor must equal the electrical power generated. If either one of these things get out of whack, the grid will go unstable and the generator will be out of step (a fancy way of saying that the generator is out of control). There are protective measures to ensure that does not happen, namely relaying systems that will either cut the generator off the grid if it starts to run away, or to isolate faults on the electrical system that will act as a short circuit\u2014those short circuits can cause the generator to spin out of control. Bad things like equipment failure and faults occur in a system that has this balance out of control. A generator that produces excess power is a generator that is out of step/running away, and therefore would render the system unstable or cause massive equipment failure on the electrical grid due to too much power being forced into the system if permitted to continue to operate in such a manner. The Equal Area Criterion basically states that electrical power generated must equal electrical power consumed in order for the grid to remain stable:  This graph shows how rotor speed correlates with mechanical power (Pm) and electrical power (Pe). When Pe =/=Pm, the system is unstable\u2014which can be due to a lot of factors that cause electrical faults: lightning strikes, switching surges, unexpected load demand, equipment failure, etc. Power system stability analysis uses these two principles in order to evaluate system stability and to design protective relaying to keep the system stable under fault conditions. So no, excess power isn\u2019t a thing on the power grid. Can\u2019t be, won\u2019t be. ",

            "answer_text": "All generated electricity is used. The simplest way to explain this is to use a car analogy. If your are car is traveling at 60 mph on a straight and level road, you can maintain a constant throttle (gas pedal) position. If your car travels up a hill (more load) it will slow, requiring more gas to maintain 60 mph. Conversely, when you travel downhill, your car will speed up so you will take your foot off the gas to return to the speed limit. Power plants respond the same way except the speed (frequency) change is very small because all power plants are connected on the \u201cinfinite grid.\u201d When system load decreases - the plants with the most expensive fuel will be throttled down, reducing their portion of the load. Small load changes happen constantly but with so many people using power, when some people use a little more, other customers statistically use a little less. Exceptions occur such as when businesses close for the day and customers go to bed. These situations are forecasted and expensive \u201cpeaking\u201d plants reduce their load and may shut-down until the next higher demand period. ",

            "answer_text": "First of all, it should be understood that under normal operation, all the power generated by the power plant must be more than the power demand of the user, otherwise the local power load will suddenly increase, and the supply will outstrip the supply easily leading to large-scale power outages. Some of the excess power generated by power plants is dispatched through the power grid to areas where power is scarce. The power grid is like a city's subway line, where multiple lines are laid out to maximize economic benefits, and a city with only one subway line is less cost-effective than a bus. The same is true of the power grid, and the wider the distribution of the grid, the more stable the power system as a whole. The grid is equivalent to a middleman, and if the power load in the city increases, the dispatcher of the grid will first send instructions to the upstream power plant to increase its power supply. At present, China mainly uses thermal power generation and hydropower generation. When a thermal power plant receives an order, it will increase the burning power of the boiler, so that the water in the boiler will produce water vapor, and the steam turbine will rotate faster, thus driving the generator. By increasing the rotating speed of generator rotor, the original speed of 49 turns per second is increased to 50 turns, the current frequency is stabilized at 50 Hz and the voltage is stabilized at 220 V, which ensures the stability of the power system in the city. If hydroelectric power increases the flow of water to increase the speed of the turbine, to drive the generator. ",

Below is a chart showing the amount of energy discarded per month by the state of California. The solar panels and wind turbines are just \u201cunplugged\u201d. In May 2019 for example California discarded about 224 gigawatt-hours of energy (224,000 Megawatt-hours). At $0.14 per kilowatt-hour, that comes to about $31.4 billion dollars worth. Because there was nowhere to store or use this energy at the time it was available. This process is called curtailment.

            "answer_text": "Well, as others have said, there\u2019s no spare electricity in the power grid, \u2026 almost. You see, there is the need at times to generate more power than demand can satisfy. The reason for this is that the generators must operate under a continuous load and that load has a safety minimum. So, what happens to that extra power that is generated to keep the generators running at a minimum load? It is mostly spilled to the open air by a huge bank of resistors. This is called a heat load. (And, an old insult in the business is to call a useless worker, a heat load.) Now, electric utilities hate that they have to spill that power. So, they have programs to help with that problem. One example (among many) is to subsidize the power consumption of a Hot Water Heater (HWH). We have one of those. It\u2019s basically a 105 gallon thermos bottle. Our power utility runs it between about 2:00 AM & 3:30 AM when power demand is generally at its lowest. It also gets a short boost for about 1/2 hour in the mid-afternoon. //REFERENCE: This is our unit: Rheem Commercial Marathon 105 Gal. Lifetime 4500/4500-Watt Non-Metallic Electric Tank Water Heater-MHD105245 - The Home Depot Our original HWH was an electronic start unit. It rusted apart. (So, we paid an electrician to run a 30amp power line and then has this unit installed. It is now 12 years old and still going strong.) ",

            "answer_text": "In a power system ,generation automatically gets adjusted to the demand. When ever the demand goes down ,the frequency increase (because the alternators\u2019s speed increases) and the governor to the prime mover whether it is a steam or hydro turbine reduces the steam/water supply till the generation matches the load. At that time the frequency becomes rated frequency.Similarly ,when the demand increases the frequency comes down and the governor increase the steam/water supply till the frequency becomes rated frequency.The grid always works at the rated frequency and departure of frequency ,even by about 0.5 Hz may lead to alternators going out of synchronism leading to collapse of grid.Hence there is no question of excess generation and the generation gets matched with the demand. In fact one of the problems of operating the power system is to match the generation with the demand every instant as there is there no provision for storage of electricity in the power system.During peak loads if the demand can not be met, the frequency falls down and some of inessential feeders( as decided as per importance )gets disconnected by under frequency relays to match the generation with demand.

            "answer_text": "Electricity is an on-demand product. Generation resources or power plants follow the load of the system precisely. Both over and under generation are not desirable and can damage the power system. Therefore the power plant will only produce as much power as is needed by load. Now how does the power plant know how much power is needed? The system operator will forecast demand ahead of time and schedule power plants to operate in a given time frame with a certain power output. The schedule is determined primarily by choosing power plants with the cheapest cost to serve the load (ignoring reliability contracts and ancillary services). The system (power grid) operator will send a signal to generator operator telling them to raise or decrease power output as needed. When there is not enough power, and demand exceeds generation the system frequency will begin to decrease. This is another signal for the system operator to increase generation and is done in real time. This does not account for generator inefficiencies and system losses, but the power output by the generator will always follow this formula: Generation=Demand+Losses The power plant needs 200 units of gas to produce the power needed for the system given that the generators efficiency is already considered in the units of gas needed to meet demand, then it will not decide to burn 210 units of gas. It must burn exactly 200 units of gas. Burning excess gas would lead to excess generation and a rise in frequency which is just as dangerous as a drop in frequency from the standard, which is 60 Hz.

And when there is, if it isn\u2019t being directly consumed by appliances, it gets turned into heat in the conductors all over the grid. In fact, where I live, the network engineers have installed strain gauges on the mountain transmission lines to tell them when the lines are icing up and sagging down. When this happens, they run extra energy through that line (usually by shutting off a parallel line) so it heats up and the ice melts off. This same thing happens as one of the mechanisms for getting rid of the extra energy in the grid. Everything starts to heat up a tiny fraction, and every light bulb shines a teensy bit brighter, which puts the grid back into balance, since the extra energy (surplus to demand) is just being used to heat metal.

Same with electricity: the voltage remains while the current is lower or even zero. There is still an issue with excess electricity supply: some electricity is produced from burning coal or heating water in nuclear plants. It takes several minutes and up to hours to adjust the power capability of these stations thus although the electricity itself is self-adjusting almost instantly, power stations generate heat more then required at a particular moment and that heat is wasted. This is known as the off peak excess power issue. Efforts are made to convert this excess power to storage, including charging a large battery farms or pumping water to higher elevation for later hydroelectric generation. ",

            "answer_text": "Original question What happens to the excess energy generated at power plants that doesn't get used? The quick answer is that there isn\u2019t any, the plant responds to any change in demand almost instantly, however, that is the easy version. There are books written on balancing demand and generation and an easy explanation is needed. A power system is designed with various buffers in place. There exists in the system various sources of energy which have various response times to the demand. These are designated in terms of milliseconds, seconds, minutes or hours. For example, a cold fossil plant might have a response time of 10 hours or more, a warm plant, fewer hours. Plant that is running, is synchronised with the system but not generating will be in the seconds area. Plant which is running and generating will be in the milliseconds. For anything faster than that, the system itself has properties like capacitance which buffers in a demand change. The real second to second controls are frequency and voltage. Both have an operation range and changes in both can be deployed to match production and demand. An exception to all this, is pumped storage systems. Water is pumped to high level storage in times of low demand, eg night, and used to generate in times of high demand. This can be used to balance load and production also, as these sets can cease pumping or increase generation in an instant. Hope that wasn\u2019t too complicated, it\u2019s the reason that electrical engineers spend so long learning all this. ",

            "answer_text": "Heres a short answer thats correct so far as I know. The power grid in north america is a giant U shape. Its an unstoppable monster that generates 60 cycles per second no matter what. If you try to make it go a little faster then you are generating power. It wont actually go any faster but you will work hard trying, either as hard as you can or as hard as you want. If you try to make it go a little slower, your generator turns into a motor and the grid will make it go 60 cycles per second. Its now a consumer and not a generator. If you drop in out of phase then the grid will put it in phase, and it doesnt care if it has to rip your generator out of its concrete pad and throw it across the room to do it, it will. So, any unused power is used to make each part of the grid work less hard. This leads to an interesting question, \"what if we connected the top of the U, and made an O, out of the North American grid?\" The answer is nobody knows and we are scared to even try, its connected to itself with a transformer that isolates it. On smaller isolated grids this is no longer true. On an isolated grid excess power generated causes the grid to run at maybe 61 or 62 cycles per second, and some clocks will run fast or slow, as well as some other inconveniences. ",

            "answer_text": "Most heat energy is wasted. At best the absolute highest efficiency posable is 40% more than 60% goes into waste heat. This is true for all heat engines and steam plants (coal, oil, nuclear ect). You can tell the size of the engine in a diesel truck by looking at the size of its radiator. Power plants put waste heat into heating houses and businesses or green houses, or it is wasted in cooling towers or rivers or lakes. Power plants do not make more power than is being used. They have equipment that closes the steam valve to keep from over speeding or producing an over voltage condition. Distribution systems consume as much as 20% of the power produced by heating wires and transformers lost in electrical resistance. Converting heat energy at a power plant into work at your house is not very efficient in the end you seldom get more than about 20% of heat energy converted into real work at your house. Cars trucks busses trains and home generators are even less efficient.  ",

            "answer_text": "You will get better answers from the electrical engineers in the group, but I think I can give you the big picture without embarrassing myself. The answer is: through constant monitoring. There are basically two types of electrical generators on the grid: those that must be on all the time, and those that can modify their output. Nuclear power plants cannot turn themselves on and off quickly, and cannot moderate their output. They are used to provide the base power. (There is always some power being drawn from the system.) Things like wind and solar power are a bit different in that they input into the system at somewhat random intervals. They represent a small amount of the total input, however. Then there are coal plants, hydro-electric dams, and (where I live) biomass plants. They can throttle their output on a minute by minute basis if they want to. Those plants have operators who monitor the total demand on the system on a constant basis, alter their power production to keep things even. They basically monitor the voltage of the system at their location. If it drops, demand is high, and they increase production to give it a boost. I believe the biomass plant where I live checks its output on 15 minute intervals. There is never extra energy generated. There are peaking power plants that turn down or off when not needed. (There is an exception where you store energy by, for instance, pumping water uphill during periods of low consumption, and using that water to generate electricity during peak times, but that is rare, and less than 100% efficient.)

            "answer_text": "in electricity there's two quantities voltage and current.Voltage is a potential, by its name you can see it has potential to do work if used properly. Current is the means to do work. When we have both voltage and current we multiply them to show the power that is being expended. Power integrated over time is work. If either quantity is zero then there is no work done. So if you have a generator running producing 120V, but no (zero) current flows then you have potential but no power (120 x 0 = 0) and no work is done. When you turn on the load (e.g. a light) then current will flow and work will be done. So with an ideal generator, virtually no energy or fuel is expended to keep it turning producing voltage and no current. Ideally, bearing friction and other losses make it non-zero losses. But it will be close to zero compared to full load requirements. With a large grid, it never goes to zero load anyway. ",

One is called the base load generator. It is often the the steam powered generator that takes a long time to start and stop. The other systems are faster to start and stop. Gas turbines can be started in a short time and stopped anytime. These cost more to run than the base load generators. Where they use water storage to generate electricity (hydro power) they may actually pump water back into the storage when they have the spare capacity to do that. So what they do is start and stop power generating plants as needed. The other thing they do is charge more for electricity during very high demand to discourage over use then but offer off peak electricity at a cheaper rate. Things like electric hot water systems can store heat. They are switched on at night when the base demand is lower and are not switched on during the day unless it is really. necessary. In some areas they actually control when your hot water storage heater is switched on from the power generator control room. They can adjust the load to their generating capacity more effectively. ",

The way these large grid storage systems work economically is that if excess power is available, they buy the excess electricity from the grid at a very low price and store it. Then later when there is a demand for power, they sell the stored energy back to the grid at a higher price. , If we are talking about power production at a personal and independent scale, unused power is just not collected or is wasted, and is not recoverable. When you start a portable generator, it sits there and spins continuously until you connect a load. If you don\u2019t connect a load, it will still continue running and consuming fuel to spin the generator, and will eventually run out of fuel if you leave it running long enough with nothing connected. If you have an off-grid solar power system with an onsite battery bank, and it is a sunny day but the batteries are fully charged, the solar panels \u201cwant\u201d to produce power but can\u2019t because an automatic switch blocks the solar power from overcharging the batteries. The excess solar power is lost and not recoverable.

            "answer_text": "It is a good question and I think not well answered to date. .. firstly the grid has enormous inertia. .. those big rotating machines in the power stations , and hydro plants contain rotational inertia. If the demand is not there, they slowly speed up. Next the controller's in the grid centres, have access to fast gas turbines which can be switched in and out in a number of seconds, and they just switch them out. ..then the load on the big machines increases and they slow down. But there must always be slightly more energy in the grid than is being consumed and it is in fact dumped into loads which are not important. Nuclear power stations can alter their power output over minutes by shutting down the reaction and if necessary diverting the hot water into a waste pond . Coal power stations are slower responders, but having a mix of reaction times is good Those guys running the grids have a lot of experience and history to work with and they know when there are peaks and lows in consumption. .. They know for instance that at half time in a major soccer match,all the kettles will go on,and increase the load,so they will have a TV on so that they can time the switching of the gas turbine. It is a balancing act,with expensive consequences ,but hey! That's why they are paid as professional engineers. ",

It has to be controlled and in the past this has been fairly easy as generators could be controlled to deliver to meet demand. With wind, solar and other sources that are not linked to demand the need is arising to \u2018store\u2019 power. Batteries do this but we would need huge ones for such a purposes (nor impossible but phew!). Instead you can store power by for example pumping water up hill into storage lagoons from which it can be released to drive turbines and generate power on demand. Since we cannot control the wind, sun or waves this will be an attractive option in the future. One other solution is developing - micro generation and storage. Individual homes, estates etc can use generation from any source and then batteries become a reasonable option, storing daytime power for night use; windy days power for calm days etc. I have a daughter and son in law who have bought a water mill and plan to do exactly this, to go \u2018off grid\u2019. Their planning applications are going in as I write! They may even sell \u2018spare\u2019 electricity to neighbours! ",

After asking, we\u2019d learn that the safeties had lifted and they\u2019d vented steam, it was weird to not have heard that much energy released. How loud is it? I was working in Page, AZ at the Navajo Generating Station located a few miles East of town. We were renting a house there, right next to the airport, and very early one morning the PRVs opened and started venting, the sound woke us up and we were at least six miles from the powerplant. At first, I was annoyed, why would they allow a jet to take off from the airport in the middle of the night?!?

Aside from some storage technologies such as pumped hydro storage, big battery banks, molten salt thermal storage and compressed air there is no real world way to effective store electricity.  Those storage systems are small fractions of the grid generation / load in your area.  The main way very short term storage (less than a second time frames) for grid frequency control is done is with the rotational inertial of the generators attached to the grid.  The mentioned storage systems are on the order of a few hundred MWe on a grid in that is 10's of thousands of MWe in size. The grid frequency is a direct measure of how well generation and load are matched.  Change either one and the other will have to compensate to maintain frequency control stable. ",

In that case there will be a rise in the system-voltage. Your 110V might become 115V, or 130V. In other words, the excess energy being injected into the grid will force all the heaters and light bulbs to run temporarily hotter. The \u201cunused\u201d energy gets diverted to all other users. Note that changing from 110V up to 130V is only 20V higher, yet it\u2019s a 40% rise in energy consumption. So, even if a large chunk of the power grid was suddenly removed, the surge wouldn\u2019t be very destructive. But dynamos are being driven by steam turbines, and the steam power is easily adjusted. Within seconds the energy input to the electric grid can be reduced. The brief power-surge is over. (And your energy bill will be a tiny, tiny bit higher for that month!) ",

In the case of a hydroelectric generator, this is done by reducing the water flow, by moving the guide vanes with the help of servo motors. In the case of steam generators, the governor causes the steam input to reduce. At this point, fuel input to the boiler is reduced to prevent occurrence of excess pressure. If excess pressure builds up, safety valves open and let out the steam into the atmosphere, to protect the boiler. ",

The battery might have another 399 amps to run everything else that hasn't been turned on yet.

            "answer_text": "There isn\u2019t such an excess. What happens when electrical consumption falls at a given moment is a sequence of events that can be only explained to an electrical engineer. I\u2019ll attempt to reason the basics. Firstly, since electricity is normally not stored anyway and thus generation must match consumption always, frequency of the AC will tend to rise above its nominal value (50 or 60 Hz depending on where your live), which has the effect of decreasing the generation. Secondly, operators of large plants may increase the voltage, which compensates this effect within a limited range. And finally, power of quick power stations (hydraulic, gas turbines) is decreased to compensate for the reduction and thus restore grid frequency and voltage of large plants. This is rather complex, also because it is distributed in space across the electric network of transport and distribution. In any case, overall and at any moment, electricity generated = electricity consumed, because there is still very small electricity storage in most national systems and only a negligible amount is stored in standard elements, such as lines and transformers. Countries with large hydro resources use to have reversible power plants (pumping hydro), that add up their consumption during intervals of a decreased demand (i.e., nights). Also, we are now installing large-scale battery systems for the same function. However, all this is not motivated by the variation of demand, but by the interruptibility and variability of renewables, specially wind and solar. ",

Rather than being pushed out by generators, you could imagine that electricity is pulled out of them, by whatever devices attached to the grid that are demanding power. When that power demand is reduced for any reason, there is less pull on the generators, and they don\u2019t have to work as hard. You can also think of it like the water in your pipes. When you open the tap, water flows. Otherwise it just sits there, but the pumping station is maintaining the pressure, so that it will flow when (and only when) you ask for it. ",

That is why we try to have as little excess as possible by regulating the frequency and also we would rather use excess energy to lift water or compress air. It provides means of increasing consumption when consumptions is low for efficiently balancing the system and also provides another source of power during peak periods. As far as I am aware, water pumps and water turbines start in a matter of tens of seconds, while playing with the output of a nuclear plant or coal is significantly slower, espcially when turning it up. On the way down, one can always let steam escape to effectively reduc the turbine speed in a very inefficient maner.  ",

Excess or deficits on the network are seen as shifts in the mains frequency (mains electricity is AC). So electricity flows (roughly) on a 'needs basis'. Many new smart devices (like new fridges) actually can sense this slight frequency shifting and can switch on/off accordingly to help regulate cumulative demand. This is really a question of energy stores and energy transfers. Energy is stored in different forms. Mostly, we store it in chemical energy (battery or hydrocarbons). We burn hydrocarbons in power plants to release this energy which is transferred. This is done on a 'needs' basis. I.e. you burn as much as you believe the demand for energy is. From energy plants to your phone at home this chemical energy gets transferred and stored several times. The Grid facilities this energy transfer through massive power lines and is a massive undertaking. ",

Normally, the mechanical energy from the wind, water or diesel engine is actively pushing the generator to be slightly ahead for the phase so that it add electrical energy to the grid. If the load decrease, like at the end of a popular tv program like game of throne, when million of people turn off the tv and go to bed, every generator all over the network start turning faster. It is the same phenomenon as with the car where the motor turn faster when turning off the head light because, with 100 watt total, about 8 amps difference, the alternator oppose less to the rotation of the engine. The frequency increase noticeably. With a scope connected on the line, it is easy to see the frequency going from 60 Hz (50 Hz in Europe) up to 60.1 Hz. A few minutes later, the throttle on a few diesel generator is decreased and the frequency drop slightly below 60 Hz. Every 10 minutes, the torque applied on a few selected generator is fine tuned to adjust the frequency. The goal is to get a fixed number of pulses over a given time window. This is done to make every mechanical clocks display the correct time. The old clocks often used a synchronous motor as cheap way to reach amazing precision. Those motor will accelerate and decelerate as the frequency change. They are effectively used as \u201cpulse counter\u201d. So, to display the correct time, the total number of pulses per unit of time is the only parameter needed. The voltage/current could fluctuate a lot with no impact on the precision of those clocks.

So why, oh why would anyone generate energy only to pay for its disposal? It is profitable to do so because government subsidies for wind and solar are higher than the disposal cost; therefore profitable. Your tax dollars are delivered to wind generation operators so they can over supply the grid most nights. Then another group gets a part of your tax money from the wind guys to sink the excess energy into heat. ",

By many practical considerations hard to explain here, it is not possible to operate a nuclear or a big coal or gas power plant under a minimum generating power, so if there is not a way to deliver this power to customers, it has to be converted in heat (sometimes it is done even before the energy is converted in electricity, as in nuclear power plants where the steam goes to a refrigerating pool instead of going to the turbines if the turbines do not ask all the steam). But since power systems are vastly integrated, it is very rare to find situations where there is no customers for the power generated, so usually the \u201cwasting\u201d shunts are used just in abnormal conditions.

Small power plants (GT, ICE, Drum less HRSG producing steam) can react within one cycle by regulating the prime-mover directly. With modern furnace (Oxygen blown, CFB) one can regulate the amount of heat quickly so steam losses can be kept to a minimum. If power would be electronically converted to DC and has large scale batteries of Redox type (switch from charge to decharge and visa versa within 10 ms) connected, than one doesn\u2019t need to blow of steam.

            "answer_text": "A plant that produces energy in excess of its metabolic needs will typically use it to synthesize energy-storage molecules such as sugar and starch, which it stores in various tissues. Some gets stored in the roots, some in the stems and leaves, etc. Sometimes, the plant will be able to break these molecules down for energy later on when it needs more energy than it can produce, such as at night or in the winter time or on cloudy days. Other times, some animal will come along and eat those energy-rich plant tissues first. Sometimes this is bad for the plant, but other times it can serve the plant\u2019s long-term interest. For example, there are billions of potato plants in the world now, far more than there ever were before human beings evolved. Producing and storing excess food in tubers that humans can easily harvest and eat has turned out to be a good strategy for potato plants. ",

Most of the generating stations are interconnected and synchronized, generation and consumption of electric power is balanced by system voltage and frequency. Suppose big load is thrown off, the system demand is lowered, current flowing in power lines is reduced, resulting in higher system voltage due to lower voltage loss, subsequently lowering the system current causes the increase in the speed of generators /frequency. Increased system voltage and frequency results in increasing the power consumption of other load. Thus compensating the reduced load. On other side when system frequency and voltage is increased beyond permissible limits generator governors reduced the input energy to the generators to reduce generation. Some time if heavy load is suddenly thrown off, generator governors could not control the system voltage /frequency then the protection relays operates to disconnect the generator from system. ",

This is detected by a series of control systems - both on generators themselves (droop control) and centralized systems (automatic generator control, AGC) which command power output to decrease in response. So, essentially frequency is always oscillating very slightly around the set point (either 60 Hz or 50 Hz depending on where you are in the world). In case of a bigger issue caused by a loss of a generation (causing underfrequency) or load (causing overfrequency) there are additional systems that kick in to either increase or decrease power output and attempt to correct the deviation, or isolate the area with the problem (causing a blackout in that area), before the entire power system collapses.

If load is increased than either generation of power must increased to meet the load  or generator speed will decreased.So governor will adjust or increase the input power so power generation must meet the connected load.A generator which is not connected to any load or open cct generator, will generate very small power to compensate constant losses only. These losses are independent of current flow in generator windings. Law of conservation of energy is always valid. Input power never more than the load plus all losses. ",

In some cases it can also cause loop currents, where the power goes around in a big circle, heating up the wires, which increases electrical resistance, reducing the loop current until an equilibrium is reached. So the answer to your question is that excess electricity simply results in heat, but as this is wasteful and costly, great effort is made to minimise excess electricity. ",

The tap changer automatically changes taps on the transformer to regulate the voltage. As you can see the voltage can change by up to 5% to accommodate quick load changes. Normally the voltage is dead on 120 volts except for temporary motor surges. Try reading your outlet voltage with your voltmeter. ",

If you turn off your light the demand is less and the voltage rises. The power company detects the rise in voltage and decreases the electricity (current). The power company tries to maintain a constant voltage. Everyone is using exactly what is being produced. ",

            "answer_text": "Answers here are almost correct. As noted, voltage will appear at the output terminals, but if there is no current flow, there is no power, i.e. ,no \"electricity\" is generated. However, for voltage to appear at the terminals, some current must flow. Very little, generally. One otherwise good answer has an image of a generator with magnetic bearings, claiming that this would \"spin forever\" until a load is connected. No.  It will spin for much longer if there is no connected load, but the generator wiring itself is a (small) load. A generator creates an electromotive force (voltage) in the windings, and current will flow from this voltage. If we look at this at a given time, the ends will charge, and reverse charge as the turning continues. This requires current flow in the wires, back and forth, and that current flow will heat them. This effect is small but certain. The rotor will slow a little from every such magnetic interaction. ",

Power is the product of voltage and current so 120 volts times zero current means zero power.
