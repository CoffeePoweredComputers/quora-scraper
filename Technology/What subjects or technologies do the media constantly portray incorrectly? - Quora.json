Or the way you can get something\u2019s location from its GPS. It\u2019s fiction. The carrier might be able to locate a cellphone by the towers it\u2019s hitting, but that would be a rough location. And GPS? That\u2019s a receiver, it doesn't transmit anything. Even if you tell it to (although I don\u2019t see how you would - it\u2019s not set up to \u201creceive commands\u201d). And the ease with which a \u201chacker\u201d gets past a password. Most of mine are 50 character randomly generated strings of letters, numbers and punctuation marks. How does anyone guess that in 5 tries? Only on TV. ",
