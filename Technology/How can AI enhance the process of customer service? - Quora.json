            "answer_text": "AI is present and integral in our lives more than many people realize. And, its role in the customer experience is only expected to grow. By 2020, AI automation will manage 85% of companies\u2019 customer relationships (Gartner). The main way it's being used to improve the customer experience is through personalization. Here are 5 ways AI is currently being used to personalize customers' experiences. 1. AI-Generated Personalized Content AI allows companies to intuitively deliver personalized suggestions to consumers based on their behavior and preferences. Amazon is a brand that has found great success by consistently presenting its customers with products that are relevant to their needs and interests. How do they do it? By utilizing AI to track visitors\u2019 browsing and purchase trends, and continually placing individualized suggestions in front of shoppers. For example, Amazon welcomes website visitors with AI-generated recommendations. Every registered customer arrives on the retailer\u2019s website to find their own customized dashboard (just like the one below).  2. Automatic Delivery of Proactive Greetings and Reminders Before the end of 2020, 51% of consumers will expect that companies anticipate their needs and make relevant suggestions before they make contact (Salesforce). AI proactive greetings and reminders are now being used to accomplish both of these feats by way of live chat and SMS messaging. Live Chat Greetings For instance, intelligent live chat software has become advanced enough to collect and store detailed website visitor information. It\u2019s also used to track and interpret customers\u2019 geolocations, prior website visits, browsing histories, and present webpage views (if they are currently browsing your site). This information is then compiled and used to configure chat triggers (i.e. pre-written chat messages that are delivered automatically based upon set visitor behavior conditions). For example, the live chat window pictured below has recognized that someone is browsing LiveHelpNow's pricing page. It then greets them accordingly.  SMS Reminders Businesses are also having success with proactive AI-generated text message updates and reminders. According to research conducted by Nuance, 85% of consumers are interested in receiving proactive notifications, and an astounding 90% say they\u2019re more likely to do business with a company that sends reminders. Have you ever received an SMS from your phone service provider letting you know you are nearing the limits of your data plan? Or, have you ever been texted an appointment reminder from your doctor\u2019s office? Here\u2019s an example of an SMS reminder I received from Suburu dealership regarding a scheduled test drive:  Sometimes messages like these can really save the day! 3. AI Targeted Email Offers and Promotions AI is making it possible for brands to send individually curated emails to their customers, and it's changing the promotional email game for the better. The same messages that used to be an annoyance inevitably bound for the virtual trash bin are actually becoming useful. Case and point: I recently bought a new Keurig coffee machine. A few days later, I received an email from the retailer to alert me that they were having a sale on K-cups. Admittedly, this AI-generated email actually worked. Two boxes of Classic Cinnamon Roll K-cups later, and I was on my merry way. AI is also being used to track and react to customers\u2019 life events, like birthdays and anniversaries. Intelligent software then utilizes this collected information to send consumers individualized special offers. For example, the Philadelphia Phillies send out birthday emails to registered fans that offer $8 MLB tickets with the use of their birthday promo code.  These types of efforts not only boost sales, but they make customers feel recognized and appreciated during important milestones. 4. AI-Powered Predictive Task Completion Predictive personalization is by far one of the most captivating and impressive trends to emerge in recent years Empowered by AI, brands now have the capacity to predict consumers\u2019 behavior, needs, and wants. They also have the capability to create tangible products that can intuitively satisfy those needs and wants. Smart Appliances For example, companies like Samsung are using machine-learning software to develop devices that independently complete precise tasks. One such product is Samsung\u2019s Family Hub 4.0 refrigerator.  The Family Hub fridge has built-in technology that sends users alerts about expiring food. It then offers recipes that include the soon-to-be expired groceries through a Meal Planner app. In addition, the fridge's Instacart app allows users to order groceries. The ordered items are then delivered directly to the customer's home within an hour. Self-Driving Cars The virtual assistant trend is beginning to reach far beyond our kitchens. It's also starting to appear on America\u2019s highways and byways. For instance, vehicle innovators at Tesla have installed mapping software that does far more than just tell a driver how to get to their destination. If you\u2019re not in the mood to drive, Tesla\u2019s AutoPilot feature will tell the car where to take you. You won't have to worry about being later either. The car will check your calendar before it drives you to your scheduled appointment. 5. Data Unification from Multiple Touchpoints These days companies are tweeted at, texted, inboxed, DM-ed, instant messaged, voice-called, and @ mentioned. Just thinking about the barrage of requests, inquiries, and feedback a brand receives on a daily basis can make your head spin. It's a customer service war zone out there. This touchpoint graphic from Branding For The People pretty much sums up the chaos:  (Source: Branding For The People) And, with all that customers have on their mind in this fast-paced world, they aren\u2019t exactly forgiving. They want a fast, accurate, consistent experience regardless of the medium they are contacting you from. According to a Customer Experience Benchmark study conducted by NICE, 72% of customers expect companies to know their purchase history regardless of what method of communication they used, such as chat, phone or email. Thankfully, intelligent insights and centralized data management systems have made it possible to track and log customer data in real-time across multiple touchpoints. Before the existence of AI, compiling massive amounts of data into individualized customer profiles would have taken weeks...maybe even months. Today, large corporations like General Electric, Toyota and HP use AI-powered data unification software like Tamr to instantly organize and store customer data for quick access. This allows their customer service teams to offer a streamlined, personalized experience from any touchpoint. For example, if a customer gets disconnected from a voice call due to a bad connection, the live chat agent they speak to later will have a record of phone inquiry. The conversation can then pick up where it left off. Easy-peasy. No fuss. No muss.

            "answer_text": "The term \u2018Artificial Intelligence\u2019 was coined by John McCarthy back in 1956 and was defined as \u2018the science and engineering of making intelligent machines.\u2019 Most people got acquainted with Artificial Intelligence (AI) because of movies like Star Wars, The Matrix, Terminator, iRobot and more. Over the years, however, technology has narrowed the gap between science-fiction and reality. AI might not look like big spaceships and humanoid robots just yet, but it is absolutely here. The best of businesses and brands are looking at ways to leverage artificial intelligence to boost their brand image and improve their customer interactions. As per a report by Bloomberg, a total of $300 million was invested in AI startup companies in the year 2014 alone. In fact, Gartner has predicted that by the year 2020, 85% of total customer interactions will not be managed by humans. The realm of AI is incredibly expansive, and there\u2019s an abundance of potential for every industry. Let\u2019s take a look at few ways AI is being utilized by brands to improve, enhance, and evolve customer experience: Conversational Ease: Cognitive ability of AI is helping people naturally engage with machines using their native language. AI enables machines to understand speech and text, understand context, and provide appropriate response back to the consumer. Natural language understanding, text-to-speech, and automatic speech recognition are few of technologies that are being leveraged by brands to provide their customers a seamless interaction with the brand. IBM Watson is a functional business AI platform which capable of answering questions posed in natural language by users. Comparably newer products like Siri, Alexa, Google Assistant are utilizing the web effectively to search answers consumer questions real-time, thus answering them intelligently more so stimulating a human brain while doing so. Intelligent Insights: Data mining has been the core of modern AI. By collecting information from their consumers, the AI codes are able to predict the data their consumers may need on a daily basis. Access to calendars make then capable of reminding their consumers of their schedule and important appointments. These applications can utilize this data to optimise their responses by machine learning. AI is also helping brands give their customers a truly personalized experience by collecting and storing customer data, and then using that information to interact with them. The more data the machines store, the more intelligently they can interact. Moreover, AI can enable a brand or business to sift through more data and extract patterns that might otherwise take them years to detect. Enhanced Customer Service: Providing convenient and real-time customer service is need of the hour and companies are really striving hard to provide round the clock support. AI is helping many companies provide 24X7 customer support. Chat bots have been a breakthrough in this field effectively ruling out hours of waiting on a phone line for a live customer representative. These chat bots can take customer queries and respond almost immediately using predefined responses or sifting through a database to provide the required information to a customer. Integration with search engines allows bots to look for the required information over the internet thus going above and beyond a restricted database. AI is slowly becoming an integral part of consumers and businesses alike be it in the form of a simple mobile assistants like Siri or Cortona or a more complex one like Alexa or Watson. The potential of AI is boundless, companies would be amiss if they didn\u2019t start leveraging it in their customer experience efforts. ",
