There are two books which are really good to learn about CTS VLSI Physical Design: From Graph Partitioning to Timing Closure Handbook of Algorithms for Physical Design Automation: Charles J. Alpert, Dinesh P. Mehta, Sachin S. Sapatnekar: 9780849372421: Amazon.com: Books If you want to learn about the basic algorithms that go into CTS the most important algorithm is the DME algorithm. There are different flavors of the DME. But consider reading the following papers Bounded-skew clock and Steiner routing Planar-DME: a single-layer zero-skew clock tree router ",
