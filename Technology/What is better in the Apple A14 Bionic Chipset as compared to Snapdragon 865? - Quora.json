            "answer_text": "The A14 Bionic is not yet launched. Comparing an up coming Apple chipset to an outdated Qualcomm chipset is by no means fair towards Qualcomm. While a lot of tech reviewers like myself have predicted that the A14 is going to get some serious upgrade over the A13, it makes more sense to pit the the A14 Bionic against the Snapdragon 865 Plus. Let\u2019s start the comparison keeping these rumours and predictions as a base: CPU Performance: The chances of Apple shifting to the oct-core SoC are slim to none. But there could be three performance cores instead of two. The top speed of these cores in the A14 are rumoured to be around 3.1GHz. In the Snapdragon 865 Plus, the prime cores has been boosted to 3.09GHz which 10% more. One Thind we know for sure that the A13\u2019s CPU is 15% faster that that of the Snapdragon 865. Using that as a benchmark, safe to assume that the A14 Bionic is going to be a beast of a CPU compared to the Snapdragon 865 and 865 Plus. Fabrication process: To understand where this beastly performance comes from, let's understand the manufacturing process of these chipsets. The A14 will use the new EUV fabrication process form TSMC. This new process will provide 80% higher logic density, giving Apple a significant advantage of packing more transistors. The fabrication process in the Snapdragon 865 and 865 Plus use the TSMC\u2019s second-generation N7P fabrication process which was also used in the A13 Bionic. Benchmarks (The fun part?): The Apple A14 Bonic is estimated to reach a whole new level in Geekbench benchmarks. The Multi-Core and Single-Core scores as follows: Single-Core Scores: 1,600 (estimated)Multi-Core Scores: 5,000 (estimated)The estimated Multi-Core scores are so impressive that they can outperform the company\u2019s 13-inch MacBook pro. New leaks reveal the beta resting results of the upcoming A14 Bionic: Single-Core Scores: 1,658Multi-Core Scores: 4,612The comparison with Snapdragon 865 and 865 Plus looks sheepish. The average Geekbench scores for the vanilla Snapdragon 865 are: Single-Core Scores: 923Multi-Core Scores: 3,267Even if you decide to boost the Snapdragon 865 Plus, these are the results: Single-Core Scores: 973Multi-Core Scores: 3,346In the benchmark scores, the A14 Bionic lights up its cigar with the dragon\u2019s fire:  GPU Performance: The GPU performance is no different story. Since the A14\u2019s GPU is expected to have 50% better graphics performance over the A13 Bionic chip; there will be significant improvements. As per the current situation of Snapdragon vs Apple, the SD 865 and A13 Bionic are almost similar in gaming performance. Hence shifting to Apple A14 Bionic Chip will bring many more gaming and GPU improvement than the Snapdragon 865 and 865 Plus. The Snapdragon 865 Plus is however a bit better than the normal 865 with 10% faster graphic rendering through an overclocked Adreno 650. There! Now you nearly have all the information to declare the results yourself. Or you could wait a little longer, declare the results and do a victory dance too. ",

            "answer_text": "Answer edited 17/09/2020 5G : A14 is rumoured to be getting a 5G modem integrated and thus brings 5G to iPhone. It\u2019s not necessarily better, but what we will have to see what Apple implements. Sub6GHz or mmWave 5G.A14 has the same hexa core layout as A13, but due to 5nm, more transistors per core and thus overall. It will be better for efficient battery use and much better multi-core performance like in games and AR.5nm process : This is the big news. And most probably, first in class 5nm architecture on a mobile SoC. It\u2019ll give a boost to the single core, and thus, multicore. It will allow better neural engine and GPU. Overall, this is the biggest advantage over the SD865.The whopping 16 core neural engine on A14 jumps ahead of qualcomm once again, further widening the gap between A series and SD\u2019s AI performance.",
