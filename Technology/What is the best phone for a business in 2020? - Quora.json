            "answer_text": "It is a big concept to say which phone is the best for business. I would only leave four features that I considered important or vital to a business phone. Great signal design and dual actual SIM for convenience.Great battery life plus decent quick charge.Good multitasking capability, include 2 apps open altogether without interfere any of other.Light, not more than half pound include case and sim card and other things like screen protector.Plus, there are different kind of business guys. Entrepreneurs/startup creators, Boss/property owner/fortune manager Serious worker Confidential guys By and large, I suppose there are 4 models can be considered as BEST business phone. OPPO Ace 2: 865+X55 plus 12GB LPDDR5 means the BEST available performance by far. Plus, it would support dual SIM, 185grams body weight, less than half pound include a case and screen protector. 65W/40W/18W Charging make it just perfect for those super busy folks. Always ready, to go for work. It works the best for entrepreneurs and startups. As they may make a call by another call. Ace2 would never stop as they need it. 5min(a cup of coffee and wash your face and your phone refresh from 0% to 25%). All other quick charge just like a joke versus this one.Huawei Mate30Pro, MPen support would be a good benefit to do things like DocuSign. Good for bosses. Steady and clean look, leather edition if needed. Great netowrk support plus Huawei Tijiatong(only good for Huawei device, you can utilize their network at any corner of the world without sim, just like a plan B)iPhone11Pro plus Blackberry UES setup, it would feature a great ecp system for your IT team to manage everything to elude possible data leaking. Great iOS plus awesome blackberry service equals to confidence about your safety.Sony Xperia 5: Light, speedy and harsh life rugged. Startup folks can show up at any place. To suffer and create something great. A 164 grams machine give you less burden bit great possibilities. IP68, good weight and dual SIM card works.Above ",

            "answer_text": "I assume you are a business owner and want to manage your data on your phone as well. I would suggest you to wait for Samsing Galaxy Note 20\u2026 or 11\u2026 or whatever they will name it this year. I have used a lot of phones\u2026 and I mean a LOT o phones. The one phone I would use to manage my student/business data is Samsung\u2019s Note lineup. They really are best for managing business data. If you cannot wait for this year\u2019s Note, then go with Note 10 or if you also want a headphone jack, then go with a Note 9. Don\u2019t go below that. Of course, this is my opinion. I categorize every phone I use so that picking a phone for myself to use daily or to manage my business data or for non-tech savvy or for tech savvy etc becomes easy. And Note series has been on top of my management list for a while now. Other alternative (of course in my opinion) would be OnePlus 7 Pro. Don\u2019t spend more on 7T or 7T pro or 8 or 8 Pro. 7 pro is on par with them and costs a lot less. Good luck. ",
