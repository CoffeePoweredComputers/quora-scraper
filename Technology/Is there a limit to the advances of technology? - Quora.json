            "answer_text": "Many have said there is no limit to technology. Consider the definition of Technology given in Encyclopedia Britannica 2007 \u201cThe application of scientific knowledge to the practical aims of human life or\u2026. to the change and manipulation of the human environment.\u201d Given this definition , it is impossible to tell if if there really is no limit to technology or whether we are limited by our present knowledge of science and technology as well as our imagination. Present science and technology determine our imagination of future technology as much as future technology is determined by present imagination and available science and technology. Take the concept of traveling faster than light. This idea was inconceivable before (a) light was seen to have a finite speed and(b) The speed of light was seen as limiting for all bodies with a rest mass. First of all why would we want to travel faster than light , if that is ever going to be possible (using \u201cwormholes\u201d or whatever exotic laws of physics, presently available or awaiting discovery)? The answer is a no brainer! We imagine ourselves traveling to galaxies far far away as they do in Star Trek and Star Wars. It is possible that will happen in the far future. What I think is likely though assuming the same rate of development in science and technology we have seen in the past 500 years or so is that priorities will be different 500 years from now and we will have technologies we cannot possibly imagine today . To illustrate the point above,imagine telling someone in 1516 that in 2016 I will be able to type this article on my laptop linked to Quora (via a wifi connection to a \u201chotspot\u201d) and get it sent virtually instantly to anyone anywhere in the world, or able to fly say from London to New York in 7 hours or so (commercial flights).Radio waves had not been discovered in 1516 and internet technology was nowhere in sight!Even airships did not exist in 1516,let alone jet propelled aircraft. The idea of practically instantaneous worldwide communication via internet and international flight was inconceivable even to those with the most fertile imagination in 1516 , unless , of course they were thinking of witchcraft and witches flying using broomsticks! Fast forward to 2016 and you find that it is nice to dream about wormholes and FTL (faster than light) travel. However just as much as what we can do now is beyond the imagination of someone living in 1516,we cannot possibly imagine what will be possible in 2516 using science and technology that will be commonly available by then,but whose possible existence we cannot even begin to imagine now .

            "answer_text": "The short answer is simply No. I know why you feel this way\u2026 The iPhone and smartphones seem to have given a lot of people the wrong impression that we have hit the limit. Also the self proclaimed end of Moore\u2019s Law has given a lot of people cold feet about technology so it seems. And online articles like this one from the New York Times often from time to time play a huge role in convincing people about the great end of technology. www.nytimes.com/2016/12/07/technology/personaltech/the-gadget-apocalypse-is-upon-us.html But the real truth is\u2026 Technology is the net result of the apparent human problems to be solved. So ask yourself this\u2026 Have we reached the end of all human problems?  If the answer to this question is Yes\u2026 I believe there won\u2019t be a need to make extra more technology because there won\u2019t be demand or useful use of it\u2026 and remember great technology is expensive to make and no one in their rightful mind will pay to produce technology which will never be used. On the other hand if the answer is No\u2026This simply means there will be more technological innovations to be proposed and invented to solve these problems\u2026 However this does not necessarily imply that we need more human problems to have more technology\u2026 It is that human problems tend to push us more to invent innovative technology to overcome them. There has been many technologies invented for the sole purpose of entertaining human beings or fulfilling their curiosity or making the earth better for other living things. For example when the Apollo 11 team decided to work hard to reach the moon\u2026 They were not problem driven and they certainly did not do it for the purpose of entertainment. But it was a challenge that it has never been done before and there was enough curiosity from all human beings at that particular time. Remember technology has to be invented first for the sole purpose of solving a particular problem and this invention needs innovation to be better and to be extended\u2026 and innovation simply means \u201cGo ahead and invent it and i will come through later and do some thinking to make it much better\u2026\u201d In other words innovation make technology inventions live forever because innovation is infinite\u2026 Innovation simply says he or she who sees things better or has the better idea is our hero. In other words Edison invented the light bulb\u2026 but it needed innovators to be extended and it still needs innovators so that it can be improved to be energy efficient or self sustainable for example. The same went for the Wright brothers when the flew the first manned air flight\u2026 So in short innovation makes an invention live forever. The golden rule here is simply that for as long as there exist human beings and human problems there will be technology invented to solve and overcome those problems and innovation will born as the net result to make these inventions to live forever. In summary*** We will never reach the limit of technology\u2026 The limit will be reached when the human race ceases to exist. IMAGE CREDIT - http://goo.gl/NS9qyY \u2014- Hope Mogale ",
