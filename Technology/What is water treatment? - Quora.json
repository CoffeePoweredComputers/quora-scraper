            "answer_text": "Hii ,Drinking water sources are subject to contamination and require appropriate treatment to remove disease-causing agents. Public drinking water systems use various methods of water treatment to provide safe drinking water for their communities. Today, the most common steps in water treatment used by community water systems (mainly surface water treatment) include:  Figure courtesy of EPA Coagulation and FlocculationCoagulation and flocculation are often the first steps in water treatment. Chemicals with a positive charge are added to the water. The positive charge of these chemicals neutralizes the negative charge of dirt and other dissolved particles in the water. When this occurs, the particles bind with the chemicals and form larger particles, called floc.SedimentationDuring sedimentation, floc settles to the bottom of the water supply, due to its weight. This settling process is called sedimentation.FiltrationOnce the floc has settled to the bottom of the water supply, the clear water on top will pass through filters of varying compositions (sand, gravel, and charcoal) and pore sizes, in order to remove dissolved particles, such as dust, parasites, bacteria, viruses, and chemicals.DisinfectionAfter the water has been filtered, a disinfectant (for example, chlorine, chloramine) may be added in order to kill any remaining parasites, bacteria, and viruses, and to protect the water from germs when it is piped to homes and businesses",

            "answer_text": "Water Treatment is a process through which the quality of water is improved to make it more acceptable for specific end-use. The end-use may be drinking water, river flow maintenance, water recreation or many more other uses. Through water treatment, Contaminants and undesirable components are removed and it reduces its concentration so that the water becomes more useful and fit for its end-use. Some applications of water treatment: Drinking water treatmentRural Water TreatmentUrban Water treatmentWastewater treatmentDrinking-Water Treatment: The treatment of drinking water involves the removal of the contaminant that should be pure enough for human consumption without the risk of any adverse health effect. Drinking water is also treated with electro chlorination. Water chlorination through the electro chlorination involves producing Sodium hypochlorite. It is also known as Bleach. In simple words, introducing an electric current into water containing salt. The bleach that we get during water chlorination can be diluted and is used to disinfect water containing salt and it makes water safe to drink. ",
