            "answer_text": "Let me propose a counter-question: what kind of performance do you expect from a 5W device, compared to a 750W device? Because that is exactly what you are doing here. You are trying to use a 5W Raspberry Pi the same way other people use 750W desktop computers! Just think about it for 2 seconds. You are basically trying to use a snail against a Ferrari! Take your time and think about it. A RASPBERRY PI IS NOT A DESKTOP COMPUTER! It\u2019s a PHONE! The technology in the Raspberry Pi is that of a smartphone. Not metaphorically. Literally! Even if you used the Raspberry Pi 3+, which is the newest generation single board computer of the Raspberry line, there are tablets and smartphones out there, that outperform this thing! Some even easily. Ok\u2026 let me offer you a few details, to help you understand, what you are talking about: I own an octa-core Banana Pi M3. Meaning, that thing has literally TWICE the power of the Raspberry Pi in it. Twice the CPU, twice the RAM\u2026 it\u2019s basically two Raspberry Pi 3 in one device. One of my desktop computers has a CPU with 6 cores of 2.8GHz each. So, a total of 16.8GHz, right? The Banana Pi M3 has 8 cores with 2GHz each, which makes a total of 16GHz. 16.8 / 16 = 1.05 => that\u2019s a 5% difference in performance, right? Well, my desktop PC performed a Python calculation in 4 hours. I took over the EXACT SAME application to the Banana Pi M3 and ran it there. An guess how long it took. Roughly 4.5 hours, right? 5% more. WRONG! It took 19 hours! Almost 5 times as long. Not enough? No problem. Let\u2019s talk storage performance\u2026 Out of your average SSD you would get what reading speed? 450MB/s? Ok. So, out of your average HDD, the reading speed would be? 180MB/s? 130MB/s? 115MB/s for a 2.5 inch laptop hard disk? The reading speed for the Banana Pi M3 EMMC is a max. of 75MB/s. But the Raspberry Pi doesn\u2019t have EMMC. So, the maximum reading speed for the SD card in the Banana Pi is under 23MB/s. The maximum reading speed of an SD card in a Raspberry Pi is under 20MB/s. Actually, it\u2019s usually more than 10% under 20MB/s. Do i actually have to compare RAM? Not only size, but also speed? Which by the way is also shared for the graphics chip on a Raspberry Pi? Ok, so let\u2019s talk USB. The recommended power supply for a Raspberry Pi is 2A. The Raspberry Pi usually has 4 USB ports, right? These USB ports are usually USB 2.0 (which a maximum reading speed of approx. 45MB/s. More likely under 35MB/s). Do you know the power specifications for USB 2.0? USB 2.0 takes up to 500mA PER PORT. 500mA x 4 = 2A. What was the recommended power supply again? Ups\u2026 2A. That could be tight. Well, according to specifications, the Raspberry Pi actually delivers a max. of 1200mA to the USB ports. If one uses up to 500mA, what does that tell us? The power is not even enough for THREE of the ports. Even less so for four of them. I could go on and on. I guess I have to go into RAM too. This is too good to pass. What\u2019s your average RAM load for the operating system without applications. For Linux it\u2019s 250 to 450MB. The Raspberry Pi3 has 1GB of RAM. So, 250\u2013450MB from the operating system. Plus the memory for the graphics chip. Now, let\u2019s add a browser. Something useful, like Chromium or Firefox, right? So, that would add like 300 to 400MB to that. And every single tab you open\u2026 websites, content, media not added\u2026 uses an addtional 50MB. Where are we? Did it already explode? So, are you going to use emails and images and applications and Youtube videos and video streaming on the Pi and maybe learn a bit coding? I don\u2019t think so! I could actually go a lot further. Because the Banana doesn\u2019t output 2GHz either. And if you run applications and calculations from a USB thumb drive, it actually powers down within a few minutes. The same happens, as soon as you plugin in 2 USB devices\u2026 BTW, the Raspberry Pi3 runs like 15\u00b0C hotter than the Raspberry Pi2 out of the box. So, you are going to see the funny thermometer in the upper right corner a lot ;) In case you don\u2019t know what that means, you might want to google it! THE RASPBERRY PI IS A DEVELOPMENT BOARD, NOT A DESKTOP COMPUTER! A 5W DEVICE WILL NEVER PERFORM LIKE A 500 or 700W DEVICE! Are you sure, you want that as \u201cdaily driver\u201d? Which one is the best? Well, obviously the most powerful you can find and only with massive cooling. Does that make it a good idea now? NOOOOOOOO!!! ",

            "answer_text": "For a few years I used to use a RaspberryPi 2, with LibraOffice as an \u201cevery day\u201d computer. It worked really well for 90% of daily tasks, I want doing any dev work at the time\u2026 All I needed was a web browser, a decent command line (for some DB admin stuff) and an office suite. So without question if you were to get the RaberryPi 3+ (the current version) it is quite a bit more powerful (and the OS significantly improved) and would be a very capable \u201cdaily driver\u201d. That said I\u2019m too mobile at the moment to be able to rely on a desktop machine, so no RaspberryPi really meets my need at this time. ",
