We could reduce the severity of disasters perhaps & avoid social collapse & our extinction if we were to stop the burning of fossil fuels NOW, but this is not going to happen. Society will likely collapse withing the next few decades, & the human race could be extinct by the end of the 21st century.

            "answer_text": "As often seems to be the case with futurist predictions, this one seems just a tad overblown. I am more worried about the real existential threat of climate change than the remote possibilities that any world government could impose a global totalitarian regime. As things stand now, it is difficult enough for federal systems, which are the best hope for a global authority, to maintain their stability In the face of various resistances from peripheral authorities representing local interests or empty-headed xenophobias. The prospect of global corporatist order is more immediate but tempered somewhat by market forces that already appear to have many companies taking stands on policies over which they have considerable influence but no real legitimate control.
