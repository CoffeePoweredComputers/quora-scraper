            "answer_text": "Can you please be more specific ? RAM is independent of the Processor. The inly thing that matters in a RAM is Motherboard Compatibility. Some Motherboards higher clock speed RAM. Some do support but after a little bit of tweaking. If you're asking about the size then that's also independent of the Processor. You can any RAM from any Seller. As long as the Speeds and Profiles are supported you're good to go. Try One of these. Corsair Vengeance SeriesG-Skill Ripjaw SeriesKingston Hyper X seriesDDR3 is outdated now. Better get a DDR4 stick for Future Proofing. Make sure your Motherboard supports DDR4 Memory. Hope this Helps. ",

            "answer_text": "If it is a 32 bit OS 4 GB RAM would be sufficient but for an 64 bit you need more than that. It also depends on what work you perform like for documentation, editing and other simple text work, 3\u20134 GB RAM would easily suffice but for multitasking and programming workload you need a 8 GB RAM without letting your P.C to wait and think of an operation which make you very irritating. For gaming purpose you might need more than 8 GB. Hope this will make you decide. ",
