            "answer_text": "There are currently 3 versions of Wi-Fi used in phones : Wi-Fi 4, aka 802.11n. Works at 2.4GHz frequency band. Has best range. Speed up to 600Mbps. Supports MIMO.Wi-Fi 5, aka 802.11ac. Works at 5GHz frequency band. Has less range. Speed up to 3466Mbps. Supports MU-MIMO for downlink.Wi-Fi 6, aka 802.11ax. Works at 6GHz frequency band (but has capability to work on lower bands too). Has less range (when used at 6GHz band). Speed up to 9600Mbps. Supports MU-MIMO for downlink and uplink too. WPA3 Encryption available.Note: The actual speed depends on signal strength, number of antennae, number of devices connected. E.g., a single device connected to a 9Gbps Wi-Fi 6 Router will not get 9Gbps speed even if there's no more device connected to it. The max speed is for router's capability to send (and/or receive) that amount of data to (and/or from) multiple devices simultaneously (known as throughput). ",
