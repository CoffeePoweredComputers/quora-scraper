            "answer_text": "Huge. In some states, I expect to see as much as 5% of the vote will be blatantly suppressed. This is not hyperbole. We have already seen that the Republican appointees on the US Supreme Court are quite happy with state laws that create a poll tax, in obvious violation of 24th Amendment. Let\u2019s remember that the Florida case disenfranchises 1,400,000 people. The last six presidential elections have handed victories to Florida Republicans by margins FAR smaller than that. Why the Hell Is the Supreme Court Allowing a New Poll Tax to Disenfranchise Florida Voters? We have seen multiple states, mostly Republican ones, go to extreme lengths to remove occasional voters from registration rolls GOP voter purges in Wisconsin and Georgia could tip the 2020 election We have seen blatant and egregious efforts in a handful of states to simply prevent people from registering at all. New Voting Restrictions in America We have seen egregious examples of Republican run counties making last minute changes to polling locations seemingly designed to prevent low income voters from successfully and safely voting Southern U.S. states have closed 1,200 polling places in recent years: rights group We have seen Governor after Governor respond to a successful mail-in primary election with a commitment to absolutely not allow mail-in voting in the general election in the fall. States weigh vote-by-mail options amid Trump and GOP opposition Does COVID-19 mean more Missourians should vote absentee? Gov. Parson says no Many Wisconsin Republicans oppose expanding voting by mail, but 80% of state GOP legislators used absentee ballots in April Trump campaign sues Pennsylvania over mail-in voting and other election issues | PA Post http://www.williamsonherald.com/news/governor-will-not-allow-widespread-absentee-voting/article_a8018a54-948d-11ea-8fc3-e71d745a7b5a.html ",

            "answer_text": "The term voter suppression can be paired with the term systemic racism. No one can define them, and the people that have are complete clowns. How much of a role will ballot hoarding play in 2020? Florida Supreme Court ruled that anyone having with an outstanding balance due to criminal fines will be ineligible to vote until those fines are paid. So 740,000 will not be able to vote until they pay those fines. Seems like a large number, right. Think about how much is owed by those individuals, billions of dollars. Liberals will say that\u2019s voter suppression, I say that\u2019s how you run a state effectively. I hope they all pay and vote, honestly. Anyone can pull up a chart and say, this action leads to discrimination. Looking at some answers on here as some relate to the 2018 Georgia election , I just shake my head. Demanding proper identification to vote is not racism. Demanding you pay overdue fines is not racism. Imagine being a bouncer working the door. There\u2019s 16 people in line 14 Caucasian and 2 African American. If you ID all people, are you racist for IDing the 2 African Americans, or treating them like everyone.? Anyone who thinks republicans are the only one\u2019s who gerrymander, look at an LA schools district zoning map. Lol. ",
