            "answer_text": "Distributed systems are particularly complex, not for beginners. You need to know a lot about hardware, software, networks, infrastructure (platforms, distributed databases), and serious systems engineering. You can get a start at things in a good computer science program, but then you need some serious industrial experience before you can really tackle the design of a serious distributed system. ",

            "answer_text": "Few algorithms like DHT, consistent hashing, Paxos, chord may help you know theory. Use and apply Akka, Spark, Storm on HDFS or any other DFS using a sample dataset available on Data.gov - keep it simple, try and do a simple computation - like sorting a billion numbers for the sample, calculating average maybe, later if you are feeling slightly more adventurous try histograms and percentiles using combination of either of frameworks, if you want to go even further after some adventurous time, try spark Mlib or tensor flow. Application of theory brings out practicality to theory in general. After trying, read up a bit on algorithms, datacenters and hardware as such. ",
