            "answer_text": "Technology enhances the way we integrate and operate in our lives today. It has become an integral part of how we do things since most of the manpower these days has shifted to the use of machines and computers. It is why many schools are integrating computers to try and ease the way learning is being taught in schools but, what role should it play in education? Use of technology in learning has been there for a long period of time. It was early used with children who have special needs such as the deaf and blind. Many of these children have been using brail machines which have eased the way they have to communicate and learn whenever they are in the classroom. Most of these programs put in place are known to assist special needs children who are born with conditions that require this sort of care. It is with these thoughts that technology has been touted to helping bridge the gap between normal students with the ones that require special care. Education is undoubtedly a key element in the life of a person. Technology, on the other hand, has made it easier for students to access learning materials by having a direct link to the coursework and the lecturer from whichever location they are in. it has been made possible using applications that help make the above process a true reality. Technology if used correctly helps developers create applications that can be useful to in defining the career path of children to whatever passion they want to achieve. It helps teachers and learners integrate successfully and in an effective way of giving students to connect and share information with their peers in classrooms. It is known to give students an opportunity to interact with their teachers and students which helps sprout some ingenious ideas which can make learning interesting to the students. Students constantly engage with their instructors as technology helps make them intrigued to whatever they are learning. It is evident that many households have gadgets such as smartphones and tablets with which many of the children have grown with becoming accustomed since they use it in their daily lives. Integrating technology with education seems like a better idea and thus help the students become accustomed to the system easily. It should be noted that the traditional system of learning is now broken which helps the class teacher or the coach become more aware of a child\u2019s emotions and attitudes to their learning encouraging students to have direct engagements which help students understand and can easily share their opinions. Learning in schools needs to be lively and interactive and with the use of technology, students can access incredible opportunities that they can learn and gain more interest in. With technology integrated with learning, it brings with them passion which makes learning wonderful. ",

            "answer_text": "In the 21st century technology plays the most crucial in education, the world is moving at a very fast pace and things are changing within the blink of an eye. Whereas talking about education it is the most important thing to sustain for in a human\u2019s life, technology and education nowadays are interrelated. With the ongoing prevail of coronavirus, people are forced to stay inside their houses and do work/studies from home itself, while it has proven to be a curse for some people it has changed the world completely and has changed the conventional definitions of various things one of them being education. universities and colleges around the world are conducting online classes. Nobody in the pre-corona time has ever thought that anything of such sort would be possible, though there was distance learning it was looked down upon and now people are forced to follow just that. Now there is a new trend of online certificate courses which provide rich information and knowledge in a course for some amount of money, while universities like Harvard charge 10\u201320k for such courses Indian universities and organizations charge much less and give value added courses and the students can choose as per their course requirement. Online platforms like Byju\u2019s etc. also provide comprehensive study material for school-going children. by providing video illustrations and classes as per convenience makes it easy for the students to study despite their busy schedule. The ideal role of technology is to provide comprehensive and wholesome education because a user is paying for the education and the courses should be valued/skill adding. It also depends on the motivation and capacity of a person that how much he/she can grasp that information. I have personally seen people/students who have enhanced their skill set as well as education qualifications by taking the help of technology and the kinds of resources it provides. At last, it depends on the will, the motivation of a person that in which sense he/she wants to use the technology. Hope this answer helps. ",
