            "answer_text": "They can make the next version more successful by making a few important design improvements. While they sound great they have several flaws that need to be addressed: The ear pieces need substantially better air ventilation. These earbuds trap way too much moisture in the ear canal leading to earaches and other moisture build-up problems. I can only wear them in very short intervals and then must let my ears air out. I\u2019ve never had this problem with my wired pair of Bose earbuds which are much better at air ventilation.The Airpods take way too long to connect. In some cases, one or both earpieces won\u2019t connect at all. This is usually solved by placing the earpiece back into the case and pulling it back out again. It\u2019s a small problem, but it\u2019s a hassle.Fails to properly interact with the iPhone during a call. Because of #2, I\u2019ve found that when a call comes in, the iPhone has a bad habit of placing the call into the iPhone\u2019s built-in earpiece rather than sending the audio through Bluetooth even when the Airpods were already connected. I then have to wrestle with the Airpods and the iPhone for about 30 seconds to get the Airpods to connect the call\u2019s audio. All the while, the person on the other end of the phone is like ??? That they can\u2019t reliably be used for the first minute of a call is probably one of the most frustrating things about the Airpods.Occasionally, the Airpods forgot their tap programming. I program it to play/pause on the right and Siri on the left. When this stops working, tapping does absolutely nothing. The most reliable way to fix this is to go into the Bluetooth settings and touch the setup for each earpiece. Sometimes even this doesn\u2019t work and you have to reboot the phone.Dropouts. While I realize they are Bluetooth, I find that even when the phone is within 12\u2033 from the Airpods, they can still experience dropouts and skipping playback. I\u2019ve only noticed this on some of the most recent updates to iOS 11 and with iOS 12.A way to connect a string or straps without weighing down the earpieces. Most aftermarket straps add substantial weight to the Airpods which pull on the earpieces and can eventually pull them out of your ears. If Apple had simply added small holes or a ring at the bottom to thread a string through, this weight problem can be avoided.A thin metal sensor that runs down the side of one or both earpieces. When you slide your finger down it, you can adjust the volume up or down. Not being able to adjust the volume directly from the earpieces is the second of its most frustrating flaws.Occasionally, the ear detection stops working. When you pull an earpiece from your ear, it simply continues playing. Fixing these unreliability problems should be at the top of Apple\u2019s list.Adding silicone earpiece covers would make them a whole lot more comfortable to wear and provide more reliable aiming of the audio into the ear. The hard plastic eventually causes the ear cartilage to become sore.",

            "answer_text": "What can Apple do to improve on the success of the AirPods? Answer: make their fit adjustable to cater for different ears. I haven\u2019t gone back to using wired earphones or headphones since I bought my AirPods. You really don\u2019t appreciate the benefits of wireless earphones until you\u2019ve tried them. So light that you barely notice, no noise mechanically communicated through the wires, no tangles, no having to route them around and through your clothing, no getting caught on something as you walk past, etc, etc. Not to mention the fabulous design that\u2019s gone into the charger case, the ability of the AirPods to sense when they\u2019re in place, the functions you get by tapping, and almost seamless integration with the macOS and iOS operating systems recognising when you put them in, take them out, etc, etc. But they don\u2019t fit my ears in their intended orientation (the pods, not the ears!). They\u2019re loose to the point of being useless, not effectively communicating audio to my eardrums, no noise isolation, and that's on the rare occasion they stay in at all. To make them fit I have to twist them around so that the ends point diagonally up and back. Then they\u2019re perfect, except of course I can\u2019t use the microphones and I get the odd second glance when using them in public! It\u2019s a bit ironic to put all this amazing design into a product whilst apparently overlooking such a basic need. I wonder how many people would like AirPods but they don\u2019t have them as they simply don\u2019t fit? And how many people that do have them are really not getting the best out of them? I bet it\u2019s the majority of the potential market. This is surely a case where one size fits, well, only quite a small percentage of the human population, especially when accurate fit is so important for audio quality and comfort. Sort it out please Apple! Alternative silicon rubber fittings are all that\u2019s needed. They would also help to keep the AirPods clean by being removable and washable. You could even have a premium custom fit option. ",
