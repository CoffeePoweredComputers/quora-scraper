            "answer_text": "I like to think about this in terms of so-called \u201cnarrow AI\u201d and \u201cadvanced general intelligence.\u201d Narrow AI refers to a primitive (but rapidly developing) category of systems that excel at exactly one pursuit. They have achieved a savant-like status, completely useless except for one small thing that they do better than anyone. Consider how chess software can beat any human player, but couldn\u2019t tell you what time it was. Advanced general intelligence an academic term for a level of AI capability only seen in movies today. You might think of this as a bundle of narrow applications that work together to complete tasks, even if they are very complex. This isn\u2019t here yet, but a lot researchers hypothesize its arrival. ",
