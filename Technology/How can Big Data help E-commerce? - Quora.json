            "answer_text": " The amount of data that e-commerce companies collect is changing what we can to do for customers. Increasingly, commercials and ads are targeted to our specific demographics. You\u2019ve probably noticed that after you go shopping for a certain item online, your ads are suddenly all about that item. I remember watching TV as a kid, forced to sit through the same four commercials over and over during a one-hour show. It didn\u2019t matter if you were a boy or girl, if you were 7 or 12\u2014everyone saw the same commercials. Now, you can fast forward through commercials. That option wasn\u2019t always there, though. We\u2019ve come a long way since then. We can skip (almost all) commercials on TV and online. It\u2019s not a coincidence. It\u2019s big data at work. And the future of big data is going to benefit all. Using Data To Create A Better Experience Data impacts every aspect of the e-commerce landscape. At ThirdLove, our data affects how we develop products, create the customer journey, and ensure that our customers have a great experience. Everything revolves around that. Sometimes women ask me how we\u2019re able to find them the right bra size using the Fit Finder on our website. With around six million women going through it, we\u2019ve got quite a bit of data to help find the right size. And that\u2019s where the power of big data really lies for e-commerce\u2014it creates a better experience. For example, we\u2019ve collected approximately 75 million data points just from our Fit Finder quiz. We use that data to influence nearly every aspect of our business. Each woman who takes the quiz adds something to it and makes our recommendations smarter. E-commerce companies all have massive amounts of data at their disposal, and it\u2019s changing how they interact with customers. Tracking Preferences Think of when someone walks into a brick and mortar store. The sales associate on the floor doesn\u2019t know who they are or what they need. They don\u2019t know if that customer is primed to buy, or if they\u2019re going to three more stores after this one to compare prices. It\u2019s very difficult for them to know all of that. But these types of things are apparent when customers shop online. If they allow cookies, then the company knows where they came from. They know if the customer saw an ad on Facebook or clicked on an email offer. They know if that customer has visited the site before, put something in their cart, and then backed out. It\u2019s all available. This type of tracking allows e-commerce companies to target consumers who are of a certain age, who have a certain income, who like these types of products. They don\u2019t engage every single person who might wander into the store, or those who aren\u2019t interested in buying. That enables companies to spend their money more effectively. Instead of putting up a billboard in Times Square and hoping the right people see it, they\u2019re using data to target the right consumers at the right times. And that\u2019s good for the customer, too. Catering To Customers Sometimes a woman will come to our website, take our Fit Finder quiz, and then decide not to buy anything. When she comes back, the calls to action for the Fit Finder will be gone. In its place, she might see products that fit her shape or size\u2014specific content that\u2019s adapted for women like her. Big data allows us to personalize the customer journey by intelligently segmenting our customer base. It isn\u2019t 100% personalized to each individual, like many think. But with so many data points to draw from, we can tailor content to certain types of customers. It\u2019s more personal, and it makes sense from our standpoint and the customers. Our customers tell us: We want you to know who we are. They want to come back to our site and have an experience that reflects their previous visits. They want to get an email that talks about their preferred style and size. Without big data, we couldn\u2019t create that personalized experience. Big data is the next frontier in e-commerce, but its uses revolve around one key question: Are you delivering value to your customer? It all revolves around creating a better digital experience than what they can get in a store. We\u2019re that point, and big data is going to take us even further. ",

            "answer_text": "Big data has been affecting the business practices radically in the last couple of years. The convergence of marketing technology and big data is now preparing the ground for target-oriented practices in e-commerce. Effective use of big data can as well translate into higher conversion rates for online retailers. How can big data help to increase conversion rates? Pricing: One of the factors influencing online shopping decision process is the price. For every product, merchants should be able to find the optimal price that an online visitor is willing to pay. This is only possible by listening to visitor data, segmenting visitors and automating the pricing process. Product Recommendations: Whether it\u2019s a clickstream behaviour or a customer review posted on a product detail page, the product recommender system uses several data sources to predict a single user\u2019s next best action. Being able to understand the visitor\u2019s taste profile and purchase intention ensures higher conversion rates for that e-commerce website. SEO: Thanks to big data, (and specifically Google Analytics, Google Webmaster Tools and other website analytics solutions) SEOs can optimize keywords, backlinks, and other important areas of search to optimize their site\u2019s conversion rates.
