            "answer_text": "As a teacher, I came across this question quite often from parents, and sometimes from students (often after they botched up their tests) I have seen all variety of students, some with basic phones, some with smartphones, some are without phones (believe me!) Some talk hours on their feature phones, some don't check their iPhones even once in a day, and there are logs of missed calls, unread messages whenever they open. Some give up phones only to pick up Facebook, WhatsApp, Quora, or start hanging out with friends, or start mobile photography. Point is, there are various ways to kill time, phone isn't the only weapon to do it. One who's determined will find a way. ;) For a student it's not useful to run away from phone at first place, but to run towards studies. Get yourself some targets, take interest in the subject, look at the consequences of good grades vs bad grades. More your attract to your studies and to your goal, everything else will fall in place. Including your use of mobile phones.  Having said that, also note that mobile is an avenue which offers quickest way to indulge away from studies. So it has highest success rate of distracting people from studies. Some say that knife is just a tool, and whether it's good or bad depends on whether a criminal gets it or surgeon. But Knife shouldn't be blamed. Similarly smartphones shouldn't be blamed, but a student should be blamed for wasting time in it. But I disagree a bit. What happens when you give knife in hands of mentally unstable person. Will he likely do something good with it? Similarly many students lack determination and focus to their goals, and once they have access to possibilities offered by smartphones, they forget their goals even faster. More often then not, smartphone is counterproductive. I am yet to find some study-critical use of smartphone for students. I should add that to not socialise will be counterproductive. But what we do on a mobile phone isn't socialisation or knowledge gathering most of the time. That barely qualifies as chatting, or information gathering. So Tl;dr version is, whether mobile is good or bad for student should ideally depend on the student, many have it but don't waste time, many don't have it but still waste time. But practically, those who have it, tend to waste their time more then those who don't have it. ",

            "answer_text": "VERY harmful. According to a New York Times article, teens and younger students who are using cellphones and texting are replacing the use of drugs with the cellphones. Medical schools are learning that they can't get away from cellphones and texting and can't quit using them anywhere. They become addicted and this causes them to not be aware of their surroundings, be able to talk to people, sleep, do classwork and listen to teachers or college professors and drive safely. There are too many teens being killed, killing someone else, or putting themselves in dangerous situations while --driving. But, unfortunately, teens will not listen to this and will start a fight with their parents as to why they can't get a cell phone or text. ",
