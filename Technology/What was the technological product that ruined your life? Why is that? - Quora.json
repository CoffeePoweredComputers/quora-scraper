            "answer_text": "One of the technological products that ruin my life is the mobile phone . With all the blessings that the technology brought us there is also a curse hidden within it. So also technology is helpful to us in many ways, such as it reduces labour, save much time and energy. So also is mobile. But it seems that I am very much addicted to it. Instead of I being the master, I have become a slave to it. In the morning when I wake up I would take my mobile and start to google for breaking news and so on. See how much time I have wasted, I could have done something very useful and productive, say I could have used the time excercising and keep my self fit and healthy. Same will happen throughout the day and before going to bed with no profit at all. I could have spent the time by chatting with my family members or friends. It seems as if my social life is being snatched from me, which is very sad indeed. It ruins my social life, my time,it controls me instead of me controlling it. Although I can enjoy the world at my fingertips but I am losing the charm of living.. ",
