            "answer_text": "Yes, it definitely is. Overheard in the gym locker room the other day, spoken by typical gym guy, \"That's not exercising. You're just [blah blah blah...] I politely corrected him with something like the following. Snowboarding requires balancing with the core, articulating with the feet, stabilizing with nearly the entire body, flexing and extending the legs, use of arms and core to stand up, and counteracting the force of gravity multiplied by velocity (= squats), etc. I started instructing again this season a few weeks ago and have lost significant weight, legs starting to feel like tree trunks, core is transforming, and have had major protein cravings for repair and building muscle. So yes, it's serious  exercise, great outdoor fun and an effective mindfulness exercise as well by forcing you to pay 100% attention to what's happening.  ",

            "answer_text": "Snowboarding is one heck of an amazing exercise! Plus, it is extremely fun! One person told me before that \u201cAll you are doing is sliding down a mountain, that\u2019s not exercise\u201d This statement could be further from the truth! Even being a personal trainer, my first time snowboarding had my body was wrecked afterwards lol! I did plenty of balance and stability training prior to my first time riding, but nothing other than the mountain will work your body as hard. Although, through my vast experience from coaching clients, and knowing how my body moves on a snowboard, I developed some training routines that will help prepare you for your first time out on the mountain. I\u2019ve created an entire series on how to snowboard, and am even creating many training videos on how to exercise to get better at snowboarding. Feel free to try this workout at home as it will prepare you for getting up and down from the ground. This is especially crucial to having the strength and mobility to get up off the ground as it will require a lot of energy to do so if you are not used to it.  Feel free to subscribe to my Youtube channel and turn on post notifications so you never miss any of my latest content. I will work on providing as much value as I can to improving your ability on how to exercise, eating healthy, improving your mobility, and even offering helpful snowboarding tutorials during the winter season :-) ",
