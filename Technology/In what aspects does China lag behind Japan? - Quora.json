            "answer_text": "At this point it is mostly a generational issue remaining. I do not believe China is lagging behind Japan at all. China has the capability to do everything Japan currently does, but better. However, while Japan is often associated with hi-tech and high margin production, China is instead associated with lower grade manufacturing \u2014 The stories of all those lottery winners ending up dead in 5 years illustrates that if you simply pluck a poor person into a rich setting, they will still be poor. But while we often focus on the education aspect, we often do not realize there is simply an innate necessity component as well. For example, the US objectively protects its environment better than China, but Chinese people hate the US natural environment biologically. We develop all sorts of weird problems, from pink eyes to leg dystrophy to stomach ulcers living in America. Sometimes a trip back to China, and bringing some plants and rocks, solves the issue. Other times we\u2019re just stuck with really unhealthy bodies for the rest of our lives. Does a person who is used to a bad environment automatically enjoy an objectively better environment? No! Now why do I bring this up? Because we need to remember that Chinese people who lived in abject poverty (that is, the ROC regime days pre-liberation) may still be alive. People who lived during the Mao days are also alive. And for the later leaders too obviously. These people simply can not stomach the new, better standards. Give these people money, and they will pay top dollar getting the older inferior stuff. This is the basis of the age old wisdom \u201c\u91d1\u7a9d\u94f6\u7a9d\u4e0d\u5982\u81ea\u5df1\u7684\u72d7\u7a9d\u201d \u2014 You see, this wasn\u2019t an issue in the currently high-income nations, because they developed slowly enough that the older generation, who needed inferior quality products, were able to die off as the nation moved up the value chain. But China has developed so fast the older people who need the older stuff are still alive! Think of how your grandparents probably much rather drive the old dusty 1970s pickup as opposed to the new Lexus or Accords. Now apply that to literally an entire nation, and all of its needs. This isn\u2019t constrained to just material goods of course. Mental things are included as well. Chinese propaganda is often derided as being bad, as if they are designed for the poor farmers of Mao\u2019s time. That\u2019s because they are! Those people are still alive! They actually need this kind of media. Give them more modern, more advanced media, and they simply won\u2019t understand it. (Of course, Confucianism itself also plays a heavy role in this too. American propaganda such as Hollywood often comes off as laughable cringe in Chinese too) \u2014 Now don\u2019t get me wrong. Our ancestors made heavy sacrifices for us. They gave the largest, juiciest piece of meat to us, and left themselves nothing but bare bones. We owe everything we have to them. And we\u2019ll gladly keep using archaic things if it helps our grandparents feel more comfortable. But as long as this older generation still lives on, China is compelled by market forces to cater to a market that desires things many younger folk may find out of date. ",

            "answer_text": "Chinas lag behind Japan is essentially on four points (a) Technological Edge - Japan has a Technological Edge over China. No matter how fast China is trying to catch up - Japan is still ahead. High End Manufacturing and High End Research and Development - is an Area where Japan is ahead of China. The Distance is getting shorter and shorter as China is spending billions on Research and Development but Japan had an almost 28 year advantage over China from 1964 to 1992 when thanks to being bankrolled with US Money - the Japanese made huge strides in manufacture from small cottage industries to mega corporations to billion dollar research.  Japanese focus on Engine Technology, Automobiles, Enterprise Servers, Robotics, MLAI etc in which they have a huge edge over China. China still focusses on Mass Manufacture of Mobile Phones or Laptops. Another 15 years to go experts predict before China can bridge the Gap. (b) Research Workforce - Dont get me wrong - China has superb researchers - just that Japan has better researchers. The Evolution of the Japanese Research is more long term and successful while the Evolution of the Chinese Researcher is more short term and less successful. The Chinese researcher is like Narendra Modis government. Always wants results in the shortest time and generally messes things up and lies about it in Global Times. This Attitude means that except Foreign Educated Researchers - most local researchers are Harried and work under tremendous pressure which automatically means very little innovation. (c) Uncle Sams Wallet - Japan has access to US Billions on Wall Street to this day. While people talk about US investments in China - they are a fraction of the investments in Japan, South Korea and Hong Kong. For every $ 1 that US invests in China - it invests $ 9.28 in Japan (I mean only in Technology and Manufacture and Local Markets - Not in the Financial Markets or Startups) Tomorrow a Chinese Tech Business needs money for R & D - It can raise say $ 200 Million in a month from Wall Street and Existing Chinese Businesses. A Japanese Businesses needs money for R & D - it can raise $ 500 Million in a week from 10 times the number of sources and investors. The US Government has the softest policies with Japan and the Harshest Policies with China (Its seriously admirable that even despite all that China has so many investors - taking the second spot to Japan in Asia)  (d) A Larger Sense of Freedom - Japan is a true democracy. One of the rare ones in Asia. In fact among the only handful of democracies in the world which are True (Even India is not a true democracy). It evolved gradually and slowly. First the Samurai ruled the others like Artisans, Merchants and Eta - then gradually from 1876 - the roots of democracy started - selective democracy, then total democracy and today their people are ready for democracy. You dont have too much rabble or dregs in Japan. This means Japan is always everybodys friend while China is always an enemy to many people.  Yet it is sure that American influence is huge in Japan. If America cuts off Japan - Japan will collapse. It has not protected its economy or currency from such a contingency. China on the other hand has adequate protections and once they begin to genuinely start Cryptocurrency - they will have an edge unlike anybody else. However that day is still around 10 years away. ",
