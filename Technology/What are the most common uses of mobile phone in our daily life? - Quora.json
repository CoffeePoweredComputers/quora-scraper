            "answer_text": "So many uses described in other answers here have absolutely no relation to the concept of telephony - it seems totally ridiculous to me. Let me remind you the definition of the telephone first Telephone - Wikipedia: \u201cA telephone, or phone, is a telecommunications device that permits two or more users to conduct a conversation when they are too far apart to be heard directly.\u201d I still fail to understand 1) why people like to combine unrelated functions within the same device, and 2) why they call it \u201ca phone\u201d. OK. What are the most common uses of mobile phone in our daily life? For me it depends on where I am: When I am at home or at my office, the mobile phone just replaces the classic wireline phone. I still use a wireline phone when calling short (7-digits) local numbers as it is cheaper than calling them from my mobile phone; but when calling other mobile numbers, it is both cheaper and also more convenient to dial them from my mobile phone (as I do not need to remember all 10 digits for every subscriber).When I am outside, I mainle use my mobile phone if I need to contact someone urgently (e.g. while visiting a supermarket, I can ask my wife of what she wants me to buy). And I also receive incoming calls, of course.When I am going to meet someone in the city - it is the case where mobile phones are especially useful! I can use it to contact the other party and to get know where that person is located exactly, if they are going to be late etc. Before cellphones were invented, it was much harder to arrange an outside meeting with someone, somehow we managed to meet in most of occasions - we just had to follow firmly the predefined time and location. However, when it a crowded place, that was extremely hard.Similar to the previous case: when I am with someone in the city, and we suddenly lost each other. Before cellphones were invented, in many cases it could be extremely difficult to find each other - sometimes we even had to part until some other day. Thank you, mobile phone!When travelling (business trip or vacation), a mobile phone is very useful to keep in touch with your family and friends - in previous times I had to look for a nearest long-distance phone booth to let others know I had reached my destination safely.There are mainly 2 cases when I find SMS messages useful: The other party is busy or does not answer the call, but I need to leave some important information. Instead of trying to call them again and again, I can drop an SMS message, and I am sure they read it when they are free.If I need to pass some specific information (like a password, a phone number, a not widely-known name etc.) it is easier to send it by SMS rather than reciting by voice.",
