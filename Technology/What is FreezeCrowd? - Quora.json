            "answer_text": "FreezeCrowd is a soon to be launching social networking site for college students and alumni with a real purpose.  The concept was originally envisioned 11 years ago as I was looking at my freshman picture book, so I'm following through with my dreams. My original idea was an interactive sticker book that students would connect to the Web with a device, yet threw out the sticker book idea for an online version.  The concept is unique in the way that it connects people through the wisdom of the crowd in a group photo.  The name itself is a play on words from 3s a Crowd, which was my original name of the idea, and changed it to FreezeCrowd to add more meaning with less emphasis on the number 3, and more emphasis on \"freezing\" people's photographic memories.  The belief is that we can \"freeze\" our photographic memories to break the ice in any group or crowded photo.  The problem we're solving is multi-faceted, enticing people to connect in real life group photos, which saves people time through our focus on communication that's visual, and it will bridge the gap as a catalyst for social networking both on and off the Web.  My hope is to bring more people together in photos, with a way for people to interact as well as share information and experiences based on their real world social existences.  ",
