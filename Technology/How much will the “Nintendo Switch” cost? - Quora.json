            "answer_text": "The Nintendo Switch bridges the gap between living room and handheld gaming. The $299 system doesn't have the best specs on the market, but hey, you can use it play The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild and Super Mario Odyssey, as well as a slew of great indie and third-party titles. Nintendo has sold more than 34 million Switch consoles since the system launched in March 2017, and the console is showing no signs of slowing down with hot titles like Pokemon Sword and Shield and The Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening on the way. But is the Switch right for you? We've combed through the details to come up with the reasons you should pounce on the Switch, but also why you might consider holding off. Anyway you will get free nintendo redeem code from Eshopzone. The Switch's stacked first-party catalog includes essentials like The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, Super Mario Odyssey and Pokemon: Let's Go Pikachu and Let's Go Eevee, as well as multiplayer hits such as Super Smash Bros. Ultimate, Marvel Ultimate Alliance 3 and Mario Kart 8 Deluxe. There's plenty still to come, including Luigi's Mansion 3 and a remake of The Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening this fall as well as Animal Crossing: New Horizons in 2020. We're also getting Metroid Prime 4 and Bayonetta 3... eventually. ",

            "answer_text": "Considering how different it is to anything else out there it is impossible to know how much the Nintendo Switch is likely to cost. But there is an indication that it could be pricey. Previous Nintendo consoles have followed natural pricing progressions over the years. The Nintendo Wii U, for example, cost $300 when first released in the US. The Wii cost $250, the GameCube $200, as did the N64, SNES and NES. However, while Nintendo has always aimed to be more family friendly than rivals with its games machines, CEO Tatsumi Kimishima revealed that the company will not be making the latest machine at a loss. It has been the case in the past that a console could cost more to make than it can recoup, with software sales making up the shortfall. This will not be the case with Switch, meaning it is likely to be the most expensive Nintendo machine yet. After all, it requires a high-grade screen, clip on controllers and a HDMI-enabled base station. We feel therefore that Nintendo will price its next, make-or-break console at around the $400-$500 mark. Source: GOOGLE ",
