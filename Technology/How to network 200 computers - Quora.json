            "answer_text": "\u201cHow do I network 200 computers?\u201d That depends on what you want out of the 200 computers. The simple case would be gathering 8\u201316 per router, 8\u201316 routers together and use multiple such trees until you get all 200 connected. Then it depends on whether you have one network configuration or dozens. If one, then a single DHCP server and backup might be able to work. If dozens, then you need dozens of DHCP servers\u2026 If you are making a cluster, get the cluster software you want and read the directions for it. It really REALLY depends on what you want, because there are many different ways to do it. ",
