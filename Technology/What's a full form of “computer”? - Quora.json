            "answer_text": "Computer Full Form IS NOT \u201cCommon Operating Machine Purposely Used for Technological and Educational Research\u201d The easy answer suggests the full form of computer is \u201cCommon Operating Machine Purposely Used for Technological and Educational Research.\u201d Unfortunately, the easy answer is also an urban legend. There is no evidence of the acronym appearing in the 20th century when modern computers debuted.  Besides, that acronym seems dishonest when you consider both the etymology and the function of a computer. A programmable machine \u201ccomputes\u201d or calculates equations. Understanding the computer full form requires a bit of a history lesson. Computer Full Form Demystified According to BBC News, since the verb \u201ccompute\u201d was used in reference to performing math equations, humans were the first computers. We simply used pre-mechanical age devices like the abacus to compile our data. The term \u201ccompute\u201d comes from the Latin word \u201cPutare.\u201d According to Professor William J. Rapaport, the word is a combination of Com and Putare, meaning respectively, \u201cwith\u201d (com) and \u201creckon\u201d (putare). The compound word, Computare, refers to a reckoning of arithmetic, or perhaps to \u201csettle an account.\u201d Now that sounds like something a human might have to do. Robots, not so much! The Roman poet Virgil wrote in Georgics of computing, or pruning vinesHistorian Tacitus used the word when counting soldiersPliny wrote in Natural History how \u201cthe breadth of Asia should be \u201crightly calculated\u201d, which was the same word \u2013 computetur)Author Richard Braithwait wrote in The Yong Mans Gleanings that he \u201chad read the truest computer of times\u201dNavy Administrator Samuel Pepys wrote of computing money for shipsIronically, humans were the first computers, not machines. We didn\u2019t even think of these amazing machines as \u201ccomputers\u201d until we understood the groundbreaking idea that machines could operate as humans do.

            "answer_text": "\u201cComputer\u201d is not an acronym, it is a word derived from a word \"compute\" which means to calculate. So, in simple words you can say that computer is an electronic device which is used for fast calculation. Some people say that COMPUTER stands for Common Operating Machine Purposely Used for Technological and Educational Research. It is only a myth because first this definition does not make any sense and second when the computer were invented they were just calculating machines which needs a lot of space for establishment.  A computer is a machine that can be instructed to carry out sequences of arithmetic or logical operations automatically via computer programming. Modern computers have the ability to follow generalized sets of operations, called programs. These programs enable computers to perform an extremely wide range of tasks. A \"complete\" computer including the hardware, the operating system (main software), and peripheral equipment required and used for \"full\" operation can be referred to as a computer system. This term may as well be used for a group of computers that are connected and work together, in particular a computer network or computer cluster. The basic parts without which a computer cannot work are as follows: Processor: It executes instructions from software and hardware.Memory: It is the primary memory for data transfer between the CPU and storage.Motherboard: It is the part that connects all other parts or components of a computer.Storage Device: It permanently stores the data, e.g., hard drive.Input Device: It allows you to communicate with the computer or to input data, e.g., a keyboard.Output Device: It enables you to see the output, e.g., monitor.Computers are divided into different types based on different criteria. Based on the size, a computer can be divided into five types: Micro ComputerMini ComputerMainframe ComputerSuper ComputerWorkstations",

The computer particularly contains arithmetic and logical unit i.e ALU.this electronic machine contains memory also. Which helps to store data. computers can be digital, analogue and hybrid based on technology. There are some other computers also Supercomputer, personal computer, desktops, laptops, etc. The computer is also considered as a programming machine because it cannot do anything without the program. It takes raw data from the user as an input process it and produces output to the user. So what\u2019s the full form of computer? These are also called as long-form of computer which provides us computer full meaning. Commonly Operating Machine Particularly Used for Technical and Education Research Below is some more hypothetical full form of computer: 1.Common Operations Made Possible Under Technical Engineering Researches 2.Common Oriented Machine Particularly Used for Trade Education and Research 3.Common Operating Machine Particularly Used for Training, Education, and Reporting 4.Computing Oriented Manipulation Programming Used in Technology Education and Research 5.Capable Of Making Perfectly Uncomplicated Tasks Extremely Rigorous 6.Complicated Office Machine Put Under Tremendous Effort to Reduce Manpower So Above are some of full form of computer in English. You can also relate this with the question of what is the full form of pc. Relate it to the full form of computer subject and is going to be meaningful now. ",

            "answer_text": "Usual answer (its not Chinese, its more like baby Japanese: a word such as 'computer\u2019 is one and only one idea: the letter 'a\u2019 just means the sound 'aaaaa\u2019 and z means zzzzz. WORDS, not characters are memorized based on latinate prefixes and suffixes like computo-: to do math and er-: thing that does. English is more like German than Chinese, but English is about single definitions, not ++ definitions. When there are ++ definitions in English it is something clever like a word game, to an extent\u2026 Even if not lying, saying something is not completely true is a common form of trick in English, it is not funny or insulting, it is basic intelligence\u2026 they wish to be smart: they don't want to be stupid. In America students learn calculus in high school, but only if they're smart, or that's what I was taught. I was an honors student in high school in a city near Yale, and I didn't even learn calculus yet in high school. I didn\u2019t have to take it for liberal arts in college, but I have learned a little about it outside of school. A lot of education in America is about learning words, using English properly, sounding intelligent if possible, and more basic math than calculus. The realization with all of English is: WORDS! But you don\u2019t know all the words yet. The realization with reading Chinese is: CHINESE! They are very different in that way). \u2026 As far as the \u2018deep\u2019 meaning of computer, you might like these links: Programmable Heuristics The Computer ",

            "answer_text": "Nothing. Its just a word derived from the word \"compute\" which means to calculate. Many full forms are available on the internet but those are just made by individuals. You can make one too for yourself. Full form is actually the actual name of anything which is shortened for the purpose of ease(Remember SHIELD from marvel's movies). So therefore it is not a game and no one in the world can now stood up and say \"from now onward let's just have the full form of computer as .......\"Because the actual name of computer is computer only. Talking about SHIELD, there's one strong example to support my answer. If, let's just say computer do has a full form, then you'll always see it written as \"COMPUTER\" and not \"computer\" like there's USA or NASA or ISRO and many more. ",
