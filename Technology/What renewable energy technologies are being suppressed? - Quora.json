            "answer_text": "Hydro is being suppressed. We take out dams to help certain fish, this increases the amount of fossil fuels burned which some say is what will be the end of the world (CO2 contribution). There are no renewable energy sources other than hydro. It would be nice if energy was free and renewable; but, it is not. Wind and solar are made and maintained with coal and oil. It takes coal to make solar cells. Sand and coke are put in a electric arc furnace to make silicon for solar cells and all other electronics. Silicon has to be further refined and purified to make the cells\u2026 lots of energy. Concrete needs lots of fossil fuels to make bases for wind machines and solar arrays. Metal used in wind and solar come from mining and smelting of iron to make steel. About 4% of the energy used on earth is used to make aluminum. There are no easy answers. Please read all of the content in the following post, go to all the links, read all the information: Amos Cline's answer to Both renewable and nonrenewable sources of energy have been beneficial to people. Years from now, how do you envision our energy consumption? Towards which path should we head on? We will stop using fossil fuels when the fires of the underworld freeze over, and they say the Devil is predicting climate change which will cause the temperature of the underworld to increase and flood with molten lava\u2026 which should concern politicians promoting alternative energy without knowing anything about engineering or science. You may want to read some of my other answers on the topic. There are no easy answers to our wanton over consumption of everything. ",

            "answer_text": "What renewable energy technologies are being suppressed? Well, there\u2019s two major categories of those: First, the \u201cthey\u2019re suppressing this infinite zero-point energy machine\u201d type, which are pretty much always the field of kooks, cranks, and conspiracy theorists. Second, there\u2019s well-known technologies that are being actively fought by the entrenched fossil fuel companies. See the government-level pushback against solar energy in the US championed by fossil energy companies by contributing to politicians, and Trump\u2019s vow to \u201cbring back coal\u201d for a worked example. Very much a \u201cfollow the money\u201d thing. ",
