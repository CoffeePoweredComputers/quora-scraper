            "answer_text": "I don\u2019t think so, and I don\u2019t think most of the people there would want it. I think Maui is more capable than over half of the U.S. states, but the fundamental problems are lack of a very top feeder university and lack of preexisting venture capital. The Maui High Performance Computer Center helps, but it\u2019s not enough. I\u2019m also pretty sure that the existing population wouldn\u2019t take kindly to a high influx of people that would price them out of homes and increase congestion. Oahu already has that problem: the native-on-Asian violence in Hawaii is remarkably high to begin with. Probably nothing on the level of the top ten tech hubs in the continental U.S. is going to happen in Hawaii. ",
