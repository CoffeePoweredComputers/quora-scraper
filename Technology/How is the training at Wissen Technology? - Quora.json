We have a Learning team which takes care of the training needs of the employees. We have the following main channels of training: We provide Pluralsight subscription to the employees, where they can take online training courses. It is a quality online training platform, mainly used for learning technical skills.We conduct regular web based trainings. These are conducted by expert trainers. These cover technical as well as domain (Finance) training. These courses are customised for our needs. Employees can join these sessions from their work, home or while traveling. We provide repeat sessions and recordings. This helps employees to catch up on sessions they missed.We conduct a special classroom training course for our campus recruits. This is usually a 2 month program that covers full stack application development.Lastly, I would like mention that Learning is a KPI for our employees. They have specific goals in this area and the managers work with them to help them achieve their goals. ",
