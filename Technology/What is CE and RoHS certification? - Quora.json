            "answer_text": "RoHS is the Restriction of Hazardous Substances Directive. Basically it certifies that there are few/no materials in a product that are on a list of known-toxic materials. Probably the biggest impact of this is the removal of lead-based solder from most recent electronics. CE marking is used to show a product meets requirements needed to be sold in Europe. The specific requirements for the mark vary depending on the nature of the product. Both of these are labels that can be applied to a compliant product, and not a certification for an individual to earn, like exams that demonstrate ones' knowledge of a particular product. ",
