            "answer_text": "There have been many good and bad impacts of technology on our daily lives. Good Impacts Medical Field Advancements in medical technology have allowed physicians to better diagnose and treat their patients since the beginning of the professional practice of medicine. This merger is responsible for improving and saving countless lives all around the world. Hospital are filled Medical Equipment such as CT Scanners and XRays. Technology has also helped in medical research, with many instruments used in finding different cures or discovering new dieseases we don\u2019t even know about.Mobile Technology Mobile phones have allowed us to communicate with people on the other side of the planet with a touch. Mobile Tecnology has allowed us to cramp loads of info into a small portable device. In mobiles we can take pictures, write emails, read Quora and even play games. Mobile phones have also introduced new people to each other with messaging, Facebook, Instagram and Twitter.Aviation and Aerospace Technology This technology has helped us reach differnt places in hours which may have taken months or years by a ship. Aerospace has also helped unlock the mysteries of our solar system. Cassini for example has discovered the possibility of Titan and Enceladus harbouring life, which would mean the possibility of colonisation of other planets or moons.Bad Impacts Cyber Bullying Technology also has been the beginning of cyber bullying within online chat groups and websites. It has hurt many peoples feelings and have in some cases led to suicide. Cyber bullying should be stopped because it has ruined many people\u2019s lives. For example if someones father is in prison. We should not make fun of the family or the kid. We should instead be supportive. Cyber bullying in this case would be making fun of the father in prison, calling him a criminal.Addictions Have you ever looked at your screen for long periods without resting or talking a break. Wherever you are talking, texting, taking selfies or snap chatting. Then you are a social media addict. Social media addiction has caused many people( including myself) to get distracted in class, work or even during a family dinner. ",

            "answer_text": "Technology has changed my life quite drastically . It has made access to different things very fast and efficient. Technology have had a profound impact on everyone's life including me. It can be seen in education, infrastructure development, health and medicine, manufacturing, exploration research, communication, security, entertainment and so on. On one hand , it has become easy for us to extract information, express our views and opinions on various social platforms , interacting with people in the remotest part of the world, socializing globally , signing online petitions , paying bills online , learning various subjects through the internet, applying for courses and registering online , transferring money with internet banking, buying and selling online , downloading important apps ,connecting with people all over the world and seeking wordlwide support for the various current issues and so on\u2026\u2026. It's quite evident that with the advent of technology our lives have definitely become easygoing but every coin has two sides i.e, both positive and negative impacts. It is indelible to ignore that with the aid of Technology we will soon become slaves as we are dependent so much on technology that we have become lethargic and get zonked out very easily. 24 by 7 we have our eyes stuck to the screens of our mobile phones, laptops, tablets , PCs which is not at all favourable for our eyes. Most of the time we are so much engrossed that we don't feel like spending time with our family and friends. Even if we wish to write an article or an essay or doing a project we just simply look for it on Google and begin to copy with the speed of a Xerox machine. We don't wish to look for the matter in books and our mind becomes limited and the thinking process comes to a halt. Moreover , when used inappropriately it leads to wastage of precious time. Well, the list of advantages and disadvantages is never ending but it obviously, depends on us that how sincerely we access technology. Thus, in my life technology ,undoubtedly has a very positive impact as things have become easier but I use the internet to a certain extent so that it cannot hamper my skills and mind and I can save much of my time for other productive things! Thanks for reading :) Cheers!! ",
