            "answer_text": "Depends on the device you\u2019re trying to pair. On the phone or tablet, you have to go to the settings and look at the Bluetooth section. There will be a place to activate a scan for new devices, so start there. On the device itself, typically you\u2019ll press and hold the power on button for ~10 seconds to enter pairing mode, at which point the phone or tablet will detect the device and begin the pairing process. But read your device\u2019s manual for the specifics on pairing; many devices use a different sequence. ",
