            "answer_text": "What are examples of strategic planning? A business plan is a good example of strategic planning. Even a concept plan to create a business opportunity or a project plan to implement a task is also a good example. In a nut shell, a business plan is a road map, to show you how to go to where you want to go from where you are. At its core, is the systematic game plan, which highlights all the strategic and tactical initiatives of completing the journey. It has all these key elements: 1) Executive Summary; 2) Unique Selling Proposition/Unfair Advantage; 3) Organisational Background (including vision and mission statements); 4) Market Analysis; 5) Competition Analysis; 6) Vulnerability Audit; 7) Marketing Plan/Product Launch; 8) Manpower Plan; 9) Financial Analysis (with a detailed 12-month statement); 10) Sensitivity Analysis; 11) Contingency Plan; 12) Game Plan (with a detailed 1-year plan, including all the strategic and tactical initiatives in tandem with predefined corporate objectives); Your game plan encapsulates all your long-range goals and objectives which are systematically translated into specific, prioritised and executable tasks which you need to accomplish daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly, and annually. For implementation and execution, it contains the following critical elements: - specific objectives for each predefined task; - metrics to measure your progress; - accountability, as some tasks may need to be shared; - resources you need to get the work done respectively;  [I call them the 7 Ms': Money; Men; Methods; Machines; Materials; Metrics; and Mojo] - timetable for completion of each predefined task; Moreover, your game plan also provides a clear snapshot all potential obstacles and/or roadblocks that may pop up, and also a slew of possible strategies to deal with them.  They serve as your contingency plan. Before I sign off, I like to point out that the fire test for your business plan will come from your consistent follow-up and massive follow-through of whatever you have set out to do, as laid out in your game plan. Furthermore, the business - and game - plan is not etched in stone.  You have to stay laser-focused on your strategic goals and objects, but remain steadfastly flexible in your tactical execution. ",

            "answer_text": "Strategic planning can take many forms. Financial planning: Businesses both startup small businesses and massive global companies, work hard to plan the best use of their cash and available funds to generate a return for their shareholders. Many times this becomes very complex as developing products, software and hiring require massive amounts of funds. Also planning how much your workforce will cost, how taxes will be handled, any tariffs or external pressure related to sales demand and regulatory pressures can be very tough to get right. The financial planning departments of many companies are one of the absolute most critical teams. Supply Chain planning: Supply chain planning is critical if you have physical products or http://goods.It It lays out how raw materials will be moved to your factory, what suppliers you will use, then how the finished products are sent to stores. COVID19 has thrown supply chains under the bus as factory closures and demand curves have changed. If you sell a physical product and are unable to get the raw materials needed to make it, your company is in trouble. Also if you run out of inventory because your supply chain processes aren\u2019t well throughout, you effectively lose the ability to sell goods resulting in a drop in revenue. Human Resource Planning: How many employees you have, how much your workforce costs, who needs to be promoted, what skill sets are desired, and needed to make the company grow are all key components of what the HR team does. They make sure your company has the team necessary to grow and be efficient. Marketing Strategy: How will buyers find out about your company and products? How will you build a brand name for yourself? How do you get customers to buy from you and at what price? These are questions that a marketing strategy will address. Marketing plans can take many forms depending if the company is B2B or B2C, some quite simple others very complex. But at the end of the day, a marketing plan is needed to get your brand\u2019s product or services in front of potential buyers and generate sales. ",
