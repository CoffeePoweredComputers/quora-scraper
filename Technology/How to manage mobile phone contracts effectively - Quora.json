What happens is we use one company card and update their CC details in their online portal. We can't force people to use one provider and we don't want them to expense it via software like Expensify. Is there a system out there that would allow us to manage it in a similar way like you mange corporate travel bookings with tools like Next Travel? Thank you!? ",
