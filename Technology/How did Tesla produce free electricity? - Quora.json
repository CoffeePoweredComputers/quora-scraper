            "answer_text": "Ignorance is bliss! If you want to know the real story about Tesla\u2019s free electricity you should read Gerry Vassilatos\u2019 Secret\u2019s of Cold War Technology, he dedicated 74 very, long print pages to this subject. Too complicated to summarize the whole story here. Basically though he spent his entire adult life in developing this technology, the theory behind resides outside the current science being taught today. Stupid system we have today The idiots back then has made us extremely vulnerable today with an expensive Power Grid that is so antiquated it is a joke. I was just reading the other day, should North Korea want to put America down all they would need to is lope a bomb with a powerful EMP and knock out the major cities Power Grids. The U.S. deaths would be huge. The article stated it would take a year to eighteen months before the system could be totally restored. Everything would require to be re-manufactured and without power, that would take much more time. It was estimated close to 90% the population would die in the first year, and half more in the last six months. We just do not know how to live without electricity. Tesla\u2019s system, ignorance then and today, could prevented it Tesla\u2019s system was so simple for homes and industry, that even if a EMP took it down, it could be back up in a fraction of the time, mainly because so much less equipment involved and the energy could be transferred from other sources. If you read the book, you will understand how the energy is dispersed; not by electricity transmitted through the air - pure ignorance by current scientists and Monday morning quarterbacks. You and I have a choice today to believe what we want My theory is that we are living in two worlds today; one which we are being taught in our education institutions a science of the world and the other the world of Nature. Tesla always used Nature as his source for research and development, and was quickly to criticize the science community back then and if alive today would still be criticizing. Concluding If one wants to understand Tesla, what he has done, why he has done it, and why we have not done it, they need to get into Tesla\u2019s mind. The first step is try to learn Nature, and forget what is being taught today. Not that today\u2019s science is all wrong, it is just far from being complete, and the avenue it is taking, it will take centuries to get to the real truth -Nature! One can get the idea that today\u2019s science believes Nature should follow their theories, versus the other way around. \u201cThe highest form of ignorance is when you reject something you don't know anything about.\u201d \u2015 Wayne Dyer ",

As far as I know, Tesla never planned to give the world \u201cfree electricity.\u201d That seems to be the product of conspiracy theorists and Tesla fanboys. Wardenclyffe Tower was going to be a prototype for a method of sending messages and media content and broadcasting electrical power. The construction of Wardenclyffe was designed to make money. A lot of money. Tesla wrote to JP Morgan \u201c\u2026 I could not report yacht races or signal incoming steamers. There was no money in this. This was no business for a man of your position and importance. Perhaps you have never fully appreciated the sense of this obligation.\u201d (Nikola Tesla: The Lost Wizard) Around this same time, Tesla also announced to the world that he may have received pulsed frequencies from outerspace, most likely Venus or Mars. You know how that worked out. Tesla was relying on other people\u2019s money and that ran out. It ran out at least partly because Tesla was not producing results. Tesla was never going to produce the desired results - he got the physics wrong. He famously disagreed with Einstein, and we also know how that worked out. Einstein 1 vs Tesla 0. ",
