            "answer_text": "Let me start off by saying that I\u2019ve never worked for one of the \u201cmajor\u201d oil companies, so I\u2019m not very versed in their corporate structure or culture. On to your question, \u201cWhat would it take to make 'Big Oil' loosen it's stifling grip on green technologies?\u201d The answer will sound painfully simple but it\u2019s actually not, so please bear with me. The lynch pin to using green tech as opposed to fossil fuels is money. It\u2019s 100% all about money. On the producer side, the day that a \u201cgreen tech\u201d can supply usable energy at a large enough scale to meet demand and at a price that yields a better margin, then producers will start producing that. It\u2019s a market response. It\u2019s the reason they quit whaling and started drilling for oil. It\u2019s the reason that electric plants have switched from more expensive coal to cheaper natural gas in most of the US. The issue is always \u201cHow can you meet the power needs the most consistently for the lowest cost and the best margin, without killing demand for energy.\u201d On the consumer side, the day that green power is cheaper than hydrocarbons and it won\u2019t cause major lifestyle change, people will switch. It\u2019s pure capitalist behavior but we are creatures of self interest. Even if our self interest is \u201chelping the planet\u201d or \u201cbeing sustainable\u201d it\u2019s a capitalist response to allocate personal resources to the things you feel have value and are important. If hydrocarbons become too expensive, or if green tech becomes advantageous, I\u2019d expect people to adapt to that. As far as big oil having a \u201cstifling grip\u201d on green tech, I\u2019d point you to today\u2019s current power generation. Currently, the US has become an exporter of energy. In fact, this month more oil was taken out of the US at the Port of Galveston than was brought in. That has never happened in US history. We have a domestic energy abundance of hydrocarbons. Yet, we have Tesla and Fisker. Two electric car companies. I\u2019m not sure of your age but I remember when the conspiracy was that big oil was killing the electric car. Yet, Mercedes, Nissan, Chevy and other car companies are making electric cars? Why? Consumer choice has made a market for it. Right now, those cars are more expensive the average car and their are issues with range that cause some people to dislike them. That\u2019s a consumer preference, too. Still, if they can make the price competitive to a regular car, don\u2019t you think there will be a broader adaptation? I do. Electric engines have better torque and I\u2019m a performance guy. I\u2019d take one in my Audi. It would be fun to drive. Likewise, when wind or solar power can be as cost equivalent as natural gas at supplying electricity, do you think the energy companies will want to stay with a cost variable fuel like gas or go with the fixed cost of wind and solar? So, I\u2019d say that \u201cbig oil\u201d, even if they adapt into the green tech areas, won\u2019t be able to stifle market forces. Disruptors in the market, like Tesla and Fisker, will continue to push innovation outside of their control. Finally, the supply and demand of energy will still pivot on market forces and the main fulcrum will always be money. ",

            "answer_text": "There is no \u2018stifling grip\u2019 on green technologies. If you can invent a better gasoline, do it. There is no cabal, preventing you or anyone else , from making an electric car, or a Hydrogen Car. Like the ad says \u201cJust Do it\u201d. If there were a \u2018better way\u2019, would you think there would have been some development in limited areas already. Perhaps areas where conventional gasoline and diesel is very expensive. There is no \u2018Department of Green Things\u2019 at Major Oil Companies. Sure there will always be competitive technologies, but to actively stifle new technologies from interfering with existing processes is written in US law as being anti-competitive. Now, if any company were to have a department of new technologies , and that departments \u2018new ideas\u2019, were to be detrimental to the existing business of making money, would they not be sold off for value X, and then eventually resurrected as a competing technology? Called a \u2018Non-Core\u2019 Asset. The New Battery Technology. After 20 years, and without Patent Renewal, any particular patent disclosure becomes public knowledge, and the \u2018licence\u2019 component of a new patent becomes open knowledge. So if there is a particular patent, that has expired, then after 20 years of issuing date, the patent expires. This is what it takes then to \u2018loosen its grip\u2019, and has been there ever since the idea of patent protection came into existence. So just do it. ",
