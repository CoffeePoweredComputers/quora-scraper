            "answer_text": "Both are almost the same. If at all you want to be only in the software development, IT would be berter. And it is familiar branch also. If you want to have options for your job, i.e both in software development as well as networking & communication fields, you can better chose ICT. But this branch is not much familiar to the world. There will not be much difference when comes to college placements. Except the communication/ networks subjects all other subjects are same to both the branches. A2A. ",
