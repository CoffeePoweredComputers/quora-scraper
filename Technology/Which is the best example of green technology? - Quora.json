            "answer_text": "Green Technology refers to making sustainable technological innovations. It focuses on finding technologies that don\u2019t have negative repercussions on the environment. People involved with green technologies initially used to focus on providing the services conventional technologies used to provide for offering a more responsible alternative. However, with time, several companies have achieved innovation and usefulness of green technologies to a new level. Some of these examples you should know about are - 1. Pavagen - Lagos is one of the megacities of Nigeria. There is a population of roughly 17 million people so you can imagine the amount of energy consumption in terms of electricity. However, the researchers at a British technology company \u2018 Pavagen\u2019 managed to build a soccer field which converts energy from players\u2019 movements to electricity. This same electricity powers the field and illuminates it. This is truly an innovative and self-sufficient model for recycling energy. It helps us not be dependent on natural resources for electricity. 2. HeliaTek - HeliaTek is a German based company which has started addressing the problem often associated with solar panels - size. Imagine a situation where every building and car will be able to produce electricity using solar panels. HeliTek has managed to make solar panels that are thin and light as paper. These are known as solar films. This material can be combined with other materials such as concrete or glass for easier use at different places. This material itself is recyclable. 3. Avantium - Avantium is a New Zealand based company that researches and explores innovative chemistry technologies across various industries for producing chemicals and materials that can be recycled. Dr Gert-Jan Gruter (Chief Technology Officer) at Avantium, came up with a solution for plastic bottles. There are tons of plastic bottles manufactured and sold in huge volumes. This creates a problem as they are non-renewable, and a lot of materials are wasted in their production. Dr Gert came up with a sugar-based bioplastic which requires no petrochemicals and is entirely recyclable. This cuts CO2 emissions by 70 percent. ",

            "answer_text": "One example is WaterBeads that takes fresh water from the Mississippi River where there is an extra 511 million acre feet of fresh water and brings it across North America to Los Angeles and all points in between. Water in the desert Southwest turns the land green. Because this guideway system uses the sun\u2019s radiation for power it does not produce air pollution or burn any fossil fuels or decay any radioactive materials. ",
