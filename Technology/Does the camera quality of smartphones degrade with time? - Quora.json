            "answer_text": "Quality of the camera phones rarely degrades, that to due to dust or sensor malfunctioning. But if you were to compare the quality of a particular smart phone, say an iPhone 6, to the quality of the same iPhone 6 after couple of years, you can barely point out any difference. On the other hand, comparing the quality of iPhone 7 2017 model to another phone of similar specifications for camera, might be superior or inferior, depending on the quality of hardware, and how well it functions with the software. Though for vanila android users, Camera app by Google is way more accurate and sharp as compared to some other devices. For example, Google Pixel 2. My answer was based on my 3 years experience on HTC Desire 816 ,3 years experience of iPhone 5s and 1 year experience of iPhone 7 and counting. ",

            "answer_text": "Actually speaking the quality of the camera in the smartphone does not degrade it remains the same from the time it is purchased. The main thing what degrades is that the maintenance of the smartphone which degrades with time. When we get a new phone we wipe it every now and then and preserve it get a new cover any problem we run get it done and then maintain it well but as time passes the mobile usage becomes more so they get used to it they way ee maintain the phone also differs which is the main reason for the dust entering the camera inside the mobile and then which eventually degrades the quality of the image also degrades which actually is in relation with the maintenance degradation over time.
