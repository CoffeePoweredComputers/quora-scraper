            "answer_text": "Your laptop screen is almost certainly an LCD display, because pretty much all laptops have been built that way for quite a while now. However, a colour LCD display needs a bright backlight, and your backlight is probably produced by LEDs, unless your laptop is quite old. You are probably confused because many new consumer TVs are called \u201cLED\u201d to make them sound new, when in fact they are all LCDs with LED backlight (instead of the older fluorescent lamps). The same goes for \u201cLED\u201d computer monitors. There are true LED displays made, but they are very bright and (so far) very expensive. They are used as video backgrounds for bands during concerts, for example. But this technology has not shown up in home TVs yet. There are also OLED displays, which are different again, and which have appeared in TVs. So, for the moment at least, \u201cLED\u201d TVs and monitors are really just LED-backlit LCD. And that\u2019s likely what your laptop has. ",

            "answer_text": "Basically there are three types of flat screen found in modern devices. A fluorescent tube back light, and an LCD filter, which filters the back light through different coloured dots as required to produce the image. These tend to have a power inverter across the bottom of the screen, which can produce some heat.An LED back light and a similar LCD filter as aboveIndividual coloured LEDs for each colour in each pixel.If the screen is displaying black then an LCD filter will normally show a faint white glow from the back light. A LED only screen with no LCD filter should be truly dark. Another way of detecting a back light/LCD filter screen is to shine a bright light on the screen while it is switched off. The screen will normally be a very dark gray. As the screen powers up, then for a second or two, it might actually appear to go darker before it lights up normally. This can happen as the LCD filter starts up before the back light comes on. This does not happen with a screen that has coloured LEDs for each pixel. ",
