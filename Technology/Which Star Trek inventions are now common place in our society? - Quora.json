            "answer_text": "When I used to watch STOS as a 10 year old, I remember my father commenting on the series. He laughed when he saw Kirk using his communicator, saying how ridiculous that was. Fast forward a few decades, and this is mainstream. Another innovation, was the PADD, which the STNG crew used to monitor systems read, and record events, even using it with a digital pen to write in DS9.
