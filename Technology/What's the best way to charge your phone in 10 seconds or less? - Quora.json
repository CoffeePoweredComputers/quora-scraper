            "answer_text": "You could convert a carefully chosen cell phone into one that only needs to charge for ten seconds, as long you don't mind having a phone that goes dead in 4 minutes or less. I will describe how below, or you can just take my word for it and go straight to the upvote button. Someone could modify an Open Source phone OS such as the Cyanogenmod version of Android to limit a supported phone to only charge for 10 seconds. It could also be modified to report that the battery went from 0% to 100% in that time. My Nexus 5 phone starts charging at less than 500 mA and slowly ramps up the current draw until it reaches 1.4 Amps or the charger voltage drops too far. I am not sure if this behavior is in the charging circuit or is controlled by the main CPU. There is a good chance the OS doesn't directly control the charge rate. Without a phone that can instantly go into fast charge mode, the 4 minute run time is just a fantasy (unlike the rest of this answer which is totally plausible). If we start with a phone that normally needs to charge for an hour in order to operate for a day, then that phone gets 23 additional time units of operation for each unit of charging. So that gives us a total 240 seconds of use time, of which the phone only needs to be plugged in for 10 seconds. Note, that to achieve the full 4 minutes of life, the phone can't be working hard the whole time. I would guess you will be able to talk for 30 seconds or play Candy Crush for 20 seconds, but not both in a single 4 minute session. With a custom charge controller, a custom high current power supply, and a battery designed for rapid charging, it would be possible to achieve much longer run times without making the phone larger or heavier. It might even be possible to get runtimes of better than half an hour. The trick is that the battery can generate a lot more heat per second than one that gets charged for minutes at a time. The charger can be designed to get the battery to its temperature limit in just ten seconds. The battery will then have several minutes to cool down. Since most people don't want phones that need to be recharged every few minutes, you will have to do all of the design and engineering work yourself. Good luck. ",

            "answer_text": "As I understand Lithium-Ion / Lithium-Polymer battery technology, there is NO way to charge a phone battery in 10 seconds or less. Batteries are a way of storing electrical energy chemically. I am sure you have noticed that your phone gets warm when charging. Pumping enough energy into a LiPo battery to bring it to a full charge in only 10 seconds would (in my opinion - at the moment I am too lazy to look up the figures and do the math) most likely cause the battery to fail. The process of charging causes a chemical reaction within the cell, which also generates heat, as the process is not 100% efficient. (see the Wikipedia entry for more details.) The amount of heat generated could even cause the battery to burst into flame. Goodbye, little cell phone. If you often find that your phone runs out of charge, pick up 2 or 3 USB power banks, and keep them charged. A power bank is little more than an external battery pack which contains one or more of the same sort of cells you will find in a laptop battery. They seem to be everywhere, and the cost is reasonable. When your phone needs a charge, plug its charger cable into the power bank, and you are back in business! Your phone can then be used while its internal battery is recharged by the external battery. ",

Assuming you\u2019re talking about actually charging your phone from 0 to 80% in 10s . I wont say its impossible because you never know what could happen in the future but let me explain . To charge it in 10s you need a 50C charger which is not even close to the highest rate ive heard of for Ultra-fast charging. To put things into context, if you want to charge a 3000 mAh phone battery in 10s you need a charger supplying about 870 Amps this is extremly high (normal for chargers now are 2 Amps). Other than this ridiculous number, your battery needs to be designed to handle that much current ( which until today is not yet designed). Also, this will require an extremly efficient cooling technology to control the heat ( which also until today is not yet designed ). Finally, the battery life time will decrease substantially. Thats a very fast approach to answer your question, hope it helps :) ",

Second you use supercapacitor instead of your phone battery and use a charger with very high current rating. Although you won't get as much battery life as you would get with Li ion battery and your phone will look ugly and bulky, You would be able get your phone charged in 10 seconds. Hope it helps. Note : assuming 3.7 volt and 400F supercapacitor You will get a capacity of 411mah.(just rough numbers) ",

Seriously, there is no way to charge your phone faster then a high current charger and the high current charger will take as long as is needed to charge the battery safely, and within its specifications. If you were somehow able to show more current into it then it was designed for, and the wires did not overheat or melt, and the battery would overheat and possibly go into thermal runaway. If there really was a way to charge it faster, you would not want to as it would reduce the useful life of the battery, at best, and catch fire if worst. Putting your phone into airplane mode, or turning it off would minimize the time needed to charge it. Wrapping it in foil would be counterproductive unless it's an airplane mode or turned off, as the phone would be increasing its transmitting power trying to reach the cell tower. ",

If a human does that then they might get chocked or hurt their throat really bad. The same applies to batteries to.
