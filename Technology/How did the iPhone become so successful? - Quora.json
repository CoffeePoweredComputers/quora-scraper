            "answer_text": "iPhone become so successful because its hardware and software were designed to work with each other. And enhances each other's Interface. It also has the world\u2019s most popular camera. A camera that makes it easy to take insanely great photos. All you have to do is use it to see that taking photos and videos on iPhone is really awesome. And all apps found in the store are super safe apps like\t\t\t\t\t\ttop-notch APIs, encryption, and app transport security, and\t\t\t\t\t\tthe rock-solid security features build inside the iPhone like\t\t\t\t\t\ttrusted boot, sandboxing, and kernel address space layout\t\t\t\t\t\trandomization, but there\u2019s only so much room. So let\u2019s just\t\t\t\t\t\tsay that iPhone and malware goes in different way.Another remarkable thing an iPhone have is\taccess to its powerful technology. iPhone comes with incredible assistive tools and \t\t\t\t\t\tfeatures built right in. Like VoiceOver, which lets you tap \t\t\t\t\t\tto hear what\u2019s on your screen, even if you can\u2019t see it. And \t\t\t\t\t\tSwitch Control, a way to navigate your phone using switches \t\t\t\t\t\tinstead of tapping, dragging, or swiping. And there\u2019s also mono \t\t\t\t\t\taudio, which helps you hear it all by playing stereo recordings \t\t\t\t\t\tin mono in both ears of your headphones. And even Invert Colors, \t\t\t\t\t\twhich increases the contrast on your screen, making it easier \t\t\t\t\t\tto read. And that\u2019s not even everything. and technology like this is essential. ",

            "answer_text": "Personally I think it was marketing and word of mouth.  Among my peer group, I was the only person who paid the $600 for the first iPhone.  But I was ALWAYS on it.  They used to pick on me about it.  Now THEY are always on THEIR iPhones.  I don't think seeing me on the phone all the time was enough to turn them into iPhone owners.  I think marketing had to play a role too.  And I don't think marketing was enough either. I think people had to see what all the (marketing) hype is about before they were willing to commit to buying an expensive cellphone.  I would say that coming down in price was important too (and it was) but even $200 was a stretch for a lot of people when so many phone companies offer FREE phones with a service plan.  We had to convince millions of people that they HAD to get a smartphone, that it would change their lives. Once people understood the real world advantage of having this powerful of a smartphone, convincing them that they wanted one was easy.  They just had to wait till their Verizon or Sprint contracts ran out. Then came Android to muck it all up.  But Google failed to market Android effectively.  Android's success I would attribute to word of mouth ONLY.  Had Google marketed Android better, they would probably have a bigger market share now. ",
