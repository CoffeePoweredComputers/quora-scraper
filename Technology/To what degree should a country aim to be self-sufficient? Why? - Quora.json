            "answer_text": "\u2018Self-sufficient\u2019 is a bit of a loaded phrase. Do you mean completely independent and providing everything the country may need from energy, food, etc.? Or economically self-sufficient so that the country does not require constant aid packages and bailouts from other countries? If the former than no. Economies both large and small have tried this and it generally does not work out very well. Usually a country is very good at some things and not so good at others. Trying to be good at everything may result in loss of efficiency at those things which they are good at, and no appreciable improvement in those things they are not. Look at Singapore. Singapore does not attempt to be self-sufficient. It attempts and succeeds at being economically successful. That said it may sometimes make sense to try to diversify your economy so that you are not a single commodity country. Also, it may make sense to find ways of employing your people even if they initially are not terribly efficient. As long as these efforts do not distract from the core strengths it should be ok. Which brings us to the second possible definition. Yes, it would be good for countries to aim at being economically self-sufficient. That is they are are capable of either producing what they need with a sufficient surplus to sell to others and obtain those things which they do not produce themselves. Such a country does not require continual aid and bailouts. ",

            "answer_text": "No. Every country should if possible pay its way, but economic self sufficiency is the surest route to poverty - accelerating and ultimately grinding, devastating poverty. Imagine a dogmatically autarkic (self-sufficient) country with no oil, but plenty of coal. Its ideology forces it to meet all its needs for oil by turning coal to oil. The technology is known, but using it is horrendously expensive. Assume that its climate it unsuitable for growing coffee and tea, so it spends vast sums building, heating and watering enormous greenhouses \u2026 It ceases to buy aircraft from abroad and builds its own more much expensively. The country has problems producing enough food, so it cultivates marginal land, at vast expense. That kind of thing is an extreme nationalist\u2019s wet dream, but it\u2019s the surest road to ruin.
