            "answer_text": "Every answer here is correct. However based upon your question, here is my input. Most sensors are of a binary form. Hello there I have the current temperature, or GPS position, or someone has walked in front of my car, ready for you. It is up to the MCU/CPU to respond, mostly commonly polling but sometimes via interrupts (which are cool, but require tricky programming). Some sensors (very rare) may collect data over time and save internally or to external devices, SD cards etc. This data still needs to be processed. Very straightforward instructions and examples are available all over the web. Get yourself an UNO starter kit and play around. WP ",

I person who asks such a question probably does not yet fully understand what a sensor is. ",
