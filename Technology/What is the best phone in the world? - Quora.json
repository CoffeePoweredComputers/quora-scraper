            "answer_text": "APPLE IPHONE 11 The best phone for most people SPECIFICATIONS Weight: 194g Dimensions: 150.9 x 75.7 x 8.3 mm OS: iOS 13 Screen size: 6.1 inches Resolution: 828 x 1792 CPU: Apple A13 Bionic (7 nm) RAM: 4GB Storage: 64/128/256GB Battery: 3,110 mAh Rear camera: 12MP Wide-Angle + 12 MP Ultra-Wide-Angle Front camera: 12MP REASONS TO BUY +Superb dual-lens camera+Blazingly fast+Great battery life+Lovely design and build+Impressive audio If you're an Apple fan and can't stretch financially to the tri-camera-toting awesomeness that is the iPhone 11 Pro, then the iPhone 11 makes a great case as a cheaper alternative \u2013 and its balance of power and price makes us think it's the best phone for most people in 2020.  The iPhone 11 comes in a variety of attractive, bright colours, and features a quality 6.1-inch HDR Liquid Retina display, Apple's latest and greatest A13 Bionic chipset, 3GB of RAM, a 3,110 mAh battery, and 64GB of storage space in the entry model (which can be taken up to 256GB with extra spend). It is, across the board, a well-equipped and very well made phone that, straight out of the box, feels great in the hand. Apple has really caught up and gone past its rivals with the iPhone 11 series, though admittedly these are still pricey phones. Read: Apple iPhone 11 reviewWhat you don't get in the Apple iPhone 11 is the same flexibility of camera that you get in iPhone 11 Pro \u2013 and that's because it has a dual-camera, rather than a tri-camera. Plus, the screen (while large and clear) is also trumped by the Pro range and some other, equally-priced devices. Regardless, though, as T3 concluded in our official review of the phone, the \"iPhone 11 strikes a brilliant balance between features and price. You wouldn't know it's the cheaper of Apple's phones from its build, camera and speed. If only it had an OLED screen\u2026\" As such, we feel the iPhone 11 is the best phone Apple currently makes in terms of bang for your buck, and as such is an easy recommend for most users (unless you have to have Android as an operating system on your phone).

            "answer_text": "There is no right or wrong answer to this question; every phone aims for a slightly different audience, with different values. As of today, the two main operating systems are iOS and android, and they have very different philosophies. Android can be further broken down to each individual OEM, which also has different philosophies from each other. Let\u2019s first talk about Android. The main idea behind android, is to make a phone that is very customizable, with an endless array of tweaking options. Android has a huge focus on UI based personalization, where all phones can add widgets, icons, change themes, and even go deep into system files to tweak the phone to your liking. The downside to this approach is fragmentation; sometimes you will see app duplicates installed by the OEM, and having an open system means that carriers have the freedom to load the phones with junk. In addition to that, paid apps can easily be obtained for free by downloading the APK, which means developers will earn less money developing for android than for iOS, thus the reason why Android apps are often noticeabley inferior to iOS. That said, however, Android is closer related to a desktop operating system in how multitasking works. Apps stay open and running in the background, and android devices with 6GB of RAM or more can hold more apps in memory than iPhones. Long story short, Android is designed like a desktop OS for phone, with the ability to customize the whole OS and personalize it to a great extent, as well as hosting tons and tons of features. iOS on the other hand, has a very different outlook compared to android. Where as android focuses on user customizability, iOS is more of an automated system. There are very few customization options in the settings, making this a very locked down system. This may seem quite anti-consumer, but it helps by enforcing personal privacy, and is the first line of defence against malware (though iOS is not completely malware-immune). iOS has a very heavy focus on apps; Apple provides developers with many APIs that are optimized for iOS devices, so apps generally run better, and look better on iOS, especially modern, graphically intensive games. (Fun fact: even google\u2019s apps are better made for iPhone, ironically). Another strength on iOS is the immediate software updates. Updates appear on devices the moment Apple releases them, where as on android, some OEMs can take up to 6 months to roll out patches. This is very important when there are malware out there like meltdown and spectre that needs to be patched. TL;DR: iOS is more focused on a polished app experience and has higher levels of security than android; as well as faster updates; though it trades features and customization for all of these. Also, if you own a Mac or another iOS device, they can sync all your files together. If you have read up to this point, you might be thinking, well all I covered is the operating systems\u2026 what about the phones? Truth be told, the OS is probably the biggest differentiator of the phones. I think that most phones are honestly pretty fairly priced for what they deliver. For example, the Galaxy note 8 has feature after feature after feature, with incredible screens and powerful processor, but comes at the steep price of $960. The Oneplus 5T has more powerful internals as the note 8 (same processor, more RAM), with a great screen, decent cameras; although the fact that it costs $470, nearly half of the note 8, do realize that it\u2019s privacy and security is probably one of the poorest. The google pixel 2 comes with one of the best still image cameras ever on a phone, with its unique google designed software and hardware, and costs $870. The iPhone X is the most powerful phone in the world and has the best video camera, and although it does not have as many features as the note 8, it lives up to its $1000 price tag by delivering a unique, polished user experience via its gesture based UI. So there you go, my take on answering your question. Currently I\u2019m using an iPhone 7 Plus. ",
