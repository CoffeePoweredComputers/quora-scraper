            "answer_text": "2 ways I'm looking at this: (As an energy industry professional that was an astrophysics major in school). (Please Google the unfamiliar terms, I don't have time to explain everything here, it would take books) Basic semantics:Force (push) = mass times acceleration = newtons Energy (fuel, heat) = force times distance = newton meters or joules, watt hours Power (electricity) = energy per second = joules per second = watts 1 Conventional -  Gravity can be used for utility scale energy storage - we are talking Gigawatt Hours, not the Kilowatt hours you see in commercial facility batteries - and FYI your house probably uses probably 5-15 kilowatt hours of electrical energy a day, mostly in the evening when you get home and turn everything on. Utility scale energy storage like pumped hydro electric or the new rail energy storage systems use gravity potential energy based on pushing mass up a hill and then letting it come back down again.  This technology helps unreliable (not 24/7) renewables like wind and solar, because Power is instantaneous voltage; there is not really any storage. There are no batteries on earth that can power a city; unless you count the existing pumped hydro electric damns, which are a gravity based potential energy batteries.  Gravity Potential Energy Provides energy storage with on demand power from unreliable sources of Renewable Power like wind and solar.  Literally - a Gravity Potential Energy Storage will allow solar and wind power generated during the day to be saved until later to give you electricity to watch TV and cook dinner at night.(there, said the same thing 7 different ways). That Gravity energy storage is existing, real technology that is slowly developing commercially as the power economics change.  Energy storage isn't needed when Coal, Natural Gas, and Uranium are Cheap.  (You build just a billion dollar power plant, not a power plant plus double or triple the cost with some sort of energy storage or battery)  You get rid of them and switch to wind and solar, then maybe you have the money to build energy storage in addition to building the billion dollars of wind and solar plants - and even then you are basically doubling the cost of electricity; because instead of building a power plant; you are building a power plant plus a giant power battery - build twice as much; twice the loan to pay off (if you don't believe me, read up the rate case from you local public utility commission on how your electric bill is calculated). 2 - Unconventional Gravity based power - getting more like science fiction.  My Major was astrophysics.  So here is the astrophysics answer for gravity power.  Freshman Physics 101 (kinematics) says Gravity does no work, it just changes from kinetic energy to potential energy.  On one hand that is true in terms of kinematics.  It also is a convenient dodge based on taking gravity for granted when you live on a planet's surface. On the other hand - gravity is pushing you constantly into the ground - at 32 feet per second squared on the surface of the earth...  That force creates heat.  Geothermal energy is the result of gravitational force (and conveniently if they calculated geothermal heat flux correctly - the US only has around 300 GW of geothermal coming up through the crust, and our peak load is closer to 1000 GW; so geothermal has basic limits of availability beyond the technical challenges) The force of gravity does convert to power and energy.  The molten core of a planet; the nuclear fusion caused by gravity at the core of a star - Stars are technically gravity powered because the gravity creates the fusion.  A Star is a Gravity powered fusion reactor. And solar energy allows solar power.  Solar energy heats the earth and creates wind.  Fossil Fuels are solar energy stored in plants and decomposed into hydrocarbons.  Nuclear power comes from radioactive fissionable materials - conventionally we use uranium and plutonium - both of which were born in a super nova - again caused by the force of gravity collapsing a star to power nuclear chemistry processes. So technically - all the energy we experience in the universe started as gravity, was converted into fusion, became photons, then became chemical energy that we eat and burn everyday. All Energy started out as gravity.  That's the astrophysicist answer. But here is the real heart of the question - can we we directly convert gravity to electricity?   Theoretically - yes.  Play with the relativistic equations for gravity; and sure, mathematically on paper you can write the equation to convert gravity into electricity. 2 problems with theoretically turning gravity into electricity directly on the surface of a planet. First - nobody knows how to engineer it.  There is no good science I've seen to convert gravity directly into electricity.  Right now it's basically science fiction; unless you can do like a reverse Mach- Lorentz force thruster that converts gravitational acceleration into electrical current.  Might be some merit there - I haven't read up on it in years.  But you have to figure out how to convert gravitational acceleration into electrical current. Second - If you can figure out how to convert gravity into electricity - you have to consider the \"environmental\" consequences. Again - it you run the equations - which is pretty esoteric unless you like theoretical astrophysics or are having a beer with Feynman and Einstein - it looks like in terms of general relativity that gravity is coupled to time. Again - taking things for granted - first imagine a place without gravity, now think about a place without time to wrap your head around it.  We know that as you increase your energy state (usually speed), your mass, and there for your gravity increases (E=mc^2), and as a resultant time slows down. So if you ask where gravity gets it's power from.  The answer looks like Time has something to do with the force of gravity - because they are inversely proportional in their rate of change.  We know that gravity and time directly change with each other. So if you find a way to suck the electricity out of gravity; relativistically speaking, you will probably slow down time... And again, speaking as an astrophysicist - slowing down time on earth while the rest of the solar system keeps going - gives me a headache just trying to think of the consequences. The math would get complicated  trying to describe it (Good exercise for Grad students) - and honestly I've never tried (we're talking multi dimensional differential relativistic tensors between the earth and the solar system.)  You would have to suck a lot of power out of gravity/time to significantly dilate time.  But if you are powering a planet with 6+ Billion People, you can probably slow down time enough to cause some interesting consequences if not actual problems... Hope that answers your question. ",

            "answer_text": "Absolutely. Absolutely. Absolutely. The fact that gravity is a force rather than an energy is irrelevant , so don't get sucked in by people that know facts but have little understanding of the entire pictures workings as a whole. I think we all understand that when you lift an object you impart energy which is \u201cstored\" as potential and transformed into kinetic energy as gravity brings the object toward the centre of the earth as much as it can. A good example of this would be an accumulator circa 1900\u2032s. These devices were large vertical cylinders like a super sized car engine cylinder. They also had a piston within them which sealed to the walls of the cylinder like a hydraulic ram. Potential energy was \u201cgiven\" to the piston by pumping a fluid like water or oil into the cylinder with a pump, raising the piston up the cylinder to be released as nessarsary, driven by gravity, giving back stored energy in the form of pressurised fluid. Simple\u2026..effective\u2026\u2026.and a one way trip? Definately not!! In order to use this arrangement to \u201ccreate\u201d a source of energy, not simply store energy, you need to find a way to raise the piston back up the cylinder without giving energy to it in the first place. This too can be done using gravity. People mistakenly believe that this is impossible. My invention proves this and can make electricity continuously from this system running on gravity alone. By displacing the fluid back out the bottom of the cylinder and letting it reenter the top of the cylinder onto the top of the cylinder you create another potential energy waiting for gravity to act upon it to raise the piston. You need to change the function of this piston/cylinder arrangement from a gravity operated hydraulic ram to a gravity operated hydrostatic system. You do this by closing off the outlet at the bottom of the cylinder, placing the piston and cylinder in a state of hydraulic lock where the vacuum created under the cylinder when you try to physically lift the piston prevents such action. To enable the raising of the piston a couple of things need to be right. The piston needs to be lighter than the volume of fluid it displaces, like a boat is, you need to break the hydraulic lock, and the piston will need something to sit on. By opening a passageway for the fluid to travel through the piston to the underside of the piston, all three requirements are met. This is the crux of my invention. Gravity applies force to BOTH the piston and the fluid simultaneously. This causes the fluid to apply a hydrostatic pressure to the piston on all sides. Top, bottom and inside the passageway. Because the fluid has a higher density than the piston, gravity's effect on the fluid is greater than on the piston, so the fluid releases it's potential energy and travels downwards, imparting potential energy to the piston as it is raised to the top of the cylinder again, exactly like a boat. The piston floats. We then seal the passageway in the piston again, the open the outlet at the bottom of the cylinder again to release the piston potential energy again. Over and over and over. This machine I invented runs non stop powered entirely by the force of gravity, making continuous, free , electricity. So\u2026..can gravity be used to make a renewable energy source.

            "answer_text": "While perhaps intuitively this idea might sound plausible, the answer to your question is No.The gravity can not be used as an energy source. In fact, strictly speaking, gravity itself can not be used as an energy source at all. You are confusing forces with energy, which are very different things.Energy is a property of objects, such as balls, atoms, light beams, or batteries. In contrast, forces describe the interaction between objects. Forces are the way that energy is transferred from one object to another when they interact, but forces are not the energy itself. Gravity is a force, so it just provides one way for objects to exchange and transform energy to different states.If I lift a bowling ball to the top of a hill and let it go, the ball falls, speeds up, and seems to gain energy. Isn\u2019t this a case of gravity giving energy to the bowling ball? No. Again, gravity is just a force, so it just describes how objects interact. The energy that the ball displays as a falling motion came from my muscles when I hefted the bowling ball to the top of the hill, and not from gravity. Gravity just provides a way to temporarily store energy in an object. We call the energy that an object gains when you lift it against a force \u201cpotential energy\u201d. The energy comes from the lifting agent and not from the force. The force just provides a way to transfer energy from one object (my muscles) to another object (potential energy in the lifted ball). When I let go of the ball, gravity converts the potential energy of the ball to the kinetic energy (motional energy) of the ball. But the ball can never gain more kinetic energy than the total potential energy that I put into it by lifting it.It is true that gravity is \u201cunlimited\u201d in the sense that it never turns off. Earth\u2019s gravity will never go away as long as it has mass. But since this is just a force and not an energy, the never-ending nature of gravity cannot be used to extract infinite energy, or any energy at all, for that matter. Think of gravity loosely like a rubber band. Stretch the rubber band and let go and it snaps back into place. You can therefore store potential energy in a rubber band by stretching it, and this potential energy becomes kinetic energy when you let go. But an unstretched rubber band just sitting there won\u2019t move at all, and can\u2019t create any energy. The energy you see in the rubber band snapping comes from you stretching it and not from the rubber band itself. Neglecting heat losses, the kinetic energy that comes out of the rubber band (how much it snaps) is exactly equal to the potential energy that you put into it using your muscles (how much you stretch it). Lifting an object against gravity is just like stretching the rubber band.

            "answer_text": "Besides examples like those mechanisms involving a weight you manually lift up all similar to clock works, the main thing that comes to mind of course is Hydropower - Wikipedia. And that is marked as part of a series of renewable energy. Of course any dam will indirectly use any source of power that transports water from the ocean back to the river source. Which is - surprise - sun energy. The water cycle illustrations I find only talk of vaporation from ocean and rain on land mass as the main water transport mechanism. The only other thinkable ways are water propelled geothermally or by ourselves with pumps in pumped-storage hydroelectricity plants. And that - at least as far as I know - is at least still more efficient than storing energy in batteries. The sun has no overall energy surplus in the air heat cycle, unless that is unbalanced through CO2CO2, otherwise the earth would heat up day by day and we couldn\u2019t live here. At night the incoming heat energy is also lost again, mainly as infrared radiation. But indeed the sun energy propels more cycles than the thermodynamical cycle, and any cycle that elevates anything, that can then fall again can be used as gravitational energy. Tidal power plants are another hydropower form I can think of, that\u2019s merely working on the mechanics of earth and moon and doesn\u2019t involve the sun. Another thing you can include is geothermal energy as that was initialized by the planet formation of Earth. It\u2019s a mix from gravitation that formed the core and heated it, but also radioactivity, and in the very long term this isn\u2019t in equilibrium with the input heat from the sun, the core very slowly cools down. Amd then, but that\u2019s off topic when asking about gravitation, any other cycle like plant growth and digestion of them is finally getting energy from the sun. All these inputs contribute to energy we can make profit from, mainly we profit from any situation in such cycles, where the sun lowers the entropy. In case of wind we profit from the rise of entropy, when wind flows from high to low pressure, but that only is possible, because the sun managed to let this higher pressure region establish. To conclude you could say only tidal forces and geothermal energy is purely graviatational energy, making use of all the mass that \u201cfell together\u201d to form the Earth and then also the moon. With a slight contribution from radioactivity keeping up this core heat. But we make more energy from the sun powered hydropower plants. ",

At best, gravity can provide a means of storing energy. Hydroelectric energy, as has been pointed out in other answers, is an example of the use of gravity to obtain energy. The energy actually comes from the sun. Solar energy evaporates water at the surface of a body of water, which then condenses at a higher altitude, and we can recover some of that energy by controlling its fall to a lower altitude. Gravity is an element of the means of harnessing that energy, not the source. Closer to home is the old-fashioned grandfather clock in which winding it raised a weight instead of tightening a spring. Gravity enables us to store human energy in the weight and then slowly recover it to power the clock. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, it is done all the time and in fact is one of the most ancient methods of harnessing renewable energy. Any mass that is farther from the center of the earth that can be transported closer to it possesses a certain amount of Potential Energy, or PE, which is best expressed in units called Joules. (As a matter of suggested best practice, always work in the metric, or SI system for all energy calculations and convert back to non-metric at the end, if that\u2019s what someone else wants). The amount of PE is determined by the multiplying the mass by the force of gravity and the difference in height, according to the equation PE = mgh Near the surface of the earth, g exerts a Force of about 9.8 Newtons per kilogram of mass, so we insert or \u201cplug in\u201d the value 9.8 for g in the equation. So, an object with a mass of 1 kilogram (kg) that can move through a height of 1 meter has PE = 1kg * 9.8 N * 1 meter = 9.8 Joules A Joule is equal to 1 Watt for 1 second, so the case could provide 1 Watt of power for 9.8 seconds if we let if fall slowly. The amount of power we can actually harvest from a gravity potential is always less than the PE, because of friction and other losses in all mechanical and electrical systems. Also, note that this is a one-way trip. Once the PE has been used, the object is now at a lower gravitational potential. If it is at the \u201cbottom of the hill,\u201d so to speak, then it must be raised again by some outside source of energy. This is where the Sun comes in, in the case of hydroelectric power. In this case, water is evaporated from oceans, rises in the atmosphere, and falls as rain or snow at higher elevation. We harness this energy by forcing the water to flow through a turbine or water wheel to perform work, usually by turning a generator. ",

            "answer_text": "Well yes and no. Gravity itself just provides potential energy. When combined with the water cycle, indeed you have renewable energy:  Ultimately, the energy is not coming from gravity, but from the sun. The sun heats the water until in evaporates. The rain then falls to the ground at a higher elevation, where the potential energy can be used as an energy source. The another exotic usage would be if there is negative mass. Negative mass would be attracted to regular mass. But regular mass is repelled by negative mass. Hence, just by placing the two next to each other you could gain unlimited kinetic energy. This would work because the negative mass is gaining negative energy\u2026 But it is unlikely negative mass exists. Another fairly unusable technique would be Hawking\u2019s radiation. The energy in this case is coming from a black hole. Basically the black hole stores it\u2019s heat in space. When that space is hotter than the universe around the black hole, the result is the black hole becomes a black body radiator. Giving off seemingly free energy. Of course the black hole is paying the debt. Currently there is no energy given off by Hawking\u2019s Radiation, because black holes are colder than the universe surrounding them. Some have speculated the same type of process could be the source of everything we see in the universe. One massive energy loan paid for by gravity. ",

            "answer_text": "Gravity isn't energy per se, it is just a force.  However, whenever you have two distant objects pulling on each other, it implies there is potential energy that could be harvested through gravitational acceleration.  When you think about all the different bodies in the solar system and how distant they are, the amount of energy is vast.  This is why asteroid impacts are so dangerous -- the amount of energy released into the earth's crust and atmosphere upon impact can be incredibly high for a large asteroid. The solar system has no shortage of energy, but what about the earth?  Hydroelectric power is one very crude form of gravitational energy that we have managed to tap with our primitive technology.  It taps a very tiny portion of the atmosphere's natural hydrological cycle, when water that evaporates from the ocean condenses in high up places (such as the top of a mountain).  The water then has a distant enough place to fall to (the ocean) and we can capture some of the power as it accelerates towards that. ",

The fusion that generates energy from matter in the sun would be impossible were it not for the incredible temperatures and pressures that gravity affords in the sun. Indeed, even that process isn't absolutely sustainable. However, since we really can't (and don't want to) throttle that, it's going to last a long, long, long, long, long time. However, using gravity to accomplish that same effect here on Earth is impossible. That's why our fusion research involves magnetic toroids of plasma and inertial confinement.

This is the equivalent of battery storage for when excess power is generated. It is possible to generate power using tides, and tides are a direct result of gravity. These are the most obvious of sources. Now, solar, wind and wave power are obviously renewable. But wind blows when there are differences in pressure or temperature, which are instigated by the Sun, and the energy emanating from the Sun originates from thermonuclear reactions at its core, triggered by immense gravitational pressure. Oceans waves are due to winds. Bonus: nuclear fission actually keep the Sun cool by counteracting gravity. If it weren\u2019t for it, the ball of gas would keep shrinking and getting hotter and hotter. ",

            "answer_text": "There are plenty of good answers here already. Adding a picture is useful, perhaps.  This is the largest pumped storage energy storage in the world. But, even that reservoir stores only enough \u201cgravitational\u201d energy to run for 11 hours and it cost 2.6 $billion to build. Backup costs as much or more than the facility that produces the energy stored. The best solution, usually, is to build BASE energy power sources which require little backup. This facility is not really backup, in fact, but is used to smooth out power demands since it can be ramped up or down very quickly. The fundamental problem with \u201crenewable\u201d energy resources is that they vary dramatically over seasons. They also vary dramatically over even seconds, but that can be compensated if you have enough backup in the form of base power. Since the backup which must be base power costs the same as the power source itself, does it not make good common sense to build the base power and NOT build the unreliable, seasonally dependent power source which cannot meet the power demand reliably? Another graphic would be helpful here.  The above plots photovoltaic output around a year. Integration of the area under the December curve and under the May-August curves shows a ratio of 2.5, typical of a sunny day at a latitude about 35 degrees. How large do you build your PV facility? For sunny days in winter, you need at least 2.5 times larger facility than in summer for the power demand. To put this into context further, let\u2019s meet the electric power demands for the USA with PV farms in Arizona. If we build for the average demand, our plant supplies too much power in winter, and too little in summer. One size does NOT fit all needs and we have wasted money by building too large a plant. OK, let\u2019s build the plant to meet needs in summer only. Then, we cannot meet the winter demands without a 2.5 x larger power source. Remember, the electricity is fed into the entire USA grid, and must heat in winter and cool in summer. The USA climate is much more demanding that the temperate climate of Europe or the UK.This brings us back to storage of energy, whether gravitational or otherwise. How much does that cost? Just as much as the unreliable renewable power system PLUS it must be reliable if we shall not shut hospitals in the midst of operations, and such other disasters.Let\u2019s build reliable base power then, and NOT waste our resources on systems which fundamentally cannot BE reliable since we live on a TILTED planet with seasons. Shipping power between the northern and southern hemispheres might seem like a solution, but 50\u201360% of the electricity would be dissipated as heat over such distances, even if the infrastructure existed which it does NOT. Just ask Germany what it is costing to ship power from the North Sea wind turbines into the interior of Germany where it is to be consumed. It is many BILLIONS of Euros.The question of using gravity as a way to store energy is well understood, but it simply does not add up in a global energy system based on wind and solar. Tides are a useful and predictable source of energy and can be developed to be a contributor to reliable energy, but cannot meet more than a small portion of demand, even in a favorable situation like the UK and the North Sea.

Simply drop a massive object into the black hole and the black hole immense gravitational tidal forces will tear your object apart to the point where 0.42 of it mass get turn into energy. The other 0.58 will get consume by the black hole but that\u2019s ok because the other 0.42 contain alot of energy which you could harness. How much energy?

Calculations are made to size the capacity of the jacks so that on sunny or windy days water is pumped into the jacking system to raise the city, then at night or peak demand that same water is used to reverse the pumps action (ie turn them into motors ) to run generators. Simple. I\u2019m looking for 5 billion to build a prototype. It might be necessary to build it outside territorial waters to avoid beaurocratic delays and to be able to run casinos etc to cover running costs. In that case the system could be reversed, using compressed air to displace ballast water from tanks beneath the city while the whole thing floats calmly in the fiercest of storms due to its massive scale. A floating city might be a bit more cost effective than tge landlocked one, so venture capitalists take note; this one is a bargain (this week only) at only 4bn.

Related may be discovery of volcanic activity on one of the outer planets-one of the gas giants Jupiter i think which surprised the scientific community in the \u201880s. The cause I believe is attributed to the enormous gravitational pull of Jupiter which creates internal heating of such magnitude in one of its moons that it is believed to be the cause of the volcanic activity observed. i leave it to the experts in the astrophysics field to decide whether this phenomenon could be harnessed somehow as renewable energy!

It takes seconds to lift the weight that powers GravityLight, creating 20 minutes of light on its descent.

            "answer_text": "The gravity of the moon causes the tides. Tides have long been used to generate electricity. See 'Harnessing the world's highest tides: massive turbine connected to power grid | CBC News'. Tidal power is generally more expensive than wind and solar since it takes massive equipment installed in a hostile environment, so it is unlikely to play a significant role in satisfying humanity's energy needs. A company in England is developing a scheme to raise and lower weights down a mineshaft. This promises to be a highly efficient energy storage means, but no net energy is generated. See 'Gravitricity'. Gravity itself is not energy but a force. Energy can be stored in or extracted from the gravitational potential energy of two massive bodies by changing their distance from each other. ",

            "answer_text": "Gravity is a force, which can transfer energy, but isn't an energy source itself. In that respect, gravity is often used to store energy. For example, a hydroelectric plant uses the gravitational potential energy of the water behind a dam to generate electricity. In this case out is the water that has energy, not gravity itself. Gravity provides the force that allows the water to perform work on the turbine rotors, which generates electricity.  In order to give a mass gravitational potential, you have to do work on it yourself. This is why gravity can be used to store energy, but not to generate energy. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, if you had a thing that magically generated objects, it would give you free energy. It doesn\u2019t take astronomical distances to see that. If you plopped a water tower full of water into existence, you\u2019d be able to drive a turbine and make energy from it. The energy comes from the gravitational potential energy of the water; it got there via whatever magic means you used to create the water tower. As for the universe as a whole, you have to grapple with more complicated facts. The distances between objects in the universe comes from the big bang, and left to itself, they would eventually all fall together and give off the same amount of energy that created it in the first place. That isn\u2019t all; there\u2019s another source of energy that we don\u2019t really understand that\u2019s actually making them accelerate away rather than towards each other. So \u201cconservation of energy\u201d doesn\u2019t really apply at the largest universal scales, and we don\u2019t fully understand the details of that. On ordinary scales, however (say, the size of a galaxy), conservation of energy holds perfectly well. ",

Kinetic energy, it turns out, is actually gravitational, so heat energy is, too. Most of the energy on earth comes from either Earth\u2019s gravity, or the gravity of the sun and other stars. Hydroelectric power is the Earth\u2019s gravity. The gravitational energy of the water was gained by evaporation due to sunlight, and the winds which are also driven by sunlight. Most of the chemical energy on Earth is captured electromagnetic energy from the sun. But the energy from the sun is gravity, too. It\u2019s what brings the nuclei of the sun close enough for nuclear reactions to take place, causing both direct and thermal radiation. Even nuclear energy, here on Earth, began as gravitational energy; heavy elements are formed in the core of stars. ",

From an engineering perspective, gravity can be used to store energy, but not to generate power or electricity. We already do this very cleverly and effectively using dams and a technique called pumped storage. Utilities have built dams on rivers that pass through a mountain gorge. They run their coal or nuclear plants at night when demand is low and use that power to pump water up the dam to a lake behind the dam. The next day when demand is high they let the water run back down through turbine generators to make electricity. This is important because electricity in the magnitudes that we use it can\u2019t be stored easily. The electricity that is powering your light right now was generated just a few milliseconds ago by a very large rotating generator. Pumped storage is a very effective way of storing the water energy until it is needed and generate that extra needed power on demand. But that power really came from the coal or nuclear or solar or wind plant that originally generated it. ",

            "answer_text": "No, because gravity isn't energy. But gravity can be used to siphon off energy from a planetary body and can be used to increase the kinetic energy of spacecrafts. This can be done by selecting a slingshot orbital trajectory which slows the rotation rate of a planet and slows its orbital velocity as well, transferring this energy to the spacecraft. While strictly speaking this may not be renewable energy, the quantity of energy available would be so large compared to the small amount which would be extracted that it might be considered as such.

If you want to utilize Earth\u2019s gravity, you\u2019ll have to lift something off the surface. Doing so would require energy. Then dropping whatever you lifted would output exactly the same energy you used to lift it so no net energy would be obtained. But like another person said, we do use water in elevated regions to produce energy as it drops. It would be cool to set something up in space though to \u201ccapture\u201d gravity\u2019s effects wouldn\u2019t it? ",

            "answer_text": "Gravity can't be a power source itself, but it can be used as a mechanism to extract power.  In fact, it already is used for that with hydro electric dams. The nuclear fusion of the Sun is the power source there. The radiation emitted from fusing hydrogen into helium heats water,  lifting it in the Earth's gravitational field, and imparting gravitational potential energy. When the water condenses, falls back down, and flows down to sea level, it releases that potential energy, and we extract it.   If we go a level deeper, it's also gravity that's responsible for fusion in the Sun. The gravitational field of the Sun pushes the hydrogen atoms together, causing them to fuse into a lower mass energy state: helium.  The difference in mass between 2 hydrogen atoms and 1 helium atom is released as energy according to Einstein's famous e=mc^2. So the power source is matter to energy conversion, but gravity is the mechanism used to extract it. ",

GravityLight is a gravity-powered lamp designed by the company Deciwatt for use in developing or third-world nations, as a replacement for kerosene lamps. It uses a bag filled with rocks or earth, attached to a cord, which slowly descends similar to the weight drive in a cuckoo clock. This action powers the light for up to thirty minutes.  And most importantly it is cheap , economic and can be utilized by the common man.   ",

            "answer_text": "Absolutely.  We already do it in a roundabout way. Hydroelectric power, for example, harnesses the energy from flowing water to turn turbines.  Water flows because of gravity.  Therefore gravity is indirectly powering any hydroelectric station. Tides are caused by gravity, and it is possible to generate power by harnessing tides. It isn't especially hard to use gravity as an energy source.  The trick is that we have to exploit scenarios in which nature has already done the hard work of getting the water up high where it can flow down and we can steal its energy. ",

            "answer_text": "Gravity has been used for centuries if not millenia, as a renewable energy source. A hydroelectric dam uses the fact that gravity moves water downhill with tremendous force as its power source. Historical implementation of hydro power exists as water wheels, mills etc. Pumped hydro as a storage mechanism exists also, wherein water is pumped uphill when power is abundant and released to flow through a turbine to generate electricity when it is needed. A renewable energy \u201csource\u201d doesn't have to originate the power per se. It can be the result of utilization of an energy transfer mechanism. Similarly, wind is not an energy \u201csource\u201d as defined in other answers here, yet we derive energy from it as the movement of air every day. Gravity transfers the potential energy inherent in mass at elevation to kinetic energy as the mass is allowed to seek a rest state. The water cycle is renewable in that solar radiation from the sun raises the water mass back to elevation through evaporation. So gravity is a part of the entire cycle, providing the attractive force to return the water to its lowest state of potential energy within the system. ",

So, no matter how hard you try, you will always apply the same or greater amount of energy to accumulate enough potential moving against the field to later move an object towards the field. In other words, the only theoretical way to do that is if you find a big and deep dwell to throw objects into without a significant use of energy moving these objects into that deep dwell, objects that of course you will not try to recover, and the same with the cord you will need to get the kinetic energy for using it\u2026 or a huge conveyor going always down.

This sort of \u2018energy\u2019 if it could be called energy is closer to potential energy or mass-displacement than kinetic energy per se. Much progress would be made if someone \u2014- as I believe I have \u2014- solves the problem of proportionality that has plagued most perpetual motion devices throughout history. The way to get this effect might involve the definition of perpetual motion I recently formed at my website: It is much like a wheel... It has a cyclical process...It has potential momentum at every point...And it tends to have more horizontal than vertical motion...as a way of creating a proportional advantage... I also have a number of language proofs defending the idea: PROOF #1: Friction does not eliminate motion where motion is permitted. PROOF #2: Reactions are possible in a circle, as shown by dominoes. Wheels can turn. PROOF #3: Dominoes can chain-react using higher and higher altitudes. Energy can be created. PROOF #4: Dominoes can accelerate, so friction does not stop everything.

If you want a more isolated way to use gravity as an energy source, then another way is the use of tidally driven water turbines, which use the gravitational action of the moon and the sun combined.

Another example are the tidal differences caused by the moon: the moon moves the water by gravity and looses kinetic energy, will rotate slower, so the energy always comes from somewhere else, not from gravity as such.
