            "answer_text": "Are third party cell phone charging cables safe to use? this depends on the type of cable. microUSB cables(for older and cheap smartphones) usually won't have a problem with cheaply built cables.the cable might not work as effectively as it should or break quicker, but it's not that likely to cause serious damage. Apple cables(used in iphones and ipads) can be certified by Apple, giving you an indication of whether a cable is safe or not.certified 3rd party cables will be safe, but due to the increased complexity of the cables uncertified cables are a bit more risky. type C(used in recent high-end smartphones) is high risk.very specific specifications were drawn up for the type C cables to make sure they could handle a wide range of voltages and amperages, but many cheap cable manufacturers found the requirements to be too expensive and used cheaper components instead. one of the most common mistakes cheap cable manufacturers make is to not include a 56k\u2126 resistor or use one with an incorrect resistance, but this can cause big problems with negotiating the amperage used for charging. such badly built cables can easily destroy your charger or charging port. in short: you can safely use 3rd party charging cables, as long as you check the reviews and don't go for the cheapest option.",

            "answer_text": "Generally, all third party cables does not pose much safety issue. The only safety issue i can think of is exposed wire. So what is the difference between expensive and cheap cables? all cheap cables have thinner wires. This means it cannot charge as fast (does not support fast charge)most cheap cables is only able to charge your phone. It is incapable of transfering data.all cheap cable tends to have thinner outer protection (note: this isn\u2019t the eletrical wire but the rubber protection). This means that without proper care, the rubber will tear(?) off, exposing the live wire inside.(based on person experience) the inner metal parts(?) at the tip of the cable, which is used to charge the phone might become loose after multiple usage. This means after multiple plugging in and out, the cable might fail to charge your phone because of loose connection.To summarise it all: cheap cable is not unsafe as compared to more expensive one. But without proper care, the rate it deteriorates (everything we use has a lifespan) to an unusable state is faster. Personally, i use both cheap and more expensive ones. The better ones are the one i carry around while i left the cheaper one at home so it doesnt have to take the constant abuse from my daily usage. Charging-wise, you should be more worried about the actual charger instead. For that, i will leave it ti others to answer since i already explained what's required. ",

            "answer_text": "That depends on the cable that you buy. Apple has a program in place where they sell a little chip that goes in the lightning connector, it allows the manufacture of the cable to stamp the cable MFI. It stands for made for iPhone iPod iPad. It means it meets a certain standard that Apple has set, and it should mean that the cable will deliver the voltage/wattage/in fridge from the wall charger to the device appropriately. Personally I\u2019ve had MFI cables fail within a year, and I\u2019ve had non MFI cables last for years without any problems. I preferred to buy my cables as thick as possible. If you stay away from skinny thin weak frail looking cables you\u2019ll be in good shape. There is a brand out called Union Station that appears to be pretty bulky, but not too bulky. My daughter has one and she seems to like it. I bought a five pack from Amazon from a company called small electronics and I\u2019ve had them for a while and I haven\u2019t had a problem. So in answering your question, number one, yes Apple products are overpriced, you can buy two cables for the price of one at the Apple store. And yes you will be able to charge your IDEVICE just fine with the third-party cable, just make sure that you buy A quality cable and not a skinny little cable from a bucket at the front cashier at the gas station.

            "answer_text": "In general, the risk is low when using third part cables when charging. The biggest risk is to damage the phone socket if the electrical contact is not very good or the dimensions are not right. The most usual effect is that a bad quality cable will charge the phone slower or at all. Most of them will be able to transfer data. There is a very low risk for the cable to overheat if the contact is imperfect or short circuit. The energy is low, but there is still a theoretical chance to put something flammable in fire. I recommend to buy, for charging, cables rated at 2.5A(mpers) or higher. From my experience they charge well, as long as the producer does not lie about it - however it\u2019s kind of risky to lie so clear. \u201cQuick charging\u201d is not much sensible to cable quality than normal charging, because they use higher voltage and for the same charging speed they can actually use lower current (Ampers). Current is the one that needs thicker copper wires. For charging with more than 2A you should probably get a special cable, from the phone\u2019s producer, that has a small chip inside. The chip is signaling to the the phone that it is safe to use this cable with more than 2A, that it will not melt ;) ",

            "answer_text": "Third Party Charging Cables are a danger to your phone. Last year Apple analyzed all the third party iPhone and iPad charging cables they could find on the major online shopping sites. They found that the majority of them were counterfeit and could in fact seriously damage the mobile devices. In Apple\u2019s case you can look for the MFi (Made for iPhone/iPad/iPod) certification, which indicates that the wiring in the cable is correct an that the chip in the cable is able to communicate correctly with the charge and the device, so the charging level and the charging rate is correct so you get a rapid charge without cooking the battery. Third party cables that are not certified will not communicate correct (or at all) which could result in unreliable charging or overcharging of the battery. If yo do not use an Apple device then there is no certification to protect you, so its best to buy the best cable and charger that you can, and avoid the cheap forgeries. ",

Some third party cables are actually better quality than the original. If you have some failed cables, check them out for yourself (they don\u2019t have to be phone cables, just audio will do). Scrape away the insulation until you\u2019ve exposed all the internal wires. On some audio cables, I\u2019ve discovered that the signal wire is only a single strand! As long as your phone is charging properly, the cable is probably OK. If the internal wires are too thin, they\u2019ll probably handle the charging current but will fail under regular flexion. If you notice that a charging cable is generating heat itself while in use\u2014get rid of it immediately. ",

If you see a real good deal like 2 cables for $4.70, you can bet that they were made as cheaply as possible. I use a lot of cables and the only OEM cables I ever get are the ones that come with the device. Almost all the others I get from Amazon. If you see many hundreds of buyers and 4+ stars, you can be reasonably assured that it's a decent cable.. The cloth covered ones tend to be more durable. Personal experience is that I have never had a USB cable fail or break due to workmanship. I have worn several out but they are supposed to be expendable instead of the socket on your phone. You don't want to have to replace that! Also, some cables are for charging only so make sure that they say they sync or can be used for data transfer. Usually it's the cheap ones that skimp. ",

It you are a light user and only recharge you phone overnight you will probably be OK with a third party cable. If you are a typical or heavy user stick with the OEM cable which allows a faster recharge when needed. ",

In most cases, the voltage is low-enough that they would not be an issue from a safety perspective. And, in general, the typical micro-USB cables tend to be uniformly similar - the charge rate depends on the transformer and/or circuits used with the charger, not the physical cable itself. However, my experience shows that the quality of the charger can vary. The inexpensive ones tend to be much more fragile - or certainly break easily due to use of substandard material. With iPhone Lightning cable equivalents, my son\u2019s experience shows that they corroded (the same pin on both sides always!) quicker than the ones supplied by Apple, but the Apple ones have not been immune either. This must be the power pin \u2026 with higher current than the other ones perhaps. ",
