            "answer_text": "I think Thomas has given a good account of what would happen if Sauron were to win the War of the Ring, and was let to rule the Middle Earth. But I don't think it would turn out that way. Let's see how the events turn out.  Frodo & Sam are captured at the Guard Tower after the fight between Shagrat and Gorbag doesn't end in bloody mess, there are few survivors, who eventually come to their senses. Sam is unable to overwhelm the remnant of the orcs and is captured as well. The Ring finally reaches in the hands of Sauron, while the leaders of the West are knocking on the Doors of Mordor.     Sauron, with the Ring back in hand, goes for a swift victory, surrounding the host of the Men, who are outnumbered heavily. They go down fighting, but in the end, the legions of orcs, Easterlings, and Haradrim, riding on the wave of optimism and turning tide after the reclamation of the Ring from Sauron. Sauron himself comes to the battle to deal the final blow to the last standing Gandalf and Aragorn. The fight lasts for some time, but both Aragorn and Gandalf eventually fall, and are killed by Sauron. A few scouts do make it out of the battle and fly back to Minas Tirith to report. Faramir, the steward of Gondor, makes decisions, and sends messengers to Rivendell, Lorien, Mirkwood and Grey Havens, asking them to unite all elves and defend together. The Gondorians and Rohirrim flee their lands, taking refuge either in the lost caves in the mountains or in Elven realms. Faramir and Eowyn both head to Grey Havens, both as refuge, as well as to arrange for messenger to be sent to Valinor to ask for help, as it is clear the power of Elves and Men (and Dwarves) is not enough to fight the armies of Sauron. Sauron eventually overruns the South, taking over Minas Tirith, Edoras and Isengard. After consolidating the south, Sauron is preparing for the siege of the Elven realms. By this time, the messenger of Cirdan reaches Valinor, and delivers the plea of the Free Peoples of Middle Earth. The Valar have already heard about the state of affairs from the spirit of Gandalf (Olorin) which rests for now in Mandos, and they are contemplating the actions and plans. After listening to the plea of the messenger, they quickly assemble the forces of Elves. The Noldor are eager to help their kindred, and the Teleri join as well as there are no grievances to hold them back this time. The combined forces of Noldor and Teleri elves reach the hither shores as Sauron puts simultaneous siege on Rivendell, Mirkwood and Lorien.  The Teleri, high in number and with better ships and weapons, quickly take over Umbar & South Gondor, and cut off the supply lines from Harad to Mordor. The Noldor, along with the Elves from Grey Havens and the Men from Gondor and Rohan, under the stewardship of Faramir attack the forces of Sauron, throwing off the Siege of Rivendell quickly and eventually defeating all the hosts of Mordor near Lorien. The Wood-Elves, with the help of the Men from Dale and Dwarves of the Iron Hills and Lonely Mountain defeat the remnant forces in the region. Sauron, furious with this defeat, challenges the leader of the Noldor for a one-on-one battle. The leader is none other than Finrod Felagund, the High King of Noldor, who was killed, back in the First Age in Minar Tirith by Sauron himself. Long and hard they fought, but Sauron was not the same Great Lieutenant of Morgoth that killed Finrod, for he was diminished in the three ages after pouring his power into his dark business. He was no match for the reincarnated Elf-lord, and thus he was finally defeated, captured and taken to Valinor where his trial would take place. The Aftermath: Since Aragorn is dead, the line of the Kings is finally ended. There is no more salvation of Mankind with fresh Elven blood from Arwen. Both Aragorn and Eomer are killed in the Battle in front of the Black Gate, thus the rule of the two kingdoms is passed on to Faramir, the ruling Steward, and Eowyn, the Guardian of the Rohirrim. As both the kingdoms suffered heavy losses in the battles, their populations were severely diminished. So when Faramir married Eowyn, they also decide to merge both the kingdoms, to form a single Kingdom, Hyarmendor. Elrond takes over the guardianship of the North, and assists the Men in the north in forming a democratic state. Galadriel, happy to meet her brother once more, decides that she has had enough of the Middle Earth and departs with Finrod to Valinor, with a heartbroken Arwen, whose grief knows no bound having lost the one she loved, she now rests in the West with Nienna.   Okay this was quite a speculative scenario that I have written about, so let me give some reasoning behind it. 1. Aragorn, Gandalf and the Company, everyone dies in front of the Black Gate. There is no way they will survive, if Sauron has the Ring. 2. Once Sauron has the Ring, the best course of action for the Stewards of Gondor and Rohan is to assemble their folks and run away to shelter. Their heavily diminished armies (from 2-3 battles) cannot withstand the onslaught of the armies of Mordor. I will wager the best place to go for them is Grey Havens. 3. Sauron, with the Ring, cannot be defeated by the tiny realms left. Their numbers are too small. To fight is the path to utter destruction. Their only hope lies in the West. It is unimaginable that the remaining Lords (and Ladies) of the Middle Earth would not seek help from the Valar. If I were any of them, that would be my first task, to appoint someone to seek help from the Valar. 4. Remember that Valar, though critical I am of their rule, were passive in the dealings of the Middle Earth for a reason. Firstly, they wanted the Men to empower themselves to fight against all evil, and make themselves self-sufficient. They also wanted the Elves to learn from their mistakes. That is why they sent five Wizards to assist the Free Peoples, and not five warrior Maiar, and also why Elrond assumes that the Valar will not allow the Ring to be taken to Valinor, as it is \"a problem of the Middle-Earth, and the Middle-Earth has to solve it\". But once it becomes clear to them that the Free Peoples of the Middle Earth have failed in their attempts, and their emissaries are all down as well (Two lost in the East, One turned to Evil, One gone native, and the last One who was the hope of all, dies twice), they will realise the need for stronger action, and will quickly send the forces to counter & defeat Sauron. 5. An important question that the inquisitive minds might be wondering about: Who would be the messenger? In the First Age, it was the famed and prophesied Earendil the Mariner, who bore the Silmaril on his Voyage to the abode of the Valar. In the Third Age, the most fitting person to bear the message would be Arwen, for who can convince the Valar better than her, but the descendant of Luthien and Earendil, both of whom managed to convince the Valar for their cause. She, bearing the broken Elessar as the token of the broken dreams of both Men and Elves, the token of the defeat of the Free Peoples of the Middle Earth, laments to Manwe & Varda, and moved by her grief, they immediately dispatch the host of Elves to defeat the Dark Lord Sauron.

            "answer_text": "Tolkien actually discusses this in Letter #183: Sauron desired to be a God-King. He was thrice involved in treachery: First, admiring strength, he had followed Morgoth and become his chief agent in Middle-earth. Second, when Morgoth fell he forsook his allegiance, but from fear only and remained in Middle-earth. Third, seeing how his knowledge was greatly admired and how easy it was to influence other rational creatures, he re-assumed the position of Morgoth's representative in the Second Age. By the end of the Third Age, although actually weaker than before, he claimed, in his pride, to be Morgoth returned. If victorious he would have demanded divine honour and absolute temporal power over all. (Emphasis added.) So a victorious Sauron would have blurred the distinction between himself and Morgoth, and he would have demanded universal worship. You would have to recognize him as a god, or indeed as God. An entire world order would have been set up solely to boost Sauron's ego by having the entire world grovel before him and call him Lord. It follows that he would try to eradicate all knowledge and memory of the \"true\" God, Eru Il\u00favatar. The Elves could never be persuaded to believe in Sauron's self-serving theology, so either he would exterminate them to the least and the last, or possibly even allow them to sail into the West and be rid of them. Once he was the undisputed world dictator, Sauron would not necessarily see it as his task to make life as miserable as possible for everyone; Tolkien noted that in his early solo career he genuinely wanted to give his subjects a good life. But as pride consumed him, just having his will was the only \"motivation\" that remained. Perhaps, even in Sauron's world, you could have a somewhat decent life as long as you went along with the universal cult demanded by the self-made deity in Barad-d\u00fbr. But quite likely Sauron would have demanded grotesqueries like human sacrifice just to test the absolute obedience of his subjects. And there would be zero tolerance for ANY opposition. Think Orwell's 1984 in a pseudo-medieval setting, with magic instead of technology. If we imagine a world where Sauron has regained the One Ring, and possibly also captured the other Rings of Power that remained, he might go back to the original plan. His main representatives across Middle-earth would all be equipped with a Ring, giving them great power, but their minds would in turn be enslaved to Sauron's will via the One Ring. Disobedience would not be an option -- indeed it would not even be conceivable. Would the Valar, or Eru, have intervened? Presumably the question is moot. They DID intervene, by sending the Wizards, and ultimately it would seem that Eru Himself pulled whatever strings of fate were necessary to make Frodo's quest succeed. The details were however left to the free will of the participants. The Wizards could stay faithful (as did Gandalf) or fall (as did Saruman); it would make a world of difference for them as individuals, but not for the destined outcome of the conflict. Gollum, in particular, could have redeemed himself by following his better impulses, and in the end he would have taken the Ring from Frodo and cast himself into the lava on purpose, thus deliberately saving Frodo by sacrificing himself. (Tolkien discusses this in one of his letters.) Sadly, Gollum did not avail himself of this chance of redemption, but \"doom\" had its way in any case. And Sauron was \"doomed\". He would never be allowed to set himself up as a false god totally dominating Middle-earth. ",
