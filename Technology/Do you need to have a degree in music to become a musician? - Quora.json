            "answer_text": "Being a musician can mean many things. Obviously you don\u2019t need any qualification to learn to play an instrument - many of the worlds best musicians don\u2019t have one. If you want to play in a band then you just need to be able to do what\u2019s required. If the band is recording then you may need to understand how studio work is done and may need to be able to read music scores. Many gigging musicians cannot read music and just learn to play everything by ear. If you want to be a session musician then it\u2019s pretty much a requirement that you can sight-read music and perform very well. If you want to work in the music industry then depending on the role you may or may not need such a qualification. If you want to be a music teacher at a school or academy they may require it. So - the answer is - yes and no, depending on the circumstances. You definitely can have a great career as a musician without any qualifications if you have the ability to play well for the situations required. ",

We need to be immersed in the music and the genres. I\u2019m a fan of school as access to great teachers AND inspiring and talented students is possible. That\u2019s what school is designed for. Music degrees are interesting. If you play really well, show up on time, work well with others, no one will care if you have a degree. But getting a degree is part of what teaches us to carry ourselves like professionals. People hire professionals who don't bring drama, are on time, have instruments in good condition, are prepared, etc. The college environment, depending upon how robust, prepares us well for this. ",

As a performer, no, you really don\u2019t. Either you can play or you can\u2019t. Wes Montgomery is my go to example of someone who made it and yet could not read music at all. If you want to do serious studio work and musical pit work for others in a variety of styles, reading is essential and you have to be musically versatile. But that doesn\u2019t mean you need a degree to do it. ",

            "answer_text": "\u201cAre music diplomas actually necessary to pursue a music career?\u201d In general? Not in the slightest. There are many tools an artist can use to create art. While a diploma can give you certain tools, those tools are by no means the only ones around. In fact, most of the music in the rock, folk, and hip-hop genres (as well as many others) have been made by people who learned what they know from playing and analyzing their favorite records and playing gigs. However, if you want a career as a music teacher, a composer, or a theatre or opera star? While perhaps not 100% necessary, it\u2019s more likely than not that you\u2019ll need at least a bachelor\u2019s. Diplomas are pieces of paper that tell other prestigious institutions that you have acquired a certain set of skills. If you think those skills or that message to those institutions will work in your favor, then go for it! If not, then there are plenty of other ways to learn. Simple as that. Thanks for listening, and I hope this helps. ",

For your grade 10 exam For piano, memorize 7 songs and tons of fast scales\u2026 it's really hard. You need to average I think 70% of each section plus hearing or get 75% overall. Grade 10 is soooo hard where it's really really hard to get an over 90. If you do get above 75, go ARCT teacher OR ARCT performance. You are officially now a musician . Well, yea generally speaking that's how you do it. Or maybe you go into band or something. Yes I know this because I am grade 10 RCM ",
