            "answer_text": "There\u2019s a short simple answer to this which we should understand with the help of an example. In western countries, online streaming apps or platforms were way famous and popular. There was a huge difference of time when this happened in India. Main reason was internet connectivity. There people had a good internet connectivity, therefore Spotify and Netflix like apps were there with a good content and quality of music streaming online. Since this Jio has come, internet itself has revolutionised in India. So the thing I wanted to tell is:- If you have a better \u201cWiFi\u201d connection, where you don\u2019t need to store so much in your phone itself, you should go with 64GB but if you have to keep stuff offline then you should go with 128GB. Other thing is, like I\u2019m using 32GB iPhone 7Plus and I\u2019ve been using 32GB iPhone since 3 years so I know how to manage and I must say 64GB would be sufficient but keeping in mind that iPhone SE 2020 has bionic chip so size of photos it captures through phone\u2019s camera must be a little more than that of iPhone 7Plus. My main problem I encounter is that I have a habit of storing so much of photos, negligible selfies, but the moments so most of the storage in my phone is filled with photos. One more thing, this is a suggestion. Apple offers you 5GB of free cloud storage which gets full in a couple of months or may be 4 months. But beyond it, they charge \u20b975/m for 50GB of cloud storage. Believe me there sync and all is very good if you change your devices or to have that backup in multiple device. So use your cloud storage wisely, though you can backup your phone to your PC or laptop but still use it wisely. I hope this helps. ",

            "answer_text": "If you\u2019re a normal user and have a good wifi or data connection then a 64GB device should be sufficient. However, if you intend to shoot a lot of pictures and videos and need to download and store your favourite TV series and movies from your subscribed OTT platforms for viewing later in offline mode, you may consider the 128GB storage on your device. Apple offers 5GB of iCloud storage free, if you see yourself subscribing to more online storage then a 64GB device should be sufficient for you, but if you don't intend to purchase more iCloud storage and are going to be content with the free iCloud offering you might want to get the 128GB device. I use an iPhone 7 Plus with 256GB storage and am currently using 175GB of the offline storage. But, I also have an iPhone 8 with 64GB storage and thats more than sufficient since I don't store anything offline. On that device, I have subscribed to online iCloud storage and everything is online. So, you\u2019ll have to know your usage before you make a choice. ",
