            "answer_text": "Legal Disclaimer: This comment is not intended to replace medical advice from a licensed physician, nor to diagnose or treat any condition. I would do what I did when I was diagnosed w/ CFIDS (Chronic Fatigue Immune Dysfunction Syndrome) in 1992 and told that it is \u201cincurable\u201d and that I would \u201cnever work again\u201d: investigate CAM (Complementary and Alternative Medicine) including herbal and holistic therapies. Prior to my diagnosis I was a true believer in mainstream medicine, having studied pharmacology for many years, and scoffed at \u201cnatural remedies,\u201d calling them \u201cquackery\u201d and \u201csnake oil.\u201d My reasoning was, \u201cIf these things actually worked, all the doctors would be prescribing them!\u201d I was very reluctant to try anything \u201calternative,\u201d but since mainstream medicine could not offer me any treatment other than to throw more and more antibiotics at the recurrent opportunistic infections (which ultimately made things worse), I figured I had nothing to lose. I studied with an herbalist and eventually found natural remedies that did, in fact, work for me, while continuing my lifelong practice of yoga and meditation, which I am sure also helped. Ironically, because my SSDI was denied when I moved to FL from CA and I had to find a way to support myself, I ended up working as a Medical Language Specialist because this was a job I could do from home. I recently retired from 22 years working in various departments of mainstream medicine, specializing in oncology. The irony is that before I began working in the field, I totally believed that mainstream treatments were \u201cevidence based,\u201d whereas CAM was completely bogus and a scam. But as my career progressed, I learned that medicine is often market-driven. I also learned that most doctors in mainstream medical school are not educated about alternative, nutritional or holistic therapies. When my disease went largely into remission as a result of CAM, my doctors were astonished. They thought it was a miracle. I would not say I am 100% \u201ccured,\u201d as I still have good days and bad days, but I am working full-time as a Spiritual Advisor (by phone), teaching yoga and Pilates on the side, and in better shape than most \u201chealthy\u201d people my age. I am not recommending that you ignore your doctor\u2019s advice. However, if he or she tells you \u201cthere is no cure\u201d and cannot offer you any useful treatments, as in my own case, you have nothing to lose by investigating alternatives with the help of a naturopath and/or herbalist.

            "answer_text": "I was diagnosed with Herpes Simplex Virus II back in 2011. It cannot be cured, but it can be managed. I take a daily antiviral to suppress outbreaks. I have had very few in the time I\u2019ve been diagnosed. But that is because I have been fortunate enough to be able to afford my medication, without insurance, a 30 day supply would be close to $200. (If you have herpes and do not have insurance, I highly recommend searching for a pharmacy group plan which can bring the cost down to under $50.) So other than the money I spend on medication, this diagnosis does not affect my day to day. Except that herpes carries a terrible stigma with it. I did not sleep around, nor was I particularly careless with my partners. Figures vary as to how many people do have either HSV I or II, but the majority of people that have it do not know. It cannot be confirmed through testing unless you\u2019ve had your primary outbreak. Men are less likely to express symptoms, but can still transmit herpes. I live every day with the worry that I pass this on to my partner. This is on top of the fact that I passed it on to my son. I gave birth to a baby in March of 2011. I knew I was giving him up for adoption. The family was there and took him home after he spent some time in the NICU. When my doctors planned to discharge me, I started spiking fevers. They had no idea why. They thought it could be septic pelvic thrombophlebitis, so they reopened my caesarean incision and stuffed it full of gauze. They gave me rounds and rounds of antibiotics, all while my fever persisted. Everything hurt and I was miserable. I\u2019d wait patiently for my IV rounds to finish so I could be taped up and take a shower. They collapsed so many of my veins during my two weeks there that they threatened me with a central line. Finally, they came up with the diagnosis. This was likely my first outbreak. It hurt to pee, it hurt to move, but the condition started to improve as I was finally taking in the right medication. I had attempted a vaginal delivery, but he became stuck. If only I\u2019d known about the diagnosis, I could insisted on the c-section from the start. My story is not nearly as heart wrenching as the other answers to this question that I\u2019ve read. But I would like to end it by imploring everyone reading to stop the stigma associated with herpes. It is not just a disease that you get from being a \u201cslut\u201d or a \u201cwhore.\u201d It is not a joke and you shouldn\u2019t treat it like one. Please remove herpes from your repertoire of funny phrases, as you\u2019ve removed \u201cretarded\u201d and \u201cgay.\u201d There\u2019s a good chance that someone you know has herpes and they\u2019d like very much for you to help them feel like it\u2019s a normal thing. Have a little compassion. ",

            "answer_text": "I have a horrible disease that doctors can't cure. It\u2019s called Myalgic Encephalomyelitis. I have a profoundly severe form that has left me paralyzed for 9 months (and then for shorter periods), mute for longer, unable to read/use computer/listen to music for 6 years or to have any one move me, touch me or talk to me. I could not even get a wash or have bedsheets changed a lot of the time because it was too much. I\u2019ve been totally locked in where my brain cannot make sense of the outside world and I just lay there, also unable to think, but in the most excruciating pain. I've lost all quality of life for 90% of the past 20 years. At it\u2019s worst, this disease holds you in a state near death just to keep you \u201calive\u201d, without the luxury of death. When you can\u2019t experience the world around you and are confined to bed for 14+ years, it\u2019s very difficult to keep going, so we peeps have a LOT of suicides. And, when I say bed bound, I mean too weak for a wheelchair, or to use the toilet or sometimes even to eat/drink or do any activity of daily living. Breathing is exercise and typing is a huge feat. If I press a computer key too hard, my hand, arm, the bilateral arm and eventually my whole body and brain can shut down. Indefinitely. There\u2019s no recovery from the smallest exertion in ME. For most of the day, my brain is not working; watching a movie is not taking it easy, it\u2019s a huge activity that I can rarely do. Mostly, I must lie here doing absolutely nothing except meditation if I'm up to it. There is no having a family, no reading books; there are no trips, there has been no going outside for 14 years. Visitors are usually too much. There is using the hour a day of bed-bound functioning to organize care, fight the system and write this answer because I think it\u2019s important. I do not know what I will do; I do not know how I manage daily. It was ok when I was classified a 5/10 (I couldn\u2019t work, but I could experience my life), but this 0.5\u20131/10 is very challenging. Society is also not ready to accommodate patients with severe ME: most choose to die at home when a simple IV could save their lives, but they cannot tolerate the sensory input related to hospital visits, so they don\u2019t go. I take it in time chunks. Right now, I work on making it through to spring, when I will re-evaluate. I want to live, but not like this. Assisted suicide doesn\u2019t feel right, but maybe because society has conditioned me to think that, and because we are biologically geared towards survival, even with no quality of life. Nothing is off the table for me, so I go on exploring all options for a QoL while also considering what I would do if that day doesn\u2019t come. I\u2019m young and I've lived in nursing homes \u2014 pure torture for folks with ME \u2014 so that would not be an option again. Yes, I\u2019ve learned a lot from my illness, but there comes a point where it starts to go backward and eats at your soul if too profound + too severe. I watch documentaries about assisted suicide, and those folks all do it because they don't want to go through what I\u2019ve been through. But, I\u2019d like to say, it\u2019s ok for weeks or months. Know that. Don\u2019t be afraid of losing control of your body or functionality, or of having people care for you when sensory issues are absent. You shift realities into a new one where all that is ok \u2026 It\u2019s the years on end of no respite or death that get to me. There\u2019s a Sufi saying: \u201cDo not become bitter at the amount of pain that has been entrusted to you\u201d. I work on this a lot. ",

            "answer_text": "I'm a nurse. I would sign the paper that allows my Dr. to not do anything to extend my death should I not be able to speak for myself and while I still can I will checkmark the box that no one can reverse my decisions should I not be able to speak for myself. Keep giving me large amounts of concentrated pain medication along with anti-anxiety medications and atropine drops in my mouth to dry any secretions until I die. Do not give me any food or fluids. While dying, not being given fluids allows the brain to secrete chemicals that kills pain. No one dies or is made uncomfortable by not being given fluids while they are dying and also by not giving me fluids that a failing heart cannot circulate, my lungs will not fill with fluids. Give me good mouth care. I would checkmark that I want medication to alleviate any pain even if it would shorten my life. I would get the durable medical power of attorney paper notorized and then I would give this document to my physician and also whoever I decide to make my durable medical power of attorney and I would die after making sure it is understand no-one calls an ambulance as I am dying because an ambulance has to keep a person alive when they are called. Call a coroner once it is clear I am not breathing and when my body is decreasing in temperature so that all of that is documented and no one is afraid to follow my wishes for fear of a lawsuit. No CPR, no oxygen unless I have \u201cair hunger\u201d and if my body is medicated properly I should not have air hunger. No antibiotics, no anything. My body will know how to die and other than large amounts of pain medication and anti-anxiety meds and atropine to dry oral secretions plus the green swabs used to give me good oral care to make me comfortable even if I am in the sleep that leads to death. I do not want lemon swabs used to clean my mouth. Lemon swabs can cause dry mouth and make a dying person uncomfortable. Good oral care will help keep the \u201cdeath rattle\u201d from occurring so my loved ones won't have to hear that and loved ones won't have to deal with seeing mucus and smelling bad breath if I am given good mouth care. I won't need anything else. A lot of the care a dying person is given is for the dying person's loved ones. No one really knows if the body feels pain while dying so treat my body as if my body is in pain even while I am actively dying and look unconscious. Care for my loved ones, give them a tray with coffee and tea as well as some wrapped cookies and crackers. Encourage my loved ones to hold my hand while I am dying, tell my loved ones that everyone dies and I am still me, that I don't want my loved ones to be afraid of me while I am dying. Tell my family it is ok to leave me and take time off to go to a restaurant and that sometimes a person will wait until no-one is there to die. Please don't whisper in my ear to go to the light. Hearing is the last sense to go and no one really knows what that light is, so tell me it's ok to let go, and to go with Jesus. I want placed on ice hidden by a drape and the ice will be underneath a cheap coffin or whatever is suitable and I only want viewed by my loved ones. No flowers, no carnations no anything. No hospice who is paid a huge amount of money and the less money they use for your care the more money they get to keep. Place me in a green bag and then bury my body. No formaldehyde. I know my body will be viewable for 48 hours but the law in my state as I have been told but don't know to be true is my body must be buried within 24 hours. Hopefully someone in my family will be intelligent enough to follow my wishes that I can appoint my medical power of attorney. They won't have guilt because it will be clearly written they cannot change my wishes. Tell my loved ones guilt is a natural reaction to the death of a loved one but make sure they know I know they loved me and I love them and there is no reason for guilt. I don't want anyone to feel guilty. The body after rigor mortis sets in will reverse and then my body will once again become soft and not scary to children and loved ones. Bury me and plant a tree over where my body is buried. Say some prayers so that my loved ones know I am a saved Christian. Encourage my loved ones to make the decision to make Jesus their savior. I would like some of the ashes of my oldest son sprinkled over the environmentally friendly green bag that my body has been placed in. Put a gravestone with a Protestant cross over the head of my body on the ground above my body facing where once I am resurrected I will see my savior Jesus Christ and include my maiden name on the gravestone so any genealogical researchers can find me. If anyone is curious as to the differences between a Protestant and a Catholic Cross, a Protestant cross does not have Jesus on it because Jesus left the cross after he was sacrificed for our sins, he was the only suitable sacrifice for our sins as he never sinned himself. A Catholic cross has Jesus on it as he was when he was being crucified, there are Catholic Christians who feel they must share in the sacrifice that Jesus made for us by suffering themselves and it's only been recently that Catholic Christians have been encouraged to take pain medication when they die and I worked in a Catholic nursing home for a time, I would tell Catholic Christians that Jesus does not want them to suffer, that Jesus already paid for our sins. Whether Catholic or Protestant, Christians are the only religion that has a living Savior. I would like the words \u201cLoving Mother\u201d on my gravestone along with my entire name because being a loving mother was the most important goal of my life and to be a mother was something I always wanted, even as a child.

            "answer_text": "While this is probably not the answer you were looking for, we all have a horrible incurable disease that doctors can not cure. Its called life. You are talking about a way of going out, where the person has a good idea of what lies ahead and a time table of when it will happen. Whether we know death is at hand or whether it sneaks up on us, we will all be just as dead. Is it more terrifying to be told you have six months to live after being diagnosed with cancer, or to realise you have six minutes to live as you choke with no one there to give you the Heimlich maneuver. Most of us will have some period of time knowing that death is probably near. Some have years, some have seconds, and I dont know which I would prefer. Having the time to make things right with the people in your life is something that I think we all would like. But having to see them look at you affraid of the future they have without you there. Of course if you're a general pain in the ads that might not apply, but most of us have someone who will care. The reverse is true as well. Knowing you have a limited amount of time left and looking at your kids or grandkids and knowing you wont be there for them has to be hard. My Mom has been told she has dementia so she is dealing with it every day and knows what the future holds for her, but seems intent on remaining engaged as long as possible. I think those who will be left behind often struggle with the diagnosis as much as the victim, but unless I've seen both sides Ill never know for sure. The only certain thing about life is that it will end, and whether you know when and how it will end, or if it takes you in your sleep, just try to leave things just a little better for someone for having known you while you were here.

            "answer_text": "This comes from another perspective to the more physical diseases described here, but I do have a common \u201chorrible,\u201d neuropsychiatric disease called bipolar disorder that is heavily stigmatized by almost everyone. In many people\u2019s eyes, it is far better to be \u201cphysically ill\u201d than severely mentally ill and be associated on level with drug addicts and criminals. It is perceived as a moral failure of character by some to many. I can't truly compare the pain of this mental illness to untreatable physical diseases like described above. Bipolar is treatable, but often treatment resistant for many people. You spend a lifetime trying to find the right medications and if some regimen ends up working, there is a very high chance it will stop and you will relapse. There is a significant percentage of people who commit suicide with this illness. Some have thought the stat as high as 1 in 5 people with bipolar will kill themselves. To add to that morbidity, people with bipolar have higher chances of getting into accidents (car or otherwise) because they often take miscalculated risks while manic. They often abuse drugs as well and engage in risky sexual behaviors due to poor judgment that can lead to negative outcomes like HIV and Hepatitis C. We die on average ten years earlier than the general population. We tend to be smokers and find it too hard to quit. Cardiovascular disease is very common and often the cause of death if we don't succumb to the other dangers we are expose ourselves to because of our impairments. We are of course more likely to be homeless and unemployed. Close to 70% of us are on disability. Bipolar Mania can usually be controlled with mood stabilizing medication. Bipolar Depression often cannot be beaten with medication and most with bipolar spend a lifetime with some level of depression. What I've noticed with these responses regarding physical illnesses is that they rob a sufferer of his or her ability to feel pleasure and that is exactly what is at the heart of bipolar depression. We\u2019re walking, talking, and often looking normal most of the time, but inside we never find things make us feel good or even benign. It\u2019s very difficult to go through life and feel this almost total absence of pleasure in response to life stimuli that typical people feel. It\u2019s not just that we don't feel generally happy, but we don't find anything enjoyable or worthwhile. It\u2019s like a wall separates us from experiencing existence in a normal way. We often have thoughts telling us we want to die almost every second of the day. It\u2019s just this grinding lack of pleasure and suicidal feelings that wear us down to the bone just as someone with physical illness is worn down by their symptoms to the bone. It\u2019s difficult. We hope there will be a cure as for these incurable physical diseases. But I just wanted to give a different perspective than the physical illnesses here. ",

For 17 years, after a strange 6 month illness that could be described as a \u2018medical cascade\u2019, I suffered a series of strange, delibitating symptoms that often changed in character. M.E. and fibro were suggested but apparently my symptoms didn\u2019t \u2018quite\u2019 fit. Finally, by pure accident, I saw a physician who happened to specialise in long term undiagnosed symptoms; there was no \u2018it\u2019s just stress,dear\u2019 stuff, in 5 min she was testing my joints. She said I had EDS and it is most likely Mast Cell activation that caused the worst of my symptoms (these can attack almost any organ.)She has me on some simple enough meds that have improved my life greatly as far as the fatigue goes in particular; bowel issues have had a slight improvement as have optical migraines. I can only work a few days a week even so, I have to \u2018pace\u2019 myself. Otherwise, I will be bedridden and in pain. What do I do? Well, the tough get going, eh? Although I can\u2019t do a full time job I work online to top up money. I write fiction and am beginning to have some success. I still travel with my partner, even if I can\u2019t climb hills and need to be very careful walking in muddy/uneven fields (one ankle has a habit of completely collapsing.) It could be worse. When I first had the \u2018medical cascade\u2019 they thought I might have a brain tumour. ",

            "answer_text": "As a Respiratory Care Practitioner I have spent 36 years being very close to many people who were terminally ill. I also helped my mother and sister through their end of life hospice experiences. I'm sure there is a psychology explanation like the seven stages of death. There are the Yahoo feel good stories of people who were terminally ill doing bucket list things. There are people who will do anything to prolong their lives. Then there are the people who accept it is going to happen and decide the 3% chance the chemo will work is not worth it. My persopersonal belief is that I am going to heaven. It is a good place and if there is no heaven I would just be done which would be ok too. After finding out the diagndiagnosis I would spend time investigating what was killing me researching on the internet. I would talk to someone to make sure my wife wouldn't lose the house or our life savings. I would divorce her or do whatever to protect her. If I felt well enough I would go to New York City and Chicago to spend time going to all the art museums. I would finally spend whatever Netflix costs and watch as many shows as possible. I would call all the people I care about and tell them what's going on. I would tell them this is ok and how much I appreciate them. Don't tell my wife but I would call my old girlfriend and tell her I still care about her and love her but I love my wife a little bit more. Then I would tell my ex wife that when I see God He will a firm she was the problem and a botch. Lol. I have been around so many people who have been so dignified through this. I had a patient who through an unbelievably crazy string of events was dying. I had come to get very close to him and care. He was dying and I came into see him. I told him how sorry I was that this was happening to him. He took my hand and consoled me by saying, \u201cDon't be sad Bob. You have been great and I appreciate all your help and keeping us all laughing.\u201d I'm very funny. It blew my mind that at this moment he would console me\u2026wow. I want to die kindly like that. Give me all the morphine also. ",

            "answer_text": "I have stage IV breast cancer and yes, in spite of all the pink fluff and overmediatisation it is a horrible disease. In spite of all the \"awareness\" talks and the happy \"I beat cancer\" survivor stories there are 113 people dying of metastatic breast cancer every day in the US. There is no cure and the average life expectancy after diagnosis is less than three years. Physically, it's hard. Here's a list of my recorded \"health issues\" from the past two years: Health Issue Compression fracture of thoracic vertebra Curved spine Serum calcium elevated Back pain Bone lesion Gram-positive cocci bacteremia Lung field abnormal Nausea and vomiting Breast cancer Broken hip Breast cancer metastasized to bone Iron deficiency anemia Hormone receptor positive malignant neoplasm of breast Uncontrolled pain Anemia in disease involving tumors Decreased white blood cell count Low blood potassium Inflammation of the stomach lining Ulcer Inflammation of the esophagus Severe protein-calorie malnutrition Chemotherapy induced thrombocytopenia Constipation due to pain medication Nauseous Pain Low white cell count from chemotherapy Nausea and vomiting Diarrhea Low white cell count from chemotherapy Urinary tract infection Abnormal chest x-ray Bilateral pleural effusion Low white cell count from chemotherapy Bleeding of the stomach and intestines Patient on antineoplastic chemotherapy regimen Abnormal finding on imaging Abdominal pain, right upper quadrant Secondary cancer of bone Disorder of gallbladder So yes, physically it's kind of horrible, especially when you live in the knowledge than it will only get worse. That it\u2019s nothing compared to what is coming. That's not the horrible part. What's horrible to me is that I'm only 35 and I have a four year old daughter. That she will grow without a mother is the worst feeling. What did I do when I received my diagnosis? I screamed her name over and over. What have I done since? Just kept on living. I'm disabled now and can only do some limited online work. I save what I can, for my daughter and the incoming medical fees. What I didn't do is run to \"alternative\" cures, they have no scientic relevance and my life is too short to listen to that. What you must go through is a phase of mourning. The career you had just started. The future plans. The second child. Another thing I try not to do is compare myself, otherwise jealousy would be everywhere. The young mom who doesn't go to bed every night worrying about who will care for her child. The old people who got to live so long. All the non-dying. I\u2019m not jealous and I still consider myself privileged in many ways. I \"got to\" live to my thirties. I \"got to\" have a child. I live in a rich country with all the material comfort that entails. I do appreciate what I used to take for granted and wasn't able to do for the six months I was hospitalized: right now I can eat. I can walk. I can stand outside and breathe the fresh air. All three things I thought I may have lost for good. It's easy to take them for granted again, but then I know that sooner than later I will lose it all for good. My current treatment is working and I can start to daydream. I'll see my daughter go to school. She'll remember me. She'll take after me. We'll travel. I can relax a bit and even buy new clothes. I read again. Right after my diagnosis when I was at the bottom I didn't want to \"learn\" anything new. What's the point of a more knowledgeable brain when all of it will just vanish. You think of all those things and at the same time you don't. You waste time online. Sometimes you leave a comment online and you feel like you've left a small trace. In the end you\u2019re just trying to come to terms with the fact that the world will go on without you and that it\u2019s okay. ",

I would make a final to do list of things i really want to do or read before the transition. Since i had an NDE in the past, I remember wishing I could spend more quality time with my loved ones. So I would squeeze in a special celebration with all my loved ones. Everyone could gather around and chat about memories and so on. Their are doctors making new discoveries everyday so thay helps.

About_Dr_Conley Page Some supplements that might help include sodzyme, Glutathione and NADH. Mullein and Stinging Nettle is good for the nerves too. Mushrooms infused in an alcohol tincture may help (like Maitake, Chaga, Shiitake). Doss Ginseng help at all??/Perhaps they can be added to your daily tea or coffee brew. Have you tried any form of autologous stem cell therapy?? If there is any way to raise funds or be part of a stem cell study that may help. The adipose stem cell studies sound the most promising. I want to get stem cell therapy on my fiance who has a bucketful of health issues. The stroke didn't help. You are a very brave and strong person. I hope to see your health improve. We never really know exactly when it\u2019s our time to transition to that supereality. This world is like a short vacation. ",

            "answer_text": "At thirty five I found out that I have a birth defect. I was told I can give you the good news or the bad news first. I said what is the bad news. The doctor told me \u201cYou have medullary sponge kidney disease and you will have it for the rest of your life.\u201d I said what\u2019s the good news? He said \u201cThe stones may be small enough for you to be able to pass them.\u201d I started to cry. Kidney stones can be very painful. I had my first one on my 16th birthday. At first they thought I had a ruptured appendix because I was curled up in a ball in excruciating pain unable to do anything, but cry out for my mother, while I was vomiting. My next few years were spent with extreme back pain. Then in my early thirties I was having infections and fevers I could not shake. Then one day as I was walking while at work, then it was like someone hit me with a sledgehammer right in my crotch. I almost dropped to my knees. The pain was very intense. I could not urinate normally for the next 9 months. My urine looked like coca cola, and I was only able to get a bit out. I was very sick with infections and fevers. I thought I was going to die, and I might have if I had not thought that I was having sinus infections and the doctor keep giving me antibiotics. Finally I went to see a doctor that I told about my urine being like coke. I told him maybe it is a kidney stone as I had one back when I was 16. He sent me for a test of my kidney then I had to wait two weeks before he told me I didn\u2019t have a kidney stone, I had nephro calcium. I was stunned. I said you just told me that I didn\u2019t have a kidney stone, I have nephro calcium. Nephro means Kidney, and calcium is bone/ stone, Kidney stone. Don\u2019t you look up what you tell people? I was stunned. It still took months after finding out I had the kidney stone for anything to happen and I was suffering. I still couldn\u2019t go. Then one day finally I felt urine coming out and heard something hit the toilet bowl. I looked and there were three stones sitting in the bowl. They were very big, about the size of a large pea. Fast forward many years later and the doctors have done many surgeries on me to the point that I can\u2019t tell you the exact number I have had, or how many I will have before I die. I will be making stones in my kidneys even as I age which scares me. The pain can be some of the worst you can go through. I can die from kidney failure, or my kidneys could become so damaged from the surgeries that I die. I can die from infection in my kidney or bladder. Maybe stones could block the blood flow to my kidneys. I could die just from the surgery. But I will die in pain one way or another. I can not do much about it. So I live with it. In 2014 I had 16 surgeries on my kidneys alone, which one time the stone blocked the blood flow to the kidney and they had to go in and pull out pieces so I wouldn\u2019t lose that kidney. Then I was in excruciating pain as my body rejected the stent they put in, not remembering I can\u2019t have stents. I almost died, and I lost 15 pounds in less than a week because I couldn\u2019t hold down even water. But I can look healthy and have some good days. But the stones come in rounds about every other year I have to get my kidneys cleaned out through surgeries. I know that I am not the only person to get stones. But most are not like mine. It is like jiffy pop corn, or as my old doctor said, \u201cThey are like the stars in the sky.\u201d I was asked while being readied for surgery, who was my favourite doctor, as everyone has worked on me. The doctor was standing in the back of the room getting ready to do this surgery. When I said, \u201cWell my favourite doctor is Doctor so and so,\u201d the room started to laugh as the doctor turned his head to look at me. Then someone said, \u201c Good answer! \u201d I am not a fool; it would have been anyone who was going to operate on me that day. Nice as they have been, no one can ever just do one surgery that would ever be able to cure me. That scares me. But it is not cancer. I am lucky. Some would think I am not lucky, I only have to keep an eye on how I am doing and make sure that the doctors don\u2019t make mistakes. Because odds are not in my favour. People who meet me tell me that I smile a lot and that I am happy. I know someone is looking over me, I know I have an angel. Maybe my disease isn\u2019t that horrible. ",

I can deny whats going on here because it goes away , the other type just continues to progress and those people get worse. Unlike MS or my MS if someone where to dx me with Lou Gehrigs I do not know what I would do as there is pretty much no other death that scares me more Unless it is horrible surgeon making me dead when I could have went to a hospic and that just makes me angry.

I will as time goes on lose control of every voluntary muscle in my body until my diaphragm fails. Then I die. Now, I could focus on how I\u2019m going to wind up in a wheelchair drooling on myself, eating from a tube in my stomach, a machine breathing for me as I type out things with my eyes because I no longer can speak. I will be totally dependent on others to do everything from scratching my nose to wiping my butt. All in all a truly depressing future. Whenever the subject of assisted dying comes up, people with ALS are always right out front. The temptation to curl up in a ball and wait to fall apart is there, but I have chosen a different path. Call it zen, mindfulness, grace, or any other name you want. I know I will die, I know how I will die, and it will be soon. But until I do I CHOOSE to live. I focus on today and what I can do. 3 years into a 3\u20135 year prognosis, I still walk, though not like before and not as long, but I have a wheelchair for any distances. I hand carved 75 spoons for favours for my daughter\u2019s wedding. And yes I am WALKING her down the aisle. I kind of learned from my father\u2019s illness and death that you have to be where you are. And look for grace. It is always there, sometimes you have to look a little harder to find it. Today is all any of us have. In the end all that matters is LOVE. ",

            "answer_text": "I have severe frontal lobe epilepsy that has not been able to be brought under control under many different medication regimens. My sleep schedule is messed up because the exhaustion my medication and multiple seizures a day cause, and the messed up sleep schedule sometimes causes more seizures. I can do very little outside of my place of residence because even small things exhaust me and environmental factors such as heat, flashing lights, and fluorescent lights add to the problem. I started having obvious symptoms about 3 years ago and my situation has become radically worse despite aggressive treatments (once I was actually able to see a doctor\u2026 stories for another time). I\u2019m just barely 22 and my memory and some cognitive skills are deteriorating. My personality has changed. Epilepsy is not generally something that can be cured, except occasionally in rare cases of radical brain surgery or certain childhood epilepsies that may go away on their own. I struggle with depression and isolation because of the ways my disability affects me. Ideally I would be able to live a mostly normal life, but that is starting to seem increasingly unlikely. My second best option is to be able to live (and hopefully also work) from home in a controlled environment and only go out when I was feeling up to it or to doctors. I have many online friends and can maintain those relationships better because I keep and often look over logs of what we\u2019ve talked about so it\u2019s not as obvious how forgetful I am and I feel more normal. You can\u2019t really do that well for in-person relationships. Edit: This answer originally said 2 years since start of noticable symptoms. It's actually been more than two years, more like 3ish. Bad math, sorry. ",

            "answer_text": "I have interstitial cystitis. It is a disease of the bladder and urethra. It causes urinary urgency, urinary frequency, and unbearable pelvic pain. Sitting down for more than a few minutes, wearing underwear, having sex, being outside in the cold, walking for too long, laying down in some positions, using the washroom, and many other actions cause unbearable burning pain. I cannot eat many foods - caffeine, alcohol, artificial sweeteners, acidic fruits and vegetables, wheat, carbonation, chocolate and caramel, spicy foods, and some others - or the pain will become so bad that for anywhere from a few hours to a couple days, I\u2019ll be incapable of sitting or standing. I have to urinate up to 20 times daily and when I have to go, it is immediate, if I wait for more than a few minutes I will have an accident. Other times, I cannot successfully urinate, and some patients need to self-catheterize when this happens. There is no cure for IC and very little treatment available. It also takes a long time to get diagnosed - doctors will often insist you have UTIs for many months (in my case, 2 years) before referring you to urology. Treatments involve stretching the bladder under general anesthesia once every 2 years or so (a very painful treatment to recover from and only provides relief after recovery for some patients), instillations of medication to the bladder through a catheter, strong antihistamines, painkillers, a device surgically implanted to the pelvic bone to provide vibrations as pain relief, or bladder removal. Symptoms can be eased with some over-the-counter medications, heat, TENS machines, rest, and sticking to the \u201cIC diet.\u201d I fill my good days with as many positive and effective activities as possible, and fill my bad days with as much positivity and self-care as possible. I give myself a break and remind myself there will be good days. I ask for and accept help when I need it. I take care of myself and my health. I think the most important thing to do is to remember to have fun. Even when it seems impossible, find a way to have fun. Today you might be able to go to Disney World on vacation and enjoy yourself, tomorrow you might need to have fun by watching a movie you like while laying on the couch with your heat pack, drugged up. Enjoy yourself as much as possible and stay positive however you can. ",

            "answer_text": "It is important to note that ALL diseases are horrible. Whilst their symptoms may exist on a continuum, all diseases are horrible. ALSO, there are MANY, MANY diseases that are never cured, they are only treated, and with varying degrees of relief or success. \u2018Cure\u2019 is not a word used very often in any medical research. It is a word that us laypeople tend to use, but doctors will tend to use the words \u2018treatment, remission, relief\u2019 etc. There are 7000 diseases for which there is no cure. Apparently these are termed rare diseases. Hmm\u2026not sure I personally buy it, after all, what are the criteria to determine what\u2019s rare? My husband and I both have hypothyroidism, both couldn\u2019t get diagnoses, nor treatment. Both of us had to find a private Integrative doctor who is a lifesaver. According to this list, three types of hypothyroidism are listed here: Congenital hypothyroidism (babies born with it), familial hypothyroidism (it runs in families), hypothyroidism due to iodide transport defect, hypothyroidism postaxial polydactyly mental retardation and Neonatal hypothyroidism. list of incurable diseases: https://globalgenes.org/rarelist/ familial hypothyroidism: Is hypothyroidism familial? What\u2019s very funny to me, is that most doctors don\u2019t seem to entertain the idea of hypothyroidism being familial, they tend to mostly rely entirely on the TSH test, regardless of symptoms or family history. As for hypothyroidism due to iodide transport defect, I wonder how many hypos have ever been tested for this? In the whole world, how many\u20263 people? 5 people? Maybe a whole 20? I doubt very much that my allopathic GP, who failed to help me, has ever heard of these types. The odd thing is that ALL forms of hypothyroidism are NOT curable. It\u2019s an endocrine disorder, it\u2019s badly diagnosed, badly treated and thus there are many many patients who cannot regain their proper lives. If anyone can find even ONE research paper that holds aloft the \u2018cure\u2019 for hypothyroidism, please show it to me. Like diabetes, it is a chronic illness and it causes many horrible symptoms. I don\u2019t understand HOW my husband and I have missed the presumed \u2018cure\u2019 for our disease? Our version isn\u2019t listed there, so I\u2019ll have to presume that they hope to indicate that it\u2019s been cured? I assume that the asker of this question thinks that incurable diseases are sort of dramatic and acute, like in a movie? Incurable diseases are both acute and chronic. They\u2019re all a burden to cope with. Some people may have mild or no symptoms but still have a disease, but that\u2019s nothing to do with the disease being curable or not. When you have a disease that you cannot get a diagnosis for, cannot find any useful literature about, cannot get treatment and cannot get your life back you tend to: read and read and read all you can in the hope that you\u2019ll hit upon some kind of amazing discovery, you join online groups and ask questions, you visit many doctors hoping to find a competent one, and you eventually learn an awful lot about your disease, your body, your diet, nutrients, possible treatments and which doctors may be of use. You become your very own sniffer dog, and you spend your time trying to detect the answers that you cannot find from your usual allopathic doctor. That\u2019s what happened in our case, anyway. :) ",

            "answer_text": "I suppose it depends on which disease it is, how debilitating, etc. I knew a guy who developed Reflex Sympathy Dystrophy Complex regional pain syndrome - Wikipedia. He was in horrible, gut ripping pain often. The doctors gave him every pain medication in every combination and dosage known to man. Some worked for a while then would lose potency, others had little effect. Eventually he became addicted to pain killers. Together, the pain of the disease and the addiction turned him into a zombie half the time. One day he got into an auto accident severely injuring a lady and her son. He went to prison for several years for that incident. His life was ruined by one ailment that started it all: Morton\u2019s Neuroma. I wouldn\u2019t want to go through what he did. I never want to become the zombie he was, become an addict and potentially injure other people. If there was no hope for a cure I just might take a shotgun and walk out into a field. That\u2019s why I support Right-to-Die and Death-with-Dignity laws. ",

Imagine how it feels to be a doc myself and accept that (which is why I have now switched to a research career working on my own condition by the way\u2026Its fun!). You know what, it gets a lot easier on your nerves to face the condition when you try to probe it in greater detail (be it academically or otherwise), understand the body\u2019s cues and learn to recognize your body\u2019s responses to the disease state. If we try and know our condition and adopt ways that keep it from flaring, it\u2019s just better for the overall quality of life. Adopting an objective outlook to something as frustrating as a disease that may be keeping you from enjoying life the conventional way will take time and effort. But speaking from personal experience, it's worth it! Please do join disease-specific support groups too. You just feel better when you know you are not alone. It does act as good psychological boost and helps to divert your mind from focusing negatively on yourself. ",

What I have is an intractable headache that arrived without warning a month after my twentieth birthday and, eighteen years later, still has not vacated the premises. Since that morning in September of 1999, I have been in pain that ranges from a major annoyance to so utterly crippling that simply dressing and feeding myself takes everything I have - and sometimes more - twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week, three hundred and sixty-five days a year. I've found a few things that ease the severity, but that's about it. Nothing makes it go away, although I can be distracted from it by a few different activities involving endorphins. What do I do? I go on with life as best I can. What else is there to do? I can't make it go away. So I can either live with it, or commit suicide. And I haven't gotten to the point where the pain overrules my pleasure in life as yet. That may change, at which point I'll have to reassess matters. Until then, I do what I can. ",

He is pretty much confined to the bed now except to stand assisted for a few moments to be placed in his wheelchair or recliner. He has a hard time communicating because it's hard for him to form his thoughts and then to communicate them. It's just awful to watch someone you love struggle like this. Sometimes he looks at me with clarity like he really wants to talk to me and other times he looks right through me. He's given specific instructions for his care and they are being followed to the letter, but we also take each day as it comes and know there's no promise of tomorrow.
