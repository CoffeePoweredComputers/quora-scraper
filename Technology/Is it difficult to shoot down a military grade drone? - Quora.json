            "answer_text": "Depends on the drone and where it is. Military drones tend to operate at high altitude and are designed as stealth aircraft.  This makes them hard to detect using air defense systems and requires missiles capable of locking onto and being guided onto a very small radar or infrared target. Since most countries aren't crowing about how they're bringing down drones left and right, I'd say its a fairly difficult problem. At lower altitudes and using drones that are more like hobbyist equipment not designed to evade detection and loiter for hours on end, the problem is well within the realm of a regular person with a rifle, standard air defense systems and low-tech systems.  You do read about the odd drone being shot down in the Middle East by various countries or groups.  Low enough and slow enough and someone with a shotgun can take down a small drone. Of course, there are drones that are designed to be shot down like military target drones.  Just big remote controlled planes with the equivalent of \"Shoot Me!\" signs plastered on them in terms of their detectability.  These are using for weapons and sensor practice.  And even then sometimes they live. The original target drone were unmanned full-size retired fighter aircraft.  Anything in the US Air Forces with a Q designation such as QF-106 indicates a drone.  These are used for full scale weapons testing for guided missiles.  Depending on the drone flight profile, the drone pilots will often be required to try and evade and sometimes the drones survive!  It is a badge of pride by these drone pilots to bring one back, paint a survival mark on it, repair it and send it back up to be shot at again!  Most drones usually didn't survive one mission but several survived multiple attempts to kill them.  With their operators taking pride in humiliating the pilots in failing to bring them down. There are brute force means of dealing with drones.  Broad spectrum radio frequency jamming is one option.  Signal spoofing is another.  The latter is how the US lost an RQ-170 drone to Iran.  Iran didn't so much shoot it down as fooled it into landing where it thought was home. Iran\u2013U.S. RQ-170 incident Suffice it to say, this incident probably caused a few engineers to get a stern talking to about communication security, navigation systems redundancy and cross-checking and the like.  Why a backup inertial guidance system was not on a drone that size to me was a colossally stupid design decision.  Inertial guidance cannot be jammed and if the GPS and inertial guidance disagree, have the inertial guidance system take over.  That way what happened with the RQ-170 would be impossible. Sometimes technical hubris blinds you to simplicity.  Simplicity in this case being dependent on a single source of signal information for critical navigation/flight systems with no backup and simply overpower it with a stronger signal that it was more willing to accept and being foolish enough to believe in your own technical superiority that no one would be able to overcome it.  Low tech but it worked.  Once. Or engage in broad spectrum jamming where you can either cause a drone to crash due to lost control data, jam its intelligence stream so it is effectively blind or simply force it into a \"safe\" mode where it goes into a automatic recovery and level flight mode absent control information until it runs out of fuel and crashes.  Don't need sophisticated hardware for that.  Mind you, you'll probably take out a lot of your own electronic infrastructure like cell phones but if you know it will kill the drones you suspect or know are around, it might be worth it.   For a lot of nations, this may be and likely will be their first approach and start an esclating battle of measure/countermeasure/counter-countermeasure strategies to gain the upper hand on either side.  The classic ECM/ECCM fight that has been going on for decades. ",

            "answer_text": "It is probably not likely to shoot down a drone that doesn't want to be shot down without sophisticated gun to missile systems. I remember, as  a Cadet, that on a trip to Ft. Bliss, the home of the Air Defense Artillery, a number of us were asked to shoot down a drone target with a machine gun. What I remember from the exercise, was that it was very difficult to get the range right and then lead it enough to account for the time of flight of the bullet. Needless to say we missed. What it did show us was the complexity needed in anti-aircraft systems and anti missile systems.  At one point on that visit a low level jet buzzed us. I don' t think that anyone could identify it as is was like a flash of sound and sight together. Forget about anyone shooting it down! ",
