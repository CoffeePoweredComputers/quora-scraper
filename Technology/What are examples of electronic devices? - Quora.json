            "answer_text": "An electronic device is a device made by utilizing and controlling the laws of electron motion in a vacuum, gas or solid. Divided into electric vacuum devices, gas tube devices and solid state electronics. In the analog circuit for rectification, amplification, modulation, oscillation, frequency conversion, phase lock, control, correlation, etc.; in the digital circuit for sampling, limiting, logic, storage, counting, delay and so on. Inflatable tube devices are mainly used for rectification, voltage regulation and display. Solid state electronic devices such as integrated circuits. here are some example: Resistors, capacitors, potentiometers, tubes, heat sinks, electromechanical components, connectors, semiconductor discrete devices, electroacoustic devices, laser devices, electronic display devices, optoelectronic devices, sensors, power supplies, switches, micro motors, electronic transformers, relays , printed circuit boards, integrated circuits, various types of circuits, piezoelectric, crystal, quartz, ceramic magnetic materials, substrate substrates for printed circuits, electronic functional process materials, electronic glue (belts) products, electronic chemical materials and parts, etc. . all these belong to eletronic devices.
