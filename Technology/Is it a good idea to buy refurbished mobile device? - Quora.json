            "answer_text": "Used Vs. Refurbished Phones While refurbished phones have often been used, the term \"used\" has a more specific meaning. A used phone is sold as is. It has not been tested or fixed, and it comes with no guarantee. A refurbished phone is different in that it has been tested, repaired if necessary, and it has been cleaned. A refurbished phone should function exactly like it did when it was new, and it should come with a warranty just like a new phone would. Sometimes cell phones are sold in a range of wear levels, with refurbished near the top of the scale and heavily worn phones sold as is at the bottom. These ranges are not standardized, so they vary from one seller to another. Phones are also sometimes sold as refurbished when they have not actually been competently tested. Just as with any other piece of equipment, the smart buyer must do some homework before laying down money. What Does Refurbishment Involve? The same companies that sell new cell phones often sell refurbished cell phones as well. These companies are often the best bet for buying a refurbished cell phone, since the name of a reputable business stands behind the phone. There are also independent companies that buy and refurbish used phones. Some of these are reputable; others are not. A properly refurbished cell phone should have been tested and cleaned, and any part that does not work has been repaired or replaced. Often it is the LCD screen that has cracked and been replaced, though repairs can include anything from replacing a scratched housing on innards that still work perfectly to taking a good-looking phone and replacing all of its innards. The phone may be given a new battery. The sticker that indicates water damage will not typically be replaced, and so a phone that has been damaged will still have a red sticker even though the damage itself was repaired. Deciding to Buy a Refurbished Cell Phone The decision to actually buy a refurbished cell phone has several parts, including the issue of whether buying any cell phone is really necessary. Other considerations include price, risk, and what kind of cell phone is actually wanted. Sometimes the right cell phone will be a refurbished phone; other times it will not be. Reasons to Buy a Refurbished Phone The most obvious reason to buy a refurbished phone is price. A refurbished phone is less expensive than a similar new phone, everything else being equal. Everything else is not always equal, and it is sometimes possible to find a deeply discounted new phone that is a better deal than a refurbished phone would be. Buying a refurbished phone is also a good way to stick with a favorite model a bit longer, even after the company has moved on to a new design. There are people who really like having the newest, flashiest gadget, but there are other people who really prefer to stick with what works for them. Finally, buying refurbished phones is one way to help reduce waste. Though many electronics companies now recycle their used products, reusing an item as many times as possible before recycling saves a lot of energy. Precautions Necessary With a Refurbished Phone The most serious risk with buying a refurbished phone is that it might not actually have been refurbished. Phones also sometimes come with histories, such as an unpaid balance from the previous owner. Finally, many people buy refurbished phones as an affordable way to replace a cell phone that has been lost or stolen. In such cases, the refurbished phone has to be added to an existing cell phone plan, and not all phones are compatible with all plans. Here is a list of ways to deal with these kinds of problems. Cell Phone Risk Way to Deal With the Risk Determining Whether the Phone Has Really Been Refurbished Buy from a reputable source, and insist on a warranty. Warranties for refurbished phones may be shorter or less inclusive than those for new phones, and what sort of warranty to accept is a bit of a judgment call, but if the company will not stand by the phone, it probably has not actually been tested. Determining If the Phone Has a History Call the provider's service line and give the refurbished phone's IMEI code, which is usually under the phone's battery. With this code, the provider should be able to look up the phone's history. If there is an outstanding balance, the provider can usually get it removed. Determining Whether the Phone Is Compatible If possible, buy a refurbished phone of the same model that the previous phone was, or look for an unlocked phone of a compatible type. Before buying, call the provider to make sure the plan will accept a new phone. Precautions That Are Not Necessary With a Refurbished Phone If a phone has really been refurbished, its quality will not be an issue because it will function like new again. Of course, refurbished phones can break. It is even possible that the cell phone model in question has a defect that will cause a replacement part to fail for the same reason that the original part failed. But new phones can break, too. There is no such thing as a piece of equipment that cannot ever fail, and this is why warranties exist. It is also not necessarily a deal-breaker for a phone to turn out to be used but not refurbished or not fully refurbished. A used phone might still be worth buying if the price is right, but in such a case it becomes much more important to examine the phone before purchasing. Make sure that the phone works properly, and be aware that it could cease working again at an inconvenient time. Of course, for such a phone to count as a good deal, its price must be lower than what a refurbished phone would typically be. Buying Refurbished Cell Phones on eBay Once you have decided to buy a cell phone, it is time to go shopping. Because eBay lists new, used, and refurbished cell phones together, it is easy to compare refurbished phones to the available new cell phone and get the phone that really is the best buy. Here are some tips on how to find refurbished cell phones on eBay. Finding Refurbished Cell Phones on eBay If you already know exactly what kind of phone you want, simply type it into the search box at the top of the eBay home page, or for a more focused search, use the Advanced Search feature. If you prefer to browse, narrow down the item listings using categories. The search begins at the Electronics portal. Select Cell Phones & Accessories, and then Cell Phones & Smartphones. Use the left-hand sidebar to narrow down the options from there, by brand, carrier, and other characteristics. One option is to narrow the field by condition; either click on Manufacturer Refurbished or Seller Refurbished to see only refurbished phones, or search the listings for phones of a certain brand and compare new, used, and refurbished phones together. Buying Refurbished Cell Phones With Confidence Always read the product listing carefully, because it is possible to misread the listing and accidentally buy the wrong phone. Do a little research on the seller. Find out what kind of feedback he or she gets from other buyers and whether he or she has a return policy. If there is a return policy, find out what its terms and conditions are and whether it includes a money-back guarantee. Conclusion Refurbished phones are not a completely sure bet, but no cell phone purchase is. They are nearly as reliable as new phones and often much more affordable. Warranties can give buyers much more peace of mind. With a little homework, it is possible to find a refurbished phone that will provide dependable service without the expense of a new phone and without the risk of a used phone.

            "answer_text": "Depends on the person I guess. If you buy a phone and keep it for years together, then you may as well go for a new one and budget it out. However, if you are a youngster living it out, wanting to flaunt the newest toy that you got, you may want to change your device twice an year. Now buying a state-of the tech smartphone could really drill a hole through your pocket. And you may not be up for it. In those situations, it is a good idea to consider buying refurbished. What makes this deal sweet is that a lot of branded-merchants ecommerce players have entered this arena. That means there is a basic guarantee of authenticity you get. Earlier, you had to rely on the street shop round the corner for your second hand buying needs. And most of the times, you are not sure if it was a stolen device. Infact, it happened with a friend of mine once. He went for a second hand device and was given his own mobile. Well, he dint stage a fight. But I digress. With these merchants like https://www.gozefo.com/bangalore/category/mobile and 2gud.com, you can breathe easy that your purchase is through a valid channel. They include in their listings, unboxed mobiles and second hand sets both. Unboxed sets are those which were factory seconds, surplus stocks, slow-moving product-line pieces which were never used by anyone. They just dint make it to the customer living room for a day. They are as good as new for all practical purposes. Then they also sell used products which they clearly mention on their sites. The used mobiles were generally some defective pieces which have been altered and corrected in the facility or otherwise good pieces which have been corrected and put for display in the listings. Both these sites maintain a good flow of these mobiles. But the refurbished category is something that gives you the ease of mind while saving a buck for you. They have a rigorous quality check process and all the listed products are certified by their QC department. Their customer-success team is always a click or a call away in case you want any clarifications. Also, they give you the \"cash on delivery\" option so that you breathe easy on your purchase call. Ultimately it is the kind of person making the purchase which matters the most. For some, it is about keeping a personal item which they carry for years together as I said. It may not be the best deal for them. However, if you are a trendy person, these listings are a boon for you. ",
