            "answer_text": "Overt and Covert come to mind. Overt surveillance is common in an industrial setting where production is monitored for quantity and quality as well as operations being monitored for safety, efficiency, etc. A cop sitting radar on the side of the road is generally overt with the intent to bring traffic closer to compliance and punish offenders. Covert would be more common for military, strategic, or criminal activity deterrence or crime solving. Low end might be a nanny cam. High end is probably above anything I can comprehend. ",
