But brain cells might want to kill themselves due to the enormous amount of inane content they would be subjected to\u2026  [Disclaimer: Only half joking.] I could elaborate the answer explaining it with neurobiological precision, but I don\u2019t think it is worth it. After all, I\u2019ve heard many parents telling their children similar phrases regarding \u201ctoo much TV\u201d, \u201ctoo much computer use\u201d, \u201ctoo much gaming\u201d, \u201ctoo much listening to music\u201d, etc. And in each case (except when it is \u201ctoo much alcohol\u201d or \u201ctoo much drugs\u201d, and a few other cases) I would use this exact same answer. For the exact same reason. ",

            "answer_text": "You may damage it. One way to do it is by using your phone at night. The blue light emitted from your phone can be confused with the rays of the sun, since it mimics its brightness. And because of that, our brain gets confused and stops producing melatonin, which is our sleeping hormone. This can cause disruption in sleep cycles and cause you to be sleep deprived. You can read more here: Does sleep deprivation cause brain damage? But if you\u2019re referring to the radiation. Then no. The radiation is very very small and it\u2019s extremely unlikely to do any type of harm to any brain cell. If you were careful with the use of your phone in relation to time, you\u2019re good to go.
