            "answer_text": "At http://aigents.com/ we are creating personal agents of global computational intelligence. The every agent is not just a toy or electronic assistant with  hard-coded set of \"narrow AI\" functions. It is a dutiful and clever friend, self-developing its skills while  interacting with human master. First what our agents learn is autonomous exploration and watching of  web pages and sites, timely extracting information required by their  masters and immediate delivery of the news, based on the masters'  preferences and feedback. Also, agents belonging to different users are getting ability to  communicate one with each other relying on social connections of their  masters, creating communities based on their interests and growing their  knowledge assets incrementally. Further, agents are getting ability to manage computational devices that  they populate autonomously, following explicit commands that they learn  and implicit intents of the users that they guess, following users'  voices and gestures.  Finally, agents acquire capability to control the surrounding \u201cinternet of things\u201d getting ability to learn about new things and their properties and capabilities autonomously without explicit or implicit commands from human master or help from other agents. In the world that we are approaching, each human will manage its  environment with help of such self-learning friend and servant, capable  to deliver information of the world and functions of surrounding things  serving the human - each user, communities and entire humanity.

            "answer_text": "I am one of those (independent) researchers working toward AGI. I have investing pretty much all my time since the last 10 years toward pushing further a working theoretical model on how AGI should be built. It is so exciting to discover new grounds and get to forge and foresee what the future will be like! And for somebody like me who likes a good challenge, well I\u2019m served! ",
