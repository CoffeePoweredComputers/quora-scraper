            "answer_text": "If it is automatic, you don\u2019t do anything at all. That\u2019s the definition of automatic. Keep in mind that the \u201ccharger\u201d you use for a phone or a laptop is not actually a charger at all. Phones, Tablets and Laptops have built in chargers. The external device sometimes called a charger is really just a fixed voltage DC power supply. The built in charger in the device will stop charging the battery when the battery is full. It will stop charging even if the external \u201ccharger\u201d is still connected and powered. If you are referring to a rechargeable battery of some other type, you should get a charger that is specifically designed for the type of battery you are charging. Any decently designed charger will have a way to determine the battery is full and stop charging. Really cheap lead acid battery chargers are an exception. Many of them are simple constant current chargers, and will keep right on forcing current into the battery (car battery, or motorcycle battery or small AGM for UPS etc.) no matter how full the battery is. It\u2019s not worth the trouble and expense to try and rig up some automatic cut off for such a charger. Better (and cheaper) to simply get a better charger. ",

            "answer_text": "If you're taking about your phone, it already does this. All iPhones and android phones stop charging once they're full. This isn't something you need to manage. They will \"trickle charge\" to top themselves off when the battery goes down a bit. There's not really any way to stop this except physically unplugging the device, and no real need to. ",
