            "answer_text": "Administrative Reforms Commissions (ARC) are committees formed by the Government of India to review the public administration system of the country. The first ARC was initiated in 1966, presented by the Congress Party. Formed to make sure that the highest standards of efficiency and integrity were maintained in the public services of India and make them responsive and responsible to the citizens of India, these commissions have been the conduit between the nation and the people. You can understand by the very nature of the Commissions that it is important to study them for the UPSC exam. There are some of them that have been found to be more important for the CSE than others. They are : 3rd ARC report on \u2018Crisis Management\u2019 GS- 2. For GS2, the 3rd ARC report focusing on Crisis Management, is important to study. It addresses what constitutes \u2018Crisis\u2019 and when it qualifies as \u2018disaster\u2019. It talks of the reasons for possible crises and disasters, how to manage the situations and the various organisations responsible for managing them. 4th ARC report on \u2018Ethics in Governance\u2019, important for GS-2 and 4. The report addresses the Ethical framework for Legislators, Ministers, Regulators, Judiciary, Civil Servants, Ethics in Public Life among others. 8th ARC report on \u2018Combating Terrorism\u2019 is important for GS-3. The 8th report concentrates on \u2018Combating Terrorism\u2019 by the Public Agencies and the Government. 9th ARC report on \u2018Social Capital\u2019, is the report on the development of the \u2018Social Capital\u2019 of the country. It addresses the development of various Regulatory Councils (eg: Medical, Bar Councils), Associations (Eg : Resident Welfare Associations), Organisations (eg : Voluntary organisations and Self-help groups), alignment of the Corporate Sector\u2019s business with the Social Values in the society (leading to the Corporate Social Responsibility initiatives) etc. The 11th ARC report on \u2018Promoting e-Governance\u2019 focuses on the aspect of alignment of Government functioning with Information & Communication technology for better efficiency and management. It tries to analyse the successes and failures of various such initiatives. You will find that these reports are most important for the CSE. Do ensure that you study them well. There is no need to go into the entire reports though. You can study from detailed summaries. As an administrator you shall be expected to know about all the reports. You should study all the reports. Maybe, give a bit more emphasis on these ones. You should be good to go. ",
