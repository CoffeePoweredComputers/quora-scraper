            "answer_text": "Step 1: Use different devices or computers, if inconsistant results shown then something is wrong with the device. Step 2: Reboot your wifi and modem. Step 3: If you can, update the firmware in the wifi and/or modem, not a lot of people do this and may not realize that their firmware in these devices is buggy and needed updating. Step 4: Take various speed tests at different intervals of the day over the span of several days. record these results including the latency. Measure these tests through a direct wired connection to your modem be that a laptop or a desktop computer. Wifi is really unreliable in these situations. If there is a huge speed increase then its something on your end not theirs. If the speed is drastically different from time to time, then it\u2019s your neighbors streaming netflix or something the like (Most likely you and your neighbors share a pipeline that is smaller than what everyone can fit in so now you are fighting for bandwidth) Step 5: hmm, so there is something really fishy going on, Call your ISP, If its mentioned that they are recording then you should also record the converstation as well. Tell them exactly the speeds you are getting. Work with them to establish a solution that Will not cost an additional feeWill get the speeds you are paying for (around 16\u201318 for you due to TCP overhead)If this fails then call back another day to be directed to a different guy who probably will know better. Ask them to talk to engineering to see whats going on. Also, keep recording speed tests every once in a while to make sure that nothing magical happened, it will be useful later. If something did magically happen then yay! It\u2019s fixed! Repeat steps 4 and 5 if it drops down to 1mbps again! Step 6: No dice? Most people don\u2019t go this far but here is a link to see what your options are for filing a complaint with the FCC: Internet Complaints Step 7: the ISP or FCC will respond. ISP at this point is forced to respond to your complaint wether they like it or not. The FCC otherwise may contact you to get further information, that\u2019s where the invoices and speed tests are handy. You will begin talking to people to establish a solution. Your bill will at least be decreased dramatically if they can\u2019t give you a good solution and/or a huge refund may be in place. This may not happen for several weeks unfortunately. Step 8: If the ISP is really being a real nut job (saying no, your speeds are fine at 1mbps), time to go find a Lawyer. He/She will take it from here. ",

            "answer_text": "It is unusual for residential Internet service agreements to include service-level guarantees covering anything more than best-effort bandwidth, latency, and packet delivery. Certain US residential ISPs do issue \u201cbroadband label disclosures\u201d as mandated by the former FCC commissioner. If you were a business subscriber to a dedicated Internet service, there might be service-level guarantees with credit dispensation for outages and failure to meet certain performance metrics. In any case, you as the subscriber should be familiar with the service terms and conditions that you agreed to when signing up for service. It should also be apparent to consumers that the last-mile ISP cannot guarantee that a remote Web server or CDN cache hosting Facebook, Netflix, and other content has adequate capacity in IOPS and database utilization to deliver downstream traffic at the full bandwidth you pay your last-mile ISP for, or to guarantee that intermediate network peers\u2019 core routes aren\u2019t congested. https://www.charter.com/content/dam/spectrum/residential/en/pdfs/policies/broadband_label_disclosure_existing_chtr_final.pdf ",
