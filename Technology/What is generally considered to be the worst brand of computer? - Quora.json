            "answer_text": "All of the major brands are terrible, but they\u2019re all terrible in different ways. Dell machines are designed to be maintainable, and durable. They succeed on these notes. However, Dell is not known for consistency in components, and uses lower quality parts. There is A LOT of manufacturing mistakes. Stuff breaks more often, but you can fix it easily.HP/Compaq: These are the Renault of computers. There\u2019s basically two categories: High end stuff \u201clike servers\u201d which is built well and reliable; and the unmaintainable, poorly designed, poorly built, poorly sourced trash that the average consumer gets.Apple: Basically the opposite of Dell. Everything is made with high quality components and reliable manufacturing. However, they are less maintainable than the Voyager space probes. They are so poorly designed, they break like CorelleWare.Toshiba: these are average. The design is about half way between Apple and Dell, they are about halfway between the two in terms of maintainability, and their component quality and build quality is neither great nor awful.Samsung: These have designs that are approximately as bad as Apple\u2019s. The component quality and manufacture quality is about that of Toshiba. They are about as maintainable as HP/Compaq.Lenovo: It\u2019s basically Chinese Dell.Acer: Basically a Taiwanese Toshiba.Sony: the designs are about as bad as HP/Compaq, the components and maintainability are Toshiba-level quality. The consistency is around that of Apple.Asus is an odd one. As a component supplier, they\u2019re fabulous. In terms of computers, they\u2019re not as good. The maintainability is not as good as Toshiba, but not as bad as Apple. Component quality is between Toshiba and Apple. Not durable, but more durable than Apple. OK but not fabulous manufacturing quality. Basically, Asus\u2019s assembled computers lie between Toshiba and Apple on most factors.",

            "answer_text": "I have 2 candidates for worst. Among \"serious\" computers, meaning the ones aimed at people who thought they were technology savvy, the worst, based on frequency of repair and warranty, was the Gateway of the 1990's (Gateway 2000). At that time, I was a partner in a technology company which sold PC-based networks and office automation systems. Our ticket was punched all the way around; Microsoft certified, HP authorized, IBM partner, etc., etc. Most of our sales were to commercial and government accounts; a minor slice was direct to consumer. However, we were among the 3 local outfits that could actually do repair work, so we saw a LOT of systems we did NOT sell come to the repair desk.  Out of every 100 systems that came in, roughly 40% were out of warranty Gateway machines. But we got some idea of machines under warranty going back to Gateway because the friendly UPS guy used our rear dock area to reorganize his load the way HE wanted it. Quite often, he would talk with us while doing this work, drinking our coffee and eating our donuts. Fine with us, we got some really priority treatment from the guy. That's when we would see the number of \"cow spotted\" boxes in his truck. (Gateway was started on a farm in the mid-west, thus had adopted a lot of \"cow\" imagery). One day I said to the driver, \"Hell, Bill, looks like people are buying a lot of Gateway Computers!\" But he replied, \"Don't think so, at least, not any more. These are going BACK to Gateway.\" Warmed my heart. And so, each day, we made a little ritual when Bill backed up to the dock. \"Show us your Gateway,\" we would say, and bill pulled up the door all the way so we could peer into the van. LOT's of 'em! We used this to our advantage on sales calls to unwitting business and government buyers who were sucked into Gateway's massive advertising. The problem with Gateway - and a LOT of PC's, back then- was the use of proprietary hardware and micro-code which was designed to eek out a bit more performance in one way or another. When that stuff failed, replacing it with \"industry standard\" parts didn't always work, so well. Thus we kept a few Gateways on the bench to use as test machines to see what might work with them.  Their \"Golden Warranty\" was a total rip-off, declaring, as it did, \"next day on-site service.\" It was such a blatant LIE that the FTC eventually stepped in, during the summer of 1998, and slapped G/W with a nearly $300,000 fine, noting, in part: \"consumers would be provided free \"on-site service\" upon request, when, in fact, the on-site service was not provided until Gateway diagnosed the problem over the telephone and determined that the consumer could not make the repair.\" You can see the whole ugly mess, here: Gateway 2000 to Pay $290,000 to Settle FTC Charges of False Advertising Claims  That brings us to Packard Bell, a PC company started by a couple of guys who bought the respected Packard Bell name, and used it to promote sales of a computer given the same name. (The original Packard Bell sold good radios in the early to mid 20th century). These machines were marketed with a \"fun and easy \" appeal to people who really didn't understand computers, very well. In the 1990's, that included a great many seniors who remembered how great the old Packard Bell radios were. Reasonably enough, they figured a company which made great radios \"back in the day\" probably also made great computers in the then current day. Otherwise, P/B not only used the mail order channel so popular then, but also placed their machines in Walmart and similar venues, so as to expose them to folks who really had no clue. It worked, as far as the marketing. But the machines? They were worse than Gateway. Those of you who were early adopters of PC's a few decades ago, and reasonably conversant with the technology, will remember what I will next say; those of you not so familiar, follow along. Most everyone knows that storage capacity of hard drives, processor power, and memory capacity were getting better, very quickly, during the 90's. In the 90's local PC shops (such as ours) would order computers by separately specifying a case and power supply, motherboard, video card, sound card, hard drive, processor, memory chips and \"controllers.\" When the parts arrived, we would assemble the machines, load the operating system, add desired software and install the finished product at the customer site. Practically everything was based on whatever standards had been established by Intel, or its competitor AMD. The \"microcode,\" being the BIOS (\"basic input output system\" was the core set of instructions burned into the machine, itself, and was practically always provided by Microdata. But with the reduction in physical size of system components, it became possible to eliminate an actual component (such as a video \"card\") and build the same or similar functionality into the motherboard, itself. Thus the cost of computers was reduced. And that's where the mischief starts. Packard Bell was a master at producing motherboard designs which gradually reduced parts that once were the size of a candy bar to the size of a match head. In theory, that stuff would work; but diagnosing the cause of problems was difficult, and repair was almost impossible! P/B had no control over production -everything was jobbed out to off-shore producers for a bid. Lowest bidder got the job. And board designs were changed so often that a given computer model might house any one of 4 or 5 different motherboards. It was like Forrest Gump's box of candy, \"you just never now what you're going to get.\" Indeed. It didn't take long for the sorry results of this production model to appear in terms of machines which just seemed to lose their minds. The trade press, to say nothing of the early Internet, was chock full of horror stories, including those appearing on a web site called, \"Packard Hell\" (which no longer is found on the 'net). Among the \"innovations\" introduced by P/B to meet the rising tide of unhappiness was making repairs with used parts salvaged from returned systems, and preventing access to the system BIOS. All of this finally came to a head with the 15 class action suits against P/B, and a serious 1 million dollar ruling by Los Angeles Superior Court in 1995:  Google News Archive Search  In our shop, we had been contracted by the local Walmart to handle the repair work which had produced a flood of returned systems. But we had to give up: the cost of an effective repair was often more than the purchase cost of the system. The most we could offer people was the last rites for their machine, and a disposal in exchange for a small fee, or else purchase of one of our systems. We sold a LOT of PC's, thanks to Packard Bell. As an interesting side-bar, to all this, consider that computer maker ACER currently owns what's left of Gateway and Packard Bell. This would make me cautious about purchase of Acer products, but hey! Take a spin and you might win. But I doubt it. EDIT: a number of commentors have mentioned that they had good experiences with brands I have taken to task. Even among the worst PC, MOST probably worked, or worked well enough. My criticism of the worst brand refers to the service and warranty issues which were so dreadful as to trigger a government intervention. The service failures were probably owed, in some part, to the great number of defective machines, but that's a calculus for which data is hard to come by. ",
