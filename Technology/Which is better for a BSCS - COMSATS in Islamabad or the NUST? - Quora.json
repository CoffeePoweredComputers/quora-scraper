            "answer_text": "Before I start, I'm a BSCS student at NUST, Islamabad\u2026 just finished my first semester. Everything I describe is my personal opinion and first impression of NUST. I'll be talking about NUST mostly. Pros NUST is known for being one the best universities in Pakistan in this field.NUST has also got international reputation for it's research contributions.For students: Competition is very fierce which makes student work hard and do their best.Better research opportunities.CDO and ILO help students find good jobs through their counselling and by letting students know about latest job vacancies and all\u2026Faculty from universities like Standford, Caltech.Extracurricular activities at NUST are remarkably good.If you're planning to go abroad for higher studies, the name \u201cNUST\u201d on your degree will make a BIG impact.CIE and TIC are among the most popular incubation centers. (I'm also part of a startup, administrations provides good support).NUST provides the best on-campus facilities and campus life.One of the most beautiful campuses in the country, provides pperfect atmosphere for studies.Societies and activitiesNUST is not about being theeta, I've had more fun than two years of college, in my first 5 months.Cons Although people at NUST are good at tech stuff, NUST doesn't produce much hard-core coders like FAST.Sometimes, the burden of assignments becomes unbearable.According to some seniors, a few faculty members (among the cream of faculty) have left NUST recently.Apart from the tech-geeks, the only thing In which CIIT is better than NUST is the HEC ranking. Don't forget that in the same ranking criteria, Iqra has surpassed LUMS (sach mein :p). Ending note NUST is a better choice. Still, don't depend much on the uni name. Gain enough skills to have the career you deserve. At the end, it's only about the effort you put in. Good luck! ",

            "answer_text": "Since being a comsian I would recommend and opine you, \u201cCOMSATS ISLAMABAD\u201d. Not because of being biased but because COMSATS Islamabad has surpassed even FAST in BSCS scoring no 1 position in Pakistan as per HEC ranking and has recently achieved the 350th position in QS ranking both in overall and in Electrical Engineering category. Secondly, the tough study schedule is something you would praise when you will be at the end of your BS. I won't repudiate the education level of NUST since as per QS ranking NUST is at 250th position both in overall and Electrical Engineering category, but in the field of computer science, COMSATS is at the top in Pakistan. After which there is FAST obviously. But again, the first and second rank varies between FAST and COMSATS ",
