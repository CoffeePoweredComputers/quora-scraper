            "answer_text": "For me, it\u2019s been a blast. Why Technology Consulting Rocks Consulting first appealed to me because of the consistency of change. Every few months I move on to a new project, which often requires new skills and always presents new challenges. Stack the ever-changing nature of IT on top of that, and life becomes a flurry of change and rapid growth. Because I\u2019ve worked with multiple clients during these last two years since graduation, I\u2019ve seen far more companies, technologies, and processes than most at this point in their career. I\u2019ve done full stack development, business analysis, UX design, and mobile development. I\u2019ve worked with Fortune 100 companies and small firms. I\u2019ve seen multiple company cultures. I\u2019ve interacted with dozens of different people and personality types, across all levels of a company. Being able to see all these different ways of doing business is unbelievably fun. Each new experience adds to my toolkit, and lets me grow into a better consultant. You also get to work with some really smart people. One of the best ways to grow is surround yourself with people who are smarter than you. My teams have been filled with some of the smartest people I\u2019ve ever met, with everyone having different strengths. This lets everybody grow, since you learn from one another as you work together. How Technology Consulting Can Suck If you don\u2019t like traveling, consulting probably isn\u2019t for you. I\u2019m lucky, because my company tries to keep you on clients in your home city, but even then you\u2019ll find yourself traveling occasionally. And even when you\u2019re at a client in your own city, it still could be an hour drive depending on where you live. With consulting you just can\u2019t move in across the street and walk to work each morning. You\u2019re also expected to be the expert. After all, your client is handing you globs of cash so that you\u2019ll help them solve their toughest problems. That means you have to bring your A-game every single day. I\u2019m not saying you can\u2019t make mistakes. Nobody\u2019s perfect, and you will inevitably do something wrong. The best companies will give you the tools to reduce mistakes and support to fix them when they do occur. But your mistakes will be under a magnifying glass because of the nature of the relationship between you and your client. There\u2019s also late hours. I\u2019ve been lucky and work for a company that tries to keep hours reasonable. For the most part, I work 40 to 43 hours a week. But sometimes you\u2019ll have a project deadline approaching that requires a few 60 or even 80 hour weeks. That\u2019s just part of the job, and it will happen at some point. Why Everything I\u2019ve Said Might Be Wrong A lot of what I said depends on the type of consulting firm you work for and its company culture. I\u2019m lucky enough to be in a place that puts the growth of their employees as priority number one, so my experience is different from that of a consultant in a firm who doesn\u2019t value its employees as much. This answer is also just the first few things things that came to mind. There are absolutely more pros and cons, and hopefully others who answer this question bring them up. As long as you can find the right company to work for, consulting can be extremely fulfilling. ",

            "answer_text": "The key thing to remember is that, as a customer facing technology consultant, culture trumps (errr, too soon?) technology. A huge piece of your job is to help. The only way you can effectively help is by understanding the culture that you're working in. In fact, the best consultants don't come off as a \u201cdoctor\u201d and fix a problem. The best consultants have enough credibility and organizational elasticity where they can create cultural changes that ensure the problem never reoccurs - in technology, this involves selecting the right technology that match the organization, having the right training systems to reflect the audience, and having the right message to management to ensure long-term sustainment is a priority. So if solving organizational problems, not just technical problems, is your thing, you may really like it. If you prefer technology, you're probably better off in an engineering type role behind a desk ",
