            "answer_text": "Redmi k 30 pro is a good device in China for its price. But poco f2 pro has not been launched till in China nor in any other global launch events. Hence when the poco f2 pro will finally be launched in India or china then we can talk about it.. Till many times poco has indicated that the f2 pro will be a beast and also a killer like its first phone the poco F1. Hence I m not so much hoping it to be a people's brand anymore. ",
