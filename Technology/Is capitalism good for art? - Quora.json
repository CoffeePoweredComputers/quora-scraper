            "answer_text": "IMO the value of capitalism with regard to art depends on a number of factors: Type of art: in a capitalistic society branches of art, like fashion photography, benefit greatly because of their ability to become quite profitable by working in conjunction with the fashion industry.  Other types of art that are similarly benefited by capitalism are graphic design & perhaps illustration-- types of art related to business.  Fine artists mostly benefit if they are able to find a niche that attracts investment or benefactors.Economy: in a poor economy art suffers and a lack of social resources can prevent artists from being able to produce. For buyers/sellers it is hard to justify buying art if your kids are hungry or you don't have a job-- it is a class of purchase that only becomes \"needed\" once all of one's more practical needs are satisfied.  There is always a wealthy group in a society but  individual art collectors tend to support a small number of artists (or artist) so artists generally benefit from having a larger potential pool of patrons.  Usually, government programs to support art/artists are defunded before programs to feed people or maintain/improve infrastructure.  Versus what?  Capitalism can be detrimental to art because the focus on money can encourage artists to create art that is commercially viable rather than taking risks that are more likely to advance the field.  Capitalism (at least in the US) tends to value quantity over quality and thinks about quality of life as something measure in dollars rather than other factors-- like art and culture-- which can decrease the ability of artists to make a living.",
