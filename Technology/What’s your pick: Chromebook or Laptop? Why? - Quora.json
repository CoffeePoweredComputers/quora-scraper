            "answer_text": "Decide what you want or need to do with the device. I personally have a Windows 10 desktop computer, so my laptops are secondary devices. I chose Chrome OS for simplicity and easy management and specifically my Chromebook X2 for the ability to use it as a laptop or a tablet. Surprisingly, I have found that I only need my desktop to play AAA games, and to print to my legacy printer (a Oki C3400 color laser printer about 10 years old with only Windows drivers available). That said, if I was to own only one computer and if it would have to be a laptop, then I would go with a Windows laptop (or an Apple if you swing that way). You generally can\u2019t play AAA games on laptops without a discrete graphics card, but you can find several with decent graphics performance now. The reason is simply for more universal compatibility with peripherals like the aforesaid printer. If I was new to the computing world, without other devices or peripherals, and I didn\u2019t play AAA games, and I did not need to do sophisticated video editing or sound recording, than I would probably go with one of this years high end Chromebooks, and peripherals that would work with it. Google has a list of printers, for example, that work with Chrome OS. The reasons: Chrome OS is much easier to manage and you get update about every 6 weeks.Chrome OS is fast- much faster than Windows on similarly powerful hardware.You get more bang for your buck with Chrome OS.You get 6 + years of guaranteed support. This is similar to Windows and Apple.You do not need to mess around with anti-virus utilities due to Chrome OS\u2019 security.",

            "answer_text": " Chromebook has risen up out of its specialty category and it's not, at this point only for children and understudies. OEMs are presently making Chromebooks with ground-breaking internals that would effectively equal against the best Laptop dependent on Windows and macOS. Further, Google as of late reported Linux support and brought numerous UI enhancements to make Chrome OS a work area class working framework. Remembering all the focuses, it appears Chromebook is at last prepared to confront the opposition. So in this article, we present to you a definite examination on the conflict between Chromebook v/s LAPTOP. From execution to battery life and UI, we have thought about both Chromebook and LAPTOP in an exhaustive way. So without losing a second, how about we discover who wins the clash of Chromebook v/s Laptop in 2020. Chromebook v/s Laptop: The Showdown Since Chromebook is the obscure amount in this correlation for most clients, we have attempted to clarify its highlights in more detail. Additionally, we are utilizing Windows as our principle correlation instrument, yet a large portion of these focuses stay substantial in any event, for other work area working frameworks. With that off the beaten path, how about we start our confrontation, will we? The Operating System The prime distinction among Chromebook and LAPTOP lies in their working framework. To set it on the right track, Chromebook runs Chrome OS \u2014 a lightweight, Linux-based operating system created by Google. What's more, LAPTOPs for the most part run Windows and macOS which are created by Microsoft and Apple individually. So how does Chrome OS admission against Windows and macOS in this skirmish of Chromebook v/s LAPTOP? As I stated, Chrome OS is a lightweight operating system and it's particular. As far as capacity size, it just occupies 4GB of space and the installation image is simply 1GB. Conversely, Windows and macOS take up more than 15GB of disk space and the installation image are route above 4GB. Also, Windows has in excess of 50 million lines of code though Chrome OS comprises of under 7 million lines of code.  Every one of these numbers show that Chrome OS has an exceptionally little impression on the equipment assets and that reflects in its presentation (more on this later). For the present, we can gather that Chromebooks have almost no asset overhead in contrast with laptop, for the most part as a result of its lightweight working framework. In any case, there is an explanation with respect to why Windows is so overwhelming and asset concentrated. On the off chance that you need to play designs overwhelming games, do 3D displaying or make enormous report extends then Windows remains as a dependable stage. I have talked about the capacities of both the working frameworks in detail ahead so read on and you will show signs of improvement thought regarding both the biological systems. Chromebook v/s Laptop: Hardware Need Since Chromebook doesn't run on a requesting working framework, it needn't bother with first class equipment. You can really run Chrome OS on any low-controlled chipset without stressing over the presentation. For instance, you can serenely utilize Chrome OS on Celeron or Pentium processors which, incidentally, are not considered as a part of the best chipsets, and can get genuinely tolerable execution. Aside from that, Chrome OS is perfect with both Intel and ARM processors out-of-the-crate. So in that manner, Chromebooks are less asset escalated and is likewise future-verification.  Coming to LAPTOPs that run Windows and macOS, you need a skilled processor to get the operating systemrunning. As the OS is requesting, you need in any event an Intel i3 to get a better than average execution out of the LAPTOP. This means more expense, however you can play out a large number of assignments that Chrome OS intrinsically needs (like video altering and gaming). Likewise, with an incredible processor close behind, you can run numerous work area class applications on Windows laptop with no concern. So to set it on the right track, for general undertakings like perusing the web and watching recordings, you needn't bother with an incredible processor, consequently a Chromebook would do the trick. Be that as it may, on laptop, you will require a competent chipset to begin, however on the positive side, you will likewise have more pull close by for asset substantial applications.
