            "answer_text": "See you can google & find what it is but let me give you my opinion what is it exactly. India has too huge population and proportion of youth is sizable. India as a country needs jobs, growth, development and Indians should really see what Germany saw during 1945 - 1985 period. Germany was flattened in world war 2. It was humiliated. I would say India in 1945 was in a lot better position as compared to Germany in 1945. Look what are we today and where is Germany? Why? Are we Indian not hard working? Are we not intelligent? Dont we have capability? Then what is stopping us? Aam admi starts blaming the government and the \u2018system\u2019. Fortunately our generation is having Shri Modiji as PM of India and this government and \u2018system\u2019 is making an honest attempt to its resident citizens, indians living abroad and foreign investors. This scheme is \u201c\u2026. forget the past, today we have conducive atmosphere, immense opportunity, speedy approvals, no red tape, cheap & hard working labour, availability of capital, start building your products in india and sell it in india as well as world over\u2026.\u201d When Chinese President gifts a mobile phone to his wife on her birthday i want to see I wish it should have \u201cMade in India\u201d tag on it!!! I would say then and only then this initiative is successful!!! By God\u2019s grace we have a PM who is determined to achieve that goal and we will achieve it. Jai Hind!!!! ",
