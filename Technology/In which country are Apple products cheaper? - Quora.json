            "answer_text": "None other than the US. The Apple website and its 269 nationwide stores sell my MacBook Pro for $1,999 excluding sales tax. You can avoid both state and local sales tax altogether in four states: Delaware, New Hampshire, Montana, and Oregon. However, as none of these states have major international airports, it\u2019s easier to pay the average sales tax rate of 8% in a place like California, Texas, or New York. But it not matters if you don\u2019t mind about buying refurbished items. You can go for Apple refurbished products and save a lot of your money. They are available in almost every country. Yes, they are the used products, but they are only launched after overcoming the flaws and repairing all the defaults. They equally work as new. And the good thing is you can get return policy, warranties and customer services, just like a new product you are buying if you are buying from an authentic seller. ",

            "answer_text": "Country is not the only indicator for guessing prices for various products. There are numerous factors which depict the prices of smart phones or any other electronics accessories. If you purchase an iPhone from a store, you might be paying more than you purchase the same product online. Similarly, if you are shopping an iPhone online, it again depends on various factors e.g discount codes, promotions or occasional offers or nature of the seller. A retail website would sell an iPhone at a higher price than a wholesale website. For example, if you visit Amazon, you can buy an iPhone 11 Pro (Amazon.com: Simple Mobile - Apple iPhone 11 Pro (64GB) - Midnight Green) for $999. If you go to eBay, you can purchase the same product for a lower price. If you struggle more and manage to find a wholesale seller, you might get your hands on even cheaper phone. For example, the price of the same iPhone 11 Pro on Onuir is around $600. Hence, it really depends upon your mode of purchase and the nature of the retailer or seller you buy from. ",
