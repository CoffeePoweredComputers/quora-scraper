Since the only requirement is for maximum speed, it will be necessary to wait a while for Jupiter, Saturn, and Uranus to get into favorable positions for gravity assists. The New Horizons probe that recently sent back pictures of Pluto took about 9 years to get there, with one gravity assist, from Jupiter. It would have taken about 12 years without Jupiter\u2019s help. If you wait for the most favorable planetary alignment, you could probably do it in 7 years, but you would have to wait about 130 years before you launch. The trajectory would be very similar to that of Voyager 2. ",
