            "answer_text": "It is advancing, though some of the changes are growing more subtle. Computer-assisted design is helping companies understand cabinet and driver interactions better than before.Designers have a greater variety of materials they can use for drivers and the cabinet.Accordingly designs have gotten much more varied. Consider the B&O wall speaker below (the shades-of-gray shapes). There was nothing like that when I was selling audio in the 80\u2019s.We\u2019re seeing more companies mix technologies, such as including ribbon tweeters in piston designs. At the sam time, electrostatic speakers have gotten better at sonically integrating subwoofers. (Note: mixing was not unheard of 30 years ago - I\u2019m noting that more companies are incorporating more variety.)Then there are some more dramatic changes the biggest of which are: Integrated DAC, DSP, and amplifier technologies. Frankly this is probably the biggest game changer because it allows speaker companies to completely tailor the signal to the each driver in the speaker. Some even come with built-in room correction software. This design approach isn\u2019t entirely new but an ever better array of products are coming from more companies and user adoption is higher.Wireless speakers. Once you put digital decoding and amplification into the speaker and with ever-improving wireless data transmission protocols, high quality wireless speakers are increasingly prevalent.Of course neither innovation would be that interesting to the vinyl enthusiast.

            "answer_text": "Tweeters are getting somewhat better, at least in term of price-performance, largely due to the wide availability of the Air Motion Transformer (AMT) technology \u2014 pioneered decades ago by ESS in the U.S. \u2014 at sensible prices from Chinese manufacturers. Woofers are getting better in terms of size-performance due to some fundamental research done in Europe which has essentially erased the advantages of traditional large-diameter, short-throw drivers over the small-diameter long-throw drivers that make extended, big-sounding bass from speaker systems in bookshelf-size enclosures possible. That said, the biggest advances are coming in the form of products that integrate top-notch drivers, multiple low-distortion/high-power amplifiers, and room-sensitive, DSP-based EQ into the speaker enclosure. This approach is currently limited to relatively high-priced offerings like the remarkable Kii Three system, but it\u2019s only a matter of time before its *huge* advantages will be available to those of us whose pockets aren\u2019t all that deep. Stay tuned \u2014 I for one can\u2019t wait! ",
