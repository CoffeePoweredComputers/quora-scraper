            "answer_text": "Well, it is incredibly unlikely. First off, the entire \u201cphone call\u201d portion of a smartphone is very walled off from the phone\u2019s main processor. This is to prevent people doing things with smartphones which disrupt the cellular network. It also eliminates exposure from some kind of potential exploit affecting the phone via a cellular call. So nothing is going to happen there. As far as using a SIP (or other application) on your phone instead of a cellular call, there is a potential exposure there. If someone found an exploit in a particular app and crafted a data stream to take advantage of this, I suppose something bad could happen. However, so far the worst that anyone has been able to do with cell phone exploits has been to crash the phone. As far as I know there has never been an exploit which resulted, even as part of a research project, in actual foreign machine code being given to a phone and have it executed. So the phone crashes? Big deal. So in order to \u201chack\u201d your phone via a phone call someone would need to find an exploit and write a lot of code to (a) send machine code to your phone and have it executed, (b) create a data stream for this that could pass through multiple intermediaries to reach your phone, and (c) figure out how to send this data stream to your phone. Aside from this, just being able to execute foreign code on your phone is meaningless - what any self-respecting hacker would need to do is gain privileged access on the phone, which means another sort of exploit that provides privilege escalation. Once you are on the phone, this isn\u2019t that hard to do as jailbreak and rooting apps show us. But all of this has to happen together. Not saying it is impossible, but it is very difficult and so far nobody has ever done it. So far, nobody has even come up with something you send to a current phone which crashes it. The last exploit like this was around 2012 I believe. So is there anything to worry about? If you are using regular cellular calling, no, nothing at all. Not even for the very paranoid. If you are using a different sort of Internet calling program, is there much to worry about? No. We are talking about a hurdle that is nearly impossible to overcome right now. ",

            "answer_text": "Strange that you asked me this question, in less than a week after a malicious malware attack was done to numerous mobile phones. However, as far as I am aware this has not happened on the cellular level, it could possibly be done but you would an excellent knowledge of how mobiles work. To be honest, it is not that difficult to develop a mobile phone these days, the parts are all available on places like Amazon or eBay. It is simple to develop an Android OS phone, using one of the latest mini-computers that is Linux based. The latest attack on WhatsApp can infect any mobile without you even answering the call. I wrote a post on this just a few days which explains more about it here:https://www.quora.com/Why-do-hackers-attack-WhatsApp-with-the-targeted-surveillance-attack-What-do-they-want-to-do-with-this-hack I would imagine cell phone hacking is pretty low at the moment because most hackers only know how to \u201creverse-engineer\u201d code, not electronics (hardware). However, I only know about electronic \u201creverse-engineering\u201d from decades of experience in the field, I started in the early \u201970s when I was only 9 or 10 years old. There are professional hackers that do know software and hardware hacking, which makes this more dangerous. These you\u2019ll find hacking cars, smart houses, refrigerators, right up to industrial level control of machines. I am not implying cellular phones cannot be hacked by just calling them, because nothing in the world is 100% safe, if it was we would not need security for our privacy, etc. So, as for your question, I would not state it was impossible. Never assume anything in this world today is secure, the more advanced techniques used in security just creates more security holes. One major company that falls into this category is Facebook, with 6 major breaches in the last 18 months! \u2026and \u201cno\u201d I do not have an account! ",

            "answer_text": "Highly unlikely. Extremely highly unlikely. But possible I guess. As you have a data stream going into your phone, being processed, then output out the speaker, there is a possibility (albeit an extremely small one) that somehow your phone has a vulnerability in that process. They could then send specially crafted packets designed to exploit this, and somehow get access to your phone. Please note, this is nigh on impossible and probably never has/never will happen. Phone calls arnt a particularly viable attack vector, usually attackers look for places where code is being run based on input. In a phone call, the data is streamed to the speaker regardless of the data's actual content, meaning it's never really read. This significantly limits the ways this could go wrong. So yes, it's POSSIBLE, but don't get scared. It's ridiculously unlikely. ",

To get a packet sent to the phone and runned and the phone to get the information to the hacker is not going to happen as that much data sent to through the phone will take more than 30 minutes or more to reach the phone.. and no sound will be heard if the data is hacking data.. becoz there will be no space for voice data to come to your phone.. as the 2G wave can't carry more data than a limited information.. so most of the cases of hacking through the voice call is fake\u2026 But I'm not sure about hacking through whatsapp calls(app to app).. not sure.. but that also low I think so..

Now don't go answering every spam call, because you aren't going to get hacked, but when you let your phone go to voice-mail, depending on the carrier, you can hit some buttons on the keypad and then type in the voicemail password and check whoever your callings voicemail. So by not answering you give whoevers calling access to the options to check your voicemail. ",
