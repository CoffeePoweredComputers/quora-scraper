Different classification schemes consider different aspects of software.  Operating systems.Device drivers.Middleware.Utility software.Shells and windowing systems.Operating systems.  An operating system (OS) is system software that manages computer hardware and software resources and provides common services for computer programs. Examples Mac OS X, Time Machine.Unix, The Shell Terminal.Ubuntu, Simplified Linux Setup.BeOS, 64-Bit Journaling File System.IRIX, SGI Dogfight.NeXTSTEP, Right-Click Context Menu.MS-DOS, BASIC.Windows 3.0, Alt-Tab Task Switching.Device Hardware hardware includes the physical, tangible parts or components of a computer, such as a cabinet, central processing unit, monitor, keyboard, computer data storage, graphics card, sound card, speakers and motherboard. By contrast, software is instructions that can be stored and run by hardware. Middleware software that acts as a bridge between an operating system or database and applications, especially on a network. Utility software software designed to help to analyze, configure, optimize or maintain a computer. It is used to support the computer infrastructure - in contrast to application software, which is aimed at directly performing tasks that benefit ordinary users. Shells and windowing systems The Windows shell is the graphical user interface for the MicrosoftWindows operating system. ... However, the Windows shell also implements ashell namespace that enables computer programs running on Windows to access the computer's resources via the hierarchy of shell objects. ",

            "answer_text": "Software is a collection of instructions for computers. This ranges from a simple test program designed to print out a few words to a large scale systems with complex structures and millions of lines of code. Some of the types are: Applications - software designed to be used by people. Perhaps the single largest category of software that includes countless subcategories including most business software.Apps - designed specifically for mobile devices.Office productivity - tools for developing knowledge materials such as a spreadsheet or text document.Automation - software for automating work such as business processes or manufacturing tasks.Robotics - software for autonomous machines. Although robots have a physical form, most of the work of developing a robot is software.Controls - systems that implement controls. E.g. safety controls on a high speed train such as automatic breaking when an earthquake is detected.Decision support - applications that support decision making processes such as strategic planning.Games - computer generated environments and activities designed to be entertaining and engaging.Ecommerce & Markets - software designed for commercial transactions such as a stock exchange or ecommerce website.Marketing - software designed for marketing such as a digital advertising platform.Artificial intelligence - software that learns and self improves.Databases - systems for managing and accessing data.Operating systems - systems for managing the resources of a computer and providing a user interface.Libraries & APIs - software that acts as a building block for other software.Drivers - software for operating a device such as a network card or sensor.",
