            "answer_text": "Technologies has empowered the internet and computers at an amazing rate. The word technology refers to the making, modification, usage, and knowledge of tools, machines, techniques, crafts, systems, and methods of organization, in order to solve a problem, improve a preexisting solution to a problem, achieve a goal, handle an applied input/output relation or perform a specific function. It can also refer to the collection of such tools, including machinery, modifications, arrangements and procedures. Technologies significantly affect human as well as other animal species' ability to control and adapt to their natural environments. The term can either be applied generally or to specific areas: examples include construction technology, medical technology, and information technology. The human species' use of technology began with the conversion of natural resources into simple tools. The prehistorical discovery of the ability to control fire increased the available sources of food and the invention of the wheel helped humans in travelling in and controlling their environment. Recent technological developments, including the printing press, the telephone, and the Internet, have lessened physical barriers to communication and allowed humans to interact freely on a global scale. However, not all technology has been used for peaceful purposes; the development of weapons of ever-increasing destructive power has progressed throughout history, from clubs to nuclear weapons. ",

            "answer_text": "Technology refers to the practical knowledge of applying the various instruments and natural ingredients of a species. Technology also determines how a species adapts to its natural environment and how it uses it. Technology in human society is a necessary consequence of science and engineering. However, many technological innovations have predicted a lot of knowledge in science and engineering. The definition of technology in the context of human society states, \"Technology is some of the practical techniques that people use to improve their environment.\" Knowledge of any instrument and natural material and the ability to use it efficiently is also called technology. We use technology to control the world we live in. Technology is the technique of using knowledge, instruments, and systems that we are using to make our lives easier.  ",
