            "answer_text": "Yes, but also no. To open, we would traditionally describe a civilization as a society that can pass information down to future generations with a method other than speech. We would technically discount even the Inca from this definition, because their complicated knot records are useless to someone who doesn't already know what the knots were referencing, and pictograms also require extreme interpretation without vocal explanations. But, we can set writing aside and just say civilization is just a complicated society. As you have pointed out, materials like wood don't survive eons, and leave less traces behind. Moreover, humans constantly recycle materials used in previous buildings. So it is entirely possible for ancient city and temple structures to have been built and consistantly recycled into newer structures over millenea to leave little if any trace of their existance. Early archeologists would have been unable to pin point the true date of construction due to the reuse of old materials. However, not only are current archeological techniques much more sophisticated, but we have even adapted space technologies to archeological purposes. We have used infrared cameras to scan through jungles and found the tell tale signs of human construction in the density of the Earth, even through soil and foliage. Archeologists are constantly pushing back the dates for the firsts in humanity. We have only recently discovered that sites like Stone Henge were large and ancient temple-like sites, though only some parts of the site were in use at any given time, the rest being burried by time, with the stones being by far the grandest and longest lasting elements. So, it is possible that we will find extraordinarily ancient societies in the long distant past, earlier than previous examples already found. It is entirely likely that such civilizations may have even been very advanced compared to later civilizations. We know from real history that there is often a rise and fall of technological advancement, with some technologies being lost to time. It is possible, but just not likely. We've been looking for a very long time, and our techniques are sophisticated enough that even biodegradable materials would not have escaped without leaving traces. ",

            "answer_text": "It\u2019s exceptionally unlikely. First, it\u2019s not clear how that could work. Such a society may not be possible. Second, even if the made biodegradable freighters and compostable skyscrapers and other \u201cvanishing\u201d technologies, there are still traces of activities and presence we\u2019d expect to find. Advances technology supports large populations, modifies existing species through domestication, moves all manner of species around the planet to new environments, and so on. Third, even if an advanced civilization figures out how not to leave any archaeological traces at all, what about preceding societies? Technologically sophisticated societies don\u2019t come out of nowhere; there\u2019s a long string of less sophisticated societies, which wouldn\u2019t have that understanding of ecology and technological response to it and would therefore be more likely to leave behind signs of their existence. Fourth, intelligent life and tool users don\u2019t come out of nowhere, so even if we were missing the sophisticated civilization and its less sophisticated predecessors, we\u2019d be missing the other species leading up to them. We\u2019d expect to see something approximately capable of tool use. So, then, even if it\u2019s possible for such a society to exist at all, which is questionable, there\u2019d be a huge penumbra of evolution and societal development leading up to it. We don\u2019t see that before the rise of humanity, so it seems astronomically improbable. ",
