            "answer_text": "\u2605\u2605 I believe the time has come for Tim Cook to offer a graceful resignation. Mind you, I think Mr. Cook is a stand up kind of guy. I have nothing against him personally, but is he the stand up guy for Apple? Short answer: No. Years ago, when Steve Jobs was ousted from Apple following a power struggle, he eventually went on to Pixar and turned it into gold. During that time, Apple was coasting at best. When Apple asked Jobs to come back, his return was applauded by all, Jobs turned the company into gold, just as he had done with Pixar. Then he got sick. At the time, Tim Cook took over the day to day activities at Apple. Since then, Apple is coasting again as they were before Jobs return. As a consumer, I love my Apple products, big fan, but lately, when I get a new device from them, I get this 'meh' feeling. Knowing me, that's no small thing to say! He has also made huge mistakes, the worst of it being to fire Scott Forstall, supposedly because he didn't want to apologize for Maps (read power struggle). Forstall or Cook didn't have to apologize for anything considering that Google had been in the Maps business for years and Apple was just sliding into it. I remember that when Google started building maps, it wasn't exactly an instant success! After that, Tim Cook decided that it was time to relax and soften things by quite a margin at Apple. Another huge mistake: Apple was extremely productive when its employees worked under pressure and tight security, courtesy of Steve Jobs. Steve Jobs, a genius with an iron fist, had high hopes for Scott Forstall. Surely he must have had a good reason and he did: Forstall could also rule with an iron fist and what's more, he shared Job's vision for Apple. Those are what Apple need the most right now, if they are to get 5, 6 years ahead of everyone else again and come up with the Next Big Thing. Other companies sure have caught up! The last 6 times Tim Cook spoke publicly, the stocks went down In fact, it has steadily gone down since his formal inception as CEO. When a CEO is more concern about what the analysts of the stock market have to say about his or her company instead of focusing on the consumer-base and the products, the battle becomes increasingly difficult, for any CEO. To paraphrase a journalist from a recent netcast, we wouldn't want Apple to go back to a Gil Emilio time. Anyone remembers that time? I do. Many journalists, analysts and others say that Tim Cook must have some time to adjust. I disagree. He had enough time. I like Tim Cook, but if there was a petition for his resignation, I would sign it for the good of Apple, as much as it pains me to say that. Anyways, Tim Cook won't last much longer at that pace in my opinion. If and when he goes, Apple won't have many options for a replacement, considering the complexity of that company. On the plus side, Intel is looking for a new CEO. Tim Cook isn't exactly a stranger to this sort of ecosystem. Somehow, I feel this would be a better place for him. It will be difficult for Intel to find a replacement as well. I would't be surprise that when Mr. Cook is gone, Apple might just swallow its pride and ask Forstall to come back! Mario Marceau ",

            "answer_text": "This answer isn\u2019t so much a commentary on Tim Cook as it is an observation of Apple\u2019s constraints and current opportunities. Apple has never innovated in technology. It has innovated in design. Since the first Mac, it hasn\u2019t been the first mover in tablets, or handheld music devices, or smart phones. But it\u2019s often captured the most value in a category by virtue of brilliant design. So this idea that Apple needs to invent the \u201cnext big thing\u201d is a bit of a fallacy. What Apple has done in the past is iterate the \u201cbest design implementation of the next big thing invented by someone else.\u201d Apple is a huge company. When you are a huge company, it is hard to achieve the same percentage growth that you did 10 years before, or 20 years before. The blunt truth is that Apple is a mature mega company harvesting cash. Tim Cook may be just the right guy for that task. And based upon its past history, if Apple has another big product splash in its future (an iCar?), that splash will likely be a design iteration of a technology developed by one or more third parties.
