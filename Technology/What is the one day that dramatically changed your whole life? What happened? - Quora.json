            "answer_text": "Three events happened that helped me get on the right road: First\u2014 it was 1978, I was 24 and had spent 3.5 years of pre-med, studying to be a doctor. While in the lab, my eye caught a little window, on a fire escape door. Through it, I could see a tree branch shimmering in the sun, dazzling. A voice said, \u201cIf you\u2019re not careful you could spend of your life in here, and not out there.\u201d Second\u2014 at that time philosopher, Joseph Campbell was on PBS talking about \u201cFollowing your bliss\u201d. https://www.brainpickings.org/20... I thought back to when I was deliriously happy. It did not matter what I was actually doing. I thought of the day my little brother, 8, and I sold hats to the visitors at Graceland. I was the one year after Elvis\u2019s death, August 16, 1978. My dad was a small business entrepreneur. He said, \u201cThere must be 50,000 fans down there, go sell them something, I\u2019ll watch on TV\u201d. I said OK you\u2019re on. Henry and I sat on the curb and watched the long line across the street. A brilliant woman was selling a single rose for $10. Suddenly, an ambulance arrived. Someone fainted from heat exhaustion. I grabbed Henry by the hand and we drove the Surplus City. We bought every wide-brimmed Mexican style hat for $.50. Stacked them on Henry\u2019s head and went in the crowd. You had to have a solid $5.00 bill. I held on to your wrist, took the money, put a hat in your hand and let go of your wrist-that how many people were on me for a hat. Now that was FUN! The third event happened while I was getting a Coke at the machine between graduate school classes. A man came up to me and asked me what I was going to do when I graduated. He and I had debated in class. He was an old guy (like I am now). He asked if I would like a job at Schering-Plough in Memphis (Maybelline, Coppertone, and Dr. Scholl\u2019s). Turned out he was Senior VP for Finance and Operations getting his PhD. He said it was for a Brand Manager. I had no idea what that was. I went to the library and looked it up (all paper then). It was a bolt of lightning. I could solve problems for millions of people across the nation. I could also work with chemists, lawyers, engineers, sales people, and artists. Together, we would build the solution. That was 40 years ago. https://www.linkedin.com/in/rdfa... None of this would have happened if I had not listened to that little voice in the lab. ",

            "answer_text": "November 20, 1997 Now as far as I know this date is only important to me, I haven\u2019t ever looked to see if anything significant happened as I was rather occupied that day, as I\u2019ll explain below: I had the day off work, it was Thursday and my employer was a ski/bike shop in a little town called Canmore. I was going ice climbing with my friend Brad that day. We planned to do a little climb in the Rockies, it was in a valley identified as French Creek. Not a large or advanced climb really but a chance to get in an early season climb. I\u2019ll condense some details, we drove to the trailhead (about 45 minutes down a gravel road that was snow covered), and hiked in to the climb carrying our gear on our backs. It took us about an hour and a half to hike. When we got to the area there was a group already on the climb we wanted to do so we decided to us a small unnamed waterfall as a warm up while the other group finished. After the climb we prepared to hike back down the rocky trail from the top, removed crampons and untied the rope (this fact is important, I\u2019m sure you can see where the story is going. Nobody would have left crampons and rope in place for this hike down, it just wouldn\u2019t have seemed necessary). Brad led the way and within my first couple steps, I stepped on a large rock that just didn\u2019t want to stay still. The rock slipped away and I fell backward and onto the top of the waterfall. A few seconds later I was lying at the bottom having tumbled over the edge and free fell about 60 feet. I don\u2019t remember the start of the fall but I vividly recall the tumble and free fall\u2026.and also the hard stop at the end. My memory goes in and out after that. Brad got to where I was lying and began to bandage what he could and wrapped me in my down coat. He had to leave me there to go get help. Cell phones weren\u2019t ubiquitous like today and wouldn\u2019t work where we were anyway. The other group had left by this point also. Brad hiked back out and had planned to drive back to Canmore to get help. Luckily for me a forestry warden was at the place we parked when Brad got there and was able to radio for a rescue right away. I laid there in pain, disoriented and going in and out of consciousness.Brad had removed my pack and set it about 20 feet away so it would be more visible, I was in a sheltered spot and not easily seen. In my mind I laid there for hours. The weather had started to darken and some snow began to fall, I thought it was getting into the evening already. I cried. It came to me that I was done. It seemed as though I was going to be stuck there and wouldn\u2019t survive to be found and rescued. Let me tell you that is an attitude adjustment if ever there was one. I accepted my death. I came to terms with it being over, I figured I\u2019d lay there until hypothermia took over and I fell asleep. Eventually freezing to death. Then I got hungry. I remembered having a snickers bar in my pack. So I crawled to my pack and got it out, I proceeded to attempt eating a frozen snickers bar. In the fall I had hit my forehead and split it open despite wearing a climbing helmet, so without the helmet I\u2019m sure I\u2019d have died on impact. I had torn my top lip mostly off and broken some teeth (dental repair done and my lip reattached by a plastic surgeon), more info on further injuries coming later in the story. Imagine trying to eat a frozen snickers with busted teeth and a torn lip. Blood was all over my face. Needless to say I wasn\u2019t exactly thinking sharply at the time. About an hour after Brad left I heard the sound of a helicopter. I got pretty excited. I pulled out my headlamp and got it ready, when the helicopter appeared I waved the light around to signal the pilot. He came in pretty close, about 50 yards away maybe, then turned and left. WTF?! How could he have missed me? Well that head injury stopped me from realizing he couldn\u2019t land where I was. A short time later I heard him returning this time with a line below equipped with a backboard and a medic seated in a sling hanging below the chopper. The pilot planted that medic right beside me and he got me loaded up and we got out of there. My first ride in a helicopter and I wasn\u2019t even IN the helicopter\u2026.i was dangling strapped to a spine board below it. In the end I had the above mentioned facial trauma, my right heel was crushed requiring a plate and 5 screws to repair it. My tailbone was broken, and my L1 vertebra was destroyed requiring spinal fusion above and below. The surgeon grafted some bone from my hip and there are 3 rods and 4 screws making an H shape in my spine now. Before the surgery on my spine I was told there was a very strong chance I\u2019d never walk again. 22 years later, I still have effects from that day physically, but in the time since I haven\u2019t let the injuries or associated pain stop me. I was ridIng my mountain bike 4 months after the fall, I had been in a wheelchair the first month and as soon as I could be mobile I was. I became a firefighter in 2007, I\u2019ve raced motorcycles, gone scuba diving many times, and other physical activities too numerous too list. The biggest change was in my head. I was a very serious person when I was young. Still am in many ways. By accepting my death that day I learned to only take the serious stuff seriously. Enjoying life is too important to waste time being upset over every little thing. \u201cDon\u2019t Sweat the Small Stuff\u201d as the book title goes (I haven\u2019t read the book BTW). So yeah\u2026that single day really changed my life, other days have had big impacts too (pun not intended), but that one was the biggest. ",
