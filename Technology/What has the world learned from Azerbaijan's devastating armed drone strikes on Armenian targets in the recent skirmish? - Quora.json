            "answer_text": "From the devastating armed drone Azeri strikes on Armenian civilian targets the world must\u2019ve learned that it\u2019s not wise to sell deadly weapons to authoritarian, warlike and liar regimes who try to wipe out a population they claim is theirs (but even that is a lie). From the military standpoint one may derive a lesson that drones are pretty useless in the hands of poorly trained and retarded operators, who can hit only immobile targets like hospitals, schools and residences, or a parked emergency service vehicle, or a non-moving military target at the best. It also leads to huge monetary losses in the form of shot down drones, that Azerbaijan lost at an \u201camazing\u201d quantity of about 200 in less than a month. Most of those shot down drones were so dumb (you understand though who actually was dumb) they couldn\u2019t maneuver to escape AA defenses, and some even just dropped on ground almost intact to fall into Armenian hands without anybody even shooting at them.

            "answer_text": "What the world is learning that with over $30 Billion invested in technology and arms Azerbaijan still has lost 10 times more soldiers than Armenia, and then with only some very modest gains. This war has just started, and Armenians, we are not the giving up type people, mot against the ottomans, not against Parthia, Mongols, Tartars, Arabs, Turks not against anyone. And its not a skirmish, but a full war started by Azerbaijan along the entire contact line, with an estimated force of 40,000 men. In one skirmish that lasted 2 days, the Armenians lost 45 soldiers, and the retreating Azerbaijanis lost over 300. And the reason being the Armenians had over 3 KM of clear sight of the valley below. The Azerbaijani forces used drones to take out a few Armenia positions, 8 drones were destroyed, but the devastation below from Armenian artillary was stunning, the militias then chased down whatever Azeri forces remained. It is estimated over 7000 Azerbaijani soldiers have died in the past 3 weeks, and almost 800 Armenian, that is the statistics when heavily defended positions in cliff tops and mountains are attacked from the bellow. The Soviet union in all of its might could not remove defending Afghans from their mountain tops, and that is exactly what is happening in our highlands of Artsakh ( Karabagh) ",
