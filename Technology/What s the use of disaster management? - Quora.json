            "answer_text": "Disaster management is the way to organize the response to a serious event for which the needs greatly exceed the resources available to a given community, town, city, county, state, or nation. It is designed to bring order to a chaotic situation so that those in need can receive what they need to survive, from responders who are capable of providing to local officials those resources that they can best provide. Bringing order first means, defining who is in charge and who gets to make the decisions about what to bring to the response. It means performing an assessment of lifeline capabilities in an affected area (lifeline includes food, water, shelter and health care), in order to know what kinds of personnel are needed. Since all disasters start out as local incidents, it is the locals that determine if they have enough resources to meet the needs of the people, with respect to things like Search and Rescue, Swiftwater rescue, medical care (both acute, for injuries or illnesses related to the event directly, or more commonly replacing the everyday health care in an area which is no longer able to provide services due to power outages, flooded pharmacies and hospitals, etc.). Please check out the internet to read about the 15 Emergency Support Functions in the US National Response Framework, to see the response categories of support that the United States can provide in response to a major disaster, as well as the Emergency Recovery Functions that provide additional resources after the acute phase of the response is over. These Emergency Support Functions actually define civilization\u2019s community activities in support of people everywhere. The management component is to get the most extreme efficiency in costly disaster responses, avoid duplication, assure correct disaster supplies and personnel get to an area as quickly as possible with the best gear.

            "answer_text": "Jake has answered well on the macro level. For an organization it is the plan that aims to manage the aftermath of a fire. or flood or any such event to a) Notify customers and suppliers of the situation and prognostication, and to keep them in the picture. This will minimize the loss of suppliers either finding new customers or reducing output, and customers finding new companies. b).Having in place plans to get trading again as quickly as possible. Different people will be responsible for knowing where suitable premises can be found, plant machinery materials and so on. c) We need to set up a management base as quickly as possible, ideally have one set up with the necessary technology and phone system ready to go. There needs to be someone in the team with the information to contact the employees. They will have been told beforehand to stay at home, except for key employees, but we have to know where they are when we need them. Finally there must be at least one person who has been trained in giving interviews and handling the media, and that person is the only one allowed to do so. If you can get the MD to be this person, so much the better as he is the one they will want to talk to. That is the basic plan. It will need to be scaled up or down, and you may need to tinker with it to suit the needs of your particular organization. ",
