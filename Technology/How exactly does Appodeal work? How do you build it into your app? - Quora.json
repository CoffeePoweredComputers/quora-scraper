            "answer_text": "Their product has changed since I left the company but I\u2019m sure the Appodeal team would be happy to answer this in detail. They\u2019re suppose to have 24/7 customer service on the website. I\u2019d copy and paste this question there and start a conversation. Read through their Terms and Conditions and make sure you understand how the technology works before integrating anything into your app. I would also make sure to get a good understanding of their business model and how you would make money on their platform. This goes for any 3rd party platform you intend to integrate into your app(s). Feel free to connect with me on Skype if you have questions: garethleeatwork ",

            "answer_text": "Appodeal is a mediation platform created in 2015 by publishers who wanted to monetize their apps in the most efficient way. That means finding a way to integrate different ad networks in a real time bidding, and find the highest earnings possible. What Appodeal\u2019s SDK does is basically this. The algorithm in their SDK finds the best paying ads for each impression. Building Appodeal into you app depends on several factors, like the platform you use to develop your game, the framework, or the size you want your app to be, just to name a few. Integration process is made to be as easy as possible and we do have a great 25/7 support team.
