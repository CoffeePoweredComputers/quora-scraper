            "answer_text": "Please be more specific. Are you looking for a specific type of data collection or usage? My guess is you are concerned about privacy and/or tracking. Most stores, these days, use CRM (Customer Relationship Management) software, which is software that helps companies run their businesses, while new versions also gather data at the back-end. In an analytics, data-warehouse style database, organizations can run statistical analysis against the historical data, gathered by the CRM, as a tool to better target and/or serve their customers.  There are other methods of gathering this data outside of a traditional CRM. Chances are that you are not blocking one of the several beacons that are coded into each webpage as you browse the internet. The beacons are an example of third-party tracking, in most cases, where companies gather data and sell it to those doing analysis.  If you stand back and think about where your data comes from, and where it is stored, you'd truly be amazed. All of the data that you see, in the digital world, is stored somewhere. A database is really no more than an application that is designed to efficiently store data for retrieval (as well as insert, update and deletion of it). Think of it as a library that is protected by user/application credentials. It is not to be feared, at least no more than your local library. ",
