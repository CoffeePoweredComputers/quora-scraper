            "answer_text": "I have worked in large companies and start-ups in the US, and have worked with many Chinese companies for over 25 years, but have never been part of one. I have worked closely for 6 months or longer with a couple of Chinese founders of US-based companies, one ion which is rapidly morphing into a Chinese company. With these perspectives and limitations, I believe that the answer to which is the better place to do a startup depends on the person\u2019s back ground, resources and goals. Background & resources: Linguistic and Cultural fluency are both important. If you are not a fluent speaker of Mandarin, most startup businesses in China would be very, very difficult to do. There are so many people in the larger cities who speak fluent English, and yet, Chinese is the preferred medium of conversation in most meetings that I have been part of. I suspect that the reverse is alos true \u2026 people who are unfamiliar with English may find doing a startup in America equally challenging. And its not just the language. Cultural norms about expressing dissent, agreement, what it is acceptable to ask for by what level and how, also vary dramatically across most geographies, very much including the USA and China. Resources can certainly facilitate any transitions and cushion rough spots. Goals: There are some kinds of companies that can only be developed in a certain geography. It is futile to think that a great AI company that specializes in recognizing mandarin characters should be based anywhere but China. It is equally naive to believe that Chinese companies have have the same independence that USA companies do. A Chinese equivalent of Facebook that did not shut down Russian troll sites would have been out of business in month 1. By the same token, Chinese technology companies have long enjoyed protected access to their domestic markets, encouragement to appropriate IP from western companies, and access to dramatically below market capital for a long time.

            "answer_text": "Depends on what kind of business. Some business thrive particularly in US and some thrive in China. But that many US companies are investing in China (FDI to China is still strong) shows that prospect of business in China is better. Also the population, the rising middle class all tells it is better to start business in China. For a start up you do not want to go under in a month, you want to succeed and make a profit as soon as possible. So usually it is China that wins here since there is the critical mass of consumers there in numerous Chinese cities, large and small. But of course, competition is always there and competitors could also drive you out too. Competition in China could be very severe. So you really have to consider very carefully. Answers given in Quora could only be general guidelines, guided by history and experiences or observations and may not apply to your start up company. ",
