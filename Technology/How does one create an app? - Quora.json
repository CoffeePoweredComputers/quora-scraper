            "answer_text": "The process of making apps goes through quite a few steps, I am not a professional though but I have quite a few experiences building apps and I see this process as a series of continuous efforts in building an awesome app. Know the requirement/needBefore we start on working over the project this is very important you realize the need of this app and how will it help solve the problems. 2. Design the Flow and layout Once you have your goal clear how will your app serve,now you should plan How your app will look and How will it behave in different situations,we call these flow of layouts in technical terms as Wireframes ,there are no of online wireframe making web apps and softwares that will help you to develop attractive and cool layouts,some of the useful tools are balsamiq,mockups,sketch etc 3. Develop the app this is One of the most crucial steps of developing the app where you will actually dtart working on your plan, building the app designs to choosing the right database and implementing the logics. 4.Test in different scenarios you need to build the app considering every type of user so that your app stands out in every situations,humans are unpredictable we never know how they will respond to your app, e.g you may have a email as a textfield and users may enter emails in some invalid formats,or they may enter characters in place of phone nos. 5. Deploy the app once you are dones testing the app its time to deploy it on the appstore or on the clients device the users may report some issues or provide some useful feedbacks. 6.Take the Feedback and improve if needed No matter How good you do, someone will definitely dislike it. No matter How bad you do someone will definitely like it. No matter How much you try, There's always a space for improvement,the feedbacks from customers and the reported errors are the tasks to always work on. I hope you enjoy building your app have a good time and I hope to see something great coming out of these series of efforts. : ) ",

            "answer_text": "Perhaps I can offer some insight, having just been through the process. While I am a software engineer by trade, I was working in very old technology since leaving university. I knew I wanted to leave and get into mobile app development, but I couldn't quite pull the trigger. Eventually I did, quitting my job, spending 8 months working sun up to sun down to write a substantially sized app, which will be released later this summer. But on to your question. The BEST thing you can do, is to come up with an idea for something you would LOVE to use/make. The other route is to do random tutorials. Let's briefly break down these 2 options. 1) When you choose a specific idea, especially one you are passionate about, your eyes are on the end goal the entire time. You have direction and motivation that will stick with you until you see your project come to life. 2) Do random tutorials. It's a directionless way of going about things, and I would put my life savings on the line to say going this route is far more likely to lead to forgetting about wanting to make apps and quitting. Like signing up for the gym January 2nd, and the last day you ever go to the gym that year is January 15th. At first, while still working for this company using old technology, I was doing #2 in my spare time. I would find some highly rated tutorials, or read some Apple docs, text books, anything. However, I was never able to stick with this for long. It wasn't interesting enough to sustain my attention for more than a few weeks. I was doing this off an on for awhile, learning, and giving up when I became disinterested.  Then, an idea came to me that I was REALLY passionate about. Something I really wanted to see made, not to make money, but because nothing like it existed, I really wanted it for myself, and I also felt others would too and there would be a great market for it. As soon as I had an idea, I began to think about the requirements my app would need to meet, and to wireframe it. Wireframing is basically mocking-up the design of your application, with paper and pencil, or many online tools that allow you to drag 'screens' out and place fake buttons, fields, images, etc. Now I had something TANGIBLE! My eyes were on the end prize. I didn't know any objective-c, I'd never used a mac, I didn't know how to write a backend server, how to host it, how to interface it, nothing. There were a TON of obstacles in my way. But they never dawned on me. I simply PUT MY HEAD DOWN and WORKED! One thing at a time.  New languages I'd never seen (objective-c, ruby [on rails]). New syntax. JSON, Web API's, Completion Blocks, Networking, Push Notifications, In-App Purchases, Core Data, Multi-Threading, User Authentication, Keychain, Animation, and the list goes on and on. I knew exactly what I wanted for an end product, and I learned one thing at a time, and pieced it all together. So to get started I would say... don't just go out and do random tutorials. You NEED DIRECTION. \"I want to make an app\" is not enough detailed direction. You'll just end up doing a couple of tutorials, and not knowing exactly what you want will kill your momentum and inertia. You need to be able to say \"I want to make XYZ app. It's going to do A, and have B, and it's going to be AWESOME!!\". Once you know EXACTLY what you want, you'll have a huge amount of inertia and momentum to carry your plan through to completion. No matter how daunting. So find something you passionately want to make. Then you just need to continually keep answering... \"What do I need to learn next to see the next part of my project through\". ",
