            "answer_text": "I'm not completely certain if this is what you're asking, but. . . Projection mapping is a way to define specific areas on which you wish to project a video.  By creating masks, you can map your video onto any shape that you require. Here's a pretty basic tutorial video:   A true, dedicated mapping software package will allow for multiple masks, layering, and timelines for more dynamic effects. ",

            "answer_text": "You can mask the image.  If you are projecting into a dark room a black mask will remove light from that area of the projection. If you wish to have the mask another color like white (or anything else), the image will be surrounded with that color. You can get creative with this.  You can define a shape using black, which will mask the projected borders.  Within that mask, you can add another border of a different color.  Combined, the black defines the shape of the projection and the other color creates a color within that shape creating a new, visible border. ",
