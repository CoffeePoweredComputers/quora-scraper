            "answer_text": "Bell didn\u2019t invent it, he stole it. Documented proof verified by The USA courts have confirmed that he coluded with The USA Patent Office to steal it from their safekeeping form the original inventor Meuci, an Italian inventor working in Cuba that traveled to The USA to register it and the designs for a patent, but didn\u2019t have the money to do so. He was told by the agent to leave it behind and it would be held in safekeeping for his return. Upon his return, it was reportedly \u201clost or destroyed\u201d. For decades Meuci publicly and through the courts fought to be vindicated and the cover-up and lies exposed, which Bell publicly denied, lying through his dishonest teeth with every dollar he made from this stolen invention. Antonio Meucci - Wikipedia Bell did not invent telephone, US rules The Telephone Cases - Wikipedia Who is credited with inventing the telephone? The tragic tale of the telephone's real inventor, Antonio Meucci Slowly, books and the education system around the world have been teaching the truth. At the time of invention there were several people working on such a device all over the world, but none had a working model other than Meuci, hence the grand theft and lies for over 1 century until the truth was revealed.

            "answer_text": "Several inventors had experimented with electrical telephones using a \u201cmake or break\u201d contact system which could transmit crude musical frequencies but not articulate speech. Elisha Gray filed a patent caveat for the same variable resistance transmitter concept on the same day as Bell. From that time there have been allegations of bribery in the patent office. These are discussed in Elisha Gray and Alexander Bell telephone controversy - Wikipedia. ",
