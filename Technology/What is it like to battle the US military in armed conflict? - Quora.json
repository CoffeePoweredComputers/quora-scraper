            "answer_text": "THE US MILITARY. Where do I even begin???? The military operates a troop presence of over 350,000 troops overseas. Also the US has a naval and airbase on every major continent except for Antarctica. It operates a total of 19 of the largest aircraft carriers/amphibious assault ships in the world. It has 24 airbases around the world and can strike any target any where at any time. The U.S. has 662 overseas bases in 38 foreign countries, which is a smaller number than the 900 bases it operates including the US. The total count of troops the US has is at a whooping 2.5 million troops which is accompanied by the largest military budget in the world coming in at $600 Billion dollars, it is the only country besides India that maintains a million man army without conscription occurring.  THE USAF The USAF is massive and when I say it's massive, it holds the top 3 spots in countries with the largest airforce, coming at 1: USAF with about 6,500 aircraft, 2: USN with about 5,000 aircraft, 3: US Army with about 3,800 aircraft. Then the USMC comes in with about 1,150 aircraft and it comes in at around 5th or 6th place depending on how many planes Japan has (could not find reliable source). Also, the USAF has 24 airbases around the world and they can launch an air strike any where and basically land anywhere. The USAF operates these 3 monsters as there main bombers\u2026  *from left to right* The B-2 Spirit stealth bomber: top speed of 630 mph, operational service ceiling of 50,000ft, and has a payload of 50,000 lbs. The Spirit has a very minimal radar profile and its aerodynamics give it a great range of around 6,900 miles. The plane itself is made largely of radar-absorbent materials which make it virtually impossible to detect. The B-52H bomber: top speed of 650 mph, has a service ceiling of 50,000ft, and can carry a big payload of 70,000lbs. The B-52 has a unique ejection system, the navigator and bombardier eject downwards instead of upwards. B-1 Lancer: top speed of 950 mph, that's right a bomber that goes faster than the speed of sound!! has a service ceiling of 70,000ft, and can carry a massive payload of over 160,000 lbs!! Yes the Russian Tuploev-160 can reach 1300 mph however the service ceiling is only 50,000ft and can carry only 90,000lbs of explosives. The USAF operates the most advanced fighter aircraft and helicopters in the world. Such as the F-16, F-15E, F-15E, F-35, F-18, and my personal favorite, the F-22 Raptor. It can easily pass 1500 mph and it is the only FULLY developed 5th generation fighter jet. It is mainly used as a air to air fighter but also has air to ground strike capabilities, however that is now the job of the F-35. Also the USAF and US military has a massive helicopter arsenal at around 1,000 helicopters. The dedicated attack helicopter has revolutionized armored warfare with its tank-killing capabilities, close-support qualities and battlefield survivability. Some helicopters include the V-22 Osprey, HH-60 Blackhawk and the AH-64 Apache.  THE USN OHH MAN, now we are getting into the big toys. The USN brings to the world 10 massive nuclear powered aircraft carriers, with more advanced and longer aircraft carriers on the way. The Nimitz class carriers are THE largest aircraft carriers in the world, coming in at almost 1,100ft long. The carriers can carry 90 aircraft and has an operation range that is unlimited however it is limited by food supply which is about a year or so. Which will feed 6,500 people!! The USN has the second largest airforce in the world. The Nimitz Class Carriers are the only nuclear powered aircraft carrier besides the French Navy's R91 Charles De Gaulle. The USN currently operates the F-18 as their main fighter but is now being phased out for the new F-35. The USN also operates numerous of different aircraft such as the kMH-60S Knighthawk, Harrier Jump Jet, and also the Bell AH-1 Cobra helicopter. Also the US operates 9 amphibious assault ships in which can carry helicopters, planes and Marine MEU\u2019s (you'll learn more about MEU\u2019s in the marines section). The USN has a policy that states that the Navy must maintain 11 active nuclear powered aircraft carriers. Which is crazy cause their are 40 active carriers in the world (which include Helicopter carriers and amphibious assault ships and so forth) out of the 40 active carriers the US owns 20 of them!!!  US CARRIER STRIKE GROUP Also the USN boasts about its large boomer sub inventory at 14 submarines that are nuclear capable. On the other hand, the USN has commissioned 58 nuclear fast attack submarines. The USN also has 65 Arleigh Burke Class destroyers, which are one of the most advanced destroyer class in the world, most will be outfitted with the AGEIS missile defense system, which is a highly advanced missile and aircraft tracking system. TheArleigh Burke Class destroyers are the pinnacle and spear head of the USN and is cruise missile capable. USN has 22 Ticonderoga Class cruiser which is also outfitted with the AEGIS combat system, they are cruise missile capable. The USN main objectives are force and power projection away from home. The USN has a total of 323,792 active duty personnel with 108,515 reserve personnel. Chart below too compare sizes of aircraft carriers, it goes from biggest to smallest.    ALL CARRIERS DUE TO BE IN SERVICE OR ARE IN SERVICE OR IN RESERVE. THE US ARMY The US Army, the pinnacle of the US military. These warriors are some of the most well trained, most advanced and well equipped military personnel in the whole world. The US army it self is massive in numbers, coming in at 1.01 million personnel, it self is one of the biggest standing armies in the world, and that's just one branch of the US military. Also, in the US military, it is the largest branch out of them all surpassing any other branch by almost 600,000 personnel. They provide the bulk of security for the US's foreign interests. The mission of the U.S. Army is to fight and win our Nation's wars, by providing prompt, sustained, land dominance, across the full range of military operations and the spectrum of conflict, in support of combatant commanders. Which is mainly air domination and land domination. They mainly engage is conventional warfare, and asymmetrical warfare. The US Army's main responsibilities is preserving the peace and security and providing for the defense of the United States, the Commonwealths and possessions and any areas occupied by the United States, Supporting the national policies, Implementing the national objectives, Overcoming any nations responsible for aggressive acts that imperil the peace and security of the United States. The US Army is also home to some of the most dangerous, prestigious and hardest working special forces teams in the world such as the frontline special force, the Rangers, we also have the green berets and the iconic 1st Special Forces Operational Detachment-Delta (Airborne) also known as Delta Force. We will talk more in depth of the different special forces in the US Special Operations section.  The US Army also employs tons of armored vehicles such as the M1A2 Abrams tank, Bradley Fighting Vehicle, M113 Personnel carrier, and the Stryker and LAV-25 mainly as armored support for troops and for other heavy armored vehicles like tanks. Likewise, they deploy over 200,000 humvee armored cars, which are totally bada** cause they can put a freakin Mk 19 grenade launcher, the M2 heavy machine gun, the M240G/B machine gun and M249 LMG and M134 Machine Gun.  THE USMC There is a reason why the USMC are called devil dogs... These marines are the baddest of the bad, the best of what America has to offer. One thing you must know about Marines, is that they take to offense if they are referred as a soldier or an ex marine or ex soldier, they have a saying in the Marines, Once a Marine, Always a Marine. The marines are responsible for providing power projection, using the mobility of the United States Navy. The Marine Corps fulfills a vital role in national security as an amphibious, expeditionary, air-ground combined arms task force, capable of forcible entry from the air, land, and sea. It is capable of asymmetrical warfare with conventional, irregular, and hybrid forces. The marines are the first ones in and the last ones out. The Marines take to heart their training, they have a lengthy 13 week boot camp, add on top of that whatever your MOS will be. Also, the marines are the only branch in the US military that everyone is trained in rifling, which means that you could be a desk jockey and you are trained to be an infantry grunt. The marines have been involved in almost every major war that has happened with the US since 1775 when the first two battalions of continental marines were established. The main responsibility for the Marines was mainly to defend ships from enemies. However, that role drastically changed after WWII. The USN and USMC were responsible for the pacific war, and the marines turned out to be the most essential ground force in the Pacific theater. While the US Army was responsible for the ground war in the European theater.  The Marines are the most well trained soldiers in the world (their is speculations that the USMC trains as hard or harder than Chinese Special Forces). Each soldier carries almost $150,000 dollars worth of equipment. However, they are trained to do the same damage with only sticks and stones. Just like the US Army, they utilize armored vehicles such as the M1A2 Abrams tank, and humvees. Some mechanized infantry units they use is AAVP7A1 RAM/RS, which is an amphibious assault vehicle, capable of driving on land and sailing on the sea. Also, they use LCAC, which is a vehicle capable of moving heavy machinery from ship to sea. It can carry things such as tanks, humvees and other such equipment which includes Marines and other soldiers. The main users of tank battalions, the LCAC's, and amphibious assault ships, are units called MEU's or Marine Expeditionary Units. They are stationed on Amphibious Assault Ships, also they usually head the invasion force, they establish a beach head and lighten up the enemy. Then the US Army comes in and cleans up the rest. MEU's also establish ship safety from external and internal threats. The USMC is the smallest branch in the US military with 182,000 active personnel and 38,500 reserve personnel. However, they make 10 people feel like 1,000.  THE US MILITARY SPECIAL OPERATIONS OK these guys, I'd rather cut my balls off than face one of them in hand to hand combat. All special forces in the US military are highly highly highly trained killers. They are trained to kill first and ask questions later. Some special forces the US military has are the USAF Pararescuemen, US Army's Rangers, Delta Force, Green Berets, and the night stalkers, USN Navy Seals, and the USMC Marine Raiders. I will be going in depth of the two most iconic and well known special forces in the world, the Navy Seals, and Delta Force.  First, Navy Seals. ^^ The Seal in Navy Seals stands for SEa Air and Land-SEAL. These boys train to the max, they have an infamous week which is about 2 weeks into bud/s training know as Hell Week. You run a minimum 200 miles on as little as 4 hours of sleep. They did research and if you stay up for a full week without at least 4 hours of sleep, you will die. They will push you to your breaking point, they will make you question who you are and what you are. They will bring the man out of you. They break you and build you back up from the ground, and you will be better for it. The first 8 weeks of Bud/s training is to see who is willing to become a Navy Seal, they separate the wheat from the chaff. The men from the boys. Overall, they train for around 6 whole months. They are the 2nd most prestigious group of badasses in the world. The name strikes fear into the eye of the enemy. The Seals are true warriors.  Second, Delta Force.^^ notice the lack of patches or markings on their uniforms. Jeezzz these guys are even more badass than the Navy Seals. These people are the top 1% of all special forces, so they pick applicants to join the iconic Delta force from all branches. They are the most secretive special force in the world. The Department of Defense tightly controls information about Delta Force and refuses to comment publicly on the highly secretive unit and its activities. Delta operators are granted an enormous amount of flexibility and autonomy. To conceal their identities, they rarely wear a uniform and usually wear civilian clothing both on and off duty. When military uniforms are worn, they lack markings, surnames, or branch names. Civilian hair styles and facial hair are allowed to enable the members to blend in and avoid recognition as military personnel. They are so secretive and so amazing, it is highly debated whether they even exist or not!!! Nobody knows, only the operators them selves and a couple of other people. Nothing is known about training or anything. However, if they take the top 1% from each special force in the US military, I can say with high confidence that they are seriously the most deadliest and hardest training force in the whole world. Overall, US Military is simply the best armed force in the whole world. They might not be the largest military in the world, however they are the most well armed and the best trained. Each branch relies on each other for certain things, such as the USMC relies on the USN for transportation around the world. All of the branches work in unison and no one is left behind.  OK so the question asks, what is it like to face the US military. Well, we can tell that it would complete and total chaos in the region that the US is fighting in, as all the branches work in unison, so the enemy would be targeted with amazing precision fro, the air, ground and even at sea. You can kill 1,000 of our men in a week, but we will come back and kill 10,000 of your men in one night. \"Nuts.\" -- The response of General Anthony MacAuliffe, when asked to surrender during the Battle of the Bulge, 1944. The US Military practices complete chaos as their basic training. They know how to handle every situation calmly and with extreme lethtality. Facing the US Military, you feel like you are being watched 24/7 you feel like your life is in danger some how in some way no matter where you are. Chances are that you probably are being watched or listened into by someone or something, such as a sniper, now if you are being watched from a sniper, it's best that you kill yourself. Our snipers are the best shots in the world. Them shooting you from 900 yards away is like a kid breaking a stick for them, it's so easy. They have super high precision and can kill multiple people without giving up their own position. A question to the enemy. Are you ready to be hunted like an animal? Are you ready for almost 10,000 troops on your doorstep, accompanied by hundreds of tanks, fighters, artillery, and naval warships? All in less than 18 hours. Let's put this into perspective, it took Iran 8 YEARS to fight a war against Iraq, and that war ended in a stalemate. Then we come in, and we clobber the Iraqi military in 2 months, with as much as 40,000 kills while only loosing 146 US Soldiers. That is crazy to me. Overall, the US military will simply overwhelm the opposing force, it would most likely start off with attacking its main infrastructure. Taking out the electrical grid, destroying any air defense that are autonomous and just wrecking havoc to anything that is run off of electricity. Then you will over tens of thousands of sorties being flown, dropping tens of thousands of explosives on you. Also you would have cruise missiles being shot at you and you can't do anything about it. Now this is only the first day or so. Your entire electrical grid is down, 95% of air defenses are down due to air strikes from planes that are 80 years ahead of your own tech. Also, your men and communications are in disarray. Nobody can talk to each other cause the US destroyed the electrical grid and communications. Also, in a day or so thousands of bombs were dropped on you without notice. And that's only the beginning. Then US Marines invade along with Army Rangers and a lot of other special forces who go behind enemy lines and disrupt the war internally. Now 3 days have passed and their are 40,000 US soldiers taking over country in over helming force due to the super high tech they have along with concentrated air strikes and cruise missile strikes. All in all, facing the US Military is pure chaos.  USA!! USA!!! USA!!! ",

            "answer_text": "I can only imagine. It could be overwhelmingly powerful, yet a bit reluctant. First of all, they have eyes in the space, the GPS system is generously donated to the world, courtesy of American tax payers and the Pentagon. For their own military use however, the resolution is much higher and probably able to pinpoint a bomb into your alarm clock next to your bed. It will be worse under Democratic party president, because the support will be immense, as it probably, be the only excuse for the liberals to went jingoistic. You will feel the whole world turned against you. Throughout the cyber world, everybody hates you, and you are defeated at all fronts. Their fanboys united, \u201cclueless people\u201d from their ally countries even jumped into the bandwagon, cursing you. It is even more disheartening to see the SJWs chiming to support their politically-aligned leader. You become frustrated, you can only make comebacks in strong yet meaningless rhetoric. This situation predictably breeds paranoia among your ranks. Everybody wise enough should know that no one in this earth stands a chance against the US military. Your only option is to go underground from the start, and let the battle wear them out. You clearly cannot defeat their weapons and soldiers, but you hoped that American public will eventually wear out from elections after elections, which thankfully, is held for every 4 years, not 5. The media coverage of war casualties, the image of your people suffering under their attack perhaps could steer away the public support for the war against you. Just as you thought of this, you\u2019ll hear reports and rumours about ongoing rebellion, mutiny, and desertion across your command. It could be the CIA activating their militant cells or your trusted people become wavered under such immense pressure. There will be reports about American special forces, blackops, and other secretive operations fighting alongside the rebels. They managed to retake several important areas, but you are still hanging on. So, it has began unannounced! Then, you\u2019ll tune to American news outlets, to find out, but you\u2019ll see the perfectly choreographed joint military assault being televised live. How vulgar! But then, as you about to shout your lungs out, your bunker starts to shake violently. Suddenly communications are down, power is switched to backup generator, your critical units reporting barrages of surgical missile strikes, destroying important infrastructures. This goes on and on for the whole day. Shock and awe! By this time, you are too tired to get angry. Too exhausted to think clearly about how to perfectly respond to the following onslaught. The day after, partial communication link can be successfully established. Several critical infrastructure are back online. You\u2019ll either think that: \u201cHa! the CIA missed these remaining assets!\u201d or maybe, if you think further, they bugged and trying to bait me with this remaining assets? As suspicion and confusion grows, the US forces unpredictably launched a massive assault on their first target. No matter how well defended that place is, it will be no match for the assaulting forces. Reports from the frontline depicted a grim battle scene: a desperate resistance against powerful might of well-trained enemy, surgically busting your resistance pockets within the area one by one. Even some of the people turned to support them! How dare! Then, you send the best reinforcements and reserves to cover their retreat, knowing that they won\u2019t be able to retake it without any proper intelligence at the moment. You expected the worst. When the relief forces established their position, they were attacked ferociously by the famed A-10. The dreadful A-10 laid waste on your gate keeper. Endlessly strafing positions after positions, using their 1,000+ rounds of ammunition. The relief forces had it, and they abandon position. The retreating columns become stranded, and your forces completely routed, effectively disbanded as an organised fighting forces. Their fighting spirit and hope for escape died after seeing their relief forces shattered by the might of enemy\u2019s most feared weapon. A lot of them immediately surrendered to the US forces. Frustrated, you hoped that your air force can effectively reduce the A-10\u2019s effectiveness, the next day, you gathered the remaining air assets, seemingly untouched by US\u2019 surgical strike, to counter the air threat. But you didn\u2019t learn anything. In Top Gun film, the US Navy fighters might be outnumbered, but reality is always worse. Once airborne, your outdated export-model MiG-23 suddenly saw jamming strobes in their radars. Before they even tried to home in the jam, they are outranged by the enemy launching their missiles from far away. Boom! Splashed one bogey. Fox three! Fox three! Medium! Pit bull! The enemy let you hear that, so you can clearly experience the complete destruction of your air force. Uh oh! They are trying to dismantle your prized air force! This was a trap! But it is too late, communication is effectively gone with strong jamming operations performed by the cunning enemy. Your last hope, the SAM batteries are left uncoordinated, they don\u2019t know where the enemy will be coming from or when, and cannot anticipate the attack efficiently. One by one, they are being taken down by anti-radar missiles. The air force is fighting a losing battle, effectively a sitting duck throughout the campaign. The enemy find it easier than their own Red Flag exercise, which invites a slight chuckle of irony from you. With the air force gone and the air defense apparatus rendered impotent, their planes can rain down any munitions in any position in your country. The path lies open. Without any strong air or anti-air opposition, the Americans now find the courage to bring in the low-flying AC-130U Spectre. Whenever the enemy finds it a bit stiff to go through, these merciless beast will rain down lead and explosive on our position, which we cannot do anything about. It will puree its target, until the US forces able to take over. Your plan to go underground finally materialised. But only so much of your initial assets are left. You are utterly disappointed, but hoped all the best to outlast the enemy. There may be more disconnected units out there who are still loyal to you, but never managed to find you. They are still out there conducting their operations. Days by days, the situation deteriorated. One day, you saw a Reaper drone flies so high, it is almost difficult to see. Then it rapidly descended and fired a missile onto nearby area. It hit the nearest outpost from your hiding spot, taking a lot of your closest leaders, seeking for an unexpected day to relax somewhere outside your hideout. You\u2019ll never leave the hideout ever since. Days after days gone, the bullies finally managed to find you, emaciated, tired, and visibly shaken. At first, they are pretty jubilant, but still largely subdued, unlike what you saw in American films. Their COs are visibly pretty uptight and quite paranoid about traps that you might hid. So, they ushered you quickly into one of their armoured cars, and take you away to their base. They are considerate enough to offer you their rations. \u201cAre you vegetarian? Do you eat kosher food? Do you want some water?\u201d asked one of your captors. One of them managed to find American stuff inside your hideout like one of your staffs\u2019 Penn U. hoodie. \u201cHeeey, how are the Quakers doing?\u201d asked one of them. ",
