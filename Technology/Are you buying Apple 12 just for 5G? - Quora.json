            "answer_text": "No,I was planning to yo buy iphone 12 but not only because of 5G.Because it will atleast take 2 years for 5G to be start rolling in india. So i bought iphone 11 at its value for money option as of now Also iphone support limited 5G bandwidth so not sure how much you will get benefit from current 5G hardware in iphone once 5G is available in India. Its better to wait for 5G to rollout first and then buy latest iphone at that time, iphone 14 maybe. ",

I actually don't care about it. Because, 5G will took 2\u20133 years minimum in India. And in that period I usually change my phone or use that phone as secondary device. So, 5G is not important at the moment for me. ",
