            "answer_text": "Because its got many more new things now.The new A14 Bionic chip,a way better display(OLED 1080p Vs LCD 720p),Magsafe(tho no one asked for it lol),Ceramic Shield,and most Importantly,5G.And to be honest,these things cost a lot. So it only makes sense fot them to price their phones accordingly.And as to why it is different than the previous Iphones,its got a new design,new chip and features as mentioned above.However,its not a huge jump,the refinements and improvements are there,but they are minor. Thats all.Hope this helps!! ",
