            "answer_text": "Ok. Placing divs exactly where you want them on a web page used to be particularly complicated. But. No more. In fact, I used to spend hours, literally in the 10s of hours, just trying to hey my divs to go where I wanted them to go. Then, mobile phones entered the market and that screwed things ALL up. What would take 10 hours of trial and error, all of a sudden, took 20+ hours to get the layout to respond to the device viewports. Then 2015 came and everything, EVERYTHING, simplified. Enter display:grid; It is THE MOST SIMPLE AND EFFECTIVE CSS tool you must put in your proverbial tool belt. For an incredibly simple and straight forward explanation of how Grid works (including tons of \u2018Grab and Go Patterns\u2019 that you can use straight away on your own website), check out Rachel Andrew's Grid by Example. If you're looking for more use cases, try watching Morten Rand-hendriksen\u2019s YouTube video on the subject: Morten Rand-Hendriksen: CSS Grid Changes Everything (About Web Layouts) Seriously, you want to know how to place and or nest divs, CSS Grid is your answer (and I'm feeling like several people who already responsed to this question might benefit from giving it a look see too!) Best of luck, Daniel ",

            "answer_text": "Many have already answered the question, you can simply add two div elements one after another, they should appear one below the another. But if it doesn\u2019t you can check few css properties for those div elements Check if div have any width then set the width to 100% or autoIs the display type of div set to inline or inline-block or flex, remove thatIf div has any float, remove thatCheck if any div has a position property like absolute, remove that.Now your div elements should be placed one after another. Hope this helps. ",
