            "answer_text": "Such a broad question. The current state? Red hot and getting hotter \u2013 regardless of your political bent on the major issues like global warming.  I'm sure there are market research stats on the dollar-size of the service market for sustainability -- which will be largely meaningless. You just need to look at the vendors scrambling to try and comply with sustainability indices, legislation (real or looming) and customer demand in order to see that the opportunity exists -- and near by.  By most accounts sustainability is growing \u2013 including growing reporting at the Global Reporting Initiative. http://www.globalreporting.org/AboutGRI/FactSheet.htm Some markets are further ahead (like Europe) and others are behind, at least politically (ahem, the US). The Harvard Business Review calls sustainability a mega trend. http://hbr.org/2010/05/the-sustainability-imperative/ar/1 However, there is a bit of a \u201cbandwagon\u201d psyche out there \u2013 with substantive know how rather sketchy in some supplier sectors. What ever you do, make sure it provides targeted and measurable benefits and appeals directly to a client sustainability need -- like education, skills development, analysis, change management, supply chain management, communications and a host of other business activities that need to be reviewed under the spotlight of sustainability. How you enter the sustainability market really depends on your field of expertise, your passion and your skill set.  You didn\u2019t say what kind of start up you were considering, so I\u2019ll pick four broad categories. Product: Sustainability, as a main driver of the trend, is a catalyst for product innovation. Everything from cars to kitchen cleaner is being revamped. Products with verifiable and genuine sustainability benefits may find a quick market niche with consumers or progressive organizations. Reinvent something old into something sustainable or look at the manufacturing and distribution costs (real and environmental) to minimize the impacts of old-world products.Consulting: Everyone is adding sustainability to his or her consulting resumes because the market is demanding it. But skill sets are varied and companies are still trying to figure out how to best use this kind of vendor.  Everything PR and branding to operational change management and audits/reporting can be done by outside consultants. Change management is going to be a strong field related to sustainability.Auditing/Authentication/Compliance: Like lawyers and accountants, sustainability experts who can help companies report and comply with various sustainability regulations are going to be hot tickets \u2013 soon, if not already. Environmental engineers have a leg up here.Technology: Utilities that do anything from conserving energy to create sustainability reports will be in demand as the market grows and needs more sophisticated tools. Apps, online resources, and offline software should be a market.Take a look at how relevant legislation is progressing and is likely to go in your market. Likewise, look at the legal landscape for trends in how sustainability is being litigated. Use a crystal ball \u2013 or at least creative imagination about how sustainability will look in five or 10 years and jump in. Try a blaze new territory since the old stand by categories are pretty well served and competition already steep. Write a kick ass business plan that helps guide your vision. ",
