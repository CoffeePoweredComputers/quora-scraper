            "answer_text": "There are different ways to communicate with babies and children. A combination of different types of communication works well. So the obvious one, talking to your children about everything is important. Even when they are newborn you can get into the habit of talking by explaining what you are doing or what you are seeing. When they get older and can respond with words it\u2019s great to interact, ask questions and explain slightly more complex notions each time. I agree, that you don\u2019t have to talk differently in a funny voice because they are children. They\u2019ll appreciate that they are treated equally. Then there is a lot of non-verbal communication that is very important for babies, because they are quicker at picking up visual cues. For toddlers you still have to physically show them how to do things, often repetitively, so they will be able to copy and remember. For older kids you can still do non-verbal hand/arm gestures, but more for everyday things like waving or pointing. Although when you are teaching an older child how to bake, draw, dance, or even help them with their maths homework, there is still a lot of non-verbal that is being used. There are also other ways to communicate non-verbally with facial expressions for example, such as smiling, or putting on a serious or a sad face. Communication isn\u2019t just about talking and showing, it\u2019s also about listening. It\u2019s important to listen to what a toddler or an older child has to say. Even responding to cues from babies who want to communicate and \u2018say\u2019 lots in their own way. Communication is two-ways, it\u2019s the same between an adult and a child. ",

            "answer_text": "Without trying to sound sarcastic because I don't mean to be, I simply talk to them. By that I mean talk to them like I would anyone else. Sure I account for their age and use terms or words they will understand better but I don't talk to them like they are stupid. My kids are 9 and 6. I see so many people talk to kids at this age like they are somehow different, that they require a silly voice all the time or to be sugarcoated at every opportunity. I don't regret my descision to treat my kids with mostly the same degree I would an adult. ",
