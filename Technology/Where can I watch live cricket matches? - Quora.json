            "answer_text": "Alright guys many of you might be wondering how to watch Live cricket matches from outside or inside India? There are a couple of ways: You can always try the paid subscriptions. If in India you can sign up with a cable. The second step is you using apps such as Sony Liv and Hotstar. (Sony LIV is for India and hotstar is for India,UK,USA.)I personally don\u2019t understand and like the concept of paying for stuff for like this. But there are a couple of ways for my Android peeps, you can use apps such as LIVE NET TV and SWIFT STREAMFor my iPhone users, you can install one app called as LIVE CRICKET TV via App Store.To conclude I have used both phones and I can assure you these two will completely work fine and for free.",
