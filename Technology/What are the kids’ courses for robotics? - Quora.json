            "answer_text": "Robotics courses help kids to learn many things such as coding, STEM concepts, Communication, Problem-solving skills, etc. Also, robotics is a multidisciplinary field that involves electronics, computer science, and some mechanical concepts as well. Thus teaching kids robotics helps them to understand the latest innovations. So I planned to teach robotics for my nephew. Since I am a DIY guy initially I started teaching robotics to my nephew by myself but later I realized that I am not a good teacher and I can't able to explain the robotics concepts in simple terms. Then, as usual, I started searching online for robotics courses as you know there are many online resources that teach robotics for kids so it took more time for me to find the best one. As I previously told that I was teaching robotics to my nephew at the time I found two things: kids will show more interest in practical things rather than theoreticalMore patience is required to teach kids and live interaction is the best wayBy keeping the above things in mind I conducted the online research and found the exact match - Skyfi Labs. First I booked a trial class where the trainer came online and interacted with my nephew to find his level of understanding and suggested an intermediate robotics course for him. They sent all the required kit to develop the robotics as well and as part of the program, he developed projects like line follower robot, obstacle avoiding robot, gesture-controlled robot, fire-fighting robot, etc. ",

            "answer_text": "Robotics Courses for Kids\u2019 Every budding child has the curiosity to know and learn more because their brains can process several sources of information in a single sitting. And that is where the question arises- whether they can work on a robot at such a tender age or wait till he or she has reached his age of graduation?  (Source of an Image - skyfilabs. com) Note: Have you checked out our projects on School level yet? School-level Kit will be shipped to you and you can build using tutorials. You can start with a free demo today! 1. 5 Robots (combo course) 2. Gesture Controlled Robot 3. Edge Detection Robot 4. Fire Fighting Robot 5. Mobile Controlled Robot 6. Line Follower Robot 7. 3 Robots (Combo Course) Well, there is no need to wait, because the earlier, the better. Global studies have found that kids ranging from 7 to 15 years of age hold high power of grasping information thereby leading them to be more productive in the work they are doing. So yes, loading a child's brain with the basics of what their interest lies in, is the best way to stick to their interests for a longer period of time because it is the skills that need mastering from years of interest to pursue a career in the universe of science and technology.
