            "answer_text": "Wait for the apple silicon. Once the apple silicon launches, x86 proccesors will most likely became obsolete. Apple has said that x86 machines will get support for \u201cyears to come\u201d. That isn't very clear. Also, not all developers have the luxury to develop for two proccesors and won't support one of the two platforms which obviously will be x86. If you need to buy an iMac right now, don't buy 2020 iMac, buy something cheaper or used and wait until they release Apple silicon. ",
