            "answer_text": "Your head hurts and your eyes itch from looking at screens all day. Your back aches from leaning towards your laptop for work. And you can't go more than 20 minutes without nervously checking your smartphone for updates. A good night's rest might help, but you can't get that either, because the light from all these devices is keeping you up. From a health standpoint, technology clearly isn't doing you any favors \u2013 and there are studies to prove it. From established health organizations to prominent universities, studying the potentially negative effects of technology on the human body has become a popular endeavor. And it's unfortunate news for everyday users. Doctors, psychologists, and technology experts are arguing that all of these devices are affecting our bodies and mental well-being for the worse. We've dug through all the research, noted all the ailments and possible causes, and spoken to health experts to get to the bottom of whether technology is really all that bad for you. Technology and Physical Health The human body has evolved over thousands of years to accomplish a vast array of unimaginable feats. From running cross-country, to swimming across rivers, to actually doing a pull-up correctly, we are built to test our physical limits. But most of us\u2026don't get to. Due to a daily grind that sees us sat at a desk through a working day, staring at a smartphone screen on our commute, then binge-watching Netflix with our evenings, we're putting all sorts of tech-driven strain on ourselves. And, the positions your body contorts into in order to utilize modern technology could be damaging it. Put simply, your body wasn't meant to endure these previously non-existent activities. Technology has become part of everyday life at such a staggering pace that our bodies are forced to play catch-up in mere years rather than centuries. And the negative effects of technology are already visible in our bodies today. Poor Vision Technology's increasing presence in our lives could be having a dramatically negative effect on our eyesight. For one thing, the use of smartphones for multiple hours at a time has significantly changed the way our eyes function on a day-to-day basis. While the tech in a smartphone display is no worse for you than a television screen or a billboard in Time Square, the problem is that you use them for a long period of time at such a close distance. Which, as we all know, is exactly how everyone uses their phone (and if you're reading this at work on a desktop screen, you may want to lean a little further back from that display). According to the Vision Council, 80% of American adults are using digital devices for more than two hours per day, along with an additional 67% that use two devices or more at the same time. Subsequently, they found that 59% of American adults report experiencing symptoms of \u201cdigital eye strain.\u201d \u201cWith an increase in digital technology, many individuals suffer from physical discomfort after screen use for longer than two hours at a time,\u201d reads the report. \u201cWe refer to this collection of symptoms as digital eye strain.\u201d Symptoms of digital eye strain include headache, blurred vision, watery or dry eyes, sensitivity to light, and plenty of other ailments typically heard in pharmaceutical commercials. Suffice to say, the use of technology is having a troubling effect on our vision. But, that's not the only problem. Weaker Muscles One of the most significant negative effects of technology isn't due to digital devices at all, but rather, the sedentary lifestyle they manifest. The need to get up and move around is dwindling by the day. Why go to work, when fast home internet and cloud computing mean you can work from home? Who needs to head out for entertainment when vast movie and video game catalogs are available to stream? This convenience leads, of course, to less physical movement. And that could be causing more of a problem than we realize. It's not just having an effects on adults either. A study out of Essex University found that children are getting weaker as well, with a suggestion that this is due to the lack of outdoor play caused by the increased use of technology. The report studied a large group of British 10-year-olds and found that, since 1985, arm strength had fallen by 26%, and the number of sit-ups they could do declined by 27.1%. Weird Bones  A few weeks ago, a Washington Post story took the internet by storm, citing research that extended smartphone use was giving users \u201chorns\u201d at the back of their skulls. The report in question showed that x-rays of younger adults showed this protrusion more often than older adults \u2013 which means smartphones must be to blame, right? Everyone picked up the outrageous claim, until experts starting speaking out about the ridiculousness of these attention-grabbing headlines. However, the actually study that the report was based on showed that the \u201chorns\u201d \u2013 or \u201cexternal occipital protuberance\u201d \u2013 aren't dangerous, and cannot scientifically be connected to smartphone or technology use at all. Whether technology is to blame for the growth of new, weird bones around the skull remains to be seen. However, the effects of tech on the brain underneath that skull are more troubling. Mental Health Impact of Tech The repercussions of extended tech use on your mental health are arguably more problematic than the effect on physical health. Social media, online gaming, and overexposure to the dreaded \u201cblue light\u201d could be wreaking havoc on everything from your sleep cycle to your social circles. Despite occasional eforts from big tech companies to get you to use their products less, the problem seems only set to increase. Addictive Behavior Whether you reach for your phone every few minutes in case you've missed a notification, or sleep with it right next to your bed so you can start scrolling as soon as you wake, technology has begun to elicit clear signs of addiction from its users. The one of the main drivers of technology addiction is social media, which studies have found as a direct correlation to the kind of addictive behavior you see in drug users. Receiving a notification (a like, a retweet, etc.) triggers the \u201cfeel good\u201d portion of your brain in a quick-hit way. There's a science behind this reward mechanic: To make matters worse, neither social media nor smartphone use are considered taboo in the way that other addictive drugs might be. This makes patterns of addiction, or the need for resolution, less obvious. And that's particularly troubling when 93.4% of users admit to spending more time on social media than they mean to. Less Sleep When it comes to sleep, the data is pretty damning: technology definitely gets in the way of a good night's rest. Most screen technology we use (smartphones, tablets, laptops) emits a blue light. This depletes your body's melatonin, the hormone that helps you sleep, causing you to stay awake longer and get less rest.  Tech companies are responding to this issue, with most modern smartphones automatically entering into a \u201cwarm light\u201d setting after a certain time point in the evening. The latest Amazon Kindle Oasis model also offers this warm light mode, for example. But, warm light or blue light aside, it's not merely the type of screen lighting causing the problem. It's the amount of tech use just before bedtime that needs addressing. According to a study from Rasmussen College, members of Generation Y send nearly 56 texts or other messages less than one hour before bed. Other generations are better, but not by much, with even Baby Boomers sending five messages one hour before bed, which could have a dramatic effect on whether or not they're getting the recommended seven hours of sleep per night. Increased Loneliness While technology was designed to bring people together, it also has a tendency to do the opposite. Take social media, again. The constant connectedness of friends, family, and random strangers might seem like a beneficial means of combatting loneliness. But studies have found this simply isn't the case. This paradox, however significant, hasn't been entirely explained by the scientific community, and it would be hard to do so with a metric like \u201cloneliness.\u201d Technology Moderation The negative effects of technology on the human body may sound daunting, dangerous, and downright scary sometimes. But the reality is that, while these symptoms and sicknesses can be hazardous to your health, they are typically only brought about by overuse. Too much of anything is never good for your health, whether it be technology, chocolate, or even going for a run. Moderation, in all its boring glory, is the only real way to make sure you're destined for a healthy life. Put your phone away before you go to bed. Stand up from your computer for a few minutes every hour. Avoid scrolling social media feeds for hours on end. Go outside every once in a while (without Instagramming what you see out there). Let technology be a pleasant addition to your full life, not the only thing you live for. Because, rest assured, you're going to feel the physical and mental effects of that dependence before you know it. ",

            "answer_text": "The Echo Chamber Effect  We would think that social media would be an effective tool for bridging divides between differing opinions, but this does not necessarily appear to be the case. For example, Facebook\u2019s algorithms tend to push users toward content which lines up with their interests, which is understandable, and their existing viewpoints, which is troublesome. As a result, users of social media must go out of their way to seek out differing views from their own\u2014and most do not. This effect serves to worsen divides by ensuring that groups on different sides of an issue are having completely different conversations. Interactions between the sides usually only comes in the form of conflict. This has become known as a \u201cfilter bubble\u201d in which those who get their news mostly from social media are rarely presented with challenging perspectives. The Web Has Diminished Your Attention Span  While it may come as no surprise that the fast-paced consumption of digital media has resulted in a shorter average attention span, a Canadian research project funded by Microsoft likewise puts this into sharp perspective. Using detailed surveys and EEG brain scans, the attention spans of over 2,000 Canadians were measured twice\u2014once in 2000, roughly at the beginning of the mobile era, and once in 2015. The result: The average attention span had dropped from 12 seconds to 8 seconds\u2014an astonishing erosion of one-third of our attention span in only 15 years. Although the report points out that there has been a corresponding rise in the ability to effectively multitask, it also points out that eight seconds is less than the attention span of the average goldfish. GPS Affects Brain Function  GPS has become a nearly indispensable aspect of everyday life. Many of us can\u2019t remember how we ever got anywhere without Maps (hint: actual, physical maps), but researchers at McGill University have presented three studies which suggest that overreliance on GPS can actually be detrimental to long-term memory as we age. This is because the hippocampus, the area of the brain which controls memory, is also associated with spatial navigation. Researchers found a higher physical volume of gray matter\u2014and increased activity\u2014in the hippocampus in their subjects who relied mainly on spatial navigation rather than GPS. One neuroscientist involved with the study even suggested that relying on GPS may lead to the earlier onset of dementia and that avoiding its use when possible may help stave off cognitive impairment. Smartphones Change Your Sleep Patterns  A 2012 Time magazine survey of 4,700 people found a great many respondents agreeing with the statement, \u201cI don\u2019t sleep as well as I used to because I am connected to technology all the time.\u201d For those aged 18\u201324, it was fully one-quarter of them. However, there is also a scientific reason why evening smartphone use could be bad for your shut-eye. Humans are wired to know when to sleep and when to wake by the quality of ambient light. \u201cRed\u201d light, the type seen at dusk, signals the body that it is nighttime while \u201cblue\u201d light is the signal that it\u2019s time to wake up. This \u201cblue\u201d light is obviously seen in the morning\u2014and is also emitted by smartphones and tablets. This suppresses melatonin, a sleep-promoting chemical in the brain. According to a Harvard study, \u201cblue\u201d light also reduces the overall hours of REM sleep, which is crucial to healthy mental function. Texting Hurts Our Ability To Communicate Texting has become the primary form of daily communication for nearly everybody. Even Americans in older age groups now send more texts per day than they make phone calls. Much has been made of how text and email communications can rob an exchange of context, but the problem runs deeper than this. New research suggests that texting may be slowly depriving us of our ability to read emotional cues in others. Such nonverbal, visual cues are a critical component of conversation, and some developmental psychologists worry that a lack of experience with them can be particularly damaging to the social development of young people. While most adults entered the mobile age with their social skills already formed, this is not the case for children and teenagers. These young people may find themselves more limited in their ability to have a face-to-face conversation than previous generations.  Fake News Keeps You Misinformed  The proliferation of \u201cfake news\u201d websites has generated a great deal of real news in 2016. These websites sometimes mimic genuine news outlets, complete with legitimate-looking URLs. Fake news sites have come under fire for publishing misleading articles in the pursuit of clicks. One might think that such easily debunked fake stories could have little impact in the Information Age, but one Stanford study conducted in 2015 dramatically suggests otherwise. Multiple assessments were made of the ability of middle school, high school, and college students to evaluate the trustworthiness of information online. In one, fully 80 percent of participants failed to differentiate between an article and an advertisement labeled \u201csponsored content\u201d on the same page. In another, only 25 percent of students were able to tell a verified Fox News Twitter account from a fake, with over 30 percent arguing for the legitimacy of the phony account because of graphics elements it contained. Technology is a two-edged sword. It provides benefits beyond belief with the same ease it can destroy dreadfully. The solution is in the to use it correctly. The word 'correctly' however, is highly subjective, and often utterly prone to 'special' interests! These interests range from politics to business. The destruction, if we want to call things by their own name, of the environment is affected by both! Money is behind these technological problems that cause problems.. Consumers are virtually brainwashed to use a torrent of increasingly more complex functions on an ever increasing kinds of devices! With every thing made easier, or completely done for us, through the use of technology, people are slowly but surely forgetting how to to do things the old fashioned way\u2026good old hard work. You no longer have to pull out the dictionary or visit the library if you want information, you can simply type in a question and get an answer. This is also true for children, they are becoming more and more focused on things like the internet and video games that they are spending much less time outside and being active. ",
