            "answer_text": "Does downloading a more powerful processor make your PC overheat? I don\u2019t know if you\u2019re trying to be funny or not but I laughed a little when I read the question. The fact of the matter is processors are not a software package to be downloaded. They are a piece of hardware that must be physically installed into the PC. They are essentially the heartbeat of the computer. For many PC designs there is software you can download which will allow you to speed up your processor\u2019s clock, i.e. make the computer run faster. The faster a processor is running the more electricity is consumed and more electricity going to the chip means more energy is dissipated into heat. What that boils down to is the faster you run a processor beyond it\u2019s intended specifications the higher risk you run of overheating your computer. You can mitigate it by installing aftermarket CPU coolers, but there is a breaking point on every processor so be careful. ",
