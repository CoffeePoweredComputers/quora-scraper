            "answer_text": "Well, I get the impression you have a young person\u2019s myopic view of computing. I regularly use an IBM ThinkPad 960EL from the 90.s Why/ Because I need to run a program on it to convert diskettes that was written in 1992 and CANNOT run on faster computers. I can also connect it to the Internet but choose not to because of all the malware, but I have done it carefully, using a shared net connection off of another computer that has good anti-virus protection, so a few things are safe. But this is not the end of the story by a long-shot. I am an expert on very old DEC computers [well-known in the field] and the NEWEST of them goes back to the early 1980.s My own machine stems from 1966 and the earliest model was a year earlier. They are not only used, they are in great demand because of a resurgence in interest. Perhaps some of these machines didn\u2019t start out as \u201cpersonal\u201d but there is no other possible definition now. I am actually typing this up on my 2004 IBM ThinkPad X32 just because it is handy. Hope that helps gain some perspective. ",
