            "answer_text": "You can use an ethernet cable. Simply plug it into the LAN port of your computer and the other end into another RJ45 connector in the wall (if public place) or on your Modem/Router/Switch. Finding a exposed RJ45/ethernet port in a public place is rare - but some small coffee shops and libraries might have them if you ask. There\u2019s also a big chance the port is blocked or extremely limited by the network administrator since this is a huge computer security risk. If you have an Android, you can buy an OTG dongle for a few dollars. You\u2019d then need to get an ethernet-to-USB adapter to plug into the OTG dongle and plug that into your phone. ",
