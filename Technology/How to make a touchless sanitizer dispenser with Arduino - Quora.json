            "answer_text": "A2A So, you will be requiring a High Tourqe servo motor, A photosensor/ proximity sensor, and an Arduino with some connecting wires. Fix the horn of the servo motor with the squeezing pump of the dispenser, and fix the sensor in front or any side of the bottle. Then connect the wires and implement the logic to rotate the servo motor only when the hand is detected. That\u2019s all, here your \u201cTouch-less sanitizer Dispenser\u201d is ready to use. Hope you got the answer\u2026 Happy coding\u2026 ",
