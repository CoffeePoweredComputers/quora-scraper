            "answer_text": "Not easily. Depending on how old it is, you may be able to remove the bottom cover and use a blower to get the dust out of the fans, which is the main place it builds up. The difficult part might be finding a screwdriver that works on the tiny screws on the base - at some point they went from phillips to pentalobe or hexatorx or some other demon screw head type, ostensibly to make machine assembly/disassembly easier. You can find kits online with the proper screwdrivers, and instructions on iFixIt. ",

            "answer_text": "Submerge your MacBook in shallow fresh water. Apple is pioneering in water-proofing technology. The new iPhone 11 Pro is water resistant down to four metres for half an hour - an industry first. If you have a MacBook purchased after 2014, it will have a waterproof rating of IP-68. This means you can submerge the device for up to a minute in depths of up to 50 cm. DO NOT submerge your MacBook in water below a depth of half a metre as the rubber seals are not designed to withstand that much pressure, and your laptop will be irreversibly damaged. Additionally, if the water is saline or has a high salt content, the salt residue left behind will do more harm than good. The best water to use for this is fresh, lukewarm tap water, the lower the limescale content the better Yes it is safe to put your MacBook in shallow water to get rid of dust build-ups. ",
