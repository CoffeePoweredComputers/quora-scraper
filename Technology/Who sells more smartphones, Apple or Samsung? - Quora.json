            "answer_text": "Apple has sold more phones than Samsung, but I just thought of sharing an interesting trivia here (I read it around the launch of the IPhoneX). According to analyst firm Counterpoint, Apple is expected to sell 130 million iPhone X over the next two years, which would give Samsung close to $14 billion in additional revenue (because Samsung makes the screen and related components). For what it's worth, Samsung is only estimated to make $10 billion in profits from its own Galaxy S8 devices over that same span. This means the iPhone X is bringing Samsung more money than the company's own flagship. ",
