            "answer_text": "Thanks for the A2A Zeeshan. Going back, I\u2019d say 20 years or more, I always used \u201ckeyless entry\u201d for my children. Giving each of your children a key to the house, which they invariably lose, never sounded like a good option to me. We used the keypad system that opens and closes the garage door and we kept the same code every time we moved. My wasband was in IT so we moved fairly often as IT people tend to do, especially back in the 80s and 90s when it was a growing industry and harder to stay in the same place for long. I\u2019m showing this garage door type first because the front door version is generally similar and more homes have this entry system than front door keyless systems. In fact when I have a property for sale (someone else\u2019s and I am the Listing Agent) I almost always go in and out using this opener vs a front door key.  The \u201ckeyless\u201d front door looks similar except it is part of the handle. I have only had one listed house for sale that used one and it looked like this.  I didn\u2019t have as much luck with it as I do with the garage door pads and this one was an either/or pad or key. Most agents do use their phones to access homes.  But we are opening a box that drops the key vs opening the door. But the same technology can be used to open the door itself. Again, for decades, agents have used this technology but more for their offices. Used to be as agents came and went we had to change the locks on the doors of our real estate offices. We switched to code entry so that we could just change the code every time an agent left vs changing the locks. So while these systems are relatively new for residential home use, they are far from new as to accessing both homes via the garage doors and commercial spaces with many and revolving staff. For home use it really is just for convenience of not having to bring a key when you go jogging or not giving a key to each of your children and nanny and housecleaner, etc. this because I can\u2019t envision a full sized home having keyless entry on EVERY door with a lock in the house. I have only seen them on the front door. Though that may change, I don\u2019t see builders going to \u201cno key\u201d locks everywhere on a single family residence anytime soon. Worth mentioning, I have also used keyless entry to get into condo complexes for decades. They have had keyless entry gates for as far back as I can remember.  The main function of that system is to call the unit owner vs open any doors, but as the manager of the complex I always had a private code to get into the gate of the complex, though not into the individual units. You may have heard or seen in movies someone at a door asking someone in their apartment to \u201cbuzz them in\u201d. You see it often on Seinfeld as example. Those are very old buildings with keyless entry to the main front door, so keyless is not a \u201cnew\u201d thing. ",

            "answer_text": "How does a keyless door lock look like? The key is simply the interface between the user and the deadbolt. If you remove the key you'll need to replace it with something else:combination pad, RFID reader or some other method. Possibilities are rather large as there are many ways to provide limited access. The question becomes what method works best for the user to provide and deny access to whatever group of people are using the door. What's popular in the US are magnetic locks and keycards. ",
