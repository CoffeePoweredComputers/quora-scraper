            "answer_text": "Hello greetings, New technologies have come as a intervention in this modern period. Technologies are spreading everywhere and easing the human task by their versatility and diligency. Although they don't have brain but whatever works they do don't create any difference between them and human. Recently I had studied that a robot hand has been built to play the piano. Artificial intelligence no doubt excelling the task and human condition. Not only students but also everyone are being benefited by technologies. When it comes to students , projector has been a most successful attempt to make a student to visualise things. The students who are not able to attend classes can see their lectures at internet. It is often said that visualization of any thing has been a successful attempt to memorizing things hence in most of the schools primary children are often taught through projector rather than making bore them by reading theories. Also in many of the places, robotics are arranged so that students may understand the importance of artificial intelligence. Not only this but also, mobile has been the best friend of toppers. On seeing interview of many toppers I have found that most of the time they used to spend in learning by phone seeing byjus app or other app. But seeing it's disadvantages, we are sad as same as we are happy for it's advantages. Most of the people do blackmailing using mobile phones and desktops. Most of the crimes in this world are being done using technologies. Terrorists are still active using these superintelligent technologies. Most of the students are misusing this seeing porn or other malfacious websites which are deteriorating their character, life and career. Some have become too much addicted that they could not leave phone for a second. It seems to be as the further coming time will not only be happiest but also dangerous because in these past 10 years mobile have developed a lot that now a rickshaw driver also have a multimedia set. So we can guess that what will happen after further 10years. Due to these advancing technologies somewhere we are going farther than our customs and spirituality that is equally important. Hence Inspite of being cultivated by recent technology changes, we are still in danger. I am sure that whoever reading this post will learn the aspects and use of technologies. Hence don't be cyanical about technology because it can have both the outcomes good as well as bad. Two year ago we are confined to finger unlock not on the screen but on back of the phone, but now we have seen and tried the finger screen unlock. So in these couple of months how much advancement have come in technology so we can guess that after couple of years we will be living in the era of robots, artificial intelligence and technologies. So we can see how much it is being advancing. Hope you will have got your required answer. Thank-you Regards Lakshya Kumar ",

            "answer_text": "Machine learning focuses on the development of computer programs that can access data and use it learn for themselves. The primary aim is to allow the computers learn automatically without human intervention or assistance and adjust actions accordingly. Let us look at some ways in which machine learning will improve education in India. One way machine learning will improve education is by grouping students and teachers according to their needs and availability. This can be achieved by creating virtual classrooms and labs. ",
