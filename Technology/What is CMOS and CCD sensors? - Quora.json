            "answer_text": "CMOS and CCD are two different types of sensor technology. CMOS stands for Complementary Metal Oxide Semiconductor and it is the same technology used to make the processors in computers, phones, and other devices. CCD stands for Charge Coupled Device. Both technologies have been used to make digital camera sensors and for a long time CCDs were considered to produce images of a higher quality. However most sensors in high end digital cameras today (Canon 5D Mark IV, Sony A7R II, Nikon D810, etc.) are CMOS. CMOS sensors are cheaper to manufacture, use less power and have been improved enough to provide very high quality. ",
