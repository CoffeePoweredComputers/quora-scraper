            "answer_text": "My nine-year-old Samsung \u201cSmart\u201d TV cannot access YouTube directly. Samsung stopped supporting the software and apps updates in their \u201cold\u201d models. If you have a newer model Samsung \u201cSmart TV\u201d, you should be able to go into the apps setting and download the YouTube app if it isn\u2019t already in your menu. You then manually enter your YouTube username and password one time and the TV should retain that info for future YouTube viewings. In order to view YouTube videos, here\u2019s how I do it: I connected a Roku streaming device to one of the HDMI ports on the Samsung TV. I connected the Ethernet jack of the Roku to an Ethernet jack on my home\u2019s router, which is then connected to my ISP internet modem. To watch a YouTube video, I turn on the Samsung TV, select the HDMI input for the Roku, and then select YouTube in my Roku menu. ",
