            "answer_text": "This is a tough, and possibly unanswerable, question. The extremely short answer is that the premise is impossible, so we can never know. The reasons ask to be broken into three parts: Which Renaissance, by type?Which Renaissance, by location?Can a time period ever really not happen?#1: Renaissance by Type Are we just removing Renaissance art? If so, the only major change is that the flat-to-our-eyes medieval-style painting is a lot more prevalent for a lot longer. Even then, change was gradual. The 1300s in Italy to the 1400s in the Netherlands to the early 1500s in Germany (previous sentence\u2019s linked pictures in order) show considerable change, even within the \u201cRenaissance\u201d period. There\u2019s also less competitive tower building, and less cultural cachet for the Pope Julius II, but those things may have happened in a different form anyway. Recall also that artistic movements are felt most by the upper classes, and the merchant/middle classes in urban areas. The average peasant in the <insert country here> countryside had no clue who all these great artists were. Low literacy rates also meant that all the great drama and poetry of the area wasn\u2019t as commonly consumed then as it is during English degrees now. Sure, attending a Shakespeare play* was a great unifier\u2026 if you lived in downtown London. The multiple-day buggy ride from Cornwall to London wasn\u2019t seen as a worthwhile price to pay to go see a play. Removing Renaissance-era political movements is probably impossible. History is a continuum. Events shape each other. Edward III, who took the English throne during the heyday of Petrarch, wasn\u2019t going to stop consolidating the English crown if Petrarch suddenly decided to stop writing poetry. The two men may have never even met anyone in common. Edward III was far more concerned with Italian bankers than with Italian poets.  Julius II: So culturally significant he has a TVTropes page. #2: Renaissance by Location The Renaissance where? Italy, Germany, the Low Countries, France, England? Elsewhere? Arguably, they were all so interconnected it would be tough to remove one without removing all the rest. That said, contemporaries in different countries commonly had no idea what each other were doing. Small communities based around cities or universities would trade ideas. Large-scale migration of ideas took longer. For an idea of how long it could take for ideas to travel back then, consider this ridiculously detailed timeline of English poetry, which notes the inauguration of the English sonnet in 1534. Sonnets had been written in Italian since the 1300s. If one Renaissance were removed, wouldn\u2019t the others fill the void? Let\u2019s say we remove the French Renaissance. Eventually, wouldn\u2019t surrounding Belgium, Germany and Italy have imported a few artists and thinkers? It may have simply started later rather than not happened, much as the sonnet took so long to travel from Italy to England. An example is the direct influence (Dutch) Desiderius Erasmus felt from (German) Martin Luther and Philip Melanchthon, even as he remained staunchly Catholic.  Desiderius Erasmus: A man who was so internationally prominent in education that, almost 500 years after his death, there\u2019s a biography of him on a site called Grade Saver. #3: Removing a Period Art versus politics, painting versus writing (and I didn\u2019t even discuss sculpture), Country A versus Country B: it\u2019s all complicated. Then, let\u2019s say we surgically remove the entire time in Europe from, say, 1336 (the publication of Petrarch\u2019s Virgil) until the first publication of the word \u201cRenaissance\u201d by Giorgio Vasari in 1550. These are haphazardly chosen dates based on only two of the hundreds of influential artists of the period. They are also over 200 years apart. In 1336 in Europe: The \u201cHundred Years\u2019 War\u201d hadn\u2019t started yet.The Black Death hadn\u2019t happened yet.The printing press hadn\u2019t been invented yet.The Reformation hadn\u2019t happened yet.No one had heard of anyone named \u201cMedici\u201d yet.The Reconquista was over 150 years away from completion. Of course, they didn\u2019t know that then.New World? What\u2019s a New World?The House of Habsburg hadn\u2019t yet achieved quasi-domination of the European continent. It was still over 100 years before the ascension of Frederick III. They also didn\u2019t know that was going to happen.The Byzantine Empire still existed. (!)Burgundy still existed. (!!)Proto-Russia had just started lifting the Mongol yoke.This is without even getting into the Low Countries, Scandinavia, Poland, Bohemia or Hungary. In 1550 in Europe, all of those points were drastically different. England had transitioned from infantry to navy power, the rebuilding of Europe after the Black Death had changed the economy forever, the printing press was a massive leap for literacy, the Reformation had forced the continent to re-examine itself on a religious and cultural level - and caused some political tiffs, the Grand Duchy of Tuscany existed, Spain was not only unified but also a dominion of the House of Habsburg, the New World was important, the House of Habsburg was situated to dominate Continental Eurpe, the Ottoman Empire was everywhere, Burgundy was more or less swallowed up into the Holy Roman Empire, and Ivan the Terrible was on the Russian throne. Sweden and especially Poland had emerged as European powers, Bohemia and Hungary were Habsburg dominions, and this list of changes in Europe from 1336\u20131550 could go on forever. Precisely how do you get from 1336 \u2192 1550 without some definition of the Renaissance happening?  Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor: Most powerful man in Europe at the close of the Renaissance, over half of his empire acquired during the Renaissance.  *Shakespeare was probably born after the Renaissance ended anyway.

            "answer_text": "As other person said the premise is impossible. But let assume that it happened. First scenario In essence for the Renaissance not happen in Europe, christianity did not happen in Europe. I\u00b4m not impliying Christ didn\u00b4t live and die and a religion was created, only that christianity was only another religion for the Romans and didn\u00b4t get more importance in the roman mind. The Roman empire fell, and the territories were taken by nordic tribes. As christianity wasn\u00b4t an accepted religions by nordic tribes, there were no reason to save Jerusalem. So there were no Crusades and no contact with the Arab countries and their knowledge. So the Dark Ages would extend for more time than what really took. Nordic languages, or Mongol Languages would prevail. Second scenario Let assume the Roman Empire didn\u00b4t fell For this to happen, the Romans were not defeated by outside tribes from the north. The african governments would take control of the jew territories, and eventually controlled by the Romans. But then it would happen something funny, there would not be a Dark Age or Middle Age. It would be a continuous growth of knowledge under the Roman Empire, because they adopt the new knowledge they come in touch with. So the knowledge from the arabs would have fall in Romans\u00b4 hands, including the Library of Alexandria and others. Eventually, they would have to create a more flexible government to control all the provinces to avoid raisings against the romans. Latin, Greek and some other languages be Official Third scenario Let assume the Romans were conquered by Egypt and Arab nations. Europe would be in contact with lost knowledge sooner that in reality happened. As the arab nations were more civilized than some others, the cities were preserved and the really important work of the romans would be preserved and enhanced. The gods statues were destroyed and Islam would be the only religion. There wouldn\u00b4t be a Dark Age or Middle Age, because there woldn\u00b4t be a lack of knowledge. Remember, these were hypothetical scenarios to comply with the given condition. ",

Unless \u2014 that\u2019s the only possibility it would not have happened \u2014 the Turks had completed the conquest of the Mediterranean rim and also marched past Austria and the Holy Roman Empire, all the way to the North Sea. That would have been such a disaster that European culture might have suffered a setback extensive and deep enough to delay its \u201cRenaissance\u201d for centuries to come. And it would be a very different Renaissance, of a very different Europe. The question is essentially impossible to answer. ",

The picture of Europe as a sinkhole of ignorance and barbarism after the fall of Rome and prior to some self-important scribbler like Petrarch is a myth promulgated by 18th century dilettantes such as Gibbon. No, not a myth; just a self-serving fairy tale. ",
