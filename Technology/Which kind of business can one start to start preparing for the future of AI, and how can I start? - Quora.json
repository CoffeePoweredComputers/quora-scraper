            "answer_text": "I do not mean to be harsh, but you are asking people to be modern day Nostradamus! For any new upcoming technology, there is absolutely no way of knowing anything about the future. That is the reason why there is a hype and burst. Each time, there is a new upcoming technology, people through kitchen sink at it and see what sticks. This is called hype. People who lead this are the entrepreneurs supported by investors. After this phase, there comes a point where the society only accepts few and rejects everything else. This is called bursts where people loose motivation and money. The second generation of hype will be more sustaining and wont be a mad rush. The reason why every technology goes through these phases is because no one knows how the society will react to the solutions that are supported by these new technologies. The only way to prepare yourself for such things is by being part of it and learning through these phases. This learning is very subjective and that is the reason why there are winners and losers in every hype and bursts. Hope it helps! ",
