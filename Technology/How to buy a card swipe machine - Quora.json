            "answer_text": "Open a bank account for the business which needs to accept payments through swiping. Discuss with them to provide the device, which will transfer funds from cardholders\u2019 accounts to your business\u2019s. There will  probably be many different schemes to select from on how you will be charged for this. There may be a temporal (annual or monthly) fee, and a charge based on the number and/or value of transactions made. They might waive the fee of their own cardholders, or have some other such understanding with you. ",
