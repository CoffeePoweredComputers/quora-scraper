            "answer_text": "See if the pilot light is lit if you have the non-electronic sort of pilot. If not, make sure the electronics sparks when the button is pushed. No pilot - make sure your gas supply is on (you\u2019ve paid your bill?) It can be turned off at the meter outside and probably along the pipe coming inside. If you don\u2019t know what to look for in a valve or whether it is on, get help. Try a pilot light restart; follow directions on the furnace. If the pilot doesn\u2019t start, at this point, consider - Do you feel lucky, punk? Well, do ya? If not, call your gas service or a licensed serviceman and hire an expert. The thermocouple is a metal bulb about 1/4\u2033 wide and 2\u2033 long with an attached copper thin tube leading to the gas valve/regulator and screwing into the body. Make sure the bulb is in the pilot flame when the pilot is lit; adjust to make it so if it isn\u2019t. If the pilot light goes out when the bypass button is released after being depressed for at least 30 seconds then the thermocouple may need replacing, particularly if it looks to be burned or broken at the bulb. A good average lifetime for a thermocouple is probably about 5 years. It\u2019s the easiest, cheapest thing to replace first; your hardware store will have them. (Of course, if you have the more modern sealed burner units type of H/W heater, then you are SOL unless you are willing to take your life/house/warrantee in your hands, and you are experienced with these sorts of things. Sorry.) If you have gas pressure at the regulator but the pilot cannot be lit, the valve/regulator body is probably plugged or faulty. It can usually be replaced with a universal replacement, but consult a salesman about your make/model off H/W heater or furnace. If it makes you scared or you don\u2019t understand what he tells you, get an expert to fix it for you. If none of that helps, you may need a new heater/furnace. There are also lots of other things that can be wrong that might require replacement as well, so it\u2019s time to admit that DIY isn\u2019t going to fix it. ",

            "answer_text": "This is a potentially dangerous situation if by chance unignited fuel is in the furnace. Quickly check the thermostat if the temperature is at the control point the heat just hasn\u2019t come on. If below the control point If possible turn off power to the furnace to prevent ignition. Any smell of gas evacuate the house and call the supplier from outside. I don\u2019t know if the thermostat should be turned below the room temperature to cut the power changing the setting might cause ignition. I once had a situation where the oil burner had been running a while and the house was getting colder. I went to check and it was running, no heat! I quickly turned off the power and called for help the repair man said the igniter had failed and an interlock had failed so fuel oil was pumped into the furnace and not burned and the igniter was trying to ignite every 20 seconds or so. The bad parts were replaced. [the repair man dismissed, vide infra.] I removed over a half gallon of oil by putting rags in the furnace and wringing them out. Then I went to the chemistry dept where I was a grad student and borrowed a 25 lb CO2 extinguisher. I lit the furnace and when it got too hot put the fire out with the CO2. It took a couple of hours to burn all the oil out and I almost used the entire extinguisher. Had that ignited with all the oil in there the house with the adjacent apartment might have burned down. BTW the repair man was going to burn the oil out without using the rags to remove most of the oil I made him check his extinguisher first it was almost empty. ",
