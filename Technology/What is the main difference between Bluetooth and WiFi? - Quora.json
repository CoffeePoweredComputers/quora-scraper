            "answer_text": "Wi-Fi has some similar applications to Bluetooth, such as setting up a network or printing and transferring files. It is also a wireless standard, but rather than being designed to communicate between devices, it serves to wirelessly connect devices to the internet or Ethernet networks such as a corporate local area network (LAN). Its range is quite a bit larger than the very short range within which Bluetooth devices communicate, as a Wi-Fi signal can be accessed up to 300 feet away. This means that a Wi-Fi-enabled device, such as a PC or smartphone, can connect to the internet wirelessly when in a Wi-Fi \"hotspot,\" or area in which a Wi-Fi signal may be accessed.
