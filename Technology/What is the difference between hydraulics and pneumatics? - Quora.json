            "answer_text": "Hydraulics use liquid (typically oil, but water sometimes) as a working fluid. Pneumatics use a gas (typically air) as the working fluid. Compressibility of working fluid - Because liquids are essentially incompressible, hydraulics can handle high loads quite stiffly. Also hydraulics are often used as a force multiplier, with a small diameter source piston and large diameter load piston, such as in a automobile jack or the brakes in your car. Pneumatics can be used this way, but are typically not, because the source stroke becomes a combination of moving the load and compressing the working fluid, making for a very long cumbersome stroke. Viscosity of working fluid - Because liquids are viscous they move through pipe and tubing relatively slowly compared to gasses. The viscous forces become dominant and have significant losses as moderate velocity. Therefore, hydraulics move relatively slowly and pneumatics can move pretty quickly. Pneumatics can also have a very controlled force (force proportional to pressure), regardless of stroke or load resistance. This feature is useful to avoid crushing, or to grip fragile items. Pneumatics are used in factory equipment (but are being replaced by electric actuators for maintenance and controlability) Hydraulics are typically used for high force, slow motion and where stiffness in position is necessary. Pneumatics are used for relatively lower forces, faster motion, and where stiffness is not necessary. Someone might argue that a pneumatic impact hammer or wrench generates high forces, but those peak forces come from a decelerating mass (hammer), not the pneumatic engine. ",

            "answer_text": "First of all Both pneumatics and hydraulic are applications of fluid power. Pneumatics uses an easily compressible gas such as air or a suitable pure gas while hydraulic uses relatively incompressible liquid media such as oil.t his is the main difference between pneumatic and hydraulics system other difference are Pneumatic system has generally low capacity of load moving than hydraulic systemThe leakage of oil or any liquid is happen in hydraulic where as this is not happen in pneumatic because of use of gas .In hydraulic system you need tank for reservoir of oil to draw oil to the system where as in pneumatic you can draw air from atmosphere.Application Pneumatic systems used extensively in industry are commonly powered by compressed air or compressed inert gases. A centrally located and electrically powered compressor powers cylinders, air motors, and other pneumatic devices. Pneumatics also has applications in dentistry, construction, mining, and other areas.Hydraulic systems are used widely in both industrial and mobile equipment. ... In motor vehicles, hydraulic are most commonly found in the application of brakes. The relatively small force exerted by the driver's foot on the pedal is transmitted through the fluid in a small piston.Pneumatic system is comparatively less efficient than hydraulic system.This are some of main difference between pneumatic and hydraulic system. I hope this helps . ",

Example of Hydraulics systems are: Jaws of life, dump truck lifts, water guns, forklifts, cranes, etc. Types of hydraulics- Some of the important types of fluids are: 1- Ideal fluids 2- Real fluids 3- Newtonian fluids 4- Non-newtonian fluids 5- Ideal plastic fluids Pneumatics: It is defined as a branch of fluid power in which gas is used as a fluid. Example of Pneumatics is- Air compressors and air brakes, HVAC control systems, Vacuum Pump, Sensor, switch, etc. The major difference between Hydraulics and Pneumatics are: 1- Hydraulics uses liquids like water or oil while pneumatics uses compressed gas like air 2- In hydraulics liquids are incompressible while in pneumatics gases are compressible 3- Hydraulic system are used for high force while the pneumatic system is used for relatively lower force. 4- The installation is complex in hydraulics while it is less complicated in pneumatics 5- In hydraulics the tank is used to store oil while in pneumatic the system can just draw air from the atmosphere.

            "answer_text": "In hydraulic systems you usually impose movement, which determines the applied force. This is a very controlled way to make something move. But eventually all hydraulic systems will leak oil. That can be a deal breaker in many environments (like food processing). In pneumatics you usually impose a force, resulting in a movement, depending on the resistance of the object, comparable with an elastic band. When the resistance is not constant, you can get crazy movements. Great advantage is that pneumatics do not create an electric field, make sparks, or leak oil, so they can be used in many sensitive environments. And in the end they are much cheaper of cause. ",

The characteristics of pneumatic systems generally are: low loads, not requiring a stiff action, and low frequencies, leaks do not make a mess, tanks holding pressurized air are dangerous. The characteristics of hydraulic systems are low, medium and high loads, can be feedback controlled, low to moderate (100 Hz) frequency response, precision linear or rotary control, stiff system response, oil leaks can be messy or even hazardous. Systems can be compact. ",

With oil, we can't afford to let it go waste like air. A liquid is incompressible. The hydraulic cylinders are designed accordingly. Gas/air is compressible. It can be compressed in a cylinder and suddenly released by a valve for a sudden brake. If you want to gradullay release, like in a clutch, the foot pedal valve has to be designed with special features. Because of its properties, oil can be released gradually (hence pressure applied or withdrawn gradually) without any special design valves. Air pipelines can rust due to moisture. This problem doesn't exist with oil. Oil systems are self lubricating, which Air systems are not capable of. V.Ramesh ",

            "answer_text": "The main basic difference between Pneumatic and Hydraulic system is, The working fluid in Pneumatic system is AIR and in hydraulic it is OILPneumatic wil be used for low pressure requirements, whereas hydraulic is used in case of more pressure requirements.Hydraulic system produces pressure exponentiallyApplication for Pneumatic system is , they are used for automatic closing and opening of bus doors .Application for hydraulic system: they are used in high capacity pressesWith above points , you can understand more about systems and frame few more differences ",

            "answer_text": "Hydraulics make more of a mess when they leak and pneumatics make a bigger noise when something breaks. Seriously though, hydraulics use an incompressible liquid (or sometimes slurry) and pneumatics use gas. Hydraulics give better control and higher pressures while pneumatics can generally provide higher speeds and less maintenance where control and very high forces are not needed. ",

Hydraulic drives have the advantage of transmiting great amount of power (pressure x flow) with rigid movements while allowing some buffering effect at the same time, on the other hand pneumatic drives have a very limited power transmision without erratic movements of the actuators .
