            "answer_text": "None of the existing models support 5G (unless you listen to AT&T tout a modest set of changes to LTE as \u201c5G\u201d, but that means \u201creal 5G\u201d on AT&T is going to get called something lame). That probably isn\u2019t a big deal because 5G doesn\u2019t bring much to most people. 5G is in theory faster then LTE, but guess what, LTE for most people isn\u2019t as fast as LTE \u201creally is\u201d. You get to share the cells bandwidth with tons of other people, and the backhaul from the cells towers to elsewhere is frequently a bottleneck. The same will happen with 5G. I\u2019m not saying 5G will be for sure the same speed as LTE, but in a lot of places it will. More over\u2026what do you do on your phone that would be faster if the network ran faster? Wait, let me rephrase that. In places where your cell network is running at full speed and not constrained by bandwidth from the cell tower to the backbone, or on the server side, or anywhere from the server to your phone except the one the air LTE part\u2026all of those times, how much difference would more speed make? That is what 5G can make better. Well, that is what \u201cnormal\u201d 5G makes better. 5G has some optional parts for \u201csuper low bandwidth super low power\u201d which if cell towers support it phones might use sometimes to make \u201cstandby\u201d power last longer (or they may not, I think it requires antennas tuned to new frequency bands). 5G also has some tiny cell modes for high bandwidth \u201cfixed wireless\u201d, which in theory a phone could use, but again it is on different frequencies. I think it also omits doppler compensation (so you can\u2019t move, or can\u2019t move much while using this mode). These modes are useful, but more to non-phones then to phones. I mean, sure if everything else is equal getting 5G is better than not getting 5G. If everything else is actually equal (battery usage, heat generation, price). Currently it isn\u2019t, and won\u2019t be for a while. So I wouldn\u2019t worry about 5G in phones for a while. ",

            "answer_text": "No iPhone supports 5g at present. And Apple has not revealed any plans how and when they intend to support 5G. If they do, it will be obvious that they will do that for all the iPhones that are released from a certain level on. Supporting 5G on a smartphone today really doesn't make a lot of sense. There is no broad support in terms of deployed networks. Unless you live in a neighborhood where 5G is already deployed, and 5g does give you the performance plus that you desperately need. Apple won't go down that route until it is a selling point for their products \u2014 which it isn't today. ",
