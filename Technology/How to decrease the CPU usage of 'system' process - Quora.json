Check for improvement by disabling Windows 10 features like Cortana and associated programs. Still no help? Right click on the process and select View Services. This should tell you what's causing the issue. Then Disable/Stop that Service(s). If nothing seems to be helping, run a complete virus scan using Avira Free(one of the best detection rates, while also being lightweight), and also, MalwareBytes Anti Malware. And if these didn't help, also try Spybot Search and Destroy. If all of this hasn't helped you by now, please take a backup of only your Most Important Files and re-format because I'm guessing by now, that this could be an issue with you \u201cupgrading\u201d to Windows 10 from either 7/8/8.1 and Windows 10 is re-indexing everything, causing you that pain. Hope that helps. Let me know. Cheers! :) ",
