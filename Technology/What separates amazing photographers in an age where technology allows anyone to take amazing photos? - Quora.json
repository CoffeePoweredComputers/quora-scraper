            "answer_text": "There are (at least) three main parts to making amazing photographs: Mastery of techniqueThe ability to un-see what our eyes and brain are telling us is thereRecognizing the presence of story.Technique For over a century, photography was first and foremost a craft. To convey a vision, a photographer had to master arcane details of exposure, focusing, materials, and chemistry. It\u2019s no accident that Ansel Adams was one of the great photographers of his time: He was a consummate technician and craftsman, coming up with key concepts such as the zone system for exposure, and books on developing and printing that are among the best ever written. While Adams also had a talented eye, most of what amazed people about his work was his complete mastery of and control over his medium. When you say, \u201cTechnology allows anyone to take amazing photos\u201d, what you are really saying is that many of the most challenging aspects of photographic craftsmanship have been automated. Today\u2019s cameras are basically photographic robots, and have been for so long that most people have forgotten how much they do for us. We have now reached the point where an iPhone 11 is doing about a trillion operations every time someone uses it to snap a picture. Specialized software and hardware is selecting out frames with the best focus and exposure in various parts of the photo, combining them together, and enhancing the resulting image based on deep learning about what makes for the most pleasing images. It even creates the illusion of professional lighting on demand. Post-processing is almost infinitely easier now, too, with digital capture. Software allows us to do things in seconds that took hours in the darkroom, or were simply impossible. Increasingly things like Photoshop deploy AI as well, for content aware selection and fill and other enhancements. The downside of this is that a lot of creative control is now in the hands of software, and you have to go back to simpler tools (such as a Leica M rangefinder) to learn about and take back creative control in key areas. There is a lot of technique that software doesn\u2019t replace, such as lighting, posing, composition, and design. One area seldom discussed, which is critical to making amazing photos, is composing and adjusting the final image in order to control the path the viewer\u2019s eye takes through the photograph. Humans don\u2019t see anything in a single moment; instead we build up our experience and perception of any scene through a set of eye movements. Next time you view a photograph, pay attention to where your eye goes: how does it enter the photo, what path does it take, and where does it end up? Is it drawn to the subject of the photograph, or does it get distracted by less significant elements? Does the eye stop, or does it keep moving? Can the viewer\u2019s eye exit the photo, or does it get trapped, making them feel uneasy or claustrophobic? No machine yet invented can adjust composition and the brightness of key elements to ensure that the image directs the eye in ways both pleasing and appropriate to its meaning. Un-Seeing The second ability, to un-see what we see, is fundamental to good photography. Our perception of the world is constructed by our neurology, and bears little resemblance to what the camera sees. Our brain sees in three dimensions, and it organizes its perception around objects, specifically objects of attention. Cameras generally produce two dimensional images, and they see light, not objects. Cameras don\u2019t care what you\u2019re photographing; they are just recording the light that falls on their sensors. Something that is absolutely fascinating to you, illuminated with lousy light, is going to look bad to the camera, and to the viewers of the resulting photographs. In addition, if you are too focused on the object you are photographing, you will miss the overall setting, and even miss key elements in the scene. The latter is how photobombs happen. Most photobombs come as a complete surprise to the photographer after the fact \u2014 they literally didn\u2019t see that goofy person looming behind their subject:  (Example edited slightly to make it more SFW. But you get the idea.) So much of really good photography requires you to set aside what your brain is telling you about a scene, and see things the way the camera will see them: un-seeing. Storytelling Finally, for certain types of photography, it\u2019s important to be sensitive to story. I frequently see a certain sort of street photography in which someone is, for example, walking down a street or looking at something in a shop. The frame is well composed and exposed, the person is fairly interesting looking or even a little quirky. Nonetheless, I have no idea what the photo is about. Imagine someone comes up to you and says, \u201cI want to tell you a story. There is a woman walking down the street. She has a funny hat. It\u2019s cloudy. The End.\u201d That\u2019s the kind of story a lot of photographs tell. The sensitivity to stories that can be told in a single moment is key to making certain kinds of amazing photographs. Let me give you an example from my own photography. A couple years ago I spotted a mother and her two children walking around the Haight Street Fair in San Francisco. There was just something about them and the way they were interacting, that told me there might be a story here. As I walked with my camera I kept an eye on them, and then this happened:  To me, this is a story about family relationships, and about the differences in how mothers relate to their sons and daughters. In this moment the daughter is the center of her mother\u2019s attention, emphasized by her presence in the light. The son is literally in the shadows, mother\u2019s back turned to him, his shoulders hunched, caught in a yawn that emphasizes his complete boredom and indifference to all this business of jewelry shopping. Now, I don\u2019t know anything about this family, or the actual nature of their relationships. All snapshots like this are to some degree fake. We impose our own meaning on moments like this, and another viewer may find a different story in it. My point, though, is that there is something going on in this photograph that tells us a story. The ability to recognize these moments depends on human intuition and insight into human psychology, and is not well suited (yet, at least) to machine learning in the same way that static composition is. Conclusion I really must disagree with the notion that these new technologies enable just anyone to take \u201camazing\u201d photos. More photos may be amazingly competent in a technical sense, because the tools have made those sorts of results accessible to so many people. But being competent is not the same thing as being amazing, for all the reasons I have described, and many more. What these new technologies have really done, is three things: They enable people for whom photography is just a form of social communications or memory making, to make and share competent photographs quickly and easilyThey make the creative side of photography accessible to people who were previously put off by the need to master older materials and toolsThey provide everyone willing to invest the time and energy with more and better tools to achieve new kinds of results.These are the most important contributions of new technology in photography.

            "answer_text": "Thanks, Robert. My take on this is perhaps different than some others. I\u2019ll take your supposition that current digital technology (camera plus editing software) at least make it a lot easier for the average, casual amateur photographer to \u2018take\u2019 amazing images. It\u2019s true. It used to be that, to take a great photo, you needed a SLR (film) camera, good lenses, and enough skill to know how the exposure triangle works, etc. You also needed to experiment a lot with film and since the results weren\u2019t instantaneous, it took a long time to get feedback, make adjustments, and improve. All of this took time and money; enough so that people who didn\u2019t want to make that effort just hired a professional to take their photos and called it good. Today the barrier for entry is much lower. You can see what you shoot immediately, adjust and improve. You can see other great work and learn from others with just a quick Google search. The \u201cAutomatic\u201d settings on DSLRS is pretty damn good for many situations. So the real question is, why aren\u2019t there more \u2018amazing\u2019 photographers? If you think about it, all of the tools and ease technology affords us should remove our excuses. We are less limited and constrained than ever before. Which brings us to the separation you reference in your question. What separates amazing photographers isn\u2019t the technology, really. If the playing field has been evened out, more or less, between the pros and non-pros, then what is left? I\u2019d submit that the best photographers share the following traits that the rest do not: They constantly push themselves to improve and learn; working on their craft constantly. They constantly evolve and avoid getting stuck in the same old way of doing things. They embrace new technology when it helps them achieve their goals and not when it doesn\u2019t. They get out there and actually shoot. They do the work whether it\u2019s paid work or personal work. They don\u2019t \u2018take\u2019 photos. They MAKE them. This is more than semantics. Any person with a good camera can take a great photograph of something that is inherently beautiful or interesting (hence the old adage: \u2018you want more interesting photos? Take pictures of more interesting stuff\u2019). That\u2019s when you \u2018take\u2019 a photo because you\u2019re just capturing what\u2019s in front of you. What takes real skill is to make or create a special image even in situations where others wouldn\u2019t be able to, wouldn\u2019t notice the potential, or have the patience or vision to do so. That\u2019s making an image. That, in a nutshell, is what separates amazing photographers from the rest. ",
