            "answer_text": "I would say no.  I know, the shiny, new model has a \"killer feature\" that you just have got to have...  Even then, though, the answer is still no.  Let me explain. I had an iPhone 4.  Then the 4S came out and it's killer feature was Siri.  I just *had* to have it!  Then, the iPhone 5 came along.  A little bigger screen, faster processor, but nothing far enough beyond my 4S that would blow my socks off, so I skipped it.  Along comes the 5S with the TouchID fingerprint scanner; I just *had* to have it.  iPhone 6 comes along with a truly \"large\" screen, and I just *had* to have it. Firmware (iOS) updates weren't even a consideration.  Apple generally provides the newest iOS to phones several generations old. With hindsight, if I had it to do over, would I do the same upgrades?  No.  Siri was so cool, but not ultimately as useful as I thought.  TouchID, like Siri, was so cool, but, again, not nearly as useful as I had imagined.  I would move from the 4 straight to the 6 Plus without the stops at 4S or 5S. I got tired of things that my phone \"ought\" to be able to do, but Apple had restricted in one way or another.  These days I moved over to Android.  When I got my Galaxy Note Edge, it was already \"last year's model\" and the new Galaxy S6 line was out, but I sought it out, specifically, for the \"edge.\"  Great phone, by the way, and the right move for *me*. With my lessons learned regarding hype vs actual usefulness - some pretty pricey lessons at that - I'll be holding onto my Edge until Samsung/AT&T stop providing Andoid updates for it.  It is in line to get Android Marshmallow, so I'm good for at least another year, maybe two. I feel like I could do a dissertation on the relative merits and pitfalls of Apple iOS vs Google Android, but that will have to keep for some other time in a different Quora answer. ",

            "answer_text": "Why do we feel like buying a new smartphone every year? We know very well that any new features are not going to affect us in any major way. That the phone that we already have is sufficing all our current needs. Yet a new smartphone seems like a necessity. The reason is very simple. We live in a society that forces us to stay updated with the latest trends, gadgets etc. Anyone who doesn\u2019t conform to these ever changing \u2018standards\u2019 is looked down upon. To avoid we try to stay updated because that\u2019s the only way to stay relevant and get validation. This constant need for validation is what gets exploited by multi-national companies trying to sell us their new products. They know the moment they launch a product with a new feature, people are going to jump on it. And hence they fuel this need of ours all the time. Our desires make for a very profitable business and it\u2019s high we all realize this. Watch this talk which explains this phenomenon very well.  ",
