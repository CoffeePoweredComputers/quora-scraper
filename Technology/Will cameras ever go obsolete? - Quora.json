            "answer_text": "TLDR Stand alone cameras, for all but the most extreme use cases, will go obsolete. For quite a while into the future professionals at the cutting edge are going to require purpose built, dedicated devices for filming and shooting cutting edge images, so currently they have things like Red cameras for video and the EOS-1D X Mark II for still images as well as various specialist cameras for hi tech and scientific work. Over time the features of these high end devices will find their way into consumer products, smartphones and their future descendants. Eventually you could reach the point where almost no one has a device which is only a camera, but even then I can imagine there will be a few special cases where a dedicated, essentially custom cameras is required, even if it\u2019s only an ever bigger and more specialist telescope in space. To a large extent the idea of a stand alone camera for consumers at least and soon maybe hobbyists too is already becoming obsolete, and companies have gone bankrupt because of it already. Compact cameras in particular probably have their years numbered in low digits. ",
