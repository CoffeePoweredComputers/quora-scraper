            "answer_text": " 2Challenges in Health Care Delivery for Patients with Serious and Complex Medical Conditions As the paradigm for health has shifted in focus away from acute care interventions and reducing deaths, a new model of health care delivery has emerged. This model emphasizes the provision of ongoing care to sustain life at the highest level of quality possible, proactive interventions to prevent the development of further problems, and intermittent medical interventions to address acute exacerbation of illness and disability. These efforts are accompanied by services to support and sustain individuals' physical, social, and mental health and well-being. As noted by the Institute of Medicine: \"To accommodate the changing needs of an increasingly older society we must broaden the traditional goals of health\u2014curing disease and preventing its occurrence\u2014to include preventing the ill from becoming disabled and helping the disabled cope with and prevent further disability\" (Institute of Medicine, 1999). Rising health care costs, rising consumer expectations, and national efforts to ensure access to care and improve and sustain the quality of health care in the United States are all contributing factors to the need for changes in the traditional health care delivery system. This chapter briefly reviews issues considered by the committee to have relevance to the implementation of regulations concerning patients with serious and complex medical conditions. An in-depth analysis of these issues is beyond both the charge to this committee and the scope of this report. The committee feels, however, that it is critical to recognize the dual roles of HCFA in implementation of regulations for the Medicare+Choice program. First, HCFA is charged with ensuring that patients with serious and complex medical conditions have access to requisite services that will benefit their overall health, well-being, and quality of life. Second, HCFA must be mindful of the need to regulate the costs of care for this patient population to ensure the affordability of the Medicare+Choice program. ",
