            "answer_text": "Currently we do not know. However, if running a simulation with the complexity of the observed universe in our Universe (or a more complex one) is physically possible and cheap enough, then one such simulation almost certainly exists somewhere already in our Universe. We do not run such a simulation yet, but another advanced Alien civilisation or AI might, and if one such civilisation can do it, likely many can. Our Universe as we think it exists is very big indeed, so if this is the case, then there are likely a large number of simulated universes in our Universe running right now. In these simulations, a universe as complex as our own is being simulated. If it runs long enough, many civilisations will develop inside it and will eventually run their own simulations. These simulations will do the same thing on and on. The inescapable implication is that in this case, there would be many orders of magnitude more simulated universes inside every universe. Therefore, it is overwhelmingly likely that we are being run in a simulation right now rather than a \u201creal\u201d universe. If this is true, the simulation we run in is of tremendous quality, but maybe we can eventually spot simulation artefacts like \u201cpixels\u201d if you want. If this is possible to spot these, maybe we\u2019ll know for sure one day. Maybe this is the objective of the beings that are running us, who knows. Maybe then they would stop the simulation. In the meantime, try to wrap your head around these concepts :-) For the record, I don\u2019t think the above is possible, but I\u2019m not certain. ",

            "answer_text": "The separation of human and machine intelligence is not clear, and this greatly complicates the question of the emergence of a truly artificial intelligence. I believe that more than anything we are merging with our machines, and that they are increasingly using us as much as we are using them. We seem to be part of one planetary system of increasingly intelligent complexity with many modes of expression. The evolution of intelligence on Earth is being goosed right now by our close and intense co-evolution, and co-cognition, with machines. So, yes, super-intelligent AI exists - and we are an integral part of it. The probability is that before long our comparatively limited cognitive capacity (slow neural signaling and space-constrained neural networks) will be outstripped by computers. But not yet\u2026 The real question I see is what will AI \u201cwant\u201d and when will those motives outstrip our own. And can AI, though far beyond our processing capacity, still be bent to human desires - including the desire to defeat other human groups? Unfortunately, it may be that we will have to depend on the notion that war, inequality, and ecological destruction are not ultimately rational and thus will not be enabled by the \u201cgreater\u201d intelligences that we create. Given the current state and direction of world politics and our collective reaction to ecological and climate crises, I am tempted to place more confidence in a hyper-rational AI to safeguard our planetary future!
