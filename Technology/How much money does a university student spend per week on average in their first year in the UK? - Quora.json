Take the bus/train daily? I didn't go on nights out half as much as some of my friends did. Where some people would spend \u00a350\u2013200 on a night out two to four times a week, I would spend near \u00a350 on a night out every month or so. Then there's food shopping - I personally spent between \u00a315 and \u00a330 a week depending on how greedy I was. The biggest money waste for me in first year was coffee. \u00a32\u20133 a cup, multiple times a day, five days a week. Adds up fast. You can have a great time at university and spend hardly anything. Just be conscious of the things you pay for and ask yourself if it's really worth it. You can also still be social and not blow all your money. ",
