            "answer_text": "There is a new phone that is being launched in the market every week nowadays leading to a plethora of options being available for the consumers. While it at times can get extremely overwhelming for someone to be able to choose a smartphone out of so many options, it is also on the other hand, better to have options to choose from. Whenever someone mentions \u201cfast smartphone\u201d, it directly/indirectly points towards the processor of the phone. The quality of the processor that is integrated in a phone is directly proportional to the performance of the phone. Based on the phones that have been released, I think it wouldn\u2019t be wrong to suggest Oppo Reno 3 5G to be the fastest of all.  The phone is powered by a Dimensity chipset and this itself is a good enough reason to believe why and how this phone is considered to be the fastest smartphone on the market. MediaTek has been on a roll with its Dimensity chipset series and while they have successfully catered to the making the performance of the chipsets to be top-notch, it also catered to the affordability aspect of it. With MediaTek Dimensity chipsets, one need not burn a hole in their pocket to be able to own a 5G enabled smartphone.

            "answer_text": "When you hear the word \u201cfast\u201d in terms of a smartphone or any technology gadget, our mind is immediately directed towards the processor. The speed of any device is measured by how efficient it is and that parameter is directly proportional to the processing power of the hardware. The smoother it works, the faster it is. Among the fastest processors to exists in 2020 are Apple A13 Bionic, Qualcomm Snapdragon 865 Plus, Qualcomm Snapdragon 865, Apple A12 Bionic, HiSilicon Kirin 990, Samsung Exynos 990, Qualcomm Snapdragon 855 Plus and Qualcomm Snapdragon 855 to name the top ones. Any phone with these processors is likely to be counted as one of the fastest devices in the category. However, there\u2019s something missing in the above list and that is the MediaTek Dimensity 5G processors which have been launched by the chipset manufacturer and quite a few phones have been launched in China, but they do not seem to be reaching the rest of the world. Since the launch of Oppo Reno 3 5G in China, Indians have been long awaiting the launch of this smartphone powered by the MediaTek Dimensity 1000L chip and that has helped it nab a score of 407340 on AnTuTu benchmark score.  After the phone was recently launched, there was a lot of noise about how MediaTek Dimensity powered Oppo Reno 3 5G was breaking all records and beating the competition. https://www.gizmochina.com/2019/11/26/mediatek-dimensity-1000-scores-over-500k-points-on-antutu/ MediaTek Dimensity 1000L beats phones with Snapdragon 765G, Kirin 810 on AnTuTu, again MediaTek's Dimensity 1000 5G SoC beats Snapdragon 855 Plus and Kirin 990 in leaked AnTuTu benchmarks  Hence, the MediaTek Dimensity 1000 & 1000+ do bring a certain amount of \u201cfast\u201d element on the table and I am quite hopeful that with more phones launching with the Dimensity series chips, the list of the fastest smartphones would also include more products from MediaTek\u2019s 5G range. And the latest expansion of the Dimensity series will make its place both in the mid-range as well as the premium-range categories. Some examples of how MediaTek\u2019s 5G chips are making it up the ladder are: https://www.gizmochina.com/2020/07/31/realme-v5-with-dimensity-720-benchmarked-on-antutu-pricing-leaked/#:~:text=The%20Dimensity%20720%20is%20MediaTek's,Realme%20V5%20recorded%20301%2C380%20score https://www.gizmochina.com/2020/05/20/dimensity-820-beats-snapdragon-765g-antutu/ Realme V5 vs Realme X50 \u2013 Mediatek Dimensity 720 vs Snapdragon 765G AnTuTu Benchmarks Hence, as soon as the market gets flooded with these smartphones, things are going to change in terms of who makes their way to the \u201cfastest\u201d list. P.S: This isn\u2019t wishful thinking. This is the support of an underdog. ",

The Apple 11 Pro Max, gives the user the same smooth and efficient A13 Bionic chip that powers the other Pro iPhone, but with a stunning 6.5-inch XDR resolution display. The screen in the size allows for better cooling of the A13 chip inside the iPhone 11 Pro Max and that helps in ensuring top performance hours after hours. The bigger size of the Max also allows for a bigger battery that can easily last for one whole day even with heavy usage. Samsung Galaxy S20 UltraThe Samsung Galaxy S20 Ultra grabbed eyeballs with its 100x zoom but that is not its only worthy feature. There are many in it. It is an extremely fast phone. The Samsung flagship not only has a massive 12GB of RAM but it also has Samsung\u2019s latest Exynos 990 octa-core processor with a speed of up to 2.7GHz.

After all, OnePlus is fond of saying the focus for all OnePlus devices is speed. Inside the phone, users will find 12GB of RAM paired with Qualcomm powerful Snapdragon 855 processor. But largely the speed is a result of two things: an extremely fast UFS 3.0 storage and optimized Oxygen OS.

            "answer_text": "The speed of a smartphone certainly depends a lot on the processor it contains but the RAM and the other factors too matter a great deal. Most importantly, while a new smartphone seems to be working well enough in terms of its speed, as it grows old, the speed of the smartphone goes down. You have the same processor, same RAM and similar every hardware, but there are some differences that occur in the software due to upcoming updates and there are many environmental factors too which hamper with the speed of the smartphone. If you look around in the market currently, there is a plethora of amazing smartphones out there. The newest ones from Apple with Bionic A13 seem to be the fastest while those from OnePlus in the new 8 series also seem to be good enough. However, as far as my personal opinion is concerned, I would not go with any of these.  First of all, I am an Android person so iOS is not my game and preferably, I would never ever wish to have an iPhone, even if they offer it at a 90 percent discount. I feel Android is far better in its operation and it actually a good OS for most of the users with its ease of usage. When it comes to Android, people generally run after brand names and would suggest getting something like Samsung Galaxy S20 Ultra which costs almost 100k in India with Exynos 990 processor. And this is the same brand obsession of the people which has made Samsung increase the cost of this smartphone to a level that not many of the buyers would reach the point. If not Samsung, people would definitely suggest going for OnePlus 8 series which has Snapdragon 865. However, I feel this is also not a good choice for a fast smartphone as while Snapdragon 865 is not at all a worthy processor, even OnePlus has kept the price of the smartphone way too high and not that it has some features which would make you jump out of joy after spending a huge amount of money.  Talking about Snapdragon 865, I came to know that it faces a lot of troubles in the smartphone and apart from the heating and battery draining troubles, the 4G network in the smartphone has been made worse too. In short, the connectivity and the heating troubles associated with Snapdragon 865 are definitely a no-no at a high cost and I think a smartphone with even this chipset would not be a good choice. So better than all these, I think you can go for Oppo Reno 3 5G variant if it is available in your part of the world and even better than it would be IQOO Z1. Oppo Reno 3 5g variant comes with MediaTek Dimensity 1000L processor and currently, it has been launched only some parts of the world. I feel the MediaTek Dimensity processors are actually quite good in performance and are worth the money that take.  A smartphone with MediaTek Dimensity 1000L chipset would be in a mid-range segment and would not cost you something more than a smartphone with Snapdragon 730 processor. However, the performance of this Mediatek chipset and the smartphone is said to be much better. But even better in the segment is IQOO Z1 which is again a mid-range smartphone even after having a flagship MediaTek Dimensity 1000 Plus chipset in it, This smartphone is about to be launched in India and is expected something between 25k and 30k in India. However, the cost of this smartphone is way less than the power it promises because MediaTek Dimensity 1000 Plus is way faster, economic, battery -efficient and has a better connectivity than the Snapdragon 865 chipset.   So if you are planning to buy a smartphone, I would suggest you to go for IQOO Z1 which is supposed to be the fastest smartphone at a much lower price than most of the brands that offer you nothing at the high cost.

From having keypads to completely being touch screens - mobile phones have definitely come a long way. Today, almost any activity is possible with a smartphone. There is hardly any aspect that cannot be undertaken with the functions integrated within the device. Life for us has become significantly smoother and easier with these smartphones. Although there are a huge number of devices available in the market - I think the fastest smartphone is not that easy to settle on. At the moment based on the devices that have been released I think it could be Oppo Reno 3 5G which was recently launched in China. Although it is expected to arrive in India - no date has been finalized as of yet.  Specifications and Features of the Oppo Reno 3 5G It has a 6.40 - inch display with a resolution of 1080*2400 pixelsIt is run by MediaTek Dimensity 1000L processor which is 5G powered.It weighs 181g and its dimensions are 160.3*74.3*8 mmIt has two variants - 8 GB RAM and 128 GB internal storage and 12 GB RAM and 128 internal storage.It has a quad rear camera with the specs of 64 MP + 8 MP + 2 MP + 2 MPIt has a 32 MP front cameraThe battery power is 4225 mAh and supports 30W fast charging (50% battery charged in 20 mins as advertised)It supports WLAN, Bluetooth, GPS, NFC,Radio and USB.Available in White, Black, Starry Night Blue and Sunrise colours.I would also like to talk about the 5G powered chipset - Mediatek Dimensity 1000L that has been integrated in this smartphone and on the basis of which it has become one of the fastest smartphones at the moment. Personally Dimensity 1000+ should be the faster chipset compared to this but I chose the former because it has been released with a device in the market while the smartphones integrated with Dimensity 1000+ are upcoming.  Specifications of the Dimensity 1000L MediaTek Dimensity 1000L - CPU - Octa Core 4x Arm Cortex-A77 clocked @2.2 GHz. 4x Arm Cortex-A55 clocked @2.0 GHz. GPU - Mali G77 MC9. Supports Fast charging.MediaTek Dimensity 1000L - Dual 32 MP + 32 MP or single 80MP. Video - 4k Ultra HD, H.265(HEVC), H.264(AVC),VP8, VP9.MediaTek Dimensity 1000L can have upto 16 GB of LPDDR4X RAM in a dual-channel manner with a max frequency of 2133 MHz.MediaTek Dimensity 1000L comes integrated with the Hyper Engine Gaming technology. It makes the device capable of supporting any level or kind of intense mobile games like Fortnite, PubG, Asphalt.etc. with extreme ease and efficiency. This technology connectivity enhancements as well as boosted clock speed for faster and better performance.This in my opinion is the fastest smartphone available in the market. It is 5G powered and has a reliable and efficient processor. Moreover, it is also affordable which makes this an accessible device for a larger number of consumers. There are obviously other processors which perform at par or even better than Dimensity 1000L (case in point : Dimensity 1000+), but I chose this because of market release as fore mentioned. Once released - there is no doubt that Dimensity 1000+ integrated phone will be the fastest smartphone. (Source : GSMArena) ",

            "answer_text": "Over the years and through innumerable technological advancements in the world, our way of living has evolved eventually to achieve what millennials might conceive today as drastic. Smartphones are to be clubbed in the pile of the most important of those advancements. And we have come a long, long way from the initial prototypes. Now, settling for the fastest smartphone in the market is a tough decision, seeing how a smartphone\u2019s speed largely depends on the processor it is powered by but at the same time the RAM and many other factors also matter a great deal. Most importantly, it should be noted that more often than not while a new smartphone seems to be working well enough in terms of its speed, as it grows old the speed of the smartphone goes down gradually. It maybe so that the processor chip, RAM and everything is working well but then some alterations in the software due to upcoming updates and even a lot of environmental factors can quite easily hamper the speed of the smartphone. If you look around in the market currently, there are a plethora of amazing smartphones out there. If you are an iOS person then the latest ones from Apple with Bionic A13 could be your answer for the fastest phone while there\u2019s also those from OnePlus in the new 8 series which seem just as good. While it is not easy to pick one, at the moment based on the devices that have been released or have been announced to, the Oppo Reno3 5G could well be the fastest smartphone in the competition. Although it\u2019s not fast enough for the Indian market as its launch date is still expected by probably next month, it was recently launched in China. The yet to be launched Oppo Reno3 5G variant comes with MediaTek Dimensity 1000L processor and currently, it has been launched only in some parts of the world. The MediaTek Dimensity processors have been garnering praises from all sources and to bet your money on a smartphone backed by it would not be too far-fetched. As far as the price goes, very clearly a smartphone with MediaTek Dimensity 1000L chipset would be in a mid-range segment which is quite reasonable compared to other brands. It would also not cost you anything more than a smartphone with a Snapdragon 730 processor would. In the end, it all boils down to the performance of the device in which case, the MediaTek chipset and the smartphone is said to be much better. Apart from the Oppo Reno3 5G you could also go for the Vivo IQOO Z1, which also belongs in the mid-ranger segment of the market even after possessing a flagship MediaTek Dimensity 1000 Plus chipset in it. This smartphone is expected to be launched in India by the end of July and is being priced something between 25k and 30k which is way less than the power it promises. The MediaTek Dimensity 1000 Plus is way faster, economic, battery -efficient and has a way better connectivity than the Snapdragon 865 chipset for its market price. So, either between the Oppo Reno3 5G and the Vivo IQOO Z1 could be the best bet for the fastest smartphone in the market, more advantageously at a much lower price than most brands offer, even with much lower standards for their products.

            "answer_text": "A good smartphone according to me is the one that works fast, that has a high capacity RAM, more storage capacity and a camera that can click high-quality pictures. Above everything, I would prefer a smartphone that has all these qualities within my budget. I assume that most of the users have the same answer for choosing a smartphone of their choice. Today, in the market, there are multiple alternatives to smartphones for users; most of the ones are in low budgets which attracts the people. But here the question arises; does all the low budget smartphones consist of all the necessary features and specifications like speed, battery, camera, etc.? In my opinion, the Redmi Note 8 Pro is one of the best phones in the market right now. This smartphone has all the features that a normal person requires on their phone and also in budget. It is priced at Rs 15,999 and it is completely worth its price. It does not disappoint you in battery life, in processor speed, storage, or even in gaming.  The Redmi Note 8 Pro is powered by the MediaTek Helio G90T which is a gaming processor. It is very capable and can play most gaming titles out there on the play store. There are three variants of the Redmi Note 8 Pro, 6GB RAM with 64GB storage, 6GB RAM with 128GB storage, and 8GB RAM with 128GB storage. It uses UFS 2.1 for storage and has a dedicated card slot for storage expansion. To boost the mobile gaming experience, the Helio G90 use the HyperEngine game technology that includes a networking engine to optimize the connection between the smartphone and its cellular network. MediaTek ensures that the engine can offer up to a 50 percent faster response than competing solutions in a crowded network environment. The Redmi Note 8 Pro comes with MIUI 10 running on top of Android 9 Pie. It comes preinstalled with a few apps that are capable of generating spam notifications. The Redmi Note 8 Pro packs in a 4,500mAh battery that helps the device deliver good battery life. Xiaomi has also bundled an 18W charger with the device. The Redmi Note 8 Pro packs a triple camera setup at the back and clicks some good shots in different lighting conditions. We found low-light video performance to be sub-par. Apart from offering game-focused features, the MediaTek Helio G90 supports a night shot mode and works with a multi-camera framework supporting multiple lens choices. The smartphone is available in 2 other variants like 6GB RAM + 128GB Storage, 8GB RAM + 128GB Storage with color options like Electric Blue, Forest Green, Gamma Green, Halo White, Pearl White, Shadow Black, and Cosmic Purple. Redmi Note 8 Pro price in India starts from \u20b9 15,999. The lowest price of Redmi Note 8 Pro is \u20b9 15,999 at Amazon. ",

It\u2019s obvious that phones get faster year by year. So the universal answer to this question mostly depends on the manufacturer and the model line. Apple, Samsung, and Google are the top three manufacturers that put the fastest processors in their respective flagship phones. Apple\u2019s iPhone, Samsung\u2019s Galaxy S/Galaxy Note, and Google\u2019s Pixel are the fastest smartphone models. Unless these companies get BlackBerry\u2019s or Nokia\u2019s faith, their flagships will be the fastest each year for the near future. ",

The tests not only open specific apps but also runs the apps then it runs read and write speeds, number crunching, video playback without frame drops allowed and other tests.

            "answer_text": "There are various smartphones in the market that has released in 2020 with great features. I think the best smartphone is the one with gaming processor and that too in an affordable price. The phone is worth buying in under 20k price range. It is available in three variants- the 6GB RAM with 64GB storage, 6GB RAM with 128GB storage and 8GB RAM with 128GB storage. The 6GB RAM variant is priced at Rs 15,999, while the 6GB RAM with 128GB storage is for Rs 17,499. The top variant is for 18,999. According to me, the Xiaomi Redmi Note 8 Pro is one of the best smartphone in the market as of now. It is affordable and is in a mid-range budget segment. It is a gaming smartphone with MediaTek gaming processor.  Starting with its display, it features 6.53-inch screen and a water drop notch that houses the selfie camera. The display also has support for HDR. It has a glass back that is made out of Corning Gorilla Glass 5. The Redmi Note 8 pro also has an IR Blaster at the top which can be used to control other IR-based appliances. The Redmi Note 8 Pro is powered by the MediaTek Helio G90T which is a gaming processor. The processor gives a long gaming experience without latency or heating issues. The phone packs a 4,500mAh battery that also gives a good performance. Connectivity options on the Redmi Note 8 Pro include Bluetooth 5, Wi-Fi 802.11ac, dual 4G VoLTE, and four navigation systems. Xiaomi also mentions that the Redmi Note 8 Pro has a self-cleaning speaker which plays a low-frequency tone to try to eject dust. As far as the cameras are concerned, the Redmi Note 8 Pro packs a 64MP primary sensor with an f/1.79 aperture and 0.8-micron pixels. This sensor takes 16MP shots in the default mode as is does 4-in-1 pixel binning. The second sensor in the array is an 8MP ultra-wide-angle camera with an f/2.2 aperture and a 120-degree field of view. Xiaomi has also added a 2MP macro camera. The fourth sensor is a 2MP depth sensor. At the front, this phone has a 20MP selfie shooter.  Photos shot with the Redmi Note 8 Pro in daylight were sharp and had good detail, which was evident on zooming in. The camera enables HDR automatically for bright scenes and does a good job at getting the exposure right. Shots taken with the wide-angle camera offered a wider field of view but lacked detail compared to the primary sensor. Overall, in a nutshell, this smartphone is a good buy and in this budget under 20,000, you get a MediaTek G90T gaming processor and a good powerful battery. ",

All of them are faster than other phones but the 5G version is obviously the fastest once they build the network to support it. Although it will be available for the time being only in UK and Finland. The regular 7 won\u2019t be available in the US. So for Americans and for the rest of the world I would recommend the second best option, OnePlus 7 Pro. It comes with three options of memory, 6/128GB, 8/256GB and 12/256GB which are priced at 669, 699 and 749$. Only the midtier option (8/256GB, 699$) will be available in the US, sold exclusively by T-Mobile. The rest are sold through OnePlus\u2019 website as unlocked, compatible with AT&T, T-Mobile and Verizon. ",

You may think of iPhone 6S to be the leader but the SE has a smaller display and hence, the graphics loading and DPI processing is slightly faster on it than the 6S, where display is larger. Do note that both use the same chipset, Apple's A9 chip with 2GB RAM. In Android, I think the LG G5 and the OnePlus 3 should be the among the fastest devices. ",
