            "answer_text": "As I understand industry 4 is about automation. In lay man terms we want to insert a brain into every machine and tool and connect them so that human intervention is minimized on the shop floor. Countries like Germany, Japan and US are likely to move into this. In India we are not likely to see this happen in near future. First we don't have such production facilities with scale of production justifying automation. Then we don't have the capital for this. So the effect on us will be from competition of products made abroad in the industry 4 factories. ",
