            "answer_text": "At this point, the time and the cost for space travel is high. It is possible using the rockets and fuel which is more time consuming. So the scientists are planning to reduce the excessive weight of the fuel and rocket every shuttle has to carry with. This is possible eliminating these rockets and replacing it with a laser gun located on the Earth, and hitting it towards the shuttle, results, the explosion will push the space shuttle into space and we can travel 20% of the speed of light. This is just a concept and not sure when would it be implemented in real. These days, scientists are focusing on plasma rockets which are faster than the rockets which creates thrust by burning the fuel. You can refer below mentioned link as well.
