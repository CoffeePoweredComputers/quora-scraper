            "answer_text": "The point of a hybrid electric vehicle (HEV) is to make a gasoline car that is more efficient. It does that by capturing energy that would otherwise be wasted as heat when the car brakes either to stop, or to moderate speed going downhill. In an HEV some of that energy is used to generate electricity that charges a battery. The recovered energy is used to drive an electric motor to help the car go back uphill and to accelerate. An HEV is a gasoline car, pure and simple. Now there are plug-in hybrids that are the same as HEV except that the battery is bigger, and you can charge it separately. These typically don\u2019t go very far on pure electricity, but some are better than others. I drove a Prius for 12 years and I appreciated the fuel savings. I don\u2019t think there was a practical battery electric vehicle (BEV) in 2004 when I bought my first Prius. The advantage of the HEV over the BEV is cost and speed of fueling. Batteries a expensive and BEVs have big batteries compared to hybrids. You can fuel an HEV in a few minutes, but a BEV might take 15 minutes to a lot longer depending on the model. Also an HEV will travel farther without refueling than a BEV. In all other respects, the BEV is superior. I\u2019ve driven both and I never want to have another gasoline car again. Electric is so much simpler. My Teslas go 200\u2013300 miles in a charge, and I must plug in at home. No more trips to the gas station and no more oil changes. Hybrid electric vehicles are a technology designed to make gasoline cars more efficient in the interim until BEV\u2019s come down enough in price to replace them. ",

            "answer_text": "I have seen many roughly similar questions, and many praising the wonders of electric cars. however I do think that many of these Quora questionners and respondents are failing to take into account the simple fact that tens, if not hundreds of millions of the world\u2019s inhabitants do not live near possible charging points, do not in fact have reliable power at all, and in many case have no access whatsoever to any form of mains supply. So while is is fine for wealthy inhabitants of California and Norway to praise their costly EV\u2019s, while gratefully accepting handouts to subsidise the cost, the average inhabitant of Bhutan, Mongolia, and Tibet would find a Tesla completely useless after a few days and be forced to search for a Yak to drag it back to the nearest power point where it would probably take several days to re-charge. So, while in many places electric cars may be one sort of future, in many others they are not. Hybrid cars may however be a stepping stone and can certainly be of use in more places than pure electric ones. Which yurt houses the Tesla?  ",
