            "answer_text": "Almost every one knows about software development and the availability and growth path in that industry for over more than 30 years now. The IT Infrastructure Services role was not so well known a decade ago. Recently with the slowing down and recession globally software development has reached a leveled growth. Under such circumstances two new fields opened up, The Business Process Outsourcing and IT Infrastructure Services. What is IT Infrastructure Services. While Indian software engineers were building and maintaining the code for MNCs all over the world, working on the offshore model, the actual implementation and management of application was still in the hands of direct hires on-site which consisted of Admin for Operating Systems eg Unix and Windows, Network Admin, Database Admin, Production Support Techies as well as Change Management and Enterprise Server Management professionals. Slowly Indian IT companies showed their service delivery capabilities by taking over these Admin tasks for Development and QA Servers. As they won the trust of the clients Indian IT Companies opened up fiercely to take the entire Infrastructure Services in a storm. The various technologies available are. Operation System Admins - Unix, Linus, WindowsDatabase Admins - DB2, Oracle, MS SQL Server, Mongo, etcMail Services Admins - Lotus Notes, OutlookSharepoint AdminsTIBCO Support and AdminsBMC and Remedy Approvers and Event ManagementTivoli and other Production and Server Management ServicesNetwork SecurityProvisioning, Budgeting and Resource PlanningSome benefits of IT Infrastructure Services One of the biggest advantage with this service profiles is that the life cycles are always more than a year and clients generally do not change service providers unless there are major cost benefits. The margins per head in infrastructure services may be lower but one can employ more resources and bill higher.Client does not expect high qualifications of the resources for these services and non-graduates can be employed if they are properly trained and perhaps certified.The job profile does not require high creative and analytical skills as required from software developers. People in these roles can expect to work without much pressure.There is quite a lot room to grow in this type of servicesKeeping the above points in mind, we foresee that the services can provide employment to a huge number of IT Engineers who do not like coding.

If we go back in 2018 or even the start of 2019, no single soul might have predicted the pandemic that we are currently in the middle of, and which has caused drastic effects on the global economy. Companies and organizations had to develop and adapt to online platforms overnight, metaphorically speaking to keep up and make sure they stay afloat in these trying times. This serves the same point i\u2019m trying to make, you need a good IT base to stay on top of your game.
