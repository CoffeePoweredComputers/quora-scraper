            "answer_text": "From what I've read, nanotechnology involves many subsets of science, especially chemistry and physics. Since nanotech operates on a tiny scale, a good knowledge of quantum mechanics is important to predict behavior and generate viable designs. Knowledge of the chemical nature of the materials making up the nanotech is also important (materials science). Thermodynamics and heat transfer are also important in order to create stable designs that function without overheating or interfering with other components in applications. Of course, a good command of mathematics and knowledge of computer science are integral to effectively employing any of the ideas above. ",
