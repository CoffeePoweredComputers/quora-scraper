            "answer_text": "Apple could in theory buy all of Samsung\u2019s stock which is buying Samsung (although as a practical matter this tends to drive prices up so that isn\u2019t really how it is normally done). However that is the financial side. Legally large companies tend to have to show they aren\u2019t creating an anti-competitive environment. Like in the USA car companies are generally not allowed to buy each other, but if one were going bankrupt another would probably be allowed to buy the ashes. Here Apple would need to convince the US and South Korean government that buying Samsung won\u2019t reduce the competition in say mobile phones. They might be allowed to slice off the phone part of either company and sell it. Governments may also have lanes against foreign ownership that might apply. Governments tend to have laws about strategic sectors. Airplanes, steel, large scale manufacturing. Apple doesn\u2019t fall into this, but Samsung may. Then you hit the \u201care the business and cultures compatible enough to merge\u201d question. I would say Apple recently hated Samsung\u2019s guts, viewed them as dishonest, and cared enough about those things to go to court even though it forced Apple to disclose a lot of secrets during the trial. Samsung may or may not deserve it, but Apple has a deep dislike and distrust of Samsung. So I think the two cultures are incompatible. The businesses may also be as Samsung makes everything from chips to heavy trucks while Apple\u2019s entire product line fits on on modest sized table. So can they? Not in any meaningful or useful way. ",

Does Apple have any interest in acquiring or merging with Samsung? Absolutely not. Apple has no interest in having a business with such a different corporate culture that is that diversified. ",
