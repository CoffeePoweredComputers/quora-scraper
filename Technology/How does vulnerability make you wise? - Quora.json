So, other than gaining wisdom from others, it\u2019s that fear and vulnerability leading to us overcoming, that teaches us wisdom (how life really works). Strength is nice but once strong, we learn almost nothing from our experience (but we can still learn by viewing others struggling and learning). As much as wee (or out culture) emphasize success, it\u2019s really the lessons learn through risking (through weakness and failure) that leads to success. And success without overcoming obstacles is shallow and gets boring and meaningless eventually. Learning and applying that learning (to greater obstacles) is were it\u2019s at. ",
