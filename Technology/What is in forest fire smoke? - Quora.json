            "answer_text": "The main elements of the smoke are carbon dioxide and water (as water vapour). However, there are solids which are unburnt organic and inorganic compounds, ash, various chemical compounds, depending on the type of tree that is combusted. There are probably several thousands types of organic chemical compounds in the smoke. The smoke you see is generally composed of incompletely burned products of combustion. This falls down as ash/dust when it reaches ground level. Typically when any wood fire burns, the smoke is composed of incompletely combusted carbonaceous materials. When wood combusts under ideal conditions there is little smoke, and the main products are carbon dioxide and water. In a forest fire, combustion is usually far from ideal. ",
