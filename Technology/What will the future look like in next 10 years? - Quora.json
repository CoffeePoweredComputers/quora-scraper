            "answer_text": "I think it will look not too different. I see technology just repeating it's self and us \u2026ok even I couldn\u2019t keep a straight face! Technology will be so ahead by then I feel like everyone will have an AI assistant that will do everything for the people. I see self driving cars and electric really sexy public transit. Most of the baby boomers will have retired so the employment maket will be over whelmed . I could see that causing some troubles. I see some building going on way over on the moon . Regular flights to and from I truly belive space travel will be normal by then . I at least hope so. I think there will be a string of bad viruse and bacteria . A law against how many kids we have . Also we will be using the three sea shell system instead of traditional methods to sanitize out back halves . Taco Bell will also be a five star restaurant. Ok the ideas from this paragraph are from demolition man with Sylvester Stallone. I love that movie! I do however see laws against certain things that need to change changing and I think there will be a shift in the way the world operates. I belive there will be a generation of odd ball kids that are going to do some serious work. Information will travel so fast by then I don't think humans will be able to keep up but I have a feeling that will be safe guarded against . I think humans will be living twice as long and the medical break throughs will be substantial in aiding with that. I think it's going to look pretty cool ! That whole space travel idea is the coolest ever and I can't belive I get watch from this tiny device I hold in my hands . I have so many questions lol What the world will look like in ten years depends on those who stand up speak up and work together for a common goal to save the world with me hahaha. Oh I almost forgot education will be free and of equal content regardless of class. If there even is class by then . ",

While we\u2019ve made huge strides in the last 40 years (the rivers of the northeast don\u2019t catch on fire, the ozone holes are closing, acid rain is much less of a problem) we still have miles to go and promises to keep. We\u2019ll see 3D printing go from a makers toy (for most people) to something useful in the home. We\u2019ll see printed electronics in many places (I suspect low powered printed electronics will be usable with \u201csnap together\u201d power/USB/HDMI connectors. The Internet of things will go from promise to reality (it will be banal by then) Biotechnology produced everyday products will be available and less expensive than other products. Maybe we\u2019ll have 3D printed bio material/organs at the next level of complexity (cartilage, kidneys, liver). The biggest change is probably that not owning a car has become a viable option for most adult Americans. ",

Nationalism, racism, and the anti-immigration movement will rise tremendously in the US and other countries as atheism/non-religion rises. The cost of food will be higher in many countries since arable land is shrinking. Technology wise things will be nearly the same, just improvements in computers, but nothing really that revolutionary. ",
