            "answer_text": "Yes. And no. It depends on what is meant by \u201cunderstand\u201d. We know a lot of stuff by observation and recognizing patterns, forming ideas and testing those ideas, etc. This is true for both \u201cobjective\u201d knowledge, such as our observations of others and scientific research, as well as \u201csubjective\u201d knowledge, such as the things one learns by disciplined self-observation. But there are limits to the kind of knowledge which comes from observation, analysis, synthesis, and theory. The understanding that we get that way is very useful, and we pursue it for good reasons. But it\u2019s still limited. An idea is a mere static representation of some fragment of reality: we have to draw mental boundaries around some aspect of our experience and give it a name, categorize it, etc., then we use that elemental idea to construct larger models of how things work, and we call the result \u201cknowledge\u201d or \u201cunderstanding.\u201d We feel that we understand when it all makes sense to us \u2014 i.e. when causality is accounted for and we can predict outcomes based on our understanding. Even so, as good as our model might be, it will always suffer a defect that\u2019s attributed to its origins. When you take reality and \u201ccarve it up\u201d cognitively, you\u2019re doing a kind of damage \u2014 truth is lost in the process. The wholeness of reality cannot be represented. It can\u2019t be packaged and labeled and used as a part in a model. This loss of truth is inescapable. There is absolutely nothing one can do about the shortcomings of conceptuality as a means to knowledge \u2014 nobody will ever overcome that limitation, because it\u2019s built-in to what a concept is: \u201ca unit of representation of some aspect of reality.\u201d All is not lost, though. There\u2019s a kind of \u201cknowing\u201d which doesn\u2019t involve that carve-up-and-label process. This kind of knowing is so different than what we normally think of as knowledge that it\u2019s probably best not to call it knowledge, but something else. The \u201csomething else\u201d that I like for this is being. Being is a kind of knowledge which doesn\u2019t depend on carved-up symbolic representations of some aspect of reality. Being is whole, like reality is whole. To be is to \u201cknow\u201d yourself, not as a bunch of ideas, but as an unbounded presence beyond language and ideas. You can\u2019t really say what it is, because talking is all about those carved-up symbols, and you can\u2019t really even think about it clearly. But you can still be it anyway. ",
