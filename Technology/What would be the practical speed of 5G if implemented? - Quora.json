            "answer_text": "Practical speed of 5G is yet to be determined as theortically speaking it would provide over 1GBPS and showed similar results in test environment. However, this kind of speed wouldn\u2019t be needed (more than enough and would disrupt technology and security standards) and so this would strictly be used for services like M2M communication, contactless payments, driverless commute etc. In entertainment industry however, it would be useful for online gaming, AR/VR implementation etc. ",

            "answer_text": "When implemented in the near future, 5G will support data rates from 20\u2013100 Mbps for mobile nodes. Adaptive modulation techniques (or higher order modulation techniques) enable the efficient utilisation of the available bandwidth. Data rates needn't be necessarily increased only by increasing the bandwidth. Nowadays, bidding of bandwidth is costly with the competition between various telcos. The expected bandwidth for 5G system is 100 MHz or more than that. MIMO systems exploit spatial multiplexing to enhance the data rates because a single antenna can't yield a higher bandwidth. The frequency of operation is in the 2\u20138 GHz band. ",

The details are a bit sketchy at this point but the speeds are supposed to be upwards of 1 to 20Gbps compare to the 4G standards which are 100Mbps up to 1Gbps. Yeah a lot faster. But will those speeds ever be realized is another question that we will find out sometime around the year 2020. ",

Currently, IoT technologies using the 4G network are not able to process data quickly but with 5G which is 10X faster than 4G will be able to transfer data faster. Also, 5G has better connectivity than 4G which means more devices can be connected at the same time. Other features of 5G like zero latency, improved bandwidth and reduction in battery consumption due to data makes it perfect for IoT. Reliance Jio is working towards bringing 5G technology to the market which will enhance IoT technologies. It shall bring 5G technology to its users very soon and work is already underway to improve its infrastructure and all these will soon be available to users. ",
