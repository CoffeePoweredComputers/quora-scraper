            "answer_text": "They are pretty close but these days they\u2019ve grown apart slightly\u2026 The Phoenicians invented a tech to decipher Mediterranean languages. It\u2019s called our modern day alphabet. They designed a solution to their translation problem. The solution was a technology. Yet, today, tech is widely regarded as digital or electrical, not linguistic in nature. It\u2019s thus more closely related to microchips than rudimentary or primitive tools. Design on the other hand has gone from art to bigger picture problem solving. Design now is broader in context than tech. Take for example the \u201ctech industry\u201d much of which is electrical and digital in nature. Tech referring to the cutting edge more than legacy or archaic tech. However, design can resurrect old tech from the grave and apply it to solve a new problem. Case in point iPhone. Touch screen tech had been around for years prior to 2006! Previously tech led companies are now making the transition to design led. It was once said an engineer is highly specialized in one thing yet an architect must be aware of many. So too do I hold tech and design in their paradox. Tech is specialized in its future conjuring capabilities where as, design is responsible for connecting the dots amongst various tech. Great question! ",
