            "answer_text": "Robotics is an emerging field which is continuously changing the present market and industries. I am listing here some of the industries where robotics is extensively used. Manufacturing - Robots are being used in many aspects of manufacturing to help increase productivity and efficiency while lowering production costs. Robots in manufacturing collaborate with workers to perform repetitive, monotonous, or intricate tasks under the worker\u2019s guidance and control. With these machines, precision is valued more than speed, as is the ability to be reprogrammed for specific tasks of different sizes and complexities. Robotic manufacturing technology is also becoming safer to operate. Cameras, sensors, and automatic shut-off capabilities enable robots to sense and stay clear of humans in the workplace.Military - In the military and public safety sectors, robotic technology is being applied in many areas. One highly visible area involves unmanned drones. These machines can be used for surveillance and support operations on the battlefield. Military drones flying over areas of war and conflict, in hostage situations, and for natural and manmade disasters are able to assess danger levels and provide soldiers and first responders with real-time information.Automotive - This industry has been drastically changed by the involvement of robotics. Robotic automation helps auto-making plants deal with labour shortages. In many facilities, robots work next to humans and help people get more done in less time. The bots also have built-in safety features that stop them from moving whenever humans get too close.Electronics Manufacturing - Consumers have an ever-growing demand for smartphones, flat-screen TVs, earbuds, and tablets, among other gadgets. These are some of the industries where robotics is currently in use extensively. In future, almost every industry will be influenced to some extent by robotics.",
