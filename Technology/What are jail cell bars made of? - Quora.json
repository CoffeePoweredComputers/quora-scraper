The really expensive part of the grill or steel door isn\u2019t the door itself, its the Folger Adam type lock. Cell bars are only appropriate where visibility is critical. Like in a corridor. Besides a great place to put a hanging noose, bars are great if you want to spear or \u201cGas\u201d a staff member with urine or feces. ",

            "answer_text": "Rolled steel is used for jail bars. As old jails are shut down, bars are becoming obsolete, due to cost. Rolled steel bars are more expensive than steel doors, and there is the added risk of the bars being used for suicide attempts as some tie sheets or whatever else can be found to the bars as an anchor point. Solid steel doors also provide for better officer safety. ",
