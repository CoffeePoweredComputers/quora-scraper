            "answer_text": "The best way to teach anything is the way each individual learns best. One effective way of teaching students in a classroom to use technology in the classroom is to provide each student with her/his own computer, and smart phone. Keyboarding. Lessons in can begin by teaching keyboarding by touch, since most students do not initially have the facility with the keyboard which maximizes their inputs in a short period of time. This is a skill to develop. I would like to see parents of first graders introducing keyboarding skills for 10 minutes a day. Writing for output and personal expression. Next, the art of writing via assigned compositions and word processing should be taught. The art of writing is one which has not changed with technology except to deliver it more quickly and make editing and spelling easier. It is critical at this point in our history for students to be able to express themselves well in writing. Graphic organizers help students learn the format for various kinds of writing (persuasive, how to, essay, etc.). Student Interactives - ReadWriteThink Reading for inputs. At the same time as writing is learned, reading instruction should parallel writing instruction; introduction to learning apps for reading can be introduced. These would include learning to read using progressive, organized, multi-sensory phonetic development (I like Page on Lexialearning ) and identifying interesting and good books according to each student's interest.  Research. Part of reading is determining which sources are best, most credible and most useful. It is important for students to be given a starting point for research, and then fostering their discovery of more, and better, information. Wikipedia, for example, is not usually a primary source, but can be used as a resource for more links to more primary information. Google, for another example, is limited by its own constraints to give prominence to sources that may not be the best source for information. It takes reading and digging to find real answers, and it is important that students with their teacher in the classroom evaluate the sources of all information they receive. Library downloading of good books. This will develop overall literacy, comprehension, and fluency. There are smart phone apps in which books can be downloaded, and there are libraries which provide downloadable books at no charge if students sign up for library cards. When the books are due, they disappear from the smart phone (and parents do not have to drive to libraries to return books or pay fines). Interval Learning (also known as Spaced repetition). As students progress in their education, there are times when memorization is a requirement in order to master information. There are computer-augmented learning techniques utilizing repetition in every subject area. These have algorithms which calculate how many repetitions are needed for each individual to learn a fact. I have seen it work well. Programming. Various languages can and should be taught progressively. Everyone should learn to code. It is part of literacy in the computer age. There should be intro to programming by second grade, when (ideally) keyboarding skills reach at least 40 wpm after ten minutes every day for the past two years. Once students reach 40 wpm on the keyboard, they can substitute the time they spent learning to keyboard and instead spend that time learning to program. Collaboration by interest for project learning. Students can collaborate with each other in class by deciding upon a class project, and designating responsibilities for completing it. These may include research, writing, promotion and publicity, outreach, graphic arts, computer programming. Classes are limited in choice of class project only by the teacher's capabilities, the classroom resources available, and the abilities of the students attending. Internet etiquette, manners, and an exploration of privacy issues. Every class must include a discussion and investigation of what is, and is not, considered to be appropriate behavior on the internet. I would suggest beginning with the Quora Terms of Service, Be Nice, Be Respectful, and a discussion of copyright, privacy, etiquette, manners, and the definition of harassment and bullying. Consequences for various violations should also be presented and discussed.

            "answer_text": "There are ways to use technology in the classroom that won't\u2028take much out of your already-packed day (these\u2028were covered in this article, and include ideas like practicing keyboarding and basic tech skills, building up student stamina by using tech academically, and honing tech problem-solving skills). Here, I'll focus on \u201cpracticing basic tech skills.\u201d This is not only the easiest skill to accomplish, it's intuitive, fun, and the most effective in enabling students to reach a comfort level with what otherwise might feel like geeky stuff they know nothing about (and think they can't learn). Use online sign-ups for conferences, parent helpers and project presentation dates. You can use Google calendar, or Google Apps for Education (from Docs or Sheets). Create and share a class calendar by creating it in Google Apps. Embed it into the class blog, wiki, website or class Internet start page. Share with students, parents and other teachers. It can be edited by anyone with permissions. Include relevant dates for homework, projects, tests, vacations, holidays, school events, birthdays, and more.You can quickly see where there are conflicts between classes (a great way to prevent too many assessments on the same day). If you don't, students will point them out! Use Twitter as a backchannel device, to solicit student feedback, as a quick assessment on a discussion, to collaborate on ideas, to share notes for an upcoming exam, as a reminder tool, to communicate outside of class, and more. Create a private class account (available only to members) that students log into. They use #hashtags to organize work, \u201creply\u201d to group answers in one spot. Show it on the class Smartscreen throughout class and encourage students to post inquiry-related comments, thoughts and questions for the class. Go on virtual field trips and save money by going places via the Internet. This is becoming increasingly popular as online tools become more sophisticated. Google's Streetview Guy not only travels roads, but goes into buildings, out in forests, along hiking trails, and more. Preview field trips virtually before going and show students what they'll see before they actually take a physical field trip, say, to the Long Beach Aquarium. Find it on Google Earth, then travel from the school (or the starting point) to the destination. Show students what they'll pass, how crowded the roads are, what their field trip location looks like before they even get there. Often, locations have their own set of videos on activities that you can watch as a group or in small student clusters Diversify your teaching by providing options for students who finish classwork early. I keep websites, simulations, educational games, the class calendar, homework and more on an Internet start page accessible by at school and home. Students know they can go here when they're done with assigned work. It always includes activities related to class inquiry. For example, students can update the class calendar, research a map location, play a topical video, or delve into a topic they're preparing a report on with the Box of Links on the right. Translate classwork for non-native speakers. There are many options for this task (for example, Google Translate). Use these in class to enrich everyone's learning. Assign a student to find and post the translation (to the backchannel device, class Twitter account, or whatever works best for your group) Adapt skills for special Needs by using tech to insure equity. Prepare these before class, so they're available for students that need them. You can even include them on the class Internet start page (see above) so students can independently access them as needed, taking responsibility for their own learning goals. Collect data with Google Forms by creating a Google Form on a topic that students are researching. Have them collect their research on the form and share it with everyone in class. This is a great way to collaborate on projects and encourage note-taking as an academic skill. Collect feedback with a backchannel. As with Twitter above, display this on the Smartscreen so students can share knowledge, provide constructive comments, help each other. This will inform how you proceed in class -- if students are catching on quickly, you might move faster, or slow down if the reverse is true. Because backchannels can be anonymous, no one will worry about sharing their feelings. It can also be used as a quick assessment of topical learning to see if students are ready to move on. Participate in Google Hangouts -- these are online get-togethers offered through Google Apps. They are typically after class hours, enabling students to meet at a prescribed time through the Google Hangout environment. It allows for sharing screens, documents, even YouTube videos, and can be recorded and shared as a video for those who couldn't make it or those who want to review the get-together. These are especially important in a flipped classroom environment to encourage students to work together as they prepare homework for the next day's class. Require an exit ticket from class. This can be any sort of quick tech - -a game, comment, simulations, greeting card, a very short story. A great one is to tweet their thoughts on class. With only 140 characters, it has to be quick Assign students to do tech class work. When there's a tech job to do, assign that to the students. They'll want to be responsible. This includes adding assignments to the class calendar, timing class activities, sharing certain information on the class Smartscreen (in my class, we have simulations that have leaderboards that must be refreshed to display up-to-date results. I let students take charge of that. Who knew pushing F7 could be so much fun?). Don't be afraid of tech mistakes -- embrace them. You won't be able to avoid them -- it's all part of technology. Show students how you face the problem, seek out solutions, don't get frustrated, and ultimately prevail. You are teaching them problem-solving Control a noisy classroom -- show a tool (like Too Noisy) on the class Smartscreen that \u2028tracks noise in the classroom. This requires nothing from you -- just the display. Students \u2028naturally react to the noise meters. Share student work -- if students have blogs or websites, show them how to display their \u2028work on these sites. It can be done with a screenshot or an embed code. If you use Google Apps for Education, every file created will generate an embed code that can be placed on websites and blogs (it's under \u201cPublish\u201d). This is a great way to develop a student portfolio, encourage feedback on student work, and share with parents and other teachers. Provide feedback -- This is an important step in student work. Studies show that feedback is one of the predictors of educational success (in teachers as well as students). Expect students to publish their work to a personal blog, wiki, and/or website AND to comment on the work of classmates. I usually say five per assignment. It can be done during free time in class, at home, or whenever it works. Students will learn to manage their time and fit this quick exercise in. Thanks A2A\u2026.!!! ",
