            "answer_text": "Deep fakes are created using GAN (generative adverserial networks) or sometimes using RNN's. To distinguish them we use these networks only. Ex- GAN has generator and discriminator, when generator is stronger than discriminator, we have a good deepfake and when discriminator is better than generator it can identify deepfakes from real images.
