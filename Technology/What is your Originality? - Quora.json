            "answer_text": "I think originality has more do with the way you react and think given a particular situation than anything else. For an instance, you are given a task to pen down a few items that you think might require for a camping trip. Now you list down the items that according to you are really necessary.  This list is a reflection of your thoughts and ideas. It is quite possible that someone else prepares a similar list but that does not diminish any bit of your originality as the process of getting to a position where you'd pick an item up can totally be different for both of you.  Thus in a way originality can be better described as An absence of imitation. It has nothing to do with the fact that something of similar sort has been done or can be done. ",
