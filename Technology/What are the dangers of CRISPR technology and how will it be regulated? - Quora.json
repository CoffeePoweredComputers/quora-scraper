            "answer_text": "The two applications of CRISPR technology that I'm the most worried about are edits to human reproductive tissue and the generation of and release into the wild of transgenic organisms that are capable of propagating edits. The underlying theme of both of these applications is that CRISPR technology can be used to make heritable alterations that can then irreversibly propagate throughout \"wild\" populations. However, each has very different ethical considerations and likely very different regulatory challenges.  The gravest issue surrounding editing human reproductive tissue is that that tissue can then be used to make edited individuals. If we generate successfully edited sperm or eggs and then use them for in vitro fertilization, we'll create individuals that carry those edits in every single cell of their bodies. This can also be achieved by editing one-cell embryos (which has been attempted but wasn't particularly successful). The ethical issues surrounding this are fraught, to say the least.  Any edits made in this fashion are, by definition, made without the consent of the individual who carries them. In my opinion, that should absolutely disqualify any modification whose benefit is debatable -- in other words, most of them. Further, any edit whose effects aren't known is essentially an experiment on an unwilling human subject (if the edited tissue is permitted to develop) -- another huge taboo. While we certainly don't understand the molecular basis of ourselves well enough (yet) to engineer sophisticated traits, we can still irreversibly infringe upon the rights of any individuals altered in such a fashion with current or near-future technology.  In contrast to interfering with the rights and expectations of human individuals, editing the genomes of other species has implications for irreversible ecological alterations. Some applications of CRISPR technology have the capability to rapidly and irreversibly modify wild populations of organisms. At its core, CRISPR needs three things to work: DNA encoding the genome cutting enzyme, DNA encoding the guide RNA, and DNA that serves as a repair template. As all of these can be delivered as DNA, we can engineer (and have engineered) genome edits that are self propagating.  These are called gene drives, and they work by inserting the DNA encoding the machinery to specifically edit a site in the genome at that site in the genome. The vast majority of eukaryotic species carry two nearly identical copies of their DNA. So, if we insert our self-editing construct in one of those two copies, it is capable of cutting the other copy and inserting itself in the cut -- effectively propagating itself through an individual. Whenever a modified individual mates with an unmodified individual, all of the progeny will be heterozygous, at least to start out. The self-propagation of the gene drive edit ensures that a majority if not all of the gametes made by progeny will carry the edit -- greatly speeding its spread through the population. In addition to the editing machinery, we can also insert \"cargo\" genes into these self-editors. These can dramatically alter the function and behavior of the individual who carries them (one of the most common examples offered is adding a gene that renders mosquitos malaria-resistant) and because they're self-copying, they'll spread through wild populations very quickly.  Truly reversing one of these edits once it has been made to a population is only theoretically possible, which means that we have the ability to irreversibly alter our environment by changing local populations if not entire species.  Our ability to regulate both of these applications is pretty tiny -- neither one requires any particularly fancy reagents or equipment that can be controlled, and there's practically no way to regulate the synthesis and purchase of specific DNA sequences. The best we can hope for are stiff penalties for \"unethical\" behavior (whenever we decide what that is) that serve as a deterrent. At least in the United States, the current regulations on academic research on human subjects (as overseen by multiple federal agencies as well as institutional review boards on each campus performing this type of research) could serve as a model for going forward.  However, these sorts of regulations only work if enforced, and my big concern is that there will almost certainly be parts of the world that simply can't be bothered. The technology isn't particularly expensive and the facilities and equipment required are not a huge hurdle for a determined party to get over. Given the possibility for these modifications to become a permanent part of a species' gene pool (whether it's ours or some other species) means that this technology is a Pandora's box just waiting to be opened.

            "answer_text": "Hi there... CRISPR is basically knock out strategy to silence the gene by inhibiting the RNA polymerase activity inside the nucleus. It's still in the nascent stage, so it would be hard to comment about the major disadvantages except it's very labour intensive and high cost oriented technique than RNA interference which provides a complete gene knock down within the cytosol with higher efficiency.
