            "answer_text": "Thanks for the A2A Keegan! Original Question: Is it possible to start a power company that generates energy using only renewable sources? Not only is it possible; it is common practice in North America. This is exactly what many of the owners/developers of most large independent renewable generation installations\u2014wind, solar, hydro, landfill gas, etc.\u2014have done and do in order to attract financing and manage risk. (This is also common practice for some fossil plants as well.) Even large utility companies, municipal utilities, rural electric cooperatives may stick renewable plants (or fossil plants) in a separate subsidiary and/or may share ownership of such a subsidiary with other utility companies or investors. However, all \u201cindependent generators\u201d which is one term used for any corporate entity owning one or more power plants selling power onto the grid to wholesale customers (like major utility supply companies) are subject to state and federal regulation and may or may not need to contend with additional regulation/membership in so called \u201cIndependent System Operators\u201d or \u201cISOs\u201d which are organizations regulating the regional purchase/sale/and dispatch of power from power plants. Moreover, as an independent generator, you also have to deal with \u201cinterconnection permitting\u201d which is usually governed by whatever operating entity actually operates the transmission/distribution lines you tap into to supply power to customers over the grid. These entities are usually a subsidiary of a larger utility company which will be competing with your plant through their own generation facilities. So the folks you go to for interconnection permits will hate you. This whole system of regulation is enormously Byzantine in complexity. There are 3\u20134 national law firms in the USA who are expert in this field and many local specialists in individual states who have expertise dealing with local state Public Utility Commissions. The first time you jump through these hoops it is kind like going though old school dental implant surgery including tooth extraction, bone grafts, installation of posts, waiting months for bone growth, installation of a temporary crowns, and then final crowns for say all of your teeth. I include in this the sensation of being drugged and then feeling massive waves of pain after the anesthesia wears off and the massive incontrollable expense in excess of all estimates. However, once you have gone through this the first time, the pain and agony, but not the expense, drops down to, say, only ten root canals or the lancing of several thrombose hemorrhoids. Also, to make stuff more fun, the process is frequently filled with corrupt individuals who want you to fail. So it is like the above procedures performed by a bad oral surgeon/rectal surgeon. The first time I tried to do this in partnership with a regional utility, after two years of work and planning, the deal got cancelled while I was recovering from major, invasive spinal fusion surgery. The recovery from disk fusion was a better experience. I suggest learning how to do this from folks who have done it before in a place that is friendly to renewable power plant development. ",

            "answer_text": "That depends on the regulatory provisions of your local grid. There are a lot of such renewable generators in the world. Recently, we have begun to see solar plus battery storage developments. This isn\u2019t required to make the solar power work, but the pricing structure of the grid in question pays a lot more for generators who can provide 100% of the power needed during the \u201cwindow\u201d of time where the local grid sees its daily peak. Peaks have historically been expensive to meet, and pricing reflects that. In recent years natural gas, which is far more flexible than coal or nuclear power, has become cheap enough to displace a lot of the coal and nuclear generation at a lower price. This means that a resource which in the past was used for peaking only, is now moving into the territory that used to belong to \u201cbaseload\u201d generators. The existence of a large inventory of natural gas plants, whether or not they are actually used for peak power delivery, also eliminates the practical requirement for other resources to be able to deliver at specific times. But convention and pricing don\u2019t move as fast as technology does. The U.S. natural gas inventory is more than double the amount of natural gas that wind and solar would need to serve 80% of total electricity consumption. Today, some developers are finding that wind is able to undercut the resources previously considered \u201cbaseload\u201d, while solar plus a little bit of storage are able to undercut new natural gas generation. The more wind and the more solar that is on the grid, the less of a problem this time of use issue is. But if you have the resources and the knowledge to start a generation company, you must know how to figure out how your local grid operator handles the pricing. Grid operators could actually be deliberate in promoting renewables. But they don\u2019t need to. Wind and solar from utility scale onshore projects are so much cheaper than existing fossil and nuclear generation, that the developers of the clean energy will figure out how to operate in any realistic regulatory environment. All that the regulatory structure does is influence who owns which part of the overall resource. Personally, I expect the natural gas industry to see a future in partnering with wind and solar generators. Renewable electricity will be cheap enough to produce a huge amount of hydrogen which can be stored for short periods and used in dedicated power plants which presently burn natural gas. Alternatively, the renewable hydrogen can be converted to methane, and the plants can be used as backup without any modification. It helps a lot to understand the actual economics, and to separate them from the existing regulatory conventions. If the electricity is cheap enough all problems can be solved. That\u2019s what happened at the end of 2017 when the cost of new wind and solar farms dropped about 40%. ",
