            "answer_text": "That depends predominantly on what device(s) you\u2019re using for your digital art production. I\u2019ve used a wide range of devices and software and these are my recommendations based on device / operating system: Windows or Mac PC with a digitizer tablet like Wacom Intuos or Cintique - Adobe Photoshop if you can pay for it (it\u2019s very expensive). It\u2019s the industry standard and while you can learn on other applications, you\u2019ll have to re-learn at some point if you plan to go pro. If you\u2019re not planning to go pro? Well then stick with the free GIMP. While there are those who will disagree with this statement - it can do everything that Photoshop can, but it\u2019s free. There\u2019s more to it than this, but I\u2019m not looking to write War and Peace here.Android based tablet (like the Samsung Note / S series) - My personal preference is for Autodesk SketchBook. It\u2019s sold on a freemium model. The base system (which is fantastic) is free and some added features can be bought within the app. I highly recommend the added features. They\u2019re not pricey and they\u2019re highly valuable. Also, you can record your process and export the whole thing in an animation. This means you get two products for your effort - the finished art and a process video that can be uploaded to YouTube etc.iOS iPad Pro series with the Apple Pencil - This is my current rig. I keep it with me at all times and feel naked without it. It\u2019s my sketchbook. My finished art studio. The whole shebang and I use it for professional work. It\u2019s also really damn expensive (though they\u2019ve released the 9.7\u2033 model which I hear works well enough and is priced on par with most of the Android tablets that you could use for art. Anyway - the program I prefer here is Procreate. It\u2019s \u2018for pay\u2019. Buy it. It\u2019s a small, one time fee, and exceedingly well worth it. Intuitive gesture controls, a fantastic UI, and everything you want in an art program* set up in a way that\u2019s easy to get started without feeling overwhelmed. (*My one objection to Procreate at the time of this writing is that it currently has no text features. For this, I export my illustrations to another app - often Autodesk SketchBook mentioned above- and work up text there.) I suspect though, that Procreate will incorporate text any day now. They seem to update the program frequently and each time they do, they add a lot of function without breaking anything. In case you couldn\u2019t tell, I\u2019m kinda a fan.ETA: Procreate has added a text function to their app and it works great! ",

            "answer_text": "The best digital art program for a beginner is ArtRage ArtRage has a very intuitive user interface that simulates drawers with pencils brushes etc.  They have a version for smartphones too. ArtRage Oils is free while the version with more variety of natural media is paid. It is available for Windows, Mac, Android, and IOS.   The best FREE OPEN SOURCE SOFTWARE digital art program for a beginner is KRITA.  Since nobody mentioned it, I felt compelled to list it. It is very fast, it is multiplatform, It has a nice intuitive user interface with a lot of tools and brushes that simulate natural media. And last but not least, it is Free and works on an also free and open source operating system: Linux, and no so open like Windows and Mac OS . It happens to be also Open Source Software, in case you are, besides a beginner artist, a beginner developer or programmer who wants to modify the source code. If you want a Free Open Source Software vector based program then it has to be INKSCAPE.   And if you want a still free 3D Sculpting the most user friendly is Sculptris   Sculptris is the most user friendly free 3D Sculpting Software that I have used in both PC and Mac. It is a nice introduction to more powerful but not free software like ZBrush. Another one that I use a lot and is free and open source software bot not as easy to use is Blender 3D that you can download for free at blender.org - Home of the Blender project - Free and Open 3D Creation Software It has nice very nice sculpting and modeling tools but also rendering and animation and even video editing. And with this I finish my selection of the 3 or more best digital art programs for a beginner. I focused mostly in ease of use since as a beginner you want something that hopefully you do not have to read a manual just to start doodling a little bit. And if it is free so much better. I listed ArtRage first since it seems to be the most user friendly and it works on mobile like Android IPhone Ipad besides Windows and Mac. So you probably would not have to invest in a new piece of hardware. It is useful to know that a pen-like pressure sensitive pointing device like the S-Pen on the galaxy note or the Apple Pencil for the IPad Pro (My favorite) are highly desirable pieces of hardware. As it is the Wacom Cintiq for PC and Mac and Linux.  The surface Pro I found not as desirable as some applications are not as compatible with their pen. I forced myself to edit my answer because it was not including the 3 main categories of digital art which are: Raster, Vector and 3D. The definition of digital art could be very general and I answered based on the assumption that the question is about visual art only and mostly about 2D sketching and painting. But nevertheless I mentioned 3D Sculpting  etc. to help to widen the perception of digital art while at the same time limiting my selection to the software that is user friendly and readily available for most hardware.
