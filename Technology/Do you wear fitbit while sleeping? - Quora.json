            "answer_text": "QUESTION: Do you wear fitbit while sleeping? ANSWER: Yes. Fitbit Blaze. I got a metal-link, after-market bracelet, because the original bracelet is not suitable for long-term wear. I take it off: to showerto charge the deviceto clean the bracelet and the back of the deviceFWIW, I find a combination of my WaterPik, an old toothbrush, and a tiny dab of toothpaste works well to get the bracelet clean. Anyway, I find the Fitbit lacking for at least two of the three reasons I own it. For counting my walking steps, it fails to record about 20 percent of the steps that my phone does. While not forgivable, this is somewhat understandable, because most of my steps are on a walking treadmill (treadmill desk), and my hands rest on the desk edge for typing and mousing. Meanwhile, the phone is in my pocket, so it doesn\u2019t need to interpret step jiggles, muted by contact with a table-top. But still, the fitbit counts SOME of my steps while I\u2019m resting my wrist on that desk, which tells me that it CAN detect steps in that situation, but just doesn\u2019t want to. The upshot is that I have to have my phone with me to get a reasonable count of my steps in a day. The Fitbit Blaze is not useful as a motivator, because I can\u2019t trust it. As well, when the wife and I go for our nearly-daily brisk walks, I try to match pace with her (her legs are shorter), but my Blaze keeps telling me that I accumulate a few hundred more steps than her Blaze counts for her. If anything, she should be showing more steps over the same distance. For displaying my heart rate, the Fitbit generally shows \u201c \u2014\u2014 \u201c and only reluctantly gets around to showing the heart-rate. This means that, when exercising, I can\u2019t get a reliable nor reasonably quick \u201creal-time-ish\u201d heart-rate, to judge the effect of the exercise. For tracking my sleep, I thought it was doing an OK job for a couple of years, but then I purchased \u201cSleep as Android\u201d app for my phone. It watches me with Sonar all night. I like the sleep summary display in the Fitbit app, but it disagrees with what Sleep as Android is showing me. I\u2019m going to switch from Sonar to vibration detection (moving the phone from night-stand to bed) for a few nights, to see if the overall trend changes. Right now, the Fitbit says I have a period or two of deep sleep, early in the night, and then cycle between REM and Light. The Sleep as Android app thinks I get a lot more deep sleep. But then the Sleep as Android graph and summary are brutally ugly\u2026 so there\u2019s that\u2026 I have to say that I dislike the Blaze\u2019s interface. There are several places where it would make a whole lot of sense to eliminate a layer of button-pressing or tapping, to get to a function. It\u2019s also a shame that users can\u2019t just slide most-used functions nearer the start screen, and let others languish, a greater number of presses and swipes away. As well, the limitations of the battery-saver display are grindingly annoying. You must hold your forearm horizontal, with the wrist-and-hand turned sideways (like you would if you were chopping something) and then flip the wrist-and-hand over to a palm-down attitude, to wake up the display. If you start in any other arm position, the watch ignores you and leaves the display off. So, for example, if you are doing pushups or any other floor exercise, or pretty-much anything that involves your hand, you don\u2019t get to see anything but a blank watch-face. Leaving the display constantly on runs the battery down with frightening speed. That\u2019s another reason why I want the Sleep as Android app on my phone to work; I don\u2019t have to miss out on counting steps nor on tracking sleep, because the phone is plugged in and charging overnight while it monitors my tossing and turning and snoring. At worst, it misses a few steps from my trips to the bathroom\u2026 (ahem - old-guy thing)\u2026. The Fitbit, on the other hand, needs a couple or three hours out of the day or night to charge. Not every day, but often enough to be annoying. If I turn off the battery-saving display blanking, I\u2019ll be charging it every night. But I\u2019ll at least be able to tell what time it is when my wrist is in a variety of positions\u2026 woo\u2026 also hoo\u2026 (the sound of underwhelmed). OUTLOOK While the Fitbit Ionic seems mildly interesting (especially the water-\u2019proofing\u2019, and supposedly improved heart rate monitor), I\u2019m going to wait for a lot of reviews - both professional and customer. I might end up waiting for the next Samsung Gear watch, instead (which will have the added advantage of integrating with S-Health and might also let me find a blood-pressure monitor that can share data to the device). I thought that was going to be the Gear 4 this Autumn, but apparently the anticipatory previews and media guesses were about the Gear 3 Sport or whatever. Did that help? Don\u2019t bother looking for my Fitbit data. I don\u2019t share. ",

It's so bad that the skin under my Charge HR is actually more pale than the rest of my arm. :) I do it because I realised that making sure I get at least 6,5 hours of uninterrupted sleep everyday helps me be a lot more productive during the day and wearing my Charge HR during the night allows me to quantify how close I am to that goal.
