            "answer_text": "If you are desperate and need cash absolutely immediately the best way is to find items listed in the daily deals section on Amazon, and then list them as \u201cbuy it now\u201d offers on Ebay at a higher price. (If you search on Ebay you will find others doing this exact same thing and you can see what price they are putting on the items). You can copy the photographs on Amazon either by saving the images or doing screen shots which you can do by using the snippit tool or a software programme called Snaggit, if you have it. Then you can use them when making the listing on Ebay. When someone buys from you on eBay and the money has arrived in your PayPal account, order from Amazon but have the item sent direct to Ebay buyer. This is completely legitimate and is called \u201cdrop shipping\u201d. You then have the profit in your account within a day and this is the fastest way I know to get a decent amount of quick cash online when you are broke! You can of course put a higher markup and will earn more on the higher value items. You can make smaller amounts of cash by doing things like answering surveys but it takes a long time to build up a decent amount of money and you are not paid immediately, so this will not meet your needs, if you are desperate for immediate money. I would recommend building up an affiliate marketing business alongside the drop-shipping method, as this has potential to earn more for you in the long term and will take less time and effort. Essentially you earn commission for directing website traffic to a product link, when a sale is made. It can take a bit longer to set up if you are going to use free traffic methods (get a free PDF download of a list of free traffic methods here 101 Ways To Get Free Traffic), which is what you will need to do if you don\u2019t have any money to invest to get started. However, if you want to use paid advertising you can be earning commissions within a few hours. You will need some guidance to succeed at affiliate marketing, although anyone of any age, background and technical ability can do this.

            "answer_text": "Hi - Thanks for the question. I agree with what most have already answered, so I will take a different approach. When you do something you are truly passionate about, it won't feel as much like \"work\" in the traditional definition. It will be interesting, stimulating and fun. But when you start with money first, you can end up doing things for that money you don't enjoy.  In my life, I've found that by focusing on building successful online businesses, something I'm really good at and love doing, it never feels like work or something I HAVE to do. And I believe when you do something you love, regardless of how much work or time it takes to make the money you seek, it never seems very hard or slow. When you are passionate about it, in my experience, the work is fun and the money comes faster because you are engaged and producing the highest quality output. My advice is to focus on what you are good at, enjoy doing, and are interested in. I can tell you exactly how to build an online business, I can give you the blueprint and formula I use to create successful business over and over again, but unless it's what you want, and you are passionate about the business you build, it'll never feel like it's easy and the results come quickly.  For example, my first business took 8 months to make the first sale. But I loved working on it. Then shortly after that first sale, things started happening quickly and it turned into a six figure business. And I have the formula down to do it again, with another business I was interested in. But I always focus on what I'm good at and interested in, before every actually taking step 1.  If you google true stories with Gill Chad Thompson, there is an interview, called how a dog saved a man, that I did about this very thing. (I'm in no way associated with that site, and there is no promotion of anything, just my story). But it shows how focusing on your interests and passions can create a life you create on your terms, and your way.  Not some hype marketer promising you'll make $10,000 a month in under 60 days. Like my friends wrote here to you, there are no get rich quick systems, if that was actually the case, the marketer would keep it to himself or herself and just keep repeating it over and over again (don't believe the \"proof\" they may show, there are a lot of unethical marketers that prey on the easy and fast money crowd). I have a proven system that I use over and over again, but you don't see me actually selling it and giving it to thousands of people! :) Hope that helps! Thanks,Chad ",
