            "answer_text": "Most original questions have already been asked. Those who are wise, have studied the history of knowledge. It is difficult to quickly do that without some foundation in mental development. This is not always provided in the standardized educational environment. The individual must take control of their own mental development. Many people see some kind of general reference to some foundational knowledge, and they are content with the superficial impression that they are seeing. How familiar is a person with understanding \u201ceverything\u201d? Another way of thinking about it might be answering the following questions. \u201cHow willing am I to explore the subject of mental development?\u201d and \u201cWhat kind of discipline in thinking will I need to research The Mind/Body Problem?\u201d Another obstacle to overcome is that I cannot simply mention the Mind/Body Problem and expect that I can hold your attention. To actually help you along the way and guide you toward a subject which can be of real interest to you, I have to make the subject interesting to you. Also, the mere mention of the subject might be a form of misdirection. If you think that the mention of a philosophical subject means that I am suggesting that you go to college and take philosophy courses, that would be a mistake. That also can be a block to your development. To be helpful to you, I must quickly show you specific tools that you can use beginning right now. So I have 2 tools to offer you. The first Is a general tool. It is a guide to some \u201cfoundational knowledge\u201d It is this: Bruce R. Bain's answer to Is one textbook per topic enough? The second is a more specific tool: Bruce R. Bain's answer to Will we ever be able to understand logic? ",
