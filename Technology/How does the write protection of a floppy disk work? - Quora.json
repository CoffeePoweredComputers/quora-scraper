            "answer_text": "Write protection is one of the helpful safety feature that is in built in 3\u00bd inch Floppy Disks. In order to ensure that nobody copies files to the 3\u00bd inch Floppy Disk or delete a file/s from Floppy disk, the 3\u00bd inch Floppy disk will be write protected. But most people discover it through an abrupt message which they\u2019d encounter while trying to copy/delete a file / folder to/from the floppy disk: To write-protect a 3\u00bd inch floppy disk, look for a tiny black sliding tab in a square hole in the disk\u2019s corner. Slide the tab with a pencil or your thumbnail so that the hole is uncovered. The 3\u00bd inch Floppy disk is now write-protected. To remove the write protection on a 3\u00bd inch floppy disk, slide the little black plastic thingy so that the hole is covered up. If you encounter the write-protect error, wait until the floppy drive stops making noise. Remove the disk, unwrite-protect the disk, and put it back in the drive. Then repeat what you were doing before you were so rudely interrupted. One thing to keep in mind is that Write-protection messages are different than Access Denied messages. ",

            "answer_text": "This is actually one of the most basic write protect systems out there (aside from the microswitch method used to detect the tab on a VHS or compact audio cassette (This method may also have been used on older floppies too but my memory only goes back so far). On one side of the disk (inside the drive) is a light source, on the other side is a light sensor (iirc infra red is used in there to be less affected by stray light from the slot you put the disk in). If the sensor can \u201csee\" the light it considers the disk read-only and sets pin 24 on the interface to logic 0 (assuming I'm reading my old spec sheet correctly, could be the opposite). This applies to both 5.25\" and 3.5\" disks. Also, the same method is used on the other front (edge with the shutter) corner of 3.5\" disks to differentiate between DD (720kB) and HD (1.44MB) disks ",
