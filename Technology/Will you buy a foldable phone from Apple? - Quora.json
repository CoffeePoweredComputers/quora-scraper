            "answer_text": "Probably not. I say that, but without having seen a design from Apple, I can\u2019t say for sure. From Apple\u2019s patent portfolio, it\u2019s clear that they\u2019ve been looking into foldable phones probably longer than anyone. They haven\u2019t shipped them to market for a couple of really good reasons\u2026 Durability is problem with the current batch.Cost is an issue with the current foldable phones.I\u2019m intrigued by the concept of a foldable phone but I\u2019ve yet to see an implementation of that concept that makes me want to get one. Presumably, having a foldable phone might negate the need for a tablet. Yet, when I look at what I use my iPad for, it\u2019s highly unlikely I\u2019d want to give that up for a foldable phone. Right now, it\u2019s an interesting concept that doesn\u2019t actually solve a real need. ",

            "answer_text": "No I won\u2019t. It will surely be very expensive and getting a foldable phone has no benefits. What\u2019s the point of getting a foldable phone though? If it is because of portability then a person should get a smaller device, along with another tablet and the accumulated cost will definitely not be more expensive than one foldable device. ",
