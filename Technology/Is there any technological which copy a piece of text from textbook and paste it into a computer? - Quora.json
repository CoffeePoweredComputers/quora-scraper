            "answer_text": "Lots of them. The one I use the most is the Evernote app on my smartphone. I snap a picture of the text, and poof, it ends up in a note in my Evernote account. From there I can do whatever I want with it such as add it to another note, annotate it, or what have you. Better yet, Evernote will OCR the image so the text is searchable. Another option would be CamScanner which does similar things with a somewhat different feature set. Heck, as a default option you can just take a picture of the textbook in question on your phone, email it to yourself, then download it onto your computer. The only problem there is that\u2019s rather a lot of steps if you\u2019re going to do this with any regularity. Good luck! ",
