            "answer_text": "The most common wireless technologies use electromagnetic wireless telecommunications, such as radio or infra-red signals. ... They can be used within range of the mobile telephone sites that house the necessary equipment to transmit and receive the radio signals these devices emit. Wireless communication uses microwaves and radio waves to transmit information. The advantages of this are: No wires are needed to connect laptops to the internet, or for mobile phones or radio. ... Communication with wireless technology is portable and convenient. Cellular (cell) phones operate with radio frequencies, a form of electromagnetic energy located on the electromagnetic spectrum between FM radio waves and the waves used in microwave ovens, radar, and satellite stations. Cell phones do not emit ionizing radiation, the type that damages DNA A radio tuner receives radio waves and converts them to mechanical vibrations in the speaker to create sound waves that can be heard. Radio waves are a type of electromagnetic radiation best-known for their use in communication technologies, such as television, mobile phones and radios. ",

            "answer_text": "The same way that radio communication is done using a carrier and modulating it. Basic radio technology is used, except that digital modulating schemes like CDMA (Code Division Multiple Access) and GSM (Global System for Mobiles). These may all get merged in 5 G systems. Explaining CDMA and GSM is quite involved unless you are in the engineering course in Telecommunications where you will undergo a course in this. I suggest that you can read more details in many books on digital communications. ",
