            "answer_text": "Your question: \u201cWill iPhone 7 support 5g network?\u201d Assuming you mean \u201cwill an iPhone 7 work on a 5G network?\u201d, the answer depends on whether a given carrier 5G network continues to support the protocols for 2G, 3G, and 4G. In that network, the answer is \u201cYes\u201d. But it will use the older protocols in that case. But that iPhone 7 cannot use any new radio protocols (for 5G) in that new network. Because it is not a \u201c5G capable\u201d phone - the cellular chipset is old. So, if a carrier drops support for 2G, 3G, and 4G - and exclusively focuses on 5G service only in a given market - that iPhone 7 will not work there. ",

            "answer_text": "Most probably it wont. This is why 5G is first of all a developing standard. Some carriers in the US like AT&T have started very limited testing of 5G networks and it is not yet rolled out to the public. In India too, Nokia has signed deals with Airtel and BSNL to deploy 5G networks but I dont think any testing has started so far. So the specifications for supporting 5G are not yet finalised and so device manufacturers cannot come out with a device which they can advertise as supporting 5G.Mostly, 5G like all networking standards till now (2G, 3G, 4G) wont be backwards compatible. For example, you cannot use 3G internet on a 2G phone like Nokia 3310. On iPhone 4s and below you cannot use 4G since they dont support it and are 3G devices. Similarly, I feel even iPhone 7 wont support 5G networks as such kind of support will need hardware level support like new antennas and these cant be done with OTA software updates.",
