            "answer_text": "Solar-powered photovoltaic (PV) panels convert the sun's rays into electricity by exciting electrons in silicon cells using the photons of light from the sun. This electricity can then be used to supply renewable energy to your home or business. In most cases, lithium ion batteries are the best option for a solar panel system, though other battery types can be more affordable. Go to my Profile and you can find all about Solar Panels material there... ",

            "answer_text": "Solar panel generates energy through photovoltaic process and higher the light intensity more is the output current from solar panel. For storing energy batteries are used and after the battery reaches to its maximum voltage through charging the rest energy is given back to grid through inverter. ",
