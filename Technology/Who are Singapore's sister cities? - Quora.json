            "answer_text": "Without hesitation and reservation,I would pick Shanghai,Guangzhou,Xiamei,Taipei and Hong Kong. Of the five cities mentioned,Hong Kong is labelled as the most \u201cSisterly\u201d since it shares many similarities with its Chinese city state located at the Southern tip of the Malayan Peninsula. Malaysians who go shopping or sight seeing in Hong Kong always see Hong Kong and Singapore as \u201cTwin Sisters\u201d. \u201cThey are as identical as can possibly be given that both cities have preponderantly large Chinese populations\u201d ,remarked James Purusugaran who just came back from vacationing with his beautiful Chinese fiance Clarrisa Woo. \u201cWhen I'm in Hong Kong,I always feel I'm in Singapore given the vibrance,excitement and energetic feel both Chinese cities possess in making foreigners like Clarrisa and I feel at home. \u201cIn a way,Hong Kong is regarded as more than sister to Singapore given the close cultural,historical,social and commercial links between the two\u201d, added Purusugaran.
