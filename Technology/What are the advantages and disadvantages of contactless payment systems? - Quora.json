            "answer_text": "Advantages: Better security:  It's far more secure than mag stripe data.  Messages are single use, so reading them is useless.  Skimming is virtually impossible. Without a PIN, a stolen physical card can be used, so it's less secure than chip-and-pin, but mostly because of the pin.  Variety of form factors: Mag stripe is very specifically designed to be on a card, and it's yet to be seen whether EMV will make its way to other form factors (I'm guessing no).  Contactless is found on cards, key fobs, smartphones, vehicles, or virtually anything that can be transported with a person.  Convenience.  Tapping to pay is faster and more convenient than most other forms of payment.  A contactless card, for instance, can be used without removing it from your wallet.  Contactless in transit venues allows lines of people to flow quickly through turnstyles.  The multiple form factors also offers more convenience.  My car can automatically pay-at-the-pump with Speedpass.  I can buy my groceries with my phone.  To my experience, only proximity (iBeacon, Bluetooth Low Energy) and contextual payment systems (like Pay With Square) can meet or exceed the convenience.  More features.  When specifically tied to a smart phone, such as Google Wallet, many features are now available that are impossible for a mag-stripe card or even EMV.  Payment history, virtual card provisioning (safer), remote deactivation, and user-configured pin-protection are just a few of the features.  The sky is the limit here.  Opportunities for innovation.  Primarily due to their viability on smart phones, contactless payments provide a platform for innovation.  In the past 60 years since its invention, what innovation have we seen on the mag-stripe?  Very little (queue the hate mail from the one person with a patent on magstripe oxidation and embossing processes). We've seen quite a bit with contactless in a much shorter time, and continue to see it today.  I expect this trend to continue. Disadvantages: Acceptance.  Contactless cards are accepted at far fewer locations than mag-stripe.  Consumers cannot leave home with only their NFC-capable phone, because they will inevitably need a mag stripe to pay.  Less implicit.  If you have multiple cards in your wallet and you pay without removing them, the winner is random luck.  Sometimes, this can cause real issues (such as errors at transit settings).  Personally, I think this is just a \"feature reality\" but I have heard some complaints about it.Less secure than chip-and-pin.  When you introduce a pin to EMV, using a stolen card in brick-and-mortar is almost impossible.  Contactless could also use a pin (and often does for high-value transactions), but then you lose much of the convenience of contactless payments.",

            "answer_text": "Benefits and risks of mobile contactless payments (by Cleveroad\u2019s article Follow the current situation on contactless payment market ) Benefits Thus, you will be able to take into account all pitfalls you may come across. First, let's speak about its advantages. Convenience for customer For sure, it is a first thing that comes to mind. People don't need anymore to pull out their credit cards or cash. Everything you need is your mobile device. So users can make payments much easier and faster than it used to be. And it also can make you closer to your customers since it increases interaction with them. Expenses reduction You don't need to buy expensive equipment or give the change to customers. Furthermore, you can also forget about paper receipts and ink to print everything out. Users will get all payment receipts in digitized version. So there is a great benefit to nature as well. Speed up the cash flow! When you make a mobile funds transfer, in most cases funds are transferred much faster than when you make usual banking transfer or transfer via self-service terminal. But it can depend on a various situation including a day of the week and particularities of transfer. Integrated Loyalty Programs You can add to your payment system loyalty programs. For example, the client will get the bonus for every transaction or some kind of reward like coupons. In turn, any payment system can draw more clients to use it. High card lifetime if we speak about contactless cards, then, of course, it is impossible to mention the increase of their lifetime. When you use common plastic cards, you always insert it in terminals, ATMs, and it is wearing out very quickly. A magnetic stripe is rubbing away, so then card simply stops functioning. Contactless cards have no mechanical contact so it will play its role until the date of expiration. Risks But not everything is so shiny, and don't forget that there is always a fly in the ointment. Contactless payment also has some drawbacks and we will check it out right now. Always be on the alert! Despite the fact that contactless technology is considered to be one of the most secure, world of fraudsters is trying not to be behindhand. Unfortunately, fraud schemes are developing quickly and malefactors are always looking for ways to steal your money. Today violators create gadgets that may read your card's data and steal money. Even in a crowd, a person can do it. So you should always be on the alert. Outdated technology As it was mentioned above, mobile payments can be much less expensive than the cost of PoS terminals. But even in this case, you need terminals with NFC support and high-tech smartphone. So you will not be able to make contactless payments without these devices. In addition, good Internet connection availability is also required. Various platforms Not everybody is using Android phones only. The same concerns iOS devices as well. So although mobile payments can be similar to each other by its qualities, there is a hardware difference. Apple Pay is using Secure Element for the protection of security data, while Android Pay uses Host Card Emulation. And terminal must be developed considering both of these solutions. Otherwise half of payments may be impossible to be done. Conservatism The human factor is also should be taken into consideration. When a new technology hits the world, no matter how smart and convenient it is, people need a lot of time to adopt it. And before they start using contactless technology, it will take time since they will keep on paying with their usual plastic cards.  ",
