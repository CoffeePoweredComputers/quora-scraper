            "answer_text": "LED TVs are (currently) just LCD TVs with an LED backlight (instead of fluorescent tubes, the technology previously used). Most LED TVs use white LED backlights. White LEDs, in turn, are really blue LEDs coated with a phosphor that emits light over the rest of the visible range: cyan, green, yellow, and red. TVs need to control red, green, and blue light separately, so they use alternating RGB dye filters printed over the LCD sub-pixels. These filters are fairly broad, so the red, green, and blue colours are not fully saturated. They are good enough to reproduce the standard television colour gamut (Rec.709). QLED TVs use a different approach to generate their \u201cwhite\u201d backlight. There is a blue LED producing blue light, along with \u201cquantum dot\u201d phosphors that absorb blue and emit fairly narrow-band green and red light. Instead of the backlight producing nearly the whole spectrum of visible light, it produces only three fairly narrow spectral wavelength ranges, one each of red green and blue. This narrow-wavelength mixture would be a poor white for general room illumination, but it is ideal as a TV backlight. The narrow spectral ranges mean that the red, green, and blue primaries are more saturated in colour, and this allows the QLED TV to reproduce colours that go beyond the colour gamut of ordinary white-LED-backlight LCD TVs. However, QLED is still LCD, and it still can\u2019t reproduce a black line right next to a white line without some light leaking through the black. OLED uses individual organic phosphors at every pixel, so it can reproduce a completely black line right next to a white one. The blacks are better with OLED. On the other hand, all of the consumer OLED panels produce white light and then filter it to produce RGB. Thus, I would expect the OLED TV colour gamut to be somewhat smaller than QLED. Also, OLED brightness is limited. Only the first half of the brightness range comes from the RGB pixels, and thus can be displayed in full colour. The top half of the brightness range is produced by turning on a white pixel (which is more efficient) but it desaturates the colour. And the maximum white brightness of OLED TVs is about 600 nits, while high-end LCD TVs go to 1000 nits and beyond. So, neither technology is completely superior to the other. OLED wins for really black blacks, and thin panels. QLED is brighter and should have a larger colour gamut. ",

            "answer_text": "   Both these technologies are great . LG makes some really high end OLED TVs and Samsung makes some really high end QLED TVs . The only thing that sets them apart is that OLED can turn off the individual pixels which means no backlighting and hence the deepest of the deepest blacks can be seen. On the other hand QLED uses backlighting , so the blacks won't be perfectly black. It's not much if a difference , QLED also gets really really black , just not as much as OLED. Both can produce extraordinary punchy colours .But when it comes to brightness , QLED is better than OLED , also the refresh rate is a bit high in QLED TVs , for example if u see a channel for a long time in OLED , if there's any logo of that , it might leave a small print for sometime when u change , it will take sometime for it to completely change , on the other hand QLEDs don't have that problem . These days all the big TV manufacturers are going with QLED technology . ",
