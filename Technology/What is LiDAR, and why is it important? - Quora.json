            "answer_text": "LiDAR, stands for Light Detection and Ranging,is a remote sensing method that uses light in the form of a pulsed laser to measure variable distances on the Earth. These light pulses combined with other data produced a three-dimensional shape of the Earth and its surface characteristics. LiDAR works in a similar way to Radar and Sonar only it uses light waves from a laser, instead of radio or sound waves. A LiDAR system calculates how long it takes for the light to hit an object or surface and reflect back to the scanner. The distance is then calculated using the velocity of light. These are known as \u2018Time of Flight\u2019 measurements. LiDAR systems can fire around 1,000,000 pulses per second. Each of these measurements, or returns, can then be processed into a 3D visualization known as a \u2018point cloud\u2019. Importance: LiDAR systems are most commonly used for surveying tasks. Because of their ability to collect three dimensional measurements, laser scanning systems are popular for surveying the built environment and elevation models of specific landscapes.LiDAR is also seeing increased levels of adoption for automation applications.Why choose LiDAR over RADAR? Good at detecting small objects thanks to short wavelengthGreat precision, can build an exact 3D monochromatic image of an object.",

            "answer_text": "LiDAR, which stands for Light Detection and Ranging, is a remote sensing technology that functions by illuminating a target with a pulsed laser and measuring the round-trip time (Time of Flight) of reflected pulses with a sensor to determine its distance. While most commonly associated with autonomous vehicles, LiDAR has a wide range of other applications that have the potential to improve a variety of industries. Think of it this way \u2013 LiDAR sensors allow machines to see the world around them, similar to human eyes. When paired with software that can interpret the data the sensors are collecting (the brain), this gives these machines spatial awareness and the ability to react to given situations. The benefits of LiDAR are substantial. Not only can LiDAR see clearly in any weather or lighting condition (unlike cameras) and see in 3D (unlike 2D in cameras and 1D in radar) but the sensors can also be mounted on both static and mobile platforms. Perception software, like QORTEX from Quanergy, can detect, track and classify objects and even has predictive analytic abilities, which can understand if a person is about to cross an intersection, is lost, or attempting to enter a restricted area. LiDAR can be used in any situation where you are looking to gain a greater awareness of surroundings, which makes the possibilities for the technology truly endless. From autonomous vehicles to perimeter security, updating the layout of a retail store based on the flow of people or opening additional lanes at airport security, and even identifying if someone has fallen onto the tracks at a subway station.
