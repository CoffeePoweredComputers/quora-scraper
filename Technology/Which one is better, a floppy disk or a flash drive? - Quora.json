            "answer_text": "A flash drive, unless you\u2019re dealing with a computer so old that it has no USB ports, but does have a floppy drive. At this point, USB flash drives of low capacity are as cheap as floppies, yet hold far more data than the floppies do. They\u2019re also smaller and less vulnerable to damage from water or heat. I\u2019ve accidentally run flash drives through the washing machine and dryer multiple times and had them still work. Good luck doing that with a floppy. ",

            "answer_text": "Flash drives are better in all aspects, except for compatibility with very old computers. They\u2019re smaller, faster, lighter, and universal to any computer with a USB port. The only time you should use a floppy disk is if you need to work with a computer that only has an interface for floppy disks. ",
