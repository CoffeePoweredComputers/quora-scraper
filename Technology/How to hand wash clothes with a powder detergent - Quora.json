            "answer_text": "Laundry detergent will be hard on your hands, so get some rubber gloves.  Put a teaspoon of detergent in your bucket, and fill the bucket halfway with the right temperature of water for your laundry. (Check the care instructions on the label.) Mix the detergent and water until the powder is dissolved.Wash your light colored and/or least dirty clothes first. Probably a couple of shirts or a bunch of underwear and socks will fit in the bucket together. A pair of pants would probably fill it.Put a batch of clothes in the sudsy water and squeeze the water through them and move them around in the water. Let them soak a few minutes (or longer if they're really dirty) and go clean something else in your apartment.Rub (scrub) each piece of clothing in the water some more, checking for stains or extra grime on the neck, cuffs, or other places you tend to get your clothes dirty. You can use your knuckles for a washboard. Add a pinch of detergent if needed to get it clean.Squeeze out the sudsy water and set the wet clothing aside.Repeat steps 3-5 with the next batch.After all the clothes have been scrubbed with detergent, it's time to rinse. Empty the bucket, rinse out any suds with a bit of water.Fill the bucket halfway or up to two-thirds full with cold water. Put your lightest colored clothes in the bucket of water and swish them around. Squeeze the water out in the sink and repeat a couple of times.Repeat for the rest of the clothes, replacing the water if it gets sudsy or dirty.Repeat steps 8-10 until there are no more bubbles or suds when you squeeze out the water.Shake the worst of the wrinkles out of each garment and hang to dry in the bathtub or somewhere it's OK for water to drip from your clothes. Plastic hangers are good. Wire drycleaning hangers can rust and stain your clothing. A piece of rope for a clothesline is good, and you can also use the shower if you won't be getting in your roommates' way.Ugh, I hate hand washing. ",

            "answer_text": "Option 1:-Put your clothes in the bucket, preferably half of it, or less. Take a spoon of detergent powder and spread it on top of the clothes.Open the tap and let the foam form till all the clothes are nicely covered.Move the clothes in the bucket 3-4 times so that the soap is evenly distributed.Wash as your regularly wash post using detergent cake. Option 2-Mix 2 spoons of detergent powder in quarter mug of Luke warm water.Mix it till the foam fikka the mug.Use the foam as and where you'll need to rub the cake.Its easier as you don't need to scrub the cake to form lather. It'll easily go inside the garment.Places where your need harder washes, like collars and cuffs of a shirt, hem of pants. Take the remanang at the bottom of cuff and scrub with that gell'ish powder. Happy washing :) ",
