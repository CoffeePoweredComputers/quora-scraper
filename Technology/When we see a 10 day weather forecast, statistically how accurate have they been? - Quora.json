            "answer_text": "I'm going to assume you mean a \u201c10-day weather forecast.\u201d Weather forecasts are created by meteorologists who have lots of training in observing factors that influence atmospheric patterns and using mathematical models to predict which factors will influence those patterns over time. However, those factors can change over time and thus change what is likely to happen where The most closely watched and publicized weather forecasts in the US are for hurricanes in the southeast states, which usually form in the Atlantic between Africa and South America and move northwest. Some head for the Caribbean, some move into the Gulf of Mexico and head for Louisiana and Texas, and some head for the Florida coast. Coastal airflow can influence where the storm then goes; a recent one took a right turn over Florida's coast and headed north to New England and Nova Scotia. Predictions get riskier the farther away they are in distance and time. Predictions for tomorrow are more likely; predictions five days out are less reliable; predictions for ten days away are even less reliable. All of this is because of the changing influence of other weather factors in whatever is being tracked. ",

            "answer_text": "You\u2019ll have to take a statistics course in order to understand how to pose your question in a form it can be answered. A 10 day forecast has forecasts for ten days \u2014 how do you weight the accuracy for each day. If nine days are wrong and the tenth day is right, what score do you assign to the forecast? It also matters where in the world you are. Here in the USA\u2019s Pacific Northwest we often get fairly accurate long range forecasts because the forecasters and models can see the weather coming down from the Gulf of Alaska for a long time. But we also get very wonky short range forecasts because the Olympic Mountains are upwind of us. Where I live, the average annual rainfall is about 48 inches per year. In the same county, twenty four miles north of here, the Olympic rainshadow results in an annual rainfall of 24 inches. Go further north, to the San Juan Islands and get 15 inches of rain\u2026 Your mileage may vary\u2026 ",
