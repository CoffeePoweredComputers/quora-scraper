            "answer_text": "Short answer: Telephone Exchange is characterised by the following:- - Controlling Application Software- Time-Space-Time Switch for connecting incoming and outgoing \"Time-Slots\"- Processor (Hardware)- Digital Signalling for Call Rout(e)ing- Charging / Accounting for the usage of Resources- Input / Output (I/O) for Operational and Maintenance- ISDN (I.420 / I.421) Capabilities- Advanced Customer Features (e.g. Centrex)- Operation / Maintenance Functions Longer answer: Note that Switch and Telephone Exchange are interchangeable terms. With the Internet, VoLTE, ViLTE, 3GPP IMS, Industrialised Internet of Things (IIOT), Voice / Data OTT applications, 4G / 5G, etc.. the role of Voice Stored Program Control (SPC) Electronic Switches that are better known as Digital Telephone Exchanges is now reduced. Although they are still around in a number of CSP Networks they are now Legacy units of communication that are being sweated using the well known Return of Investment (ROI) approach. Before SPC Switches the Telecommunication Network (Wireline) used electro-mechanical units to process and route telephony traffic. Examples of Electro-Mechanical units are Strowger and Crossbar systems. TXE4E (Nortel) was an example of a solid state switch. Analog Switching systems were gradually consigned to history due to the advanced introduction of Computer Based Telephone Exchanges that used Digital techniques: Signalling (CCITT Number 7 (C7) / ISUP / TUP+/etc..) and Pulse Code Modulation (PCM). This meant that advanced Services could be offered to End Users / business. The Call Processing and Voice Quality was also improved with making Networks Digital. Examples of Digital Switches are: Ericsson's AXE10, Lucent's (now Alcatel-Lucent) (5)ESS switch and Siemen's EWSD. PCM allowed Analog signals to be converted to pure Digital signals. A real milestone for Network Transmission. With Analog Transmission there is a lot of signal leakage and noise that impacts the Switching Equipmemt. SPC Switches are characterised by:- - Controlling Application Software- Time-Space-Time Switch for connecting incoming and outgoing \"Time-Slots\"- Processor (Hardware)- Digital Signalling - Charging / Accounting for the usage of Resources- Input / Output (I/O) for Operational and Maintenance- ISDN (I.420 / I.421) Capabilities- Advanced Customer Features (e.g. Centrex)- Operation / Maintenance Functions SPC Switches have stood the test of time. Now with Data-Centers, SDN, NFV, IP, etc.. another cross-roads is being experienced that is similar to the move from Analog to Digital systems / Networks that was experienced during the 1980/1990s.
