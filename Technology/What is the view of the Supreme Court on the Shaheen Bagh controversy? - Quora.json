            "answer_text": "Supreme Court of India decided to postpone the hearing because SCI wanted to have a conducive environment. Below are the most conducive Ganga-Jamuni tehzeeb performed by Muslim rioters who love peace with sprinkling acid packets, Rocks, Bullets, and Petrol bombs. Islamophobia has been narrated to make us believe that it is unreal but in surreal way.     In order to wait for conducive environment Delhi lost 1000 + crores worth personal and public property. We lost an Intelligence officer whose body was stabbed more than 400 times, a police officer was killed by the peaceful mob, an IPS officer was sent to coma for many days to retrospect why did he chose to serve the nation, a Hindu Shiva temple was destroyed, many Hindus and Muslims got killed. The riot was planned by ISIS and PFI with the help of Indian Muslims who believed Jihad is justified. The prelude was Shaheen bag and practical was east Delhi Muslim riot. As a sincere citizen, I believe the postponement of the judgement on Shaheenbag mazma was deferred, is the epitome of showing the world that we are a secular nation. We can sacrifice the lives of policemen to show the world. It is sign of weakest democracy. I am not sure,if we can produce the judges in the witness box to showcase all video back to back and show them that there are many lives has been lost due to post Holi deferment. After showing the video of the Delhi riot, we should demand justice on their judgement and people who have suffered. If I had been the judge, I would have resigned from the post to take the full responsibility of the irrecoverable damages have done because of my unwise decisions. I would\u2019ve visited every houses of martyrs to console the family. The conscience of judiciary is under the hammer and some drastic measures need to be taken to invigorate the humanity. The answer is my personal view in the current situation. ",

            "answer_text": "I agree with the views of the Honorable Supreme Court in this case. Their finding , protest must be at prescribed places and it must be peaceful is very much appropriate. I didn't find this decision to be unfair. Commuters had to face a lot of problem in the protest. Road blocking is not a nice way to do protest. Emergencies are inevitable. Anything can happen to anyone at any point of time. Roads mustn't be blocked. Well again, this may be my personal opinion . ",
