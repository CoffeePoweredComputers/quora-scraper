            "answer_text": "Hello, im an alumni from SIT here with a degree in mechatronics from the University of Glasgow (UOG).  1) All I can say that SIT aims to be different from the rest of the uni is by teaching more related stuffs practiced in the industry and thus, explains the internship program included. Which means to say, you can get a job once graduate. 2) now I myself did programming in school and I would advise you to please think about your career and go research how programming relates to it. Honestly, the assignments you do in school is insufficient to be used as a industrial standard. Interest alone is not enough as most company demand good quality programming. So in summary please think of what career you wish to do before taking a degree. As your engineering school senior I can tell you that it is NOT EASY studying engineering. ",
