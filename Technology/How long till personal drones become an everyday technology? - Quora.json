            "answer_text": "You both bring up some good points. Using solar cells and making it water proof would (as long as its not damaged while on the ground/water) let a drone go virtually anywhere given enough time. Conversely the normal mail routes are very cost competitive so it would in theory force drone delivery into areas where these are not usable. Within 10 years I predict that drone tech will primarily be used for deliveries into far off locations and by underground organizations. One major thing to watch out for is drug cartels using this to transport their substances over international boarders. Which brings me to my next point.  The Mexico US boarder is the most likely location for this to occur. I would even go so far as a mixture of boat/sub usage and drones used together. Any floating hunk of metal could be floated out into international waters and then launch small drones that have enough energy for a one way long range trip. Another thing. Launch enough of them and it would look like a small flock of birds even on military grade radar. These could also be used to fairy in supplies to refuges in places like the Middle East or Africa where there own governments are sometimes against their people and will not allow aid. ",

            "answer_text": "I would say not for at least 50 years.  Obviously the entire problem is completely cost driven. The competing technology is obviously the Mail and shipping technologies like FedEx. Right now, you can ship something for about $20 obviously plus the cost of driving to the post office, etc. So, until the \"swarm network\" would be able to ship packages in under 20 dollars, it's not gonna happen.  And the technology isn't going to be cheap anytime soon. Only the military would probably really use these technologies, and they're more concerned about putting in lots of features rather than trying to reduce costs. So until then, you're gonna have to make do with cardboard boxes :D ",
