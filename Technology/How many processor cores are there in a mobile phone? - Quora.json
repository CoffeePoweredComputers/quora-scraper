            "answer_text": "The mobile phone in your hand is certainly a lot smarter than you could think of and it is certainly one of the products that you do not know much about. Well, just as a smart person is a result of smart brains, similarly, smart phones are a result of smart brains too and here, the brain which controls the smartphone is its processor. A mobile processor has way more functions than you could think of and besides powering the gaming or multitasking in the smartphone, it is also concerned with the display, connectivity, graphics and camera as well.  And due to this, your smartphone needs to have an utmost powerful processor, the power behind which is generally derived by the cores in the processor. Earlier, the processors used to have just a single processor core. However, now you generally get smartphones which are octa-core in nature and this transition of cores from deca to quad to hexa to octa has really brought a revolution in the smartphone industry.  The octa-core processors which you get are highly sufficient to perform all kinds of heavy tasks. Whether you wish to play heavy games, multitask or install heavy mobile applications, most of the octa-core chipsets would tackle all such situations well. Do CPU Cores Offer Power to the Smartphone?Once, single-core CPUs were enough to support functions such as calling and messaging etc. However, just as the functionality of the smartphone increased, it needed more number of cores in the processor.  In case you have an octa-core processor in your smartphone, the functions performed by the chipset are distributed among the cores. Therefore, an octa-core chipset would support multitasking much better than a quad-core chipset. In fact, an octa-core mobile processor such as MediaTek Helio P22 or MediaTek Helio P70 contains two sets of quad-core arrangements and the tasks are distributed accordingly. Having said that, a major point to note here is that more CPU cores are not always synonymous to more power. Can We Have More Than 8 Cores in a Processor?Talking specifically about the smartphones, more than 8 cores in a chipset is absolutely possible and MediaTek has already experimented with deca-core chipsets i.e. chipsets with 10 processor cores.  Yes, MediaTek Helio X series launched a few years back and some of the chipsets in the series were deca-core in nature. And though these deca-core chipsets were extremely efficient and highly powerful, MediaTek had to stop their production due to the kind of heat generated by the chipsets. So yes, deca-core and even powerful chipsets are capable of being produced but the brands need to control the heating properties.  On the bottomline, nowadays you majorly get octa-core or quad-core chipsets and these are sufficient to perform all kinds of tasks in utter ease. ",

            "answer_text": "Your smartphone is such a powerful piece of device which imbibes innumerable elements, products, and devices in a single pack.  And just as it tends to obtain newer functionalities every now and then, the working capability of the gadget needs to increase too. So here we would tell you about the cores in a mobile processor, its various types, and how each one of them differs in their characteristics: Before this, it is important to know about what cores actually are. You would know exactly that all gadgets have a Central Processing Unit (CPU) and this CPU is made up of several cores. So exactly, cores are little bits of processors that form a complete processing unit. And as the name implies: Single core processor = 1 core in the processorDual core processor = 2 cores in the processorQuad-core processor = 4 cores in the processorHexa-core processor = 6 cores in the processorOcta-core processor = 8 cores in the processorDeca core processor = 10 cores in the processorSo this means, a processor could either be single-core, dual-core, quad-core, hexa-core, octa-core, or deca-core in nature.  More cores = More Power, Is it True? More cores may be synonymous to more power, but only in certain cases. For instance, earlier, we had phones with only a single core and these used to look after each and every function from calling to camera operation and using the internet etc. With dual cores, the power of the smartphones increased considerably and so was with quad-core, hexa-core, octa-core, and deca-core. However, once the processors go beyond quad-core, things take a different turn.  Most of the octa-core processors are actually two quad-core processors which work together. In place of all driving the phone at once, the cores take turns to helm the wheel. Usually, the procedure that may be followed in this is: The cores with low power are set to be used for the normal uses The set of cores with high power will come into play only when you are doing some heavy work such as browsing heavy web pages, video recording, and playing games etc. However, you also need to know that more number of cores is not synonymous to more power. For instance, an octa-core processor is not twice as powerful as a dual-core processor. Though, it is more power efficient since it only uses its full power when it needs to. Also, it's usually a bit faster.  So this means you need an octa-core or deca-core processor with your smartphone; is it? First of all, it is essential to know that smartphones with deca-core processors are currently not available in the market. It was the Taiwanese company MediaTek that first brought the concept of deca-core processors. MediaTek is currently one of the best mobile chipset manufacturing organization that is known for its cost-effective products. Though the deca-core chipsets, which were mostly a part of the X-series of MediaTek, were not continued for long, in spite of the fact that they were extremely powerful. So as of now, we have octa-core processor which are currently the best in terms of power.  However, you need not get octa-core processors every time you buy a mobile. In fact, octa-core mobiles are suitable for those who are heavy games, record HD videos or engage their smartphones in heavy tasks. Besides, if you play just regular mobile games such as Candy Crush etc. and use a smartphone for taking selfies, sending emails, browsing the internet and other such petty jobs, even quad-core processors are enough for the operation.
