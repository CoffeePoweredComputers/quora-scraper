            "answer_text": "Many people have great ideas of new product.But they might do not know what the next? Below are some of my opinion for your reference. I have been in plastic injection molding and tooling for more than 6 years. From my experience,when you come up with some new projects, you need to know: 1, What are they made of? Usually, different materials are made by different processing. For example, when your new project is a metal part, you should not find a plastic manufacturer. 2,Do you know what the processing it should be? If it is made of metal, do you know what the processing it should be? If not sure, do you have samples or prototypes available? All manufacturers custom make parts as per samples or prototypes or 3D drawings. If you have more than one samples/protoypes available, you can send one to the manufacturer to know whether it is in their field.For us, if it is not within our capabilities, we can usually help to transfer the sample/prototype to other factories as per the customer's request. Metals are usually made by die casting(it is also called metal injection molding or MIM), stamping, or extruding. If it is made of plastic, they can usually be made by plastic injection molding, blow molding, rotocasting, extruding, rotational molding,etc. Also, plastic injection molding is the widest used method. For which processing, it depends on the design or constructure of the part. If you are not sure, come to us for help. 3,What should you prepare? Money,of course. *_* Then a prototype or sample or 3D design drawings. To make prototypes, you can find a local rapid prototyping company to do it. If just need to be similar to an existing product, you can get a similar sample from existing market, and tell the manufacture where you need modifications. If it is not new, just need to copy, you can easily get a sample. To make 3D design drawing, one of my customers, I heard that he finds a university engineering major student to create the first 3D. And then send to the manufacturer, the manufacturer must know where should be modified, as the student might not know knowledges in manufacturing. ",
