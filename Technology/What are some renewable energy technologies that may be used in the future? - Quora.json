            "answer_text": "In the long term there are really only three, Hydro that requires no fuel, which is mostly maxed out, and needs dredging to remove sediments behind dams, Nuclear which is the cleanest and cheapest after hydro, and natural gas which is underused and wasted by burning off at the well heads. Another renewable is wood. Wind and solar are not renewable because they require generation backup and/or batteries, both are really expensive, and both have extremely short lives. ",
