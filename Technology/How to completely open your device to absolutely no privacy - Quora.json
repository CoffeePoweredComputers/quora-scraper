            "answer_text": "It\u2019s going to be a wee bit difficult these days, with basically every browser having privacy mode (or whatever they happen to call it), and all kinds of tools to enhance privacy, as it is the norm to try & keep at least a modicum of control over one\u2019s privacy, rather than to abandon it. You can try to approach this by e.g. setting up a computer account with only one user account that everybody shares, but that will only get you so far, because of the privacy modes & whatnot. Having said that, I would recommend having an open discussion with whoever you\u2019re trying to go for zero privacy, because in my experience, it\u2019s a bad idea and basically won\u2019t work. It\u2019s especially bad idea, if you\u2019re having problems with your relationship and try to solve them with \u201ccomplete transparency\u201d\u2026 \u2026but if you\u2019re trying to set your kid\u2019s computer up for zero privacy, that\u2019s not good either, because kids these days need to be taught and trained from very young to guard and take care of their privacy, as the need for it will only increase as we come even more dependent and reliant on computer technology.
