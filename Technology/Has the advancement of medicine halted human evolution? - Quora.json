            "answer_text": "If anything, quite the opposite. \u201cEvolution\u201d is a function of diversity, and medicine means we can sustain a much higher level of diversity than we otherwise would be able to. Diversity is tied to evolution because the way evolution works is that your environment changes. When your environment changes (say, when the world heats up by about 2 degrees F, resulting in global changes to weather patterns, sea currents, and what plants will grow where), this imposes \u201cpopulation stress.\u201d In the wild (In species that do not actively predict future environmental changes and preemptively adjust to them), what happens is that critters with less fur suddenly have an easier time of it in the warmer climate\u2026 and also critters that can range farther without getting tired can move more easily between limited resources that might be getting farther apart (say, water and your preferred prey). So you might have a situation where leaner, faster, less furry versions of a species survive better than their furrier, larger, slower versions. In humans, though, we pretty much tow our entire population along with us, at least in civilized portions of the world (yes, I\u2019m taking a potshot at my home nation, America, here, and yes that\u2019s intentional). This means that when the next great mega-disaster strikes, we don\u2019t just have minor varieties of fur and leanness to pick from\u2026 We have people who see differently, hear differently, think differently, feel differently. We have people of all sizes and shapes. We have strong people who can lift heavy objects and weak people who burn fewer calories. We have creative people for whom repetitive tasks are hellish and hyper-focused people who can reliably do the same work for 12 hours without losing their concentration. So when an Alien species arrives and uses light to enslave everyone except the blind people and sound to enslave everyone but the deaf people, humanity will live on, nonetheless. If that sounds ridiculous, I present to you an example presented to me by a high-school science teacher, Dr. Cohn (an excellent man, and an excellent violinist). It was part of our fruit-fly unit. Class: \u201cBut Dr. Cohn, why do flies still pass along the genes that make wings useless? It seems like evolution might have weeded that out?\u201d Dr. Cohn: \u201cEnvironments change in unpredictable ways! Can any of you think of a situation in which being unable to fly might be an advantage to a fly?\u201d Class: \u201c\u2026\u201d Dr. Cohn: \u201cYeah, bends the mind, huh? Look at that aquarium full of flies over there.\u201d <we look> \u201cWhat happens when I electrify the wire mesh on top?\u201d class: \u201c\u2026 oh.\u201d \u201cNow that might seem hypothetical, but what if a new super-predator invades the region? It\u2019s an aerial hunter though, and it tracks targets that are moving. Suddenly, only flies without functional wings are able to survive, because anything that takes off immediately dies.\u201d So medicine hasn\u2019t halted Evolution for humans. It\u2019s made us much, much better at it. ",

            "answer_text": "It was a hectic program at South Africa with back to back medical lectures and workshops that I had to do. I reached back home tired after a long flight from Cape Town. The first thing that my mom told me once she saw me was \u2018oh my son, you have become so much darker\u2019 Since I happen to hover between \u2018shade 8 to 9\u2019; in a scale of darkness from 1 to 10; my moms comment reiterated the fact that Indian women of all ages are so deeply attached to fair complexion. Her comment also made me start thinking as to what could be the mechanism of getting dark, on sun exposure, that too just in a week\u2019s time. Evolution Evolution is typically driven by need for survival; a biped stance made us run fast with our surveillance system mounted on top of a \u2018180\u2013degree\u2019 rotating neck and a depth sensing stereoscopic vision to detect predators; a off-axis thumb for better grasp; a lung instead of a gill fit for land use. But human ingenuity has taken care of the need itself. Motorised transport has nullified the need for faster running. Telescope and microscope extended the reach of our vision; large array of dish-antenna searching the sky to eavesdrop on the slightest noise from the space, million times powerful than human ear. Does this mean that there is no dire need for evolution? Does it mean we will de-volute; losing our ability to run or climb and such other physical attributes of our forerunners? The answer is no. \u2018Yuval Harari\u2019 author of \u2018Homo Deus\u2019 puts it this way. \u2018Phidipidis\u2019, the Greek messenger ran 42.195 Kilometers from the battlefield of \u2018Marathon\u2019 to Athens to deliver the good news of wining the war; starting off the traditional marathon. In 1908 Johnny Hayes ran the Olympic marathon in 2 hour 55 minutes; shattering the impossible \u20183-hour\u2019 myth. Today the minimum qualifying criteria is 3 hours to get a chance to run for Olympic marathon. The Rio Olympic record of Kenyan \u2018Eluid Kipchoge\u2019 is an unbelievable 2 hours and 8 minutes. This shows that human endurance is increasing, a point against de-volution. There is actually no \u2018Need for Speed\u2019 New \u2019Fast\u2019 Evolution; Genotype to Phenotype We know that genetic code doesn\u2019t easily change unless there is a mutation; but we have evidence that the activity of DNA changes (its ability to transcribe info on RNA and RNAs ability to sequence Amino acids and create a protein). The suppressor and promoter elements of DNA are under the influence of the environment. Such effects, may start to show off quickly in few days time, but contrary to popular belief, may not be transient; the trait may be passed on to the next generation. (scientific American 2018). (https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/what-is-junk-dna-and-what/) Sun exposure, for example, can suppress the inhibitory effect of a melanin (skin pigment) producing gene, and create darkening in a week\u2019s time. May be this is the new evolution in the new medical and technological era; fast, efficient, self perpetuating. Bright African Sun to dark Indian Son My mom died of Alzheimers disease 5 years back. Good that she didn\u2019t have a chance to read the cutting edge science; lest she would have been worried, not just about the colour of her son but the colour of her future grandchildren. ",
