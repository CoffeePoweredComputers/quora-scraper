            "answer_text": "Yes , the iphone 7 costs about 90,000\u20b9 in India . But when you buy it from dubai , it turns out to be about 65,000\u20b9 . This is also applicable with an IPhone 7 from the US I'd suggest you to buy the IPhone on Amazon itself and as it will cost you about 59,000 - 70,000 and is at the proper price range . ",
