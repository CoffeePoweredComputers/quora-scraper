            "answer_text": "Well\u2026this is a great question and I will do my best to provide a decent answer. Judging art is tough and often subjective as many people have a different opinion on what they perceive as \u201cbeauty.\u201d Beauty is always in the eyes of the beholder but with that said, there are certain key elements and principles of design that can be carried through to interpreting art. So let\u2019s go through some of them. Artistic Skill and Execution - There are several kinds of art out there and it depends on your tastes. Some people like realism and others like abstract art. What is key is the experience level and consistency with which the artist executes their work. An Artist who creates \u201crealistic\u201d paintings may appeal to you but someone that creates \u201cabstract\u201d paintings may not. That does not mean the abstract paintings are bad. It\u2019s just different but if the technique is executed with consistency to the point you can \u201crecognize\u201d the uniqueness of their work, then you can attribute a level of skill to that particular work.Beauty - Again this is going to be subjective to some extent but beauty has does have a common attributes from a psychological standpoint. Complimentary colors that are used in traditional paintings that can create a high degree of contrast can be beautiful such as a red dress contrasting against a green wall. In design, you have characteristics such as repetition, rhythm, patterning, symmetry, and composition. A skilled artist may know what you want the viewer to see and lead their eyes through the painting. They may provide a focal point with repetitive shapes and use color combinations that compliment each other.Deep Meaning - Again this is not necessary for good art but many paintings from the earlier centuries had a deep meaning where the artist was a master story teller. His painting me evoke feelings of anger, sorrow, happiness and joy. It all depends on what the artists intent is. Other paintings may be more metaphorical and necessitate the viewer to \u201cdig\u201d and \u201cdiscover\u201d the inner meaning or interpret the meaning of the painting. Other paintings as mentioned, may just be purely visual and represents the skilled technique of the artist and their unique style.Uniqueness - Sometimes creating art that is completely unexpected and opposite to what others are doing, can be enough to promote a sense of curiosity. If you look at a lot of the viral content that is spread throughout the internet, the ones that stand out are the ones that are completely unique, innovative, and surprising. Such work is hard to forget even for the ones that are perceived as poor art. Let\u2019s take for instance the botched restoration of a Fresco in Spain by an elderly woman. The original painting of Jesus by Elias Garcia Martinez was restored by an elderly woman and was in essence unrecognizable. The image went viral and has been a source of countless memes on the internet. From some artistic standards, it would be quite sub-par compared to the original but the result was so different, it ended up being an original piece of work regardless. Only no one quite knows what it is. (bless her heart though)Making a Statement - In our current political climate, many artists have become very politically active and represent their thoughts and feelings through their art. Take recently, Jim Carrey\u2019s artwork on political figures, Pablo Picasso (has several political paintings) or Shepard Fairey\u2019s uber-popular Obama painting.At the end of the day, a great piece of artwork should speak to you and invoke a sense of feeling or emotional response. A good artist is able to use some, a few of the above to get his point across. An exceptional artist is able to master most of these characteristics. Hope this helps.

            "answer_text": "Thanks, Noah, for the compliment of the A2A. You are precisely right. Art is inherently subjective. And though it somehow seems \"wrong\", professionals in the art field do use their subjectivity when they select (or deselect) and write about art. It's simply that they bring more information to the task, so that their subjectivity has a greater objective platform on which to rest.  As Lily noted, when they look at an artwork, they are going to observe it differently than a neophyte art looker - but not necessarily differently than another artist, or many experienced viewers, collectors or connoisseurs.  They are likely to see the composition of the work, its draughtsmanship and structure, its color balance and skill in paint application. They are going to know how it \"fits\" into the artist's overall body of work, and how that body of work slots into the greater parade of art history. They may also factor in what they have read about the artist and the work by writers or critics for whom they have respect - or don't.  But ultimately, they will make their own, very personal assessment. The  assessment will be defined in some measure,  of course, by the task. For example, an evaluation of one of many landscapes from a particular artist in a regional museum being considered for deaccession is an entirely different evaluation than a critical magazine review of that same landscape. While both would be concerned with overall quality, each has a different context and purpose to consider, meriting special considerations.  Beyond these differences, however, the person who ventures their opinion is still going to end up with some level of individual \"liking\" or respect (or possibly the opposite) for an artwork. And that sense, that determination will be essentially visceral. It may have all this extra information underneath it, bolstering it, but our final judgment of whether this or that piece is a 3 or an 8 out of 10  will still be ultimately subjective, because no one can ever do otherwise. We can each only bring ourselves to any artwork, no matter how many degrees in art we have, or miles in museums we've travelled. It's all we have. Our background, our information, our tastes, our biases. In the final analysis -  just us.  This is exactly why we should never, ever take the high priests' of art opinions for anything more than they are - educated opinions. We each are entitled to the legitimacy of what we see and receive from any work of art. And it has been my frequent experience that an open heart can sometimes perceive more than an illustrious intellect. ",
