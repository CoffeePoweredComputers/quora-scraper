            "answer_text": "Yes for sure. But only for general consumers. I have 1Gbit/s Internet access. 1TB on Microsoft onedrive. In some aspects it is convinient to store online, especially when I need information from multiple sites. But 1TB is not enugh, it would not even fit all my pictures. I upload 50GB in 15 min (should take about 9min). So for general use it works. The question is about data security, both the NSA related security, eg. how private are my private data? And against data loss, can the cloud provider guarantee my data integrety for 1 year, 5 years or even untuched for 50 years, nobody knows\u2026 So local storage when I am in charge of it all, including off-site backup is still the best thing. But that is for me, it will change for sure when the bulk of users are at the 1Gbit/s tier regarding speed. ",
