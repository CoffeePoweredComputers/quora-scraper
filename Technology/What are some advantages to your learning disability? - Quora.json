            "answer_text": "As I get older, it is difficult to distinguish my dyslexia from the rest of me, it's simply a part of who I am, how Inthink, and I don't know what it's like to not be dyslexic. What I will share is how myI think my Dyslexic brain has been a net benefit in my life, and seems to follow a pattern that many highly successful dyslexics have encountered.1) I think in systems, I see non-obvious connections between themes and ideas long before other people. This has made me very successful in technology product design and strategy.2) I get people - I have a very deep sense of empathy, and can apply it very practically in everyday life. I notice patterns in behavior, and can anticipate what people are likely to do ahead of time.3) I can talk to anyone, and can often convince them take a course of action. 4) I am very creative. All of the above stills help me to see opportunities well ahead of others, which results in new ideas and products in my work. I have a bunch of patents onideas where I could walk into a room and riff on an idea and come out with several applications. The ideas seemed obvious to me, but apparently they weren't (according to the USPTO). It's weird to say that these talents are part of my disability, but when you look at the list of people who are widely suspected to have had an \"LD\":Sir Richard BransonSteve JobsThomas EdisonAlbert EinsteinWoodrow WilsonGeorge Patton The notion of a 'disability ' gets fuzzy. Maybe the problem isn't with how I learn after all. Maybe, the problem is that we aren't good at teaching to people that fall outside a very narrow set of definitions for normal. ",

            "answer_text": "There is always good when there is less good. People with LD as children recognized as so, receive an improved support at school. They have an aid to help them complete tests, they often get more educated teacher in more teaching tools than the traditional tools. People with LD do not suffer the same anxiety to produce impeccable results which is very hard for children without issues to live. Many children with higher capacities develop depression very young and are, for life, marked by a duty to produce excellence which no one can do at all times. There is another advantage, which is you can change. From a neurological point of view, which is mine, I know that the brain is plastic and I was lucky to work with people with very severe LD amongst whom were a few people with Down syndrome who have so much difficulty to learn while being intelligent, and see them develop capacity to memorize, develop new memory systems, new learning tools and do just fine. This is a great question! Thanks for asking it. ",
