            "answer_text": "From my years of running test automation programs and doing interviews with probably a 100 candidates, I wouldn\u2019t say that there are \u201cfake\u201d Selenium testers. I would say that there are plenty of beginner testers that drastically exaggerate their skill level. I certainly find this to be a problem as well, especially when looking for solid test automation engineers. To prevent this kind of problem and hire experienced Selenium engineers, I follow some of these principles taken from Google: Skills Assessment (screen share): A hands on coding exercise where we test their ability to write some simple code by solving a simple problem. We actually do this right up front after the phone interview. If the candidate sounds promising, we just do a screen share and watch them write some simple code. This will weed out 90% of the testers that are drastically exaggerating their skills. Also, this is great because it will not waste many people\u2019s time if the candidate isn\u2019t up to par. You will not need to wait to find this out at the in-person interview.Job Knowledge Test: Don\u2019t focus too much on the resume. Asking questions related to skills is great. But I\u2019ve found that some individuals have a knack for speaking well. But when it comes to actually doing the work, they fall short. Hence, asking questions about experience and automation strategy and their thoughts on test automation pyramid and shifting left might be helpful to catch red flags. But ultimately, we\u2019ve seen people succeed in this step and drastically fail at the coding quiz. Research shows that there can be a gap between theory and practice.Skills Assessment Test (in person): A hands on coding exercise in person of at least 30 minutes. Ask the Selenium engineer to perform the exact task that they would in their real job. Have them spend at least 30 minutes coding an automated test for your web app. Something super simple, like a login. But see their output and their thought process. This will reveal how they will perform on their job. Research shows that a skills assessment is the most indicative of good job performance.Cognitive Ability Test: Cognitive ability tests measure a candidate\u2019s general mental capacity. You can test the person on something like working through a code refactoring or solving some automation problem. Research shows that these types of tests are some of the best in showing how well a person will perform on their job. I\u2019ve found that to be pretty accurate in the workplace as well.I know that this might seem like a lot to implement for an interview. However, if you are really in search of a quality candidate, I\u2019ve found that this is the process that needs to be applied. Bill Gates says that one good software developer is worth 1000 bad ones. I\u2019ve also found this to be true with Selenium testers as well since test automation is really a development skill. If you find one right candidate, your entire automation program can transform and blossom. Depends on what you want of course. UltimateQA.com ",

            "answer_text": "First of all there are no fake selenium testers. There are beginner selenium testers and then there are experienced selenium testers. Being a beginner you don't work on real projects so they are unaware about the complex issues which an experienced person faced and therefore found a solution for this. To know whether a person is experienced or not in selenium,I follow these steps in interviews. Carefully looking at the job description in his/her previous companies to know what was his/her background.(50% of the cases I found it from CV itself).Asking whether person has experience in writing/modification of frameworks based on selenium or not(an experienced person have this experience and beginner doesn't)-30% of the cases I found this from this question.Since using selenium requires two things-solid oops concepts and solid xpath knowledge therefore few basic questions on these helps me found out 10% of the cases where the person actually understand basics.Last 10% are the most difficult they are beginners but they really work hard by themselves and they know selenium classes,methods and oops concepts. I give them the intermediate level questions where I found the difficulty during working on framework creation and tests scripts writing myself. Also I ask questions about overriding the built in selenium interfaces methods and using customized classes. 7\u20138 % of the cases I found it from this question.Last 2\u20133 clears all these questions, they are very smart even though they haven't worked on real projects but tried their hands on public websites. I find them useful in 2\u20135 years of experience range but can't take them in 5+ role where you have to work as mentor as well.Remember every experienced person was once a beginner so next time you ask this question please rephrase the word \u201cfake\u201d.
