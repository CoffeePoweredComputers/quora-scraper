            "answer_text": "Environmental sustainability would have the following features: Wastes would not build up in such a way as to seriously threaten ecosystem viability, that is, all types of waste (air pollution, water pollution, land wastes) would degrade to harmless products at a rate fast enough so that they wouldn't threaten the eco-system or society.Resources wouldn't be consumed at a level beyond what the earth generates e.g. if the earth contains 1000 units of wood and generates 10 additional units of wood per year, humans would not use more than 10 units of wood per year.In practice this would mean: Delivering all of the goods and services with the absolutely minimum physically possible resource and energy use.Building products to last as long as possible and be easy to recycle once they are no longer usable.As close to 100% recycling of waste as possible (in a human time frame, as all waste gets recycled eventually).100% renewable energy use (or something like fusion which is practically and infinite energy source).Achieving a stable population that did not violate the first two features (unless we were expanding into space in which case population growth could continue indefinitely).Preserving enough habitat so that the ecosystem i.e. all the plants and animals could thrive and their extinction rate was no more than the background extinction rate which is about 1 per year.",

            "answer_text": "It depends on the implications of the question: do you mean environmental sustainability for the sake of the planet in and of itself (meaning, a planet without us) or environmental sustainability for the sake of humans living within it, and trying to survive and thrive within the Earth's carrying capacity? For the latter one, there are a couple of science-based answers that I am happy to chip in with, but it's important to clarify first. Best, M. ",
