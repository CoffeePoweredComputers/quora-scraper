            "answer_text": "Why not ? Self-replication relies on some parts or \u2018food\u2019 from which to do the construction. Plants and animals take in simple chemicals. Machines can use a level of pre-built parts. A machine, say an assembly robot, could look at its bill of materials and order the parts from Amazon/eBay, then follow its assembly instructions and at the end copy its assembly instructions into the new machine it has just assembled. 3D printers can be ordered on online. Any custom metal and plastic parts for the arms and hands can be 3D-printed from designs included in the robots assembly instructions. So we just need a general purpose assembly robot with some software for online order placement, \u2026 and money. The hardest/slowest part might be that each robot needs to somehow earn money to pay for its parts, or to give to the ones it builds. It could perhaps earn money on the internet, or just do paid-for assembly work for other people. It could be a product assembly subcontractor, or just run a 3D-printing shop. That probably needs a level of AGI, yet to be developed. The electro-mechanical design and software would be complex, the money earning and assembly time might be long. Without money, the robot might need to infest an Amazon warehouse to steal its parts - it would be a parasite. So it depends on your definition of practical (and if you accept my definition above of self-replication). ",

            "answer_text": "If by self-replicating you mean a machine which is capable of producing exact, functional copies of itself, such a thing is not practical if even possible. If you consider all the components that are essential to build even a fairly simple automated device or machine, you\u2019ll see why. Most of the parts, such as ball bearings, gears, fasteners, motors, printed circuit boards, ICs, wires and sensors can only be made by highly specialized machines in separate manufacturing facilities. Some of the simple, structural parts could be made by flexible manufacturing processes, such as CNC machining or 3D printing. Each of the machines required to make the above mentioned parts is itself a highly complex machine requiring many specialized components. There is really no way that a device that\u2019s also flexible enough to be used for a different purpose could make itself. Self-replication only occurs in biology, which has its own complex system of encoding a method of reproducing itself, called DNA. ",
