            "answer_text": "While I cannot speak to its worth in India, I definitely wouldn't buy it in the US where I live; even if I didn't have my 6s Plus or any other iPhone. Other answers to this I've seen are more detailed, but I'll keep it simple. It will not perform well. Unless you find one still running iOS 5, 6, or 7, it is going to be noticeably slow. The iPhone 4s was made for iOS 5, and it runs that extremely well\u2026 it's just quite outdated now. It doesn't support LTE. If you have 4G LTE available in your area, the iPhone 4s cannot use it but will instead run on a 3G network if available. If you are used to 3G this is fine, but it is pretty slow if you are used to 4G speeds. There will be issues with apps. Many popular apps now require iOS 9 to run, or at least iOS 8. This year Apple will release iOS 10 (or whatever they decide to call it; they may try to get creative with the number 10) and the 4s honestly shouldn't support it since it handles iOS 9 so poorly. The hardware is obsolete. While it may be fine for some, there are far better options out there now. The 4s has a slow processor and low-quality cameras compared to newer devices, and the screen may be clear (it's a Retina Display) but it is incredibly small and limiting to what you can do with it. Most are closer to breaking than newer phones. While the 4s is pretty durable, if you buy it used it is likely considerably closer to its death than newer phones even at the same price point. You would need to find the rare one in great condition to avoid this.  I would definitely recommend thinking twice about buying an iPhone 4s these days. While I am not well-versed on the state of smartphones in India, it is an older phone and there are far better options now at that same price point. If you absolutely must have that Apple logo, it may work. But I highly recommend a budget Android phone which won't be the best but at the same price point as the iPhone 4s will likely be much better assuming it is newer than the 4s and either new or like-new. There are plenty of resources available online to help you find the best phone for you, including budget phones. ",

            "answer_text": "It's a bad idea. I'm using 4S since 2012 and I still like it, but I won't recommend it now to be bought. Some of the reasons are- It has a very small screen. So small that sometimes I really get frustrated with the size. It's a huge drawback. The screen is also not HD or something, it's just mediocre.It's slow, it used to be fast but as iOS has been updated, it has become slow compared to today's standard. It doesn't lag or hang, but apps take up a lot of time to load. This is especially the case with iOS 8. Also the 4S won't get any iOS updates from now.Front facing camera is bad. It takes pixelated and blurred pics. Though the rear one is still amazing.Battery life is poor. I've to charge it 2 times a day with medium usage.It's thick and heavy. Put on a case and you'll regret buying it.On a positive note, 4S still looks elegant and classy, it's rear camera is amazing as well! The screen quality is also fine, but size is very small.  It actually isn't worth it, as there are better options available at this price point. MOTO G, Grand 2, and others are more worthy than this.  Go for it only if you want that Apple logo. ",
