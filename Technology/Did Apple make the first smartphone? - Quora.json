            "answer_text": "Not even close. Apple was off by more than a decade. The first smartphone is often credited to IBM in 1994, the Simon Personal Communicator. The phone still looked like a block 80\u2019s cellular phone, and wasn\u2019t even as sexy as the Nokia feature phones that were its contemporaries, but it was the first to have some real PDA capabilities that are what set apart a smartphone from a \u201cdumb\u201d feature phone.  What Apple did create though was the first \u201ctrue\u201d PDA \u2014 the Apple Newton, a big slab of a device that had a stylus, back in 1993. Most people when they think \u201cPDA\u201d think Palm, but the Newton predated the Palm Pilots by three years.  The Simon was basically an Apple Newton that had a phone attached, making it technically the first smartphone in the world. The first \u201creal\u201d smartphone though was the Nokia 9000 Communicator. It\u2019s what put smartphones on the map.  The Communicator was the refinement of its predecessor the HP OmniGo 700LX, which was a collaboration between HP and Nokia. It\u2019s hard to take this device seriously, because it\u2019s basically a small clamshell laptop with a Nokia 2110 dock literally soldered on top.  The Nokia 9000 Communicator was a real trendsetter, but what really dominated the smartphone landscape before the iPhone came out in 2007 where the Palm Treo line and the various Windows Mobile devices which were without a doubt the most advanced smartphones of the time until the iPhone came out, along with the Blackberry phones which dominated the Enterprise segment. These devices came out in 1996 and onwards, and were a full decade of smartphone computing before the iPhone even came out. The Palm Treos, Windows Mobile phones and Blackberrys were all big name brands that predated the iPhone by many years, some by a decade. It\u2019s also interesting to note that Samsung had some really good Windows Mobile device back then, including one of the big best-sellers of its time, the Samsung Blackjack, which people affectionately called the Samsung Crackberry. HTC was also a major player in these days, being the OEM manufacturer for the vast majority of Pocket PCs being made at the time. So no, Apple didn\u2019t make the first smartphone, and was more than a decade late to the party actually. But wow, did they revolutionize the industry when they did.     ",

            "answer_text": "As with all \"first\" questions, you need to define your terms with complete precision. If you mean an integrated Personal Digital Assistant and Mobile Phone, one might declare the Nokia 9000 Communicator in 1996 to be the first smartphone. The Ericsson R380 was the first device marketed as a smartphone in 1999. Windows CE, BlackBerry and the Palm Treo series phones all predated the iPhone, but they were all painful to use in their own special way. They were all starting from the assumption of: \"I have a phone, let\u2019s add computer-like capability to it.\" Constraints like size and long standby battery life hobbled both screen size and CPU power. Apple hit the problem from the other end with iPhone. It was a computer that happened also to be a phone. It was a clean-slate design, 100% touch screen, no keypad or keyboard, battery life be damned. PURE HERESY to the existing industry. Even more heretical: The iPhone was sold and marketed DIRECTLY to consumers as an Apple-branded device. The business model of the time had phone vendors selling handsets to carriers, who sold them to consumers with the carrier branding alongside the manufacturer. Those phones were also burdened with tons of carrier mandated crapware, and hobbled with offensively bad user experience. Apple demanded, and got, full user experience control and complete removal of all carrier branding and crapware. Apple caught the mobile phone industry in transition, and made a whole new experience. So Apple didn't make the first smartphone. They made the first smartphone that didn't suck. ",

            "answer_text": "Did Edison invent the electric light bulb? Most would say yes, even though Humphry Davy demonstrated a working electric light about 80 years before Edison did. The main reason Edison is credited with inventing the bulb is because his invention was so much better than the existing products that it completely changed the market. Before the iPhone there were phones which had features of a smartphone, but the iPhone re-defined what a smartphone should be. So much so that today none of those would be called smartphones. The iPhone was so far ahead of those phones, that NONE of those phone platforms have survived. Android had to totally re-invent itself, as did Windows, Blackberry, Nokia, Palm and Samsung, with varying degrees of success. Most likely, history will regard Apple as the inventor of the modern smartphone. ",

The iPhone was the first mobile phone with a capacitive multi-touch display and an interface based on multi-touch gestures, which is the most recognisable quality of today\u2019s smartphones. There were other phones before it that had a somewhat similar touchscreen interface (but no multi-Touch), and there were a number of features that were unique to the iPhone that made it revolutionary, which is why\u2019s the industry experts widely consider it the first modern smartphone. I have no doubt that this question will quickly gain plenty of answers saying yes and no, from various tribes in the smartphone wars. There may be Some who will try to claim that there was nothing new or revolutionary in iPhone, because other products presumably already had all those features. Such statements are misguided. You may despise Apple for whatever reason, but they rightfully deserve credit for the revolutionary change in the mobile phone industry. ",

            "answer_text": "You have to define the word \"smartphone\". If \"smartphone\" means \"phone that can be used like a modern multimedia computer\", then the answer is no. There were phones coming out for the previous decade that claimed to have Internet capability, the ability to run applications of some kind, to be used as cameras, etc. Microsoft had several varieties of Windows Mobile, which tried to squeeze a bowdlerized version of Windows onto the tiny phone screen form factor. Palm had their Treo line, which incorporated phone capabilities into their decaying Palm Pilot brand. RIM ruled the roost with the Blackberry, essentially a texting device with some (bad) phone capability and (terrible) Internet browsing. Their secure texting capability was what attracted corporations to the platform and drove RIM's growth. If \"smartphone\" means \"phone that can do all that, without making you want to throw it across the room\", then the answer is yes. ",

            "answer_text": "This is so funny. There were heaps of GOOD smartphones about before the iPhone. But the iPhone was all about marketing the product well and making out like it was something new. Which it wasn't. Until then smartphones were the things geeks / businessmen used. The iPhone sold it as fashion. The first smartphone to come out that the iPhone REALLY stole a lot from, was the Sony Ericsson P800. If you take off the removable keypad you basically have a big chunky ancestor of the first iPhone, that does pretty much everything the first iPhone did. It came out in 2002 half a decade before the iPhone. With apps and mobile internet and camera and email\u2026 the lot. The functionality is extraordinarily similar between the two devices. Apple took that nerdy blueprint and in a moment of genuine marketing genius, remade it into a fashion item with awesome build quality, better size, better screen and a marketing budget the size of Canada. So Apple's genius was to be the first company to really successfully mass market the smartphone as a device for the common people. They didn't invent it. They lovingly refined it. ",

            "answer_text": "No, there were loads of smartphones before the iPhone, even ones with app stores. People have a revisionist idea of history when: a) They're too young to remember stuff.b) They really, really like certain companies. I seem to be the only one here who didn't find BlackBerry, Symbian, Palm, or Windows CE devices to suck (OK, maybe Windows CE). I liked the keyboards, the stylus, and the OS which you could install anything you liked on it. Obviously hardware technology has moved on, but our uses of smartphones have gone from Pocket Excel to Angry Birds, so while our abilities to make powerful, productive smartphones is higher than ever, the market for them is eclipsed by the market for tweens posting pictures of themselves on social media. </misanthrope> ",

It was a giant step up from the Motorola RazR it replaced and gave me full Internet capability in my hand, 24x7, with the no-cap unlimited data plan which accompanied it at AT&T. I was literally buying other phones and parting them out, surfing the phone hacker boards for unlocked OS updates, all sorts of stuff to keep it alive before finally giving up and getting an iPhone 4 in 2010. I'm an iPhone believer today, because of the ecosystem. There are still many things that the 8525 did much better than even my 5S. ",
