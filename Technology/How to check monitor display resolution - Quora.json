On the window that opens, scroll down and there should be a drop-down box labeled \u2018Resolution\u2019. If you click the drop-down, you will see the resolutions that your monitor supports.  The resolution marked \u2018Recommended\u2019 is the resolution of your monitor. Here is a wiki-how article with details for Macintosh as well. ",

            "answer_text": "It\u2019s measured by number of pixels across the screen. SD 720 HD 1920 UHD 3,840 4k 4,096 So\u2026 if you have a 36\u2033 display, the size doesn\u2019t change with different resolutions, but the number of pixels change. If your input is created at HD 1920, and you play it back at UDH, it\u2019ll take those 1920 pixels and display them stretched across 3, 840 pixels. Since it\u2019s double, it\u2019ll look pretty good\u2026.actually very good. But of you have SD 720 and play it over 4,096 pixels it\u2019ll look bad. So resolution is the number of pixels the display has\u2026 not per inch like printing because\u2026 an 80 inch UHD has the SAME number of pixels as a 36 inch UHD display. ",
