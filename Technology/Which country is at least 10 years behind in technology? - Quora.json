            "answer_text": "We live so comfortably in our Wi-Fi connected homes with smartphones and apps that can deliver almost anything to our doorstep that we often forget there is a whole another world out there. While some of the countries just don\u2019t have the right terrain to support and develop technology, others don\u2019t have the right funds for it. There are countries like Timor-Leste which are located on such isolated islands that setting up electricity and telecommunication lines prove to be extremely expensive. And then there are countries like Sierra Leone which are engulfed by locals wars so often that technological advancements is not even an option when people are just trying to survive. And then there is Lesotho where technological advancements aren\u2019t really a priority since 50% of their female population is affected with HIV and sexual violence. The country is more focused on being able to provide better healthcare services to their citizens than faster internet. ",
