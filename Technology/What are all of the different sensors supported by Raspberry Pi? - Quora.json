            "answer_text": "Raspberry Pi supports almost all standard sensors that you use with other micro-controllers as well! Raspberry Pi 3 has over 26 GPIO pins so you can connect plenty of sensors to it at a time. But Raspberry Pi has only digital pins and no analog pins like arduino. Lots of sensors are designed to give analog values. So this part plays tricky! You have to make changes in your code accordingly to read values from the sensors. Listing a few sensors that can be connected to Raspberry Pi: DHT11 and DHT22 humidity and temperature sensor BMP180 Barometer MCP3008 Soil sensor MQ Gas Sensor PIR Motion Sensor HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor Magnetic Switch / Reed Relay GP2Y0A02YK infrared distance meter RFID-RC522 \u2013 Inductive RFID card reader MPU-6050 Gyroscope HMC5883L / GY-271 Compass\u2026.Lots More ",
