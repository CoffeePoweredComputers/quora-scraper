            "answer_text": "This is a question which may have 2 answers. I will try to answer both a bit and leave it on you to decide. A call center as a business will earn from the process which it works on. It can be an in-house or in sourced. There are several factors which play a role in deciding the payment amount of a call center. There are several KRA or you can say certain benchmarks for measuring performance when it\u2019s a outsourced process. For example : if it\u2019s a customer care ,then ideally performance is ranked by customer satisfaction score. And the CallCenter is paid by the Client on the basis of customer satisfaction. Basically this becomes a regular cycle. Customer is happy with customer service (CallCenter) and he/she continues paying for the goods or services to the Client and for this good work the CallCenter gets paid by the Client. On the other hand I run an in house sales process. There are benchmarks or targets we have to Meet to carry on the business.So I get paid directly by customers or end users. I hope I have answered your question with some personal examples or experiences which may help. ",
