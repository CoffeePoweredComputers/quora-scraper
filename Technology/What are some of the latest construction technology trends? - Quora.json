            "answer_text": "Here some of the latest construction technology given below and to know more visit this article.  Some of the construction tech trends we\u2019re watching this year are closely related to tech trends we started watching in 2016(mobile apps and big data). Others have been percolating for a few years now (thermal imaging and cloud computing), and we expect big advances this year. And others are just plain cool (holographic headsets and construction exoskeletons), and we want to see if they\u2019ll make it into the mainstream this year. CLOUD COMPUTING The cloud isn\u2019t new to industry tech trends lists, but it\u2019s lining up to have a huge impact on the construction industry in 2017. Many of the other tech trends discussed in this article would not be possible without the cloud. It\u2019s compulsory for big data, mobile applications, virtual reality design and the Internet of Things. The \u201ccloud\u201d consists of storage and computing resources that your device (smartphone, tablet or PC) can only access via a network connection (wi-fi, cell service, Internet, etc.). Most construction companies have either demoed or rolled out file sharing applications like Dropbox or Google Drive to make it easier for workers, contractors, clients, regulators and any other interested parties to access designs, permits and other documents. But file sharing is just the beginning of how the construction industry will take advantage of the cloud. According to Dexter + Chaney President and CEO Norbert Orth (as told to Construction Executive): \u201cCloud-enabled and mobile friendly, the industry\u2019s next generation of software will help contractors realize two important things: a more streamlined and timely flow of information between the office and the jobsite, and the delivery of more powerful information tools into the hands of the folks who need them in the field.\u201d BIG DATA \u201cBig data\u201d is simply that: supremely large amounts of related information. The trend centers around using algorithms to extract meaningful insights from these sometimes unstructured data \u2018dumps\u2019; insights that help companies make better decisions about how they can work more safely, productively and efficiently. Where is all this information coming from? Digital video, sensors, building information modeling (BIM), enterprise resource planning (ERP) software, wearables and other technologies produce massive amounts of data. Technology companies see opportunity in the construction industry to use data sources such as digital designs, materials receipts and video inspections for big data analytics. They write an algorithm to retrieve and organize the data, and then produce predictive analytics or business intelligence that you or your competitors are willing to pay handsomely for. Builders are already seeing big data results in the form of more sophisticated software, increased mobility, stronger designs, faster builds and longer-lasting structures. MOBILE APPS The Fieldwire task management app. About the only tool that construction industry professionals of all levels use every day is a cell phone (one of 1998\u2019s tech trends?). Tablets are becoming more popular on the jobsite and you can almost always find at least one laptop there. Thanks to the cloud and faster mobile and Wi-Fi networks, increased mobility and agility keep the construction industry humming. And I\u2019m not just talking about phone calls and text messages. Mobile apps for time tracking, estimating, invoicing, design, material ordering, printing, collaboration, drone control, resource tracking and just about everything else except the actual building are growing in popularity. Nearly 80 percent of construction industry professionals who participated in a JBKnowledge survey dubbed mobile applications as important or very important. To keep from overwhelming you with too many different applications, look for the industry to consolidate or at least collaborate to integrate multiple functions in fewer apps. VIRTUAL REALITY DESIGN Last year we mentioned BIM as one of the tech trends to follow, and it continues to trend upward. The next step in 3-D modeling is to actually inhabit the model. Currently, the most common way to view 3-D models is on the 2-D screen of a tablet or laptop. Designers and builders can get more value out of the model when they\u2019re able to fully immerse themselves in it. Companies such as IrisVR specialize in converting 3-D plans into a virtual reality (VR) experience. According to this article in GeekWire, \u201cWhere the technology really has the potential to make a difference in the industry\u2026is in planning complex medical and industrial projects.\u201d Other large marquee projects will also start using more VR design. In a recent Construction Dive article, Aaron White of structural engineering firm Walter P. Moore said of designing stadiums, \u201cWe\u2019d like to start using VR modeling of de-shoring the tower headers before we send workers up 150-foot towers.\u201d The VR environment would improve safety and efficiency, allowing workers to determine which tools they will actually need to complete a project. HOLOGRAPHIC HEADSETS VR headsets such as Google Cardboard, Oculus Rift, Gear VR or HTC Vive will immerse you in a fantastic virtual world and work well with virtual design. However, if you want to overlay and interact with models and designs in a real-world environment\u2014known as \u201cmixed reality\u201d or \u201caugmented reality\u201d\u2014then you need a holographic headset. DAQRI Smart Glasses and Microsoft Hololens (watch the video to see how mixed reality works) are leading the charge into designing with holograms. The biggest advantage is that you can design and make alterations in the physical environment where you\u2019ll be building. Although still in their infancy, using holographic headsets in augmented reality could offer real benefits in the form of faster builds with fewer mistakes, resulting in substantial cost efficiencies for builders.

            "answer_text": "A few years ago, the construction industry was shifting from traditional methods to introduction of digital trends. This was the time when the industry introduced various automation processes and IoT in its working. Today, the industry is considerably well-developed and digitalized. In this scenario, the current focus of the domain has shifted to long-term sustainability and green-planet initiatives with better efficiency. - Building Information Modelling (BIM): BIM is basically a centralized management model created on shared systems, where the 3D design and modeling are used to provide all stakeholders, real-time information on the project. - Use of Green Technology: Each and every project today is focused on creating eco-friendly and sustainable constructions either using technology or organic, renewable material. - IoT in construction: Smart buildings, high-tech cities, and smart grid planning are all examples of how much IoT adaptation has increased in construction - Virtual Reality: AR/VR technologies are rapidly being adapted in construction. Building simulations and assistance in 3D Construction Printing (3DCP) are being used for better constructions. - Wearable technology: Wearable technology, as well as mobile-based applications, are helping construction sites to become safer and more efficient, with real-time inputs and faster response rates to potential hazard situations. With the use of new technologies like Artificial Intelligence and Virtual Reality, I think the scope of technology in this sector can increase tenfold. ",
