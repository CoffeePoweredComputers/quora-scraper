Almost all men who have tried both true lather and canned foam agree that, in terms of shave quality and enjoyment, it goes like this: Worst: cartridge razor + canned foam Better: DE razor + canned foam Better yet: cartridge razor + true lather Best: DE razor + true lather To make true lather will require a shaving brush, which (like the razor) is a one-time purchase. Here are some excellent shaving brushes for around $10: Maggard Razors 22mm Black Handle Shaving Brush Synthetic or RazoRock KEYHOLE Plissoft Synthetic Shaving Brush - 22mm or The Green Ray - 24mm Hybrid Tribble Synthetic Brush - Retro Shave Tech! And you\u2019ll need a shaving soap. It can be a premium soap (like Ultra Premium Formula CK-6) but even regular shaving soaps are quite good. Browse through these, noting the ingredients: All Shaving Soap - Van Yulay, All Brands of Shaving Soaps and Creams, Creams & Soaps - ItalianBarber, and http://phoenixartisanaccoutrements.com/collections/phoenix-shaving-soap. Loading the brush takes about 10 seconds:  Read A disquisition on blade sampler packs to learn more about blades, and read this post for basic info: A brief guide to the gourmet shaving experience. UPDATE in response to a request in a comment: What about multiblade cartridges? Answer is indicated above: a good double-edge razor and blade give a better shave \u2014 better in terms of the process (enjoyable, smooth, efficient) and in terms of the result (smoother, not so scratchy). One problem of the multiblade cartridge is the resistance and drag: the Fusion has five cutting blades, so when you make a stroke with the razor you have to pull five edges through stubble: five times the resistance encountered by pulling a single blade through the stubble. So the cutting action of a DE razor is much easier. Moreover, the tug-and-cut action of a multiblade cartridge exacerbates the problem of ingrown whiskers since when a whisker is tugged out and then cut, the cut end can be below skin level. For men whose beards are curly, this often results in an ingrown whisker. So far as smoothness of the result, many men have commented that after they switched to a DE razor and did a three-pass shave with true lather their children or grandchildren as well as their significant other remarked that their face was no long scratchy. Another advantage is that because DE blades are cheap, men tend to change the blade before the shave is really unsatisfactory. Because multiblade cartridges are expensive, many men use them long after the shave has become unpleasant (in part because these men do not realize that a shave should be enjoyable). So another reason a DE razor cuts more easily is that the blade is likely to still be sharp. ",

            "answer_text": "In a way, yes. But there are pros and cons. With a blade, one pass cut the hair whiskers once. With 2,3,4,5 blades, you are effectively cutting 2,3,4,5 times with each pass. That mean 4,6,8,10 with 2 passes and so on. It all depends how cleanly you can shave with minimal passes. If you have hard to reach areas of the cut angle isn't right, you can get unnecessary razor burns. The more irregular your beard pattern is, with different angle of growth, demanding different approaches, the less is better. I have a sparse beard and although I've tried 1~5blades, the optimum for me is 2 or 3 blades, with minimal razorburn. I chose cartridge blades for convenience of ease over anabsolute shave. However, your lubrication on the skin also important. ",
