            "answer_text": "I had several digital assistants in the 80\u2019s 90\u2019s. They were about 5 times the volume of my Samsung 8, Note. The screen on my last one was a touch screen. And it almost fit my pocket.. business suit. My boss in the early 90\u2019s had a wireless telephone with a curly cord to a 12 volt lead acid battery. Heavy. The first thing; was cellular radio. The bosses\u2019 phone had a 5 watt radio. Cell phones only need to get to a tower, not to downtown. And didn\u2019t need a single set frequency per telephone, registered with the government. The second thing was small powerful batteries. Nicads were close but heavy. The third was color LCD screens with graphics, and low power. Gray screens were boring. The main thing though was the computer and it\u2019s separation from a hard drive. As the computer gained speed and the memories increased in size, gaming.. apps.. music\u2026.. All of those things were necessary. It is a continuing progression of advances. Earth cellular satellites will be next. For long distances, they can be faster than fiber when mixed with a few earth stations. When there are 30,000 cell satellites, there is no dead spot in the world. ",

            "answer_text": "Star Trek Their communicators and Tricorder provided a vision of modern cellphones. There are lots of other answers about technology, also valid. But remember that what we now call 1G cellphones -1980s technology - was quite primitive in every sense. They weren't much more than walkie talkies that could patch through to the telephone network. 2G in the 1990s was the beginnings of modern cellphone technology. ",
