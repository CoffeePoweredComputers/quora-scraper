You can use either resource to check to see if your coin is rare for the design, or if it is common. You see, a 1909 penny is not worth that much, but a 1909 S penny is quite good. By checking the dates and mint marks, you will see if you have anything that is worth an exceptional amount of money above the price for the type. If you find something that is valuable (more than $500), You should send it in to be graded by PCGS. Once it is authenticated and graded by PCGS, you have a commodity that can easily be sold on Ebay. Since THEY traded it, everyone knows exactly what it is. You should get about 20% to 30% less than the sheet price (the gray sheet is the weekly price guide). Then you pay about 15% to Ebay. If you have a graded coin, a dealer will offer you 40% or 50% of the sheet price for the coin (they have to make money some how, and they make it when they buy the coin). The coins that are worth less than that, you can take to a coin show and shop it to the dealers, and/or take it to the coin shops and shop it to the dealers. Any coin worth less than $1, I personally would spend. You\u2019ll NEVER be able to sell it for much more than face, and you\u2019ll makes someones day if they find a 1939 well worn Jefferson Nickle or a worn out 1910 Lincoln cent. ",
