            "answer_text": "Both of them are responsible for phone radiation. A button phone has a screen which glows. It emits radiation. Same with touch screen. But in touch screen, your fingers are in contact with the screen. The second source of radiation is phone calls and internet. The radiowaves which your body receives during calls or internet causes harm to body as your body comes in direct contact with the radiation. But nowadays the screen of the phone is made up of LED screen. LED screens do not emit radiation to that extent. Very surprisingly, LED screens have brought down the radiation by almost 80%. So you don't need to worry about it. You may have heard about cancer and other deseases caused by mobile phones but most of them are just rumours. Many tests conducted by reputed technical firms have confirmed that mobile cannot be a reason for these deseases. Cancer ,I mean seriously. Personally, I have never found any cancer patient due to mobile. Actually we just hear the word radiation and get terrified. Do we ask ourselves, whether radiation can be responsible for cancer. How many of us have a little bit of idea about radiation? Mostly the physics student knows about it and even they get terrified by the word radiation. To answer this, I will give a quick overview of what really radiation is. Radiation is a band of 13 different forms of wave which is collectively called spectrum. Yes the basic spectrum band has 13 different types of radiation. Now the count has increased by recent detailed study and research. Out of 13, only 3 can harm your body to a great extent. Do you hear only 3. These are Gamma rays, X-rays and UV rays. The thirteen different rays are Gamma, X-Rays, UV rays, Violet rays, Indigo rays, Blue rays, Green rays, Yellow rays, Orange rays , Red rays, Infrared rays, Microrays and radio rays. Only radio rays is used in telecommunication. From violet to red, it is collectively called Visible spectrum. Just take a walk on a sunny day, you will be exposed to all these rays to a great extent(much much more than what you get from mobile). So everyone should suffer from cancer, but is it so. Only Gamma rays are responsible for cancer. X-RAYS Rays can give you cancer but after a very prolonged duration of exposure. UV rays can affect your eye and can make your iris opaque or cause serious rashes on your body but not cancer. Others will not cause cancer even if you are exposed for 200 years. Still we should keep ourselves aloof from radiation as even the least dangerous radiation is also made up of energetic photons. So don't use your mobile while it is hot, allow it to cool down and then use. Talk on your phone with earphones and not directly placing it near your ears. Don't use internet if the connection is not good because mobile tries to get stronger signals and thus uses more energy which takes the form of more energetic radiation. Don't use internet while travelling at high speed ( more than 40 KMPH) as the mobile constantly changes towers and thus affects the connectivity and then again it has to use more energy. Don't use phone for longer periods.and while downloading don't keep your phone near you because downloading causes huge data transfer and uses a wider spectrum band width to transfer data. You don't need to care if your mobile is touch or button, just use it judiciously and don't believe in rumours. ",

            "answer_text": "it doesn't matter what the phone's input method is\u2026 the device uses radio waves to communicate and they are not cancer causing. Check the spectrum\u2026 you can see that radio waves are placed on the far left side and the radiations that cause cancer is (are) placed on the right side\u2026 so that explains a lot.check other answers too\u2026 ",
