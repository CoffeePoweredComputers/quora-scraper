            "answer_text": "Interesting array of answers. To Martin Pitt\u2019s good answer I would like to add that the administration of the Clean Coal grant program was effectively a massive subsidy to coal generators which produced nothing of any use. If they had wanted to ensure that taxpayer funds were spent well, they would have restricted grants to projects which had a potential to remove SO2 or NOx LESS EXPENSIVELY than switching to low sulfur coal. There was no interest in taking care of taxpayer investments, and no concern about making the program produce anything useful. Neither climate science nor natural gas generation were understood the way they are today, back in the late 1980\u2019s. We still talked in terms of \u201cacid rain\u201d because we still had large parts of the nation exposed to rainfall which was acidic enough to do physical damage to plants, property and so forth. The terminology has never, to my knowledge, been officially applied to any aspect of controlling carbon emissions. Some of the scrubbers installed on coal plants in the last twenty years are probably removing a small fraction more SO2 than they would have without some of those research programs, but the cost is not justified, compared to eliminating the use of so much coal with energy efficiency, or today, with natural gas, wind and solar. Don\u2019t believe any of the stuff about fusion until you see a commercial production facility which isn\u2019t propped up by billions of dollars of subsidies. I wish what Mr. Steinhaus was saying was true, but for some reason there has been a recent surge in people talking about fusion technologies which aren\u2019t commercially ready. Given the past history, I\u2019d say I\u2019ll be surprised if any of them are ready in another 50 years, assuming I live that long. In the mean time we\u2019re going to solve climate change with efficiency, wind and solar, which all cost less than fossil fuels, or the nuclear fission some people think we could replace fossil fuels with. Fusion only exists in laboratories, or in the One True Fusion Plant 93 million miles away. You can read stories about actual deals for cheap wind and solar every day. Not so with fusion. Or clean coal. We need to speed up the adoption of efficiency (which doesn\u2019t get the press it deserves as the largest source of new energy capability in the world), wind and solar, and it is the fossil and nuclear industries\u2019 sincere desire to delay that, hence their continued sowing of distrust with modern theories about how expensive or feeble wind and solar are, along with lots of other things they pretend are \u201cjust around the corner\u201d. In this case, cynicism is healthy. Until you move beyond the junk and help us build a new clean and wealthy world with wind and solar. ",

            "answer_text": "There is a genuine clean coal technology - Carbon Detonation Fusion  Picture of LLNL ramp compression device that dynamically achieves 5 terapascal plasma pressure. Carbon Detonation Fusion as a means of Global Decarbonization and Energy Production - While many forms of nuclear are carbon neutral, and produce no CO2 while they operate, Carbon Detonation Fusion is one of the very few techniques that actually permanently takes carbon out of the air and ocean while producing large amounts of energy (not just using up energy as many other approaches do). Carbon Detonation Fusion permanently converts Carbon to energy and alternative elements (like non-radioactive Helium, Neon, and Oxygen gas) that do not produce any green house effect. Because during Carbon Detonation Fusion the temperature increases from the fusion, but volume is controlled by degenerate electrons and thus does not increase, plasma pressure and thus the rate of the fusion reaction increases greatly - producing fusion's closest equivalent to fission's runaway chain reaction. By carefully controlling the amount of fusion fuel (deuterium, tritium, and carbon) used per shot, safe controlled bursts of fusion energy can be produced. The fusion carbon-burning process or carbon detonation fusion is a set of nuclear fusion reactions that have used up the lighter elements in their cores. It requires high temperatures (> 5\u00d710^8 K or 50 keV) and densities (> 3\u00d710^9 kg/m3). The principal simple carbon burning fusion reactions are believed to be: 6C12 + 6C-12 -> 10Ne-20 + 2He-4 + 4.617 MeV 6C12 + 6C-12 -> 11Na-23 + 1H-1+ 2.241 MeV 6C12 + 6C-12 -> 12Mg-23 + neutron \u2013 2.599 MeV 6C12 + 6C-12 -> 12Mg-24 + \u03b3 + 13.933 MeV 6C12 + 6C-12 -> 8O-16 + 2He-4 + -0.113 MeV It remains uncertain whether a Carbon Detonation Fusion will ever be used to produce controlled amounts of energy on earth. As plasma pressure increases, both the power that can be generated from a given fusion plasma and the rate of the fusion reaction in the plasma are greatly accelerated. LLNL researchers have recently demonstrated that they can achieve a pressure on a small solid sample of 5 terapascals (equivalent to 50 million atmospheres). This recent developments uses a shock-free dynamic (ramp) compression method driven by a large laser (NIF). Ramp compression of diamond to five terapascals I believe that High Density ultra-compressed Plasmas produced in Inertial Confinement Fusion stand the best chance of producing Carbon Detonation Fusion on earth. ---------------- Disclosure - A cascade Carbon Detonation Fusion event is responsible for initiating the enormous release of energy that results in a Type 1a Supernova (and in the process produces the fusion nucleosynthesis that creates all heavy elements in the universe above the atomic number of Iron).
