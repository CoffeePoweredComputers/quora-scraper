            "answer_text": "Generally the answer would be no regarding figuring out when a VHS was taped. However, it is possible the VHS recording has additional information in what is known as the vertical blanking part of the image. This is usually the very bottom or very top of the image, out of what is known as \u201cTV Safe\u201d area. If you access to a professional TV monitor with what is called underscan, under scan or cross pulse, these two options reveal the entire area of the image. If there are little white dots those could be VITC time code which can reveal additional information regarding time and date and time code information. KInd of a long shot. One might have better luck watching the video and studying the clothes, hair style, and quality of graphics and types of video transitions to determine what time period a video may be from. ",

            "answer_text": "I have used the text TV for that. The resolution of VHS is not enough to store it reliably but sometimes one can see the date information. With SVHS there would be no problem. However, in the US there to my knowledge was no text TV. Also if it is home recordings that of course will not work. ",
