            "answer_text": "I work on cars at home on the side and use a scan tool similar to the Autel. It helps for sure but it really depends on how many cars you get on a consistent basis. I can tell you for sure you won\u2019t be doing any diagnostic work if you don\u2019t have a diagnostic tool. I can easily make $300+ in a few hours with that tool. If you want to learn how to use it, there are tons of Youtube videos on it and also on their site. I\u2019d recommend a engine management class though so you\u2019ll know what to do with all the information that the tool will give you. The tool won\u2019t fix the car but it will provide you with the information needed to fix it. ",
