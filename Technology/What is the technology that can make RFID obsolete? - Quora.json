            "answer_text": "RFID is a term which covers everything that allows identification by using radiofrequency waves. This tech has been in use since WWII. Thus, in order to make it obsolete you would need to find a way to communicate on distance which requires very little enegy, does not care about obstacles (metal reflects RF, water absorbs it), has a nice range (from some inches to many yards), can be installed in everyday objects in a nicely, unobstrusive and cheap way and that can be easily understood by people who does not have time (or does not want to) to figure out complex stuff like \"why the heck do I care if the RF wave reflects better on some objects?\" If you find it, give me a call please. I promise to call you \"Master\" for a week ;-) ",

            "answer_text": "A significant number of  applications use RFID as a security token (embedded in a card) that grants the bearer certain rights: open a security door or hotel room, use a FastPass toll booth, validate a credit card with chip & pin.  Since most bearers of these security tokens also carry smartphones with secure authentication built in, there's an opportunity to build smartphone apps that control secure access to a facility (Starwoods hotels keyless check in) or a credit line (Apple/Android Pay,) and eliminate the need of separate physical security tokens.
