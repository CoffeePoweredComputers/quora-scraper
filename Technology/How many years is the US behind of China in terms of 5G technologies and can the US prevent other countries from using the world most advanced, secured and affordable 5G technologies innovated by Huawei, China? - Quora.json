            "answer_text": "The US is NOT behind the PRC in 5G technology, but the speed & cost of America\u2019s 5G roll-out is handicapped relative to that of the PRC, as of this writing (Nov \u201819). 5G is a set of technology standards, any telecom network built in accordance with these standards will have roughly comparable performance. Both the US & PRC have access to the relevant technology, & are capable of deploying a 5G network, so neither side is significantly more technologically advanced than the other. However, there are 2 big factors - among others - that makes 5G deployment far more expensive in the US than the PRC: Spectrum allocation is the US\u2019s biggest cost disadvantage by far: Sub-6 spectrum is the ideal radio frequency in which to deploy 5G networks; it offers the optimal trade off between speed & range. However, the US government has allocated mostly mmWave spectrum for 5G deployment. This spectrum offers faster speeds but limited range & reliability. Meanwhile, the PRC allocates spectrum across all frequencies to its mobile operators, starting with Sub-6 now, then mmWave by the end of 2019. Consequently, this means that US mobile network operators (MNOs) will need to install more infrastructure for the same range of 5G coverage relative to PRC-based MNOs. If I had to estimate \u201chow much more\u201d, I\u2019d say ~3-4X, judging by the diagram below from the US Defense Innovation Board. This diagram shows the coverage range of mmWave (left) vs Sub-6 (right). It estimates that Sub-6 has ~2X the coverage range of mmWave, & therefore ~4X the area. Although mmWave is faster than Sub-6 (assuming no signal interference), I would argue that the extra speed is not worth the extra cost, particularly when 5G adoption is still in its infancy. Assuming all else being equal, US MNOs likely need to spend 3-4X that of their Chinese counterparts on infrastructure just for comparable levels of 5G coverage. & if this WSJ report is accurate, the US spectrum allocation constraints aren\u2019t likely to be mitigated anytime soon. Banning Huawei & ZTE means higher equipment costs for US MNOs. The US chose to ban Huawei & ZTE from selling 5G network equipment in the US, ostensibly for data security reasons. Regardless of the real reasoning behind this decision, the ultimate impact is that the US network market is a de facto duopoly between the 2 remaining major equipment OEMs: Ericsson & Nokia. Meanwhile, the PRC allows all OEMs to compete, including Ericsson & Nokia. This means PRC MNOs have more choices, more suppliers competing for their business, & inevitably lower prices. E.g. Bloomberg estimates that PRC base stations cost less than half that of the US.The significance of winning the 5G cost & deployment race is 2 fold: Like physical package delivery, digital data delivery is essentially a commodity business, the only market differentiation are cost, speed, & reliability. From the perspective of the end-user, whoever delivers the \u201cpackage\u201d (data in this case) at the lowest price & fastest speed without error is the preferred vendor. Lower 5G costs enables companies to deliver cheaper 5G-enabled goods & services to the end user.Data is the key ingredient for AI-enhanced products/services. When we talk about AI, we\u2019re primarily referring to a technology called \u201cmachine learning\u201d - a type of software algorithm that improves functionality over time by learning from ever greater quantities of data. 5G enables faster collection & delivery of data to AI-based services, therefore the algorithms that incorporate data at a faster rate will improve faster & become more competitive. Whoever enables the broadest, cheapest data collection & delivery network will likely have more competitive AI products & services.The bottom line - while the US isn\u2019t behind in terms of technology, it\u2019s behind in terms of offering cost-competitive 5G connectivity. This ultimately means that enterprise & consumer adoption of 5G will be faster in the PRC, & the economic benefits thereof will be realized faster & on a bigger scale.  EDIT: as for the 2nd question of whether the US can coerce other countries to ban Huawei - judging by the results as of this writing - it\u2019s a resounding NO for most of the world, other than a few countries that are particularly wary of the PRC. Those who are interested in speculation on why this is a failure, see this answer: Hongda Jiang's answer to How effective is the ban on Huawei? Is it justified? Why are US allies not cooperating if it presents such a security concern? My conclusion is based on the reaction of the US\u2019s closest allies & other key regional markets to the \u201cban Huawei\u201d campaign on a region by region basis: Europe: UK: UK is postponing any final decisions. But in the meantime, major UK MNOs are continuing 5G trials with Huawei equipment.Germany: already rejected ban on Huawei.France: same as Germany - imposes security monitoring but no ban.Italy: same as above, scrutiny but no ban.Switzerland: not only no ban, but also doing joint R&D.Rest of Europe: in places like Russia & Hungary: business as usual.Middle East: Saudi Arabia: no ban.UAE: no ban.Kuwait: no ban.Bahrain: no ban.Rest of Middle East: if America\u2019s closest regional allies aren\u2019t banning Huawei, there\u2019s no chance that others such as Iran will do so.Africa: South Africa: no ban.African Union countries: no ban.Latin America: Brazil: no ban.Mexico: no ban.Rest of region: no ban.APAC: ironically this is where Huawei is facing the most resistance PRC: lol.. moving on\u2026SE Asia: most of SE Asia is simply ignoring the US campaign, the only exception is Vietnam, which is excluding Huawei without an overt ban.South Korea: no ban.Vietnam, Japan, & Australia: Huawei is facing a de facto banIndia & New Zealand: both are undecided & on the fence, but providing positive signals by allowing trials & participation at key industry events.Central Asia: no ban.North America: USA: banned obviously; in fact, the US is providing subsidies to rural areas for removal of existing 4G Huawei/ZTE gear & 5G deployment.Canada: undecided.Most of America\u2019s closest allies & the biggest telecom markets in every region continue to partner with Huawei on 5G. While the US market is closed to Huawei, it has more than enough access to the world market to thrive. ",

Further, the advances for use of the medium will be in software, the hardware, like your laptop, will become\u2026 mehh. If you haven\u2019t noticed, when it comes to advances, and efficiency in software, then\u2026 the US will be reigning supreme for a VERY long time. As to China\u2019s intent on putting systems at low cost in 3rd World countries, that\u2019s fine! The US will sell the software to make it useful. It\u2019s just that China may \u2018move in\u2019 with it, monopolize (censor) such that access to Chinese directions are the only items on the menu. Thus far in Africa, many countries are not pleased with Chinese behavior. [1] \u2018Entrepreneurial\u2019 groups show up that make the \u2018ugly American\u2019 look like a savior. They have mining operations in 38 countries there, and bring their own labor, and live in Chinese enclaves. They hire the locals only for the most menial tasks. Major coastal investments seem to be set for the future, but first: all the land is purchased by the Chinese, -a bit remote from cities. We will just see how things pan-out. (Their 5G is scheduled for a Mexico installation by the way). Historically the Netherlands, Germany and U.S. really haven't done much to help Africa other than extend their lifespan; it\u2019s EDUCATION that\u2019s key, and dozens of \u2018clinics\u2019 isn\u2019t enough\u2026 and I don\u2019t see China bringing education or clinics at this point, and just as the Free World has kept the sea lanes free for the Chinese Navy, they may be counting on CDC/WHO hospitals to take care of their new labor force.
