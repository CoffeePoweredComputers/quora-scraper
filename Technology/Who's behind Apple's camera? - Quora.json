            "answer_text": "As of the iPhone 11, Sony is behind the mechanics of the iPhone camera, and Apple fills in the other half of the equation with its own custom controller/processor that performs so many tasks that is has its own 2GB RAM (separate from the main RAM in the iPhone) and gets support from the AI/MK capability built into the iPhone 11. That is why the Night Mode pictures from the iPhone look so much better than any of the Android equivalent, so we can say that it is a Sony/Appel partnership that make the iPhone 11\u2019s photos better than other manufacturers, even the ones that use the same camera module.

As for ascribing this to the \"algorithm\", Apple's own press material on the camera is touting the hardware, supported by their software.http://www.techinsider.io/iphone-6s-camera-specs-and-features-2015-9 ",
