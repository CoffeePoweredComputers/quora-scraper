            "answer_text": "Theoretically, yes. But getting there will require advances in stem cells / cellular regeneration and cellular biology that are orders of magnitude higher than anything we have accomplished since the dawn of modern medicine. A breakthrough is needed, and it can come in one of several fields, including some unexpected ones such as cancer research: immortalised cell line In other words, you should not be feeling especially optimistic after looking at the following graph:  Average life expectancy means there were people in 1543 who lived to be over 100, but many more died younger for one of a myriad reasons that we\u2019ve gotten better at preventing. But there is a natural (and presently insurmountable) limit to how many times our cells can divide. For all intents and purposes, this limit has always been there, and pushing it in our favor via science is not likely to be an easy task. In fact, it would be an unprecedented feat in all of nature, as even creatures that are, to our knowledge, immortal have become so by virtue of evolution and not via self selection (see biological immortality). Immortality via procreation is, of course, the much more common way nature does this, and we may have to learn to be happy with that for at least a couple more thousand years of consistent innovation. Where I\u2019m going with this is, yes, we\u2019ve come a long way, but the way we need to go is much much longer. It may even be overly optimistic to call it \u201ca way.\u201d Let\u2019s say that as we\u2019ve learned to stay alive longer, we\u2019ve been getting better at walking uphill. But now we\u2019re nearing a tall wall that we have very little clue about how to even touch. So don\u2019t hold your breath (haha, very funny). Not to waste too much time on this, but there\u2019s also no verifiable evidence that a human being ever lived for 500 years. There are only tales. Scientific evidence suggests that human beings that lived as far back as 200\u2013300,000 years were not significantly different from us, and in fact were likely to have a much shorter lifespan than what we enjoy today.

            "answer_text": "As far as records are concerned, no human has survived 500 years. According to record books, the longest a person lived was 122 years and if my guess is right, it was a french woman and she died in the year 1997. A number of researches have been conducted on centenarians (people who lived 100 years), super centenarians (110+ year survivors) and it was proven that as of now, no technology can extend the lifespan of human beings. But then, researches are done on laboratory animals like mice to increase their lifespan and some of them seem to be working. Hence, the scientists are confident that, perhaps with the advancement of technology, it could be possible, but it still is a 50:50. Death rates among children and woman are dropping due to the strides taken in medicine, but when tried on aging crowd, the effects are rather insignificant. There are a lot of anti-aging pills available in the market, that stop the genes from aging exponentially but I guess that has nothing to do with lifespans. Theory has proven that human lifespan maxes out at somewhere around 115 years. Most people who cross 100 years get it from their genes and the healthy diet that they followed when alive, and all super centenarians got it from their genes. ",

            "answer_text": "I believe we could live that long and even longer with the right advancements, even to the point that death would become non-mandatory and the only way you\u2019d die is by injury as any age/cellular related illness that results in death would be blown out of the water back to Timbuktu We might even have the advancements to understand how the human brain work and have the ability to resurrect any human that ever lived with the replicated set of neurons the departed had that gives them their own perspective, I don\u2019t know much about this science stuff but we came a long way, from trees and rocks to magic boxes of moving pictures and captured sound effects, our tech is nothing different from magic if you look at it from a primitive person\u2019s view. So I believe it can be possible its only a matter of how long till we master reality itself, we can already control the elements to do our biding, such as electricity and other energies. TL;DR - Hell yes I believe we could if we play our cards right. ",
