            "answer_text": "It would depend on where they get their education. If the next generation of Muslims gets a western education in western setting it would end up being liberal, agnostic, or even atheist. This, in my opinion, is a well-orchestrated element of western education; to steer the masses away from the religions, which, in the West, are generally considered to be the mother of all ills. Intrinsically there is nothing wrong with the modern education at all, but the one which deprives one of his/her religiosity. Muslims therefore, have to stay clear of this black-hole by developing their own institutions, in their own countries, with the religious education patterned on modern lines, being an inevitable part of the curriculum. For these institutions, the teachers should be selected very carefully; who ought to be western educated but with entrenched religious values, which must have been left undiluted, muddled and unvitiated. shakir2.wordpress.com ",
