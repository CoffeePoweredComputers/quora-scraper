Whatever you see, the user interface, whatever you deal with while browsing a website comes under Front-End. Basic languages that are used for front end web development are HTML , CSS, JS. With the use of these languages the job of creating front end of website is accomplished. The back end of a website consists of a server, an application, and a database.
