            "answer_text": "Originally, companies created VPNs to protect their communications from industrial espionage. Because there are increasingly simple ways to intercept data travelling to a network. Have you heard of MAC spoofing and Firesheep for example? Two solutions to hack information. That\u2019s why a VPN offers an encrypted connection from point A to point B. A VPN client uses an encrypted data transmission and a tunneling system to securely route the data between these two points. Back and forth. As a result, your data is encrypted and protected. It\u2019s almost like that secret tunnel at the back of your castle that leads you safely away through the secret mountain passage, and only you and your fellow knights know about it. A VPN also means better privacy! Besides, security and privacy typically come hand in hand anyways. Now indeed, the VPN replaces the IP address of your internet connection with the IP address from the server where you are connected. And you can connect to any server that the VPN provider has for you to choose from. Therefore, you can have several different IP addresses. For instance, you may live in London and appear to be in New York with the help of the VPN or vice versa. So at least when somebody asks you what exactly is a VPN and what is it used for, you can mention that privacy is certainly one of the main reasons as to why they are highly sought after. Understanding VPN connections and censorship is very important when it comes to learning about geo-restricted content and using VPNs to get around them. After all, what is VPN program or what is a best VPN gateway, if not able to help you bypass these restrictions. But that\u2019s not all! Indeed, there is another good point related to the privacy method described above. For example, connecting to an IP address from any country means that you can unblock all the geo-restricted content from the country you connect to. Imagine that you want to watch American Netflix from your home in Leeds. Without a VPN, the thought of doing so is virtually impossible. But with a VPN however, you can quickly connect to an American server and easily access US Netflix. ",

            "answer_text": "A VPN is a network that encrypts the data from your machine to another machine so that no one in the middle can see the data, unless they either crack the encryption code or have the encryption key. A VPN can be based in hardware or software, so you can download a VPN software app to your tablet, phone, or computer and use it to log into a VPN server somewhere. All the data your computer sends via the VPN will be encrypted all the way to the other end server. Of course, if you\u2019re using a VPN to hide your Internet traffic, it still goes out on the internet after the far end VPN server. Be aware that there are VPN\u2019s being operated by groups, companies, and even countries that allows them to have front row seats to everything YOU do over the internet. How to determine which ones are trustworthy is the real question and one I can\u2019t answer for you. So, if you\u2019re trying to do something nefarious over the internet via a VPN, be aware that someone can easily be watching what you\u2019re doing, if you happened to pick one of the \u201cwrong\u201d VPN services. Just because you pay for it, does not mean you\u2019re still home free since that could still be a NSA or other agency funded VPN honeypot used to track internet data. Here is one I read about a week ago\u2026 Four years ago, Facebook purchased Onavo, a Tel Aviv-based VPN company which developed an app for Android and iOS called Protect. Facebook examined the slew of data it received from the Protect app to look at how users use the Snapchat app. After the introduction of the very Snapchat-looking Instagram Stories, Snapchat use fell. The lead paragraph in the Journal read: \u201cMonths before social-media company Snap Inc. publicly disclosed slowing user growth, rival Facebook Inc. already knew.\u201d Users sought out a VPN app to mask their mobile data, but handed it to Facebook. How did Facebook defend this ominous data mining? The social network referred back to the Onavo Privacy Policy where this is all stated. ",
