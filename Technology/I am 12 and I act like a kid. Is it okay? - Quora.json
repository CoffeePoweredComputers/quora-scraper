            "answer_text": "Yes! Legally, you are technically a child until you are 18\u201321 years of age\u2026 depending on location, maturity level, and your living situation/ home life. But more importantly, always and I mean always be true to you and your most authentic self, especially if you like to stand out from the crowd. My biggest piece of advice that should stick with you until you die\u2026 and that is, Never live your life based off of aiming to please others. Also, worry less of what others think, which I know is easier said than done. By golly, if you are 42 years old and you like to play Pokemon Go, we'll, you better. I mean even if you feel an urge to discuss life insurance policies at at the age of 13, so be it. Ultimately, its whatever floats your boat at the end of the day. I am just going to go ahead and keep it real with you, but these people walking around with their harsh judgements and negative comments..& this is when you ask yourself, but are they putting food on the table for you and yours and/or are they paying your Netflix and Hulu/ Game Pass subscription? Most likely, No. Nope. So, there ya go. Honey, what do you feel like being today? This is getting to be long winded, my apologies, but I am a 28 year old girl/woman with heelys, and yes I skate around in public, at Wal-Mart.. Target.. Idc. This life is too short, and I will embrace my inner child for as long as my adult self will allow me to. #outdated #adult #sorrrynotsorry. Hope this helps. ",

            "answer_text": "I think you\u2019ll find that people will see you as mature if you act mature. What do I mean by that? Treat others with respect, express your feelings without blaming other people, and be patient with others. It\u2019s also fine to have \u201cchildish\u201d interests! Many modern cartoons like Steven Universe have adult fans. Or take me, for example. I\u2019m twenty-five. I was a bit stressed today because my car had two flat tires and I had to play catch-up at work after a vacation. I bought myself some cookies to cheer myself up a bit. It\u2019s important though, that you stay away from people who try to make you do things that make you uncomfortable. People who pressure you, saying that you\u2019re \u201cmature\u201d enough for drugs or for a physical relationship, especially if they\u2019re an adult, especially if they\u2019re an authority figure, are bad news. It can be hard to let go of childhood, but you\u2019ll find a balance! ",
