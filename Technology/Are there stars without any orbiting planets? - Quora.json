            "answer_text": "It is generally believed that planetary systems exist for all stars - with an exception. The exception is type 'O' and \u2018B\u2019 stars - the blue giants, that can be immensely powerful. It is believed that the radiation pressure and stellar wind emitted by such stars should be powerful enough to blow away any planet forming disks. Anyway, I do not think we currently have the technology to observe a star and conclude that it does not have a planet or planets orbiting it. ",

These are however biased towards large planets and planets close to their star. A solar sytem with just planets equivalent in size and position of Neptune and Uranus wouldn\u2019t show up yet. There are also very few that resemble out own solar system, though this again may be due to it being hard to detect. See 2016_08_130001 - other solar systems for more. ",
