            "answer_text": "Airplane mode, aeroplane mode, flight mode, offline mode, or standalone mode is a setting available on many smartphones, portable computers, and other electronic devices that, when activated, suspends radio-frequency signal transmission by the device, thereby disabling Bluetooth, telephony, and Wi-Fi. GPS may or may not be disabled, because it does not involve transmitting radio waves. When the \"aeroplane mode\" is activated, it disables all voice, text, telephone, and other signal-transmitting technologies such as Wi-Fiand Bluetooth. Wi-Fi and Bluetooth can be enabled separately even while the device is in airplane mode; this is acceptable on some aircraft. [1] [2] Receiving radio-frequency signals, as by radio receivers and satellite navigationservices, is not inhibited. However, even receiving telephone calls and messages without responding would require the phone to transmit; a smartphone in airplane mode is effectively a PDA. ",
