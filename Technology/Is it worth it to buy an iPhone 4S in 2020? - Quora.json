            "answer_text": "Well it all depends, most apps are still somewhat supported although it a hit or miss. If you want this iphone as a second phone i should say go for it, but for a main device i would look towards the iphone 5(s) because its a LOT faster. The iphone 4s is a slow device and you should have a lot of patience with this device, its using just 512mb of ram and the a5 chipset didn't age very well eather. Conclusion? Its a slow iPhone that still looks good and premium, for lightweight tasks (texting, calling, music and facetime) its still ok to use but for anything more i would look for another iphone to buy ",

            "answer_text": "It depends on what you are going to use it for. I have an iPhone 4s as my main phone, in fact I'm writing this reply on it. If you only need to send whatsapp, message, FaceTime etc and don't mind a lag and missing some features then it is probably fine. Another factor is that as it is not worth very much, you don't need to worry about loosing it or breaking it. However it is slow an apple doesn't support it anymore. It depends on you \ud83d\ude00 ",
