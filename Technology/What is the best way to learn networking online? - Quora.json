            "answer_text": "I would recommend you to start by learning the material covered in the CCNA certification from Cisco. It covers a wide range of topics such as basic networking, routing, switching and WAN. I think what you basically might want, is to study the CCNA module 1 which covers general networking (it's actually called Networking fundamentals). If you want to learn it by video, you should watch the video classes from CBT Nuggets, they are very complete. I used them together with the official material from the Cisco Netacademy to obtain my CCNA certification. This youtube playlist contains lots of videos explaining key topics from the CCNA 1:  http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL33E07ECCA73C0755 Finally if you want to test yourself, here you can find the original exams: http://ccnaanswers.com/category/ccna-1-network-fundamentals/ ",

            "answer_text": "Hi First decide weather you want to learn generic networking or any product/certification oriented networking. Their are plenty of good videos available in YouTube, I personally spend my free time watching these technical videos. Their are many technical blogs & websites where in you can download or read the theory content. you may download simulation software like cisco packet tracer, GNS3 to practice lab sessions.
