            "answer_text": "RE: What are innovative renewable energy resources? There are a whole lot of people who have been working on this for a long time so there is not much room for true innovation. Mostly smallish incremental improvements of various sorts rule \u201crenewable energy\u201d research these days. However I can think of one true innovation which would turn the energy debate on its head and in favor of \u201crenewable energy\u201d: an efficient, stable catalyst which would split water (H2O) into hydrogen and oxygen using the energy in sunlight. Plants do this all the time. People think plants split CO2 and give off the oxygen. Nope. Plants split water, H2O, give off the oxygen and attach the hydrogen to CO2 to make sugars for energy storage. That process powers almost all life on earth. Using sunlight to efficiently split water would overcome one of the biggest deficits of \u201crenewable energy\u201d, ie it is intermittent but we cannot store electricity cheaply. But we CAN store hydrogen cheaply. Such a catalyst would be a game changer. Note my repeated use of the word \u201cefficient\u201d. The other big problem with \u201crenewable energy\u201d is that it is diffuse energy. You need a lot of collectors when you are talking about supplying energy on a national scale, so a catalyst which would, say, use 1% of the energy in sunlight to make hydrogen simply would not cut it. I don\u2019t know exactly where \u201cgame changer\u201d lies in between 1% and 100% efficient, but it\u2019s in there somewhere. Hmm, as far as I know no one is using large-scale solar cell farms to drive electrolysis of water to make hydrogen. That means that the \u201cgame changer\u201d efficiency has got to be more than that process, ie . . . Solar cell energy conversion efficiencies for commercially available multicrystalline Si solar cells are around 14-19%. the industrial production of hydrogen, and using current best processes for water electrolysis (PEM or alkaline electrolysis) which have an effective electrical efficiency of 70-80% . . . more than 19% times 80% = 15% efficient. You might think that the 2 stage process of PV + electrolysis would cost more than a catalyst breaking apart water, but the catalyst would produce an explosive 2 hydrogens to 1 oxygen ratio gas which would have to be separated carefully without any possibility of igniting it. That separation process would use more energy, so my bet is that the \u201cgame changer\u201d efficiency of a catalytic system would need to be WAY over 15%. But, if you do invent a sufficiently efficient, sunlight powered catalyst to split water then you will become a zillionaire (unless someone who has lots of money and fancy lawyers steals your formula or patent).  Addendum: I talk about catalysts above. I should also include any other process which efficiently produces hydrogen from sunlight and water, tho I do not know what that might be at this time. ",

            "answer_text": "Renewable energy resources are plentiful Renewable energy sources, are any type of energy resource that does not contribute to toxic waste, or reduces emissions in some way. Energy gathered from wind, water, and solar, are all forefronts of renewable energy. Most scientist would say that renewable energy is restricted to to actual renewable sources, that do not have a con toward the environment. So that leaves us with some sources such as solar, wind, water, hydrogen, and other forms such as Algae. Renewable energy is also characterized as having a high Energy Returned on Energy Invested, which means that the ERoEI, should be profitable to a consumer so that they have a reason to use it besides just helping the envirment out. This helps, because the right renewable energy sources will be considered a viable resource to the consumer with high ERoEI, so they will continue to use it as a 100% supplement to dangerous fossil fuel production. And, they will spread the word through their community, investors, and family that there is plenty of good reason to continue using renewable energy. How can you make the best out of renewable energy? Most people will choose to rely on solar energy in their efforts to use  Energy coming from an infinite source such as the sun, which does not have a damage toward the environment. Renewable energy mitigates your carbon footprint, and supplies energy to communities and individuals world wide without damaging fossil fuels, or absurd standards to ERoEI (Energy Returned on Energy Invested). If you are struggling to shop for solar, you have come to a good source. I work for a solar panel company, and can tell you straight forward it is not a bias form of renewable energy. In fact, it is beginning to pick up speed so fast, that you are able to get renewable energy on the fly, many states are developing a 100% renewable energy standard, and some states will give you so much back in state and tax credits, that you are left with a jaw dropping low bill. HahaSmart, is definitely at the for front of solar energy, we give you prices that are an average of 25% below the average market value, and our system will stream line you direct with everything you need; panels, installation, certifications, accessories, BOS, and the know it how to get the job done. Our team is dedicated and experience, we won\u2019t leave you with an arm or a leg missing. Try using the price-checker, it will pre-asses you with costs, and set your appointments in the same place. Plus, you will be able to get an accurate cost, that is not bias, compared to competitors, which will charge you superfluous costs, and leave you guessing with a high bill. ",
