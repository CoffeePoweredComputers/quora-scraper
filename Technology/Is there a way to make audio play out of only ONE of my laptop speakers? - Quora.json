            "answer_text": "Yes, your laptop should have stereo speakers. Check out the Youtube video below, if you hear the sound coming from two places you do have two speakers. In order to have just one of them play you need to set the balance somewhere. This can either be in some type of audio settings dialog depending on your OS or maybe driver software, or you can set it in some programs like VLC player. Browsers usually don\u2019t have such a setting so you\u2019d have to set that in your OS.  ",

            "answer_text": "Other answers talk about a balance control. While that will allow you to suppress the output from one channel or the other, it will not mix the two channels together, so whatever would have come out of that speaker is just gone \u2014 that is, you don\u2019t get mono. ",
