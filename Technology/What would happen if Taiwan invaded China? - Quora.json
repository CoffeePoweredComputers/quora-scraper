            "answer_text": "Under no circumstances in the forseable future, would this scenario happen. But, Lets imagine a plausible scenario where this might happen as the ROC government would only invade mainland if they have a chance of winning. Year 20XX, 1st year The PRC is plunged into chaos after a series of economic crisis (Housing bubble, local government debt and failing SOEs), the three gorges dam bursting due to a massive earthquake causing devastation downstream and also flooding of the Yellow river in Henan and Shan Dong. This causes massive popular uprising nation wide and the central government quickly loses direct control over many Southern provinces as anti presidential factions rises from hiding after the anti corruption campaign and attempts a coup to overthrow the Beijing central government, but due to the chaos and unorganised forces becomes an armed standoff resulting in sporadic fighting all over the country with no defined boundaries or front lines, but generally speaking the central government holds the majority of the North while regional governors hold the South while Shanghai becomes battleground that ravages the entire city. Events continue for several months and it becomes clear that Beijing cannot reassert control in a short time, but the regional governors also cannot overthrow Beijing. By this time the general populace are sick and tired of fighting and would have supported any sort of armed intervention that could bring stability and order from chaos. During this time in Taiwan the ROC government led by the Nationalist government is facing a difficult re-election in a years time is watching with both glee and horror. They quickly mobilise the armed forces, call in the reserves and declares a national emergency to prevent fighting spilling over to Taiwan. The DPP is initialy opposed to any armed intervention as victory will mean that the Nationalists reap the glory, while defeat will bring destruction, but after seeing the mainland decend into complete chaos they reluctantly accept the formation of a coalition government of all major parties in ROC after being persuaded that it will mean riches to everyone, especially their wealthy donors who are promised with vast areas of land and economic benefits. For once they get together and launch a massive media and social campaign to get all ROC citizens on board with promises of riches for everyone and an easy walkover with the PLA in civil war with each other. Before the invasion, ROC spies previously posing as majicians and entertainers managed to secure the promise from the commander of the PLA strategic forces, who are the only unit left with cohesion, to remain neutral when they invade and is promised with the post of minister for defence of the future unified China and letting the unit keep its status and becoming the first strategic unit for the future ROC government. Before the invasion of ROC forces, commandos and spies spread propaganda of law and order in Taiwan and how it will be brought to the mainland if ROC forces returned. A small invasion of outlying islands around the mainland is sent to test the waters and are assured after seeing PLA units defecting en mass despite being better equipped (by this time in the future the PRC is better equipped in all manners). After the initial recapture of several islands the ROC government receives the defection of the majority of the Eastern and Southern Fleets of the PLAN after being unpaid for almost a year. By this time the ROC government has started to receive International help and aid as these governments now see the ROC as capable in succeeding in a successful recapture of the mainland, thus helping them with loans and war bonds to finance the invasion. Year 2 The ROC forces waits till spring when food reserves are at the lowest and start with a multi pronged invasion of Fujian and Guangdong which are massively succesful and quickly recapture the two provinces. After this there is a brief pause with only minor incursions into surrounding provinces and a small scale invasion of Hainan to hold the captured territories and local CCP officials are allowed to retain civil adminstration power, with the the police and legal system taken over by the ROC government who have assigned educated ROC citizens who have difficulty in finding jobs back in Taiwan further boosting the support of the civilian population back at home. After pausing for about three months, ROC forces continue with invasion of neighbouring provinces, now backed by defected PLA units overseen with ROC commisars. The invasions are still successful, but local resistance is clearly increasing as during the brief pause the former CCP factions have agreed to a rough ceasefire to face the common enemy. This is not as successful as anticipated as many lower level officials see that their positions will be retained by the new government and PLA units mainted after defection. The ROC forces continue the advance and roughly recapture most of Southern China South of Yangtze river before the end of the year 2. By this time most of the initial rebellious Southern provinces have already surrendered to ROC forces and despite occasional uprisings the CCP have managed to retain a fragile hold of Northern China, but without control of the strategic forces who have declared neutrality in the civil war. Year 3 Now international powers are pushing for dialogue and ceasefires from both sides as many see it as a good chance to break up the beast, but this time with so much at stake and the coalition government rejects call of ceasefire citing human rights violations in the North and a wish to liberate the struggling masses. The government launches a massive invasion spearheaded by defected units who are eager to declare their loyalty with ROC units acting as a rear guard and a surpervising forces to prevent defections. ROC government forces make a big drive through Henan towards Shanxi attempting to cut off the CCP\u2019s controlled territories in half which succeeds, but also suffers massive casualties due to the more determined defences and flanking actions from CCP loyal forces in Hebei and Shaanxi. This leaves the ROC forces unable to continue with a planned drive towards Beijing as reinforcements have to be brought up to replace losses, but is successful in forcing the surrender of all western provinces as they are now cut off from the CCP government and sustained massive casualties during the flanking action. By now the CCP are fully on the defensive, but depite losing all the territories, ironically they are now left with provinces that are most loyal to the President as the current president personally made Northeast China as his power base before accending to power while his wife is from Shandong. The CCP entrench themselves in and await the next step. By September new and fresh units have arrived at the frontline and the government have also pacified Western China up to inner Mongolia. For the first time ROC forces outnumber the CCP opponents and launch a massive attack involving millions of troops dubbed the Hua Bei Campaign. The attack quickly becomes a battle of attrition with with units on both sides breaking down and deserting, but after 3 months of fighting ROC forces finally pushes CCP forces out of all of China apart from the North East as CCP forces cannot replace lost equipment fast enough to maintain the fight. Year 4 After the bloody Hua Bei Campaign ROC forces pushes very cautiously towards the North East in Spring, but find that resistance is not as heavy due to the CCP not being able to replace lost equipment from last year and CCP troops being demoralised knowning they have already lost the war and it takes around than 6 more months of campaigning to finally recapture all of China. The new government declares victory in Nanjing and sets up a transition period of 15 years to intergrate mainland with the rest of ROC. Year 20 The first election is held in all of China to choose lawmakers for the national parliament in Nanjing and after the results come in, the new President declares the rebirth of the Republic of China. Now this is how a fantasy invasion of mainland may play out for if ever the ROC government decides it is capable of invading mainland. ",

I think the war can be separated as two steps step oneTaiwan\u2019s army landed Fujian province(assuming Taiwan trained some wizards or superheroes who wiped out Chinese navy)\uff0cbut Fujian province is a undeveloped area because Chinese government has already considered such situation. so, they landed in Fujian, but they cant cost big damage because this area has nothing except Chinese military. To annihilate Taiwan\u2019s army, it only need to take 3 hours, or less. step two: yes, we finally get opportunity to recapture this island, as i just said chinese navy goes to some where we dont know, let all infantry swim to land, even we dont use tank.or missile, and obey the leader\u2019s order dont bother civilians, take over Taiwan can only need 3 days ",

Hence ,this is just a hypothetical scenario that will not actually take place. Additionally ,there is no legitimate reason for Taiwan to invade China or for China to invade Taiwan ,for there is no direct connection between the two countries. All Taiwanese military do is prevent other countries ,especially CHINA ,from infringing upon Taiwanese sovereignty. ",
