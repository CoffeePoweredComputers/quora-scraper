            "answer_text": "Ah, where to begin. Feedwater preheat. The Corliss engine that throttled the engine with intake valve timing instead of a steam throttle. Steam superheater after the boiler. Multi-stage expansion of the steam with reheat between the expansion stages. Condenser which produces a vacuum at the final exhaust port. And finally, using a turbine to expand the steam, which allows much higher steam temperature and pressure because the turbine blades don\u2019t need to be lubed. The Titanic had two triple expansion with reheat engines driving the right and left props and then the exhaust steam from both of those engines powered a low pressure steam turbine which powered the center prop.
