            "answer_text": "Internet is already there on ISS. Although ISS is not technically in outer space. Its still out there and you can surfe the web if u get up there. Easier would be to connect with the guys up there. They tweet and host google hangout regularly. Now back to the question 'is it possible to have internet in space?' In orbit around earth I would say yes. In outer space like on mars or Jupiter or Neptune. Again yes. I will tell u how. For internet you basically need a two way communication medium. Which all satellites already have. The next step for them is to understand the http ftp and other protocols for data transmission. Which they generally dont have because they dont need it. If we can add that then we will have a minimal viable product :) The only major issue that we will have would be that the time period of a single 2 way handshake would be 6 min for mars to earth. And for voyager 1 its over 17 hours.Imagine loading google and receiving it 6 mins late or 24 hours late. Meanwhile most pages would drop your request if time taken to receive acknowledgement is more than a few mins.  For this and many other reason, Internet in outer space is not viable now. Specially because its not worth it. ",

            "answer_text": "Well, we already have a sort of internet connection with the MArs Rover and with Juno, which is now near Jupiter. And with several other space crafts that are out there in space, sending data to us while receiving commands from us. But those connections are well-protected to avoid others from hijacking these systems. These are expensive projects so you don\u2019t want hackers to take them over\u2026 There are more challenges, of course. Here on earth most internet data takes a fraction of a second to get from A to B. But if a site happens to be on the other side of the planet then you will notice some lag. The distance to those modules in space is much longer than to the other side of the planet thus transmissions also take a bit longer. For Mars, this delay is over 13 minutes because of the distance. To Jupiter, the time could be 30 to over 50 minutes, depending on where both Earth and Jupiter are orbiting the sun. To calculate the more exact times for your internet lag in space, you need to know the distance between both points and divide this by the speed of light, or the speed of the radio waves that you\u2019re using. So, you\u2019re on Jupiter and doing a Google Search for this answer. It would take an average of 40 minutes for your request to arrive at Google, mere milliseconds to have it processed and then another 40 minutes to send back the response. So you\u2019d better be patient. Reading your email on the GMail website is even more complex as GMail uses JQuery to make various requests for data to the server. So it will take a few hours for you to read the 5 emails you have today. So, the question is more: would you want to go on the Internet while in space? ",
