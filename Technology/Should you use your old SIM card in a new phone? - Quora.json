            "answer_text": "Sure, why not. You don\u2019t have to hassle with your cellular provider, which most want to charge you $20 for the honor of taking your old SIM car putting in your new phone, and then tossing the new SIM card in a drawer anyway. Not sure how long they can actually last, but we\u2019ll probably have stopped using SIM cards (moved to something new) before they actually die. And nobody uses the memory in them anymore, which was were all the contact information was stored prior to moving on to smartphones. ",
