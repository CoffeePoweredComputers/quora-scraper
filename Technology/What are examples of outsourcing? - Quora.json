The biggest advantage that comes from using manufacturing outsourcing service is cost saving, plus decreased assembling time. However, there are also some concerns such as quality issues and interception of the product time.

            "answer_text": "Today, companies and businesses can practically outsourcing any business function they want to. I\u2019ve put them into groups for easier explanation: Professional outsourcing Professional outsourcing significantly reduces a company\u2019s overhead costs, because this kind of outsourcing lets companies gain access to high quality resources while paying only for the services used. Here are the business functions under professional outsourcing: IT functions - network management, website or software development, data warehousingBusiness process and HR - payment processing, recruitment, inbound and outbound sales, trading and marketing, human resourcesFinance - bookkeeping, tax management, invoicingSales and marketing - marketing communicationsManufacturing outsourcing This type of outsourcing primarily means the transferring of production or manufacture-related jobs to expert third parties to save on human capital, time and expenses. Popular examples of tasks outsourced are those in production of goods and car manufacture. As not all companies have the means to continuously upgrade their equipment and their process, manufacturing outsourcing helps these companies deliver their products to stay competitive in the market. Process-specific outsourcing This kind of outsourcing refers to the outsourcing of a specific process or procedure. It\u2019s becoming a popular choice for companies to outsource their specific operation-related aspects to other companies that specialise in that service. Ex: A bakery outsourcing their deliveries to courier companies In our example above, the outsourced courier company is now tasked with having delivery timelines, customer contacts and costs, etc. This allows the company to focus on its strength as they reduce costs and time.
