So if a new Iphone comes out Amazon would put it on their homepage maybe even give Prime members exclusive discounts.Amazon app would come with the Apple product. So if you get a new IPhone it would probably have the Amazon app built in to it. Maybe IPhone users would get Amazon Prime for free or at a discount.Amazon has their own streaming service with amazing original content. Apple is starting one this fall. Maybe they might merge the 2 to make an ultimate platform of original content. They would also merge Amazon\u2019s phone company (Yeah Amazon makes phones) with Apple.Apple would become a a powerhouse! It is close to $ 1 trillion and with Amazon they would control alot!I don\u2019t think this would be good for consumers and I hope to god it never happens.   ",
