            "answer_text": "Zero. Tesla doesn\u2019t pay dividends to shareholders, and they are unlikely to do so for the near future. They are not really profitable, so their aren\u2019t any profits to distribute. And, any extra cash they do have is likely to be put right back into the business. It is a highly capital-intensive business that needs constant money to produce new vehicles, build new factories, and invest in R&D. They type of people who invest in Tesla are looking for growth in the stock value, not dividends. ",
