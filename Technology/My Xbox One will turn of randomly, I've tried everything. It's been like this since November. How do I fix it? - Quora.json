            "answer_text": "Check the console immediately after an unexpected shutdown for excess heat. I\u2019ve noticed that most newer consoles tend to overheat easier, due to there being more hardware packed into a box with not many ways of ventilating. I don\u2019t know about the PS4, but I know that the Xbox One has a failsafe that shuts down the console when the internals reach a certain temperature, to prevent permanent damage. If your Xbox One feels hot to the touch, you should check the ventilation and make sure it\u2019s free of dust and other blockages, to optimize cooling. Be sure to give the console an open space to breathe. If not, check for companies that offer console-cleaning services and dust removal. Some game stores offer it. If it\u2019s not a heat problem, check the software you have installed. The Xbox One has been known to shut down in the case of a fatal software error, and this extends from the menu itself, to apps, to games. These can happen at any time, and you should see if you can narrow the issue down to a specific function. That means trying to reproduce exactly what caused the crash. If you know what software is causing the issue, try a reinstall. If it\u2019s an unknown software, you may need to factory reset your system. While time consuming to reinstall everything, this is usually a surefire way to fix any software issues. If all else fails, take your console to a licensed repair shop. This may be the local game store down the road, or you may have to send it into Microsoft themselves. There will probably be a fee of some sort, but it\u2019s typically less than the cost of a new console. If nothing seems to fit the bill, it may be time to save up for a new console. Depending on your model, an upgrade may be in order. I know that my Xbox One X is much less prone to issues than the original Xbox One, and it seems like a worthwhile investment at the price point. Hopefully this helps! ",

            "answer_text": "Not a lot of information to go on but if it shutting off when it is sitting idle then my first suggestion would be to check the settings that turn it off/put it in rest mode if it sits idle. Check the power cord for damage. Also check where it plugs into the console and outlet. Sometimes depending on how the cord is bent, the cord gets damaged over time. It could be good enough to get the console up and running and just every now and then shorts out causing your problem. If this is the problem make sure to replace it. The other thing I can think of is over heating. Dust the vents, make sure there is nothing covering them. If you need to relocate the console because it could be against the wall of a shelving unit or things could have been placed close enough to it that proper airflow isn't happening. Also make sure nothing is on the Xbox because I believe they vent hot air up and the side vents are for air in. ",
