This will allow physicians to spend three times as much face-time with their patients as they currently do by eliminating the clerical computer workload facing physicians.Replacing billing systems-based EMRs with NLP classifiers \u2014 automated clinical knowledge extraction and classification systems. The current crop of EMRs are built around collecting as much coding data as possible in an attempt to maximize Medicare revenue. These EMRs are directly responsible for the epidemic of physician burnout, which now affects more than 50% of practicing physicians. NLP classifiers are AI agents that take over these mind-numbing clerical tasks for the physician. NLP classifiers could replace the traditional physician\u2019s billing technology with an automated system that requires no billing staff and no dedicated billing systems (in the US).A Learning Health Care System. The Holy Grail of the AIM (Artificial Intelligence in Medicine) field has been to link statistical inference engines directly to large-scale clinical databases in order to directly link patient records to the latest published research, alert clinicians to new clinical knowledge that could help them provide better care, and rapidly identify evolving biological threats to the population.Machine learning for automated clinical research. While the majority of machine learning activities have focused on pattern recognition, such as identifying micro-calcifications in a mammogram, there is another class of machine learning that focuses on automating the tasks that epidemiologists and biostatisticians focus on. For example, there is a study that is being readied for publication that shows how an analysis of > 1 million patient records is able to predict the most-likely course of disease progression in a patient with a chronic disease. By understanding the likely course of disease progression, we can more cost-effectively deploy care management strategies that effectively reduce the long-term costs for health systems.Physicians who are cross-trained in computer science have been working in the Artificial Intelligence in Medicine (AIM) field since the AI Winter of the early 1970s, with the introduction of clinical expert systems such as Mycin, DXplain, Internist-I, AI/RHEUM and others. In 1986, the US National Library of Medicine launched the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS), with the hopes of establishing a language-independent symbolic language for NLP systems, inference engines, and for the exchange of clinical data between computer systems, independent of the language that the data was originally captured in; the UMLS has been used successfully in international settings. For example: I designed the NLP interface for the EMR that was deployed by the International Olympic Committee at the Rio 2106 Olympics. Clinical data was collected from the athletes in their native language, then transformed into the UMLS-based symbolic language for analysis and data interchange. It worked\u2026 ",

            "answer_text": "We\u2019re in the very early stages, but ultimately AI will have a profound and pervasive impact for all people working in medicine, for patients, for hospitals, and the economics of healthcare. Let me review some of the principal impacts that I cover in my new book, Deep Medicine: How Artificial Intelligence Can Make Healthcare Human Again and in the so-called Topol Review, the recently completed report I issued with a multi-disciplinary team from the United Kingdom on the future of its National Health System (NHS). Liberation from keyboards by using speech recognition, bringing back face-to-face contact during medical encounters.Augmented performance of accuracy and speed by radiologists, pathologists, eye doctors, heart doctors, gastroenterologists, and all specialties by machine interpretation of scans, slides, retina pictures, electrocardiograms, and finding small polyps during colonoscopy (all of which involve deep learning algorithms).Training machines to see things that humans cannot and will not be able to see by thousands or even millions of inputs (data in forms of images, speech or text) yielding things like seeing blood potassium levels on a smartwatch without any blood sample, \u201cseeing\u201d genetic mutations of a cancer on a slide that cannot be discerned by expert pathologists, or being able to predict the function of the heart from an electrocardiogram only.Developing the virtual medical coach or assistant to seamlessly collect, integrate and process all of one\u2019s data and the medical literature (see Figure) to help a patient prevent a condition or better manage one that is present. Eliminate the need for regular hospital rooms by performing exquisite monitoring in the patient\u2019s home using sensors and AI algorithms. This would not reduce the need for intensive care units for critically ill patients, or operating rooms and emergency rooms, but the rest of the hospital could essentially be out-migrated to patient bedrooms at far more convenience and less cost that our current model relying in our very expensive facilities (~$5,000 a day average in the United States).",
