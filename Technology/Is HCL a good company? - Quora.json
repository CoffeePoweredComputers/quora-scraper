            "answer_text": "Hi .. I completed my graduation in EEE( electrical and electronics engineering). I'm from Hyderabad. I got placed in HCL in Nov ,2014. HCl is just like any other service based company. They asked to report in Chennai. Training You won't get chance to select (or request) location. You have to report where ever they said.They will decide your domain (testing , development)according to alphabetical order of your name. they will not consider your talent or any certifications you have. You will get training according to your domain.You can't learn anything in training. Sometimes training will be given by 3rd party.Even though you are trained in Java or Oracle , you can be deployed to Testing. ** But reverse is not possible .If you are from EEE , MECH Or Civil don't expect anything from training.Project Your career depends on the project you get.Don't expect to be deployed in project as early as possible. Some people got deployed with in one month after training , for some people it may take one year.You won't get chance to choose project. Because getting project is not in your hand.Some accounts (projects) are good . You can learn something.Some projects are worst , you have to do just excel work.Even after working for 4 years you are zero in open market.Appraisal As usual there is partiality/ politics in appraisals.If you do your managers work , you may get good rating.If you work for project and learn new things definitely you will not get good rating.If one of the members in team got good rating definitely others will get minimum rating / appraisal. **Irrespective of your work / talent.As one of our friends said in other answer \u2026Their tagline: \u201cEmployee first, Customer Second\u201d actually means \u201cEmployee will be exploited first and then we will move on to exploit the customer\u201d Infrastructure Some campuses are good. Not all.# your work - life balance is depends on your manager, project , client. ## Don't ask about job satisfaction. That varies from person to person. Conclusion: Nothing is in your hand, except your I'd card. You are one of 1 lakh . I think this is the case in most Indian service based companies. So no negative about HCL. ",

            "answer_text": "Hi, to be honest a lot of things matter in this small question. experience, technology and work company has in its belly. let me give you my example: i joined HCL 5 years back . did my training and got project and was given a middleware tool which has a niche market and i was happy. i worked hard and 1st year got no hike, which didnt upset me coz i was still new and i was sure i will get my due. another year, another year of hard work goes by and the hike was 22000 p.a. then i was pissed and started looking for job, but i was just 2 years in experience and my knowledge was not yet market worthy so i studied and cracked an interview with accenture but they also offered just 50k hike. i refused. in 2014 i got 20% hike and in 2015 i cracked another MNC and they offered flat 100% hike. and guess what i did? i refused coz hcl had put my H1B application and i was selected in lottery and i thought by end of 2015 i will be in USA. (we all dream of it) since i am in India writing this, you can imagine that also never happened. in 2015 i got 15% hike. after that, i havent had any luck with onshore or hike or promotion. and my work ethics and efforts took a hit and i satrted to get out of touch. and finally now i have upped my pace and trying for jobs again. my net hike from 2011 to 2017 hasn\u2019t even doubled. and the only reason to stay-my H1b has gone to shit. so thats that. in terms of environment: there is little to no politics i have faced. easy, work and flexible environment. made good friends with team mates and managers. few people know me. work wise: if you are in project from scratch and you put efforts you will learn and if you don\u2019t nobody is going to bother also. this is just my 5years and i hope this helps. P.S: if you feel you are stagnant and want to move out , you have to do in such a way you don\u2019t piss people. they can bite you :) choose and know the tech well, learn and always learn as if its imp. switch at rght time, not too early, not too late.
