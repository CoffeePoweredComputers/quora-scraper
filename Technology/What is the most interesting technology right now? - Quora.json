            "answer_text": "There will be one million on field tech jobs the United States in the \tcoming years. It's \ta lot of jobs you have already heard it referenced here today \tpundits are calling this project in supply and demand gap that tack \ttalent crunch and it's already gotten started according to glassdoor \tresearch there are currently more than two hundred and fifty \tthousand on filled tech jobs costing the economy more than twenty \tbillion dollars annually. Those \tnumbers may help to explain why one third of the H. R. budgets are \tdedicated to recruiting and retaining tech talent and why ninety \tpercent of executives list just that as one of their top challenges. Two \tyears ago I found in school that helps people from non traditional \tbackgrounds start careers in technology to help fill that gap. Click here read about: Future of Work Series: Part 2 - Sure Ways to Prepare for Talent Shortage And \tI've come to believe that the tech talent crunch may be exactly the \tcrisis the industry needs to reboot itself for the road ahead. Our \tworld is being fundamentally changed by software tech giants like \tGoogle and Facebook have obvious impacts but there are countless \tother less flashy changes happening in virtually every part of our \tdaily lives. To \tbe in the audience probably use online banking I'm guessing the \tmajority view of probably called an uber from your smartphone and \tthe really brave early adopters amongst you might Sidle into the \tself checkout lanes of the grocery stores every once in awhile. The \tpoint is technology has become central to company operations across \tthe board and that's changing not just how we as consumers are \tinteracting with these organizations but it's also changing about \thow they think about building the teams that they need to run their \tbusinesses. In \tgetting ready for today's talk I pulled up some job listings locally \tin Minneapolis for Java script which is one of the foundational \ttechnologies the web and something we focus on my school and I found \tcompanies hiring full time software engineers in the following \tindustries accounting data security education government home \tfurnishings hospitality insurance logistics manufacturing marketing \tmedia medical and dental care software supports research restaurants \tand retail so that's at least two brats worth of industries and that \tis in the first four out of sixty three pages of results. So \tover two thirds of computing jobs are now outside what most of us \twould think of as tech companies the tools that you'll all use in \tthe future shop to access health care to connect with your family to \tget your news to travel and to put food on your table both \tfiguratively and literally are being created right now by designers \tand engineers and all of these different industries. I \tdon't think it's hyperbole to say that the future of everything is \tbeing written in code. If \tthose are the stakes who's behind those keyboards this is what the \ttypical programmer looks like according to an annual survey done by \ta company called stack overflow. There \tare eighty nine percent male their eighty eight percent white nation \tand the average age is twenty eight. Seventy \tfive percent of these people studied computer science in college \tbefore starting their careers. So \tthese numbers paint a portrait of technology generally that looks a \tlot like Silicon Valley both the place and the cast of the HBO TV \tshow demographically developers represent only a fraction of our \tpopulation but beyond that the majority of spent their entire \tcareers in software. The \tpeople that are creating software revolutionize all of these \tindustries are routinely working with very little if any personal \tcontext of the sectors they're seeking to disrupt and none of this \tis new but as we scramble to address those one million on Phil tech \tjobs I believe that we only do agree that the future of everything \tis too important to put in the hands of a small group of people just \tbecause they know how to cope. I \tthink the future demands more than that I believe that organizations \tneed to build teams inclusive of the audiences they aim to Sir. Ladies \thave shown that organizations with diverse management teams are \tthirty five percent more likely to financial returns above their \tindustry mean and are more likely to develop new products and \tinnovations and I absolutely believe that this principle transfers \twhole cloth into software development. I \tthink it comes down to a topic that we've heard about today already \twhich is empathy. And \tmy school one of our core beliefs is the MPV beats engineering \tsimply put a well engineered solution to a problem you don't \tunderstand very well is not likely to be a success by building a \tteam that can establish meaningful active empathy with their users \tcompanies can better understand and serve their needs I've seen what \tcan happen and what can be accomplished by developers and designers \twho understand their audience I seen language jobs created by \tdevelopers who spent years teaching English abroad I've seen store \tinventory systems developed by engineers who started their careers \tin retail. I \tseen mental health tools created by people whose lives have been \ttouched by mental illness. In \teach of these cases the life experience and the user empathy lead to \ta better product developed more quickly and for a lower cost. What \twould be great if that argument alone sparked a revolution in the \tindustry to embrace a more inclusive hiring strategy we might not \thave to wait for enlightenment to spark the change. At \tthe end of the day there aren't enough programmers to horse around \tso luckily companies have to think of different ways to approach \tthings explosion of demanded technology colliding with a wholly \tinadequate talent pipeline is exactly the crisis we need to shock a \tcomplacent industry into changing their entrenched ideas and \tpractices around hiring. Whether \tto intentionally build a more inclusive team or simply to keep up \twith the demands of an increasingly digital world companies are \thaving to re examine their processes in order to tap a broader pool \tof talent. Right \tnow while the demand is so high in the supply so low we have a \tunique window to retrain the industry to embrace talent that can \thelp them build teams that can develop empathy with their users. That \topportunity has helped to fuel a new breed of immersive accelerated \tlearning programs that are helping to bring on under and unhappily \temployed people from diverse backgrounds and demographics into the \ttech sector. Tech \tboot camps as they're sometimes called first appeared about five \tyears ago but this year more than a hundred programs will graduate \ttwenty three thousand people into the industry that's about a fifth \tof people coming from traditional sources so it's starting to really \tmake an impact. In \tthese programs students are typically spending about five months \tstudying most of its sixty to eighty hours a week building skills \tand software engineering user experience design and other in demand \tareas it might sound a little crazy you quit your job and you \tdedicate basically every waking moment to learning but it's working \tnearly ninety percent of the grads from my school start cruise \tintact within six months and other programs across the country have \tsimilar success rates. So \thow did these candidates look relative to the average developer. The \tfifty seven percent male there seventy nine percent white or Asian \tand the average age is thirty. So \tdemographically bootcamp grads are more inclusive than the industry \tbut the biggest difference is the diversity of backgrounds and the \tfact that the vast majority these people are coming from outside of \ttechnology. Since \thail from a wide variety of industries but some of the most strongly \trepresented our retail education finance and health care all of \twhich are industries that are being actively disrupted by software \tand were insights from the field could be terrifically relevant. If \tthe tech industry wants to rise to the challenge of reinventing our \tworld accelerated learning must be part of the solution alongside \tother efforts to diversify the stem talent pipeline. Graduates \tof these programs can help organizations to diversify their \tdemographics and backgrounds of their teams immediately while \tbringing valuable context from a variety of different industries \tthat can help ground innovative digital solutions with real world \texperience. The \tchallenge of filling those one million jobs is an opportunity for \ttechnology to reinvent itself. We \tcan choose to elevate empathy for users and bring the human side of \tsoftware development to the forefront. All \tthat's required is for organizations to think critically about who \tbelongs on the teams that will build the future for their companies \tand for their users need to embrace nontraditional Canada may bring \tthe context and empty to the table that can help. I \tknow first hand that there is an army of on tap smart capable people \tout there waiting to help change the world the software we just need \tto give them a chance. ",

            "answer_text": "Nanotechnology, but in a really cool way. You remember the microbots in Big Hero 6, right? Well, unfortunately, those microbots are impossible, but there is a similar technology that\u2019s being developed in real life. The idea is to build tiny replicators that can create more of themselves, like a sort of super bacteria that never stops replicating. Such a technology would be unbelievably dangerous. In fact: \u201c\u2026the first replicator assembles a copy in one thousand seconds, the two replicators then build two more in the next thousand seconds, the four build another four . . in less than two days, they would outweigh the Earth; in another four hours, they would exceed the mass of the Sun and all the planets combined\u2009\u2026\u201d Of course, self-replicators require materials, so they aren\u2019t going to spread through space or anything. But they would have an abundance of material on Earth, especially of carbon, which would likely be the building blocks of such an assemblers. If you were carrying a jar of them and tripped and they spilled out, and they had no limit, they would quickly devour the entire earth with no way of stopping them. But here is where things get interesting: These tiny robots would have the ability to construct molecules from atoms, giving them the ability to produce amazing materials like graphene, cubes of apple, and even brain material. With advanced nanotechnology in the form of self-replicators, the entire world would experience a revolution. Think for a second about what wouldn\u2019t change in the face of machines that can produce everything. Production jobs would cease. The price of every item ever created would be lowered massively. Supercomputers and experiments regarding brain material would become almost commonplace. Terraforming other planets would take years if not months. And all of this is actually realistic. There is a lot of power contained within those tiny machines.  ",
