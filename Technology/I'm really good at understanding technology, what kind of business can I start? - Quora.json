            "answer_text": "For the longest time I\u2019ve made the mistake of confusing my understanding of technology for an understanding of business. I urge you to not make the same mistake. For that reason it is largely irrelevant that you understand technology when you start out - at most that would help you grasp the inner workings of a product or service. It won\u2019t help you understand the value of a product. My advice is to take step back and start learning about business. You can do this by identifying problems that can be solved and validating possible solutions. For example, at one time I had the idea that I could manufacture and sell pillows. I called some buyers at local furniture stores and they gave me an indication of what they pay for pillows and that they would consider buying from me at the right price. I then went to a place that manufactured stuffing and I looked at the cost of material. Then I added rental of an industrial sewing machine, the cost of labor per hour, the number of units to be produced per hour and the cost of delivery. Using these numbers I figured out whether pillows were a viable idea. It wasn\u2019t. The point is that your understanding of technology will only gain value when you figured out how to pick and validate a viable product or service. Different to some of the other advice here I don\u2019t believe passion plays a role - business is initially a game of cash flow and blooms into a game of developing value-bearing assets. Learn how to generate, maintain and grow cash flow and you will be able to take on any business that strikes your fancy. ",

            "answer_text": "You have to be more specific. What kind of technology? AI, Front-End, Back-End, Full-Stack, Biomed, etc. Understanding technology is one thing, but starting a business is something completely different. If you don\u2019t believe me, ask yourself why aren\u2019t there professors making millions of dollars instead of slaving away teaching future millionaires. Once you can say I understand business and technology, you will be able to answer your own question. I hope this answers your question and if you want more specific business advice, please visit RGarcia dot Org. Best of luck. Robert ",
