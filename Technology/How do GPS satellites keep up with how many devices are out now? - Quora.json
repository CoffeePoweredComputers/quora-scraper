            "answer_text": "How do GPS satellites keep up with how many devices are out now? GPS satellites are not two-way communicators. All a GPS satellite does is transmit the time according to their on-board atomic clock. GPS receivers (navigation units like in your phone or car) work by listening to multiple GPS satellites. Each satellite is in a different location and will have different speed-of-light delays to the receiver, so the receiver will get the same atomic clock signals at slightly different times. By comparing the differences between signals, the receiver can pin down its location. GPS satellites just transmit across the whole world. It makes no difference to the satellites whether 1 GPS receiver is listening or a billion GPS receivers are listening - the satellites just keep broadcasting the time. ",

            "answer_text": "Q: How do GPS satellites keep up with how many devices are out now? A: They don\u2019t. They never listen to your device. Instead, they send out a regular signal containing its exact time and position. Your device then listen to at least four GPS satellites. When the device has the time and position from four satellites plus the relative time it received it, it can use those four sets of data to calculate its exact time and position. Mathematically, there\u2019s only one place (and time) where your device can be if it \u201cknows\u201d the exact position of four GPS satellites, the time it was there, and the relative time when that data was received. Your device can then tell the cellphone network, another satellite, or the device manufacturer exactly where it is, but it doesn\u2019t talk to the GPS satellite. ",
