            "answer_text": "I am rather suspicious of liquid laundry detergents, in case it is a gimmick to get more money out of people for the same necessity of washing clothes. There is nothing at all wrong with powdered detergents, and they worked fine for decades. This is what they contain: 1. Sodium carbonate. This is the main washing agent and is a mild alkali. 2. Sodium tripolyphosphate. This is a water softener; without it, calcium carbonate would precipitate from hard water and cause white flecks on the washed clothing. 3. Sodium dodecylbenzene sulphonate (NaDDBS). This is the detergent that loosens dirt and emulsifies grease. It is generally supplied let down slightly with sodium sulphate to give a grainy powder form, since it is somewhat waxy in pure form. 4. Non ionic surfactant defoamer such as ethylene oxide/propylene oxide block copolymer. This prevents foam from the NaDDBS. It should be active in cold water for the newer cold wash powders. Some nonionics precipitate in warm water and cause defoaming. Larger amounts of nonionics will be active detergents and emulsifiers. 5. Proteolytic and lipolytic enzyme. This is the 'biological' component and will digest body fluids, food stains, etc. 6. \"Per\" salt such as sodium percarbonate, actually a hydrogen peroxide of crystallisation adduct with a salt. This is the bleaching agent. It can reduce the colour of stains. On the negative side, bleaches can lighten some dyes. 7. Per salt activator, which is a nitrogen ring compound such as from cyanuric acid.. This produces oxygen from the bleach. 8. Sodium carboxymethyl cellulose. This is a stabiliser for dispersed dirt, and prevents redeposition. It produces a colloidal solution or particles which limit the mobility of the dirt particles. 9. Optical brightening agent.. This fluoresces blue under UV light and neutralises any slight yellowing of fabrics due to age. Blue and yellow lights add together to produce white, whereas in subtractive (dye) mode they make green. 10. Optional blue colour specks. Just for show, although they do indicate what the powder is for. Blue violet dyes used to be used to correct yellowing. In this case, green is not produced even though the colours are subtractive because the violet part masks the yellow. 11. Perfume. Again, optional, but people expect it and it also indicates that the powder is a detergent, to make things smell better! 12. Free-flow agent. There is a variety of types including powdered silica gel or magnesium carbonate. These enable the otherwise sticky mix to flow from the box and into and from the dispenser. ** Most washing powders that I know have been 'spray dried'. This gives them a lighter bulk density so that they flow readily down the chute with the water current. Plain mixes of these, mainly, powdered ingredients give dense powders that do not pour easily. Whether the important parts of those concepts can be all incorporated into a liquid, I don't know, but as a formulator I do know that compromises are often made. At least with the gel pods that are sold these days, some of the ingredients can be kept separate until they are ready to go into action. ",

            "answer_text": "The German \u201cStiftung Warentest\u201d[1] has done a few comparisons between liquid and powder detergent and so far always the powders have come out ahead as they are better in getting the clothes clean. I\u2019ve used liquids for a time, because I - like some of the others here - had problems with the white residue, especially on dark clothes. But I wasn\u2019t really happy about the results the liquids delivered and I wanted to produce less waste. Concentrated powders use a lot less packing - the concentrated powder is in heavy foil while the liquid needs a sturdy bottle - and can be more densely stored so can be transported much more efficiently. Then I read about the test results, that powder also washes better and I tried to find a way to make the powder work for me. It was rather easy - just use quite a bit less than what the package suggests, around 2/3 of that amount. The clothes still get clean and no more residue left on even black garments. I only use liquid detergent for my hand wash garments because on that program the washing machine just doesn\u2019t have enough agitation to dissolve powder. Most people living in western civilization don\u2019t have that heavy stains on their clothes - at least in my case. If I have real stains, I just use some stain remover on those spots. And my whites get a bit of \u201cFleckensalz\u201d (special cleaner, that is sold separately in the aisle with washing detergents - I have no idea how it would be called in English, it\u2019s oxygen based bleach) every now and then to keep them white. I\u2019m using a European style front loader with rather low water usage. Footnotes[1] Stiftung Warentest - Wikipedia",
