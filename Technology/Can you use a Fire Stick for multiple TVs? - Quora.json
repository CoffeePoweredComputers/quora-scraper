            "answer_text": "Hi, not sure what your goal is, but this is what I wanted to do. I wanted to be able to hook up one Fire TV stick to 3 TVs in different rooms, so I could easily go from room to Room and watch the same thing on all 3 TVs. This is actually a bigger issue when using the Fire TV Recast (TV tuner) because it can only be use on 2 Fire Sticks at once, so if you want it on 3 TVs you can\u2019t (plus you can\u2019t have 2 Recasts on your network). So if this was you goal, the best bet is to buy an HDMI splitter (I got a 4 way splitter), you can find them for about $20 from amazon. You will also need to buy HDMI cables, if you want to span long distance for the HDMI, I recommend getting an HDMI extender over RJ45 (networking cables), HDMI extenders (it is a set of a receiver and a sender) at amazon they go for about $10 (they go for up to 100 feet). You will need to buy a pair of cat 5e cables of the length you want. A pair of 100ft cables can be found for about $20\u2026 Also since the Fire TV stick remote is Bluetooth, you can control the Fire TV from a different room, you might want to get an extra remote for each room\u2026 But sadly, the remote that also does volume and TV power can only store one set of TV ir-codes so if your TVs use different ir-Codes, you will only be able to control the Fire Stick not the TV volume and power\u2026 I asked Amazon to work on that, how hard could it be, you can control multiple ir based media devices just only one TV\u2026 Hope this helps. Here is a list of a few web links for the parts I have described.

            "answer_text": "Yes you can. There are a number of ways that this can be done. You can either unplug and physically move the stick from room to room but most TV HDMI sockets are not particularly easy to access on a regular basis. Another way would be use some sort of splitter to separate the signal from the stick to multiple TVs but this would require extended cables or additional hardware to convert the signal to Network signalling and back again. The problem with this is this type of equipment is relatively expensive for good quality equipment. A further method would be to purchase multiple fire sticks on the same account but Amazon video limits you to the simultaneous use of three devices per account with the same steam being allowed to two devices simultaneously. I currently have two 4k fire sticks, a 1080p stick and a couple of spares (one of which is linked to my phone hotspot for when I travel) As an aside Amazon in the UK now no longer sell the 1080p version of the fire stick and only have the Cube and the 4k sick available as of 08/08/2020 ",

If you are asking if you can use a single Firestick to watch movies or whatever on multiple tv's at the same time .The answer is \u201cNo\u201d .but if you have your Firestick cconnected to tv in the living room you can easily disconnect it and connect it in the bedroom. kids room .Or you can even do what i do and take it on vacation for the hotel stays. If you don't want to disconnect it constantly Amazon has the Firesticks on sale for a limited time. Hope my answer helped. ",
