Do you remember in the 2000's when cellphones would make a loud buzzing noise from the speakers inside a car? That doesn't happen anymore. So smartphone manufacturers are careful because hurting people would be the end of their company, so they perform all sorts of tests to make sure it's safe, sometimes they use rats as test subjects. Ask a scientist, don't get your information from some guy on the internet. ",
