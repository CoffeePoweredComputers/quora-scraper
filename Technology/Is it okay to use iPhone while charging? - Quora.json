            "answer_text": "If you think it\u2019s bad, you have an incorrect understanding of how batteries work. This question has been asked and answered so many times it\u2019s sad. So rather than repeat myself yet again, I\u2019ll quote myself here: iPhones are designed to be used while charging. Apple doesn\u2019t design products to fail when used as designed. Charging more often actually improves battery life as opposed to allowing the battery to drain significantly before charging it. So it\u2019s best to charge as often as is convenient for you. Note: If you are worrying about when the battery will die, you\u2019re doing it wrong. All batteries have limited lifespans and must eventually be replaced. The minute they leave the factory, they start degrading. Due to fluctuations in the mass production manufacturing process and differences in usage including environmental factors and usage patterns, some batteries age faster than others. Worrying about it changes nothing. Stop babysitting your battery. Just use and enjoy your iPhone. When the battery needs to be replaced, you\u2019ll know it. When that time comes, for best results you should have it replaced with an authentic Apple battery by an Apple-authorized technician.

            "answer_text": "Ideally, you shouldn\u2019t be eating while you work. But you do, because you\u2019re in some hurry. At the same time, you be careful that you do not spoil any of your work by spilling. Right? Similarly, you can use the iPhone while on charge, but make sure you\u2019re not making direct contact to the phone, either by speaking over a call without earphones or by lying down with your head close to it. Technically there is a transfer of electic charges in and out of the phone which creates a magnetic as well as hear field and an energy involved in this process. Maybe your hands wouldn\u2019t be much affected with it, but when you place it close to your head , there can be radiations striking parts of your brain, but of very small intensity though. When it becomes habitual and you continue speaking on phone while charging, some parts of your brain and heart could become prone to damage. So you can. But just be careful to stay away from it or just use it for texting/surfing the net. Calls over a earphones can be less harmful. Take care mate :) ",
