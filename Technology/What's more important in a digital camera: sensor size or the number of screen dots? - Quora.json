            "answer_text": "What's more important in a digital camera: sensor size or the number of screen dots? You\u2019d think that as technology improves, a generalization like that would become simpler, especially considering that in the old days of film, generally speaking, size mattered. A perfect 35mm negative might produce an outstanding print but it couldn\u2019t hold a candle to a well-turned out 4x5 shot which in turn would be blown away by an 8x10. But today, with who knows how many software engines embedded in every digital camera, it\u2019s harder to come away with safe generalizations, especially given the deliberate muddying of the water by marketing hype. Generally speaking, the bigger the sensor, the more potential for quality. Comparing two sensors of similar size, generally higher pixel count translates to a better potential for better resolution. But that potential depends on the lenses, the software, the compression schemes, if any, and any number of design choices that are based on both costs and quality. Your best hope for determining the likely product of any imaging system is to look closely at samples produced, compare technical specifications (not marketing materials) and - growing more and more relevant - read technical reviews that analyze the image handling methodology and then decide which of these you\u2019ll give weight to and in what proportions. A photographer looking to shoot family snapshots that might occasionally be enlarged will be looking for sharp pictures, good contrast and true colors, but not to quite the same degree as a photographer who is hanging their livelihood on a stable of camera bodies and lenses.

            "answer_text": "If by \u201cscreen dots\u201d you mean really screen dots, well, it\u2019s deeply irrelevant for a digital camera. If by any chance you mean number of pixels on the sensor itself, well, it is important, but what makes the image quality is the combination of it and the size of the sensor, most notably resulting in a better low-light sensitivity and a smoother transition from sharp to blurry and nicer bokeh. The most striking example that I have experimented first-hand is the difference between the Nikon D300 and D700, both of which sporting 12 MP but on an APS-C and a 24*36 sensor. I used the D300 up to ISO 1600, and only in raw, sometimes up to 3200. On the D700, I learnt quickly that ISO-auto set with a maximum of 6400 was more than just ok - that is one stop of clear difference, maybe two. But I am still unsure what you mean. ",

            "answer_text": "The person pushing the button. I\u2019m not sure what you mean by screen dots? Do you mean the resolution of the view screen on the back? If so then that is utterly irrelevant to the quality of the final image. I suspect that you mean megapixel count in which case sensor size is a much better indicator of quality as bigger sensors have better performance in low light and usually are fitted to higher quality cameras. A full frame DSLR has a sensor size of around 24x35mm. A point and shoot compact camera such as a Nikon Coolpix 7000 has a sensor size of around 7.5x5.5mm. An iPhone 7 camera has a sensor that is about 5x6mm. Often you will see cameras rated by megapixel count. This is the resolution of the sensor. More megapixels will usually mean a more detailed image, but a worse performance in low light conditions (when compared to another sensor of the same size) so, if you are choosing a camera, choose sensor size over megapixel count.

            "answer_text": "The screen size and dots are just to have a preview. Is nice to have a good screen with good contrast, lots of dots and a swing arm, but in no case is indispensable even when the \u201cdigital picture experience\u201d is somewhat ruined by not being able to see the preview. Remember, the old film cameras didn\u2019t have screen and were used to take the best pictures in history. The sensor size isn\u2019t that important neither, unless you are a pro photographer. For a newbie, there\u2019s no difference between ASP-C, Micro 3:4 or full frame. For a fashion photographer, on the other hand, the difference is life and death. ",

The higher the DPI or pixels per inch, PPI the more detailed your image will be. Larger sensors, measured in megapixels will produce larger images and generally higher PPI. Pixels per inch refers to the way a monitor displays an image while dots per inch refers to the way an image is printed on paper. I would always look for larger sensors which will inherently render higher PPI and ultimately higher DPI ",

            "answer_text": "Actually, the lens. Any camera that delivers more than 8\u201312 megapixels has more than enough resolution for most uses. Folks imagining they will publish photos in National Geographic may want more, but for everyone else (including may professional users) current resolution (i.e, the number of dots) is perfectly adequate. A larger sensor, however, permits use of larger lenses. And it is the physical size of the actual lens opening that captures light and allows a more shallow depth of focus for subject isolation. ",
