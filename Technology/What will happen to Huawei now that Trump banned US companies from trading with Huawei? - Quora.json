            "answer_text": "First, it must be made clear that the issue with Huawei is very real. Some Trump-obsessed detractors continue to argue that it is not. Below is a high-speed video compression card that contains a \u201cback door\u201d that was designed-in by Chinese contractors. It is the size of a grain of rice in the white circle. China Used a Tiny Chip in a Hack That Infiltrated U.S. Companies  Now consider that Huawei has massive reach in consumer and telecommunications markets. How foolish would it be to not suspect that China, seeking (at least) parity with the U.S., would not seek to take advantage of this opening? So, what will happen to Huawei? Huawei will have to prove its to be \u201cbug free\u201d. A start would be for them to turn over their circuit schematics and integrated circuit designs and masks. There will (ironically) be protests over Chinese intellectual property rights. This won\u2019t be enough, however, because it is possible to design integrated circuits that have (what one could call) \u201csleeper circuits\u201d, circuits that do nothing until they are triggered by a specific set of undocumented commands. The U.S. could provide the circuits and relegate China to the task of assembly only, but the value of this has to be looked at on a case-by-case basis. There is no easily solution because China is obviously trying to claw its way upward. And, as we all know, when you have a needy person in your social group, the dynamics change quite a bit. ",

            "answer_text": "Companies for now are granted permission to sell products to Huawei. The impact on Huawei\u2019s phone business is the least of their concern though as their infrastructure uses US intellectual property (think servers, software, chip fabrication equipment, etc). Should a full ban be implemented, Huawei will fall flat on its face. They wouldn\u2019t even be able to use the ARM architecture that underpins much of what they sell. ",

This may delay or throttle deployment of 5G infrastructure for example. This could also make Chinese consumer boycott US brands such as Apple. I don\u2019t see any silver lining from this ban. ",
