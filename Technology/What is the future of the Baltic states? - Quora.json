            "answer_text": "I can speak the most confidently about my country, Latvia. We are fucked. We are frogs swimming in a bowl of water. There is a fire underneath the bowl, heating up the water and slowly boiling us alive. However, the process is so slow (and the water at such a pleasant temperature right now!) that we are going to boil, die and be forgotten instead of waking up and jumping out of the fucking place. That is how I see the future of Latvia. I don\u2019t see any fundamental differences that could lead Estonia or Lithuania in a vastly different direction. That is so because of multiple problems that manifest as a single, devastating symptom: depopulation. Every year, more people die than are born.Every year, more people leave Latvia to live elsewhere than come here from abroad.Let\u2019s consider these items in a bit more detail. The Dead 1 : 0 Infants It is expensive to raise a child primarily because most ladies in Latvia work and have careers, often better ones than their partners. So having a child does not just add the cost of childcare items to a family\u2019s budget (nappies, clothes that last 2\u20133 months at most, kindergarten, additional classes, etc.); the biggest impact is from the family losing a huge chunk of its income while the mother is not working. And while the social system kind of allows one of the parents to stay home with their baby for a year on a decent proportion of their pre-child pay, it\u2019s just the first year. It is nearly impossible for both parents to return to full productivity and, therefore, earnings right at the end of those first 12 months. I haven\u2019t seen any studies on this but my own observations suggest that for the first three years of a child\u2019s life the parents make around 80% of what they used to before. They work a whole day for free every week. And then you have another child, and your income drops even lower. The solution would be for people to have wages where it is possible to sustain a reasonable quality of life even on 80% of their income. We are a long way off that, and the result is that people defer having children, and when they do, they often stop at one. (Or, in a more recent trend, people with very low or no income at all have more children since that way they get at least something from the state. We can make an educated guess at the quality of life those children enjoy.) At the same time, we have a bastard healthcare system that, in a stroke of genius, combines the worst features of free healthcare, insurance-paid solution, and private medicine. In the end the medics are underpaid, the queues to see a specialist take months of waiting with no treatment, private medicine is horrendously expensive for most people, and we can\u2019t even easily buy insurance (it is available to individuals only through pools, such as an entire company). So the older folks, who have smaller incomes and less tenacity to go after insurance coverage with a friend, child or whoever, don\u2019t get the treatment they need and die before their time of trivial health complications. The solution would be to: Set an annual threshold of medical expenses which people must cover themselves - say, EUR 500Ask yourself - how much do you really spend on doctors in an average year?Have the state cover only treatments in excess of this thresholdHave people pay themselves for everything below the thresholdIn one move we have: 1) Eliminated the burden of tens of thousands of trivial cases paid by the government which frees up resources for people who really need them; 2) Created a clear market for private medical insurance since we now have a known cap on medical bills for any single customer, so calculating the premium becomes trivial; 3) Energized the healthcare sector which now no longer needs to defer treatment to match the availability of state-paid quotas.Foreign lands 1 : 0 Latvia At pretty much every level of experience, working abroad results in a better quality of life for Latvians. The higher cost of living in the Nordics and Western Europe is more than offset by their even higher earnings, so the move makes sense financially for nearly everyone who decides to emigrate. So they do, and they take their families with them, and they settle down living regular lives. Once you have a steady job, a mortgage, a school your kids go to and a few friends living nearby, why would you give up all of that to go back somewhere where nothing is certain? And so we have two ongoing effects draining the population and bleeding Latvia out by a thousand cuts. The effects are: Shrinking market \u2192 fewer investors, less competition, higher prices charged by those who remain (yes, a lot of food does cost more in Latvia than it does in Germany)Shrinking labor force \u2192 fewer employees to pick from, some skills literally not available in the market at all, and the resulting difficulty with cultivating or attracting high quality employers in Latvia; therefore, less and less chance for the people remaining here to get to a level of income where they can afford more children\u2026 and we\u2019re back to problem #1So what is the future? On the observable evidence: Long-term population will probably stabilize at around 1 million peopleMost of them - perhaps as many as 75\u201380% - will be living in the capital, Riga since that is the only place where there will still be schools worth going to, doctors that know how to cure a patient, roads you can actually drive on, and a reliable supply of powerI doubt that we will be able to maintain these services for very much longer outside 3\u20134 urban centers if the population keeps shrinking the way it has beenWages will remain roughly constant at ca. 50% of EU average after they reach a peak some 5\u20137 years from now, with a few exceptions where people find an export niche for themselvesLatvians will slowly and painfully squeeze out the local Russians from existence, so the ethnic proportion will return to the 75+% Latvians it used to be before WW2Overall, it will be a grim, impoverished existence with no discernible hopes for improvement for the absolute majority of those who decide to stick aroundI think by the time we get there most of those who know what living in the USSR was like will be dead (or as good as); it is very likely that a Kremlin-sponsored populist movement will engineer another \u201creunion\u201d with Russia on the false promises of a better future. This time, there will be no breaking free.Is this avoidable? Is there a less bad scenario that is not completely make believe? I can think of one, however it is somewhat extreme and would require a lot of sacrifices from the people alive today. As such, it is not going to happen. ",

            "answer_text": "If you define the Baltic states Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, then the answer is that their futures are different. If you take Lithuania and Estonia as examples, they have different problems they are facing right now and different historical and socio-economical background that causes these. If you narrow it to the ethnic majority of the countries, Lithuanians had an own nobility with their own habits, cuisine, etc., and ideas that leaked into modern-day society, while Estonians didn\u2019t. In the luckiest case wealthier Estonians became merchants and took up German or Scandinavian habits and their language. But even then, there is a difference of Catholicism vs. Protestantism between Lithuania and Estonia. If you bring into the picture present-day ethnic pictures, then you see that Estonia has a calm but existing tension between Estonians and Russians that goes down to the level of working-places. In Lithuania the ethnic divide between Lithuanians, Poles and Russians is not so divisive. There were decades - generations - in between when Lithuanian and when Estonian peasants were liberated from serfdom. Literacy, industrialization, urban living spread later to Lithuania. Estonia had already had a well-built industry by the late 1930\u2019s and a social state competing with Sweden at its age. Lithuania was still primarily an agrarian country which witnessed similar levels of industrialization, welfare-state and literacy only during the decades of communism. Something that forms opinions and thoughts in people\u2019s mind for example about capitalism and socialism. And we have already reached to generations who are still alive and have voting rights today. Present-day Lithuania and Estonia, although both are building and maintaining strong ties with EU and try to embrace the ideas of Western democracy, are going into slightly different directions. Which is no surprise after the above. Lithuania\u2019s inhabitants are more conservative and more local in their ideas while Estonia has clearly decided to be like Finland or Sweden and are solidly on the way. With this I didn\u2019t state that any of these are better strategies than the other, just different. They are among slightly different circumstances too at the moment. Estonia supplies a great deal of its energy consumption by burning oil-shale while Lithuania has its own nuclear power plant for the same purpose. Something that might define their future ways and might influence some geopolitical decisions. (Feeling the need for renewable energy-sources vs. being satisfied with nuclear power. Although fortunately Lithuanians seem to perform relatively well in the proportion of renewable energies, so far so good). Estonians have a language-relative, wealthy country right in the neighborhood (Finland) to learn from and to travel to as guest-workers, Lithuanians don\u2019t have a similar big-brother around, they have to make somewhat bigger efforts for the same experience and money. So, Estonia and Lithuania start from different circumstances and have somewhat different ideas about which direction they would like to follow. Estonia can just \u201ccopy\u201d things and sooner or later become one of the technologically and socially developed, liberal Nordic countries while Lithuania has to invent more local ideas to its local circumstances to be successful in the future, in my humble opinion. So, visit other topics about what Estonia will be like in 20 years and what Lithuania will be like in twenty years and you\u2019ll get some ideas, but they will definitely not be the same. Maybe on a global scale, yes, but not from a closer look. Latvia is in between in many of its features with some own characteristics none of the other two have. For example, the biggest German influence in its culture and urban life. Still, I have the impression that sooner or later Latvians and Latvia always follow the Estonian decisions with a few years behind, so to answer the question, Latvia might be more alike Estonia in this comparison in the future.

            "answer_text": "As an Estonian, I can speak on behalf of my own country. So, what will happen to Estonia? Estonia has some fundamental problems that hamper the existence of a whole country. Firstly, the population is declining and aging. In 2013 there were 1.31 million people in Estonia. By 2040, there should be around 1.19 million people instead of 1.56 million we had during the peak in 1989. Young Estonians are reluctant to make more babies because of low income. Secondly, speaking of low wages and high prices, by 2040, Estonia will be totally bankrupt, unless we quickly do something to prevent it. Our government is mindlessly spending astronomical European development sums on pointless projects (like huge M\u00e4o intersection in the middle of nowhere) without realizing that there will be gigantic upkeep costs as well. The only method the government seems to have is raising taxes for the alcoholic beverages and in the transportation field. It\u2019s an amateur move as the prices of goods will keep rising, while the average income will basically stay the same. We are being systematically impoverished. And lastly, there are no industries in Estonia. I won\u2019t classify various small manufacturing plants or chopping some timber as industries. To prove the point, our import is much higher than export. Since we united with the EU, the monstrous army of bureaucrats has only grown. Basically, we don\u2019t produce anything useful, we only love to waste time on useless complicated paperwork and navigating through harsh regulations. Basically, we are dirt poor, but for the outside world we project the material image that we are rich. Heck, a cleaner in Finland earns more than a certified specialist in Estonia, although the prices in stores are comparable. Although I love my country, I must admit that soon might come a day, when we humbly ask for Russia\u2019s help. It might be sooner than we can expect. Meanwhile, we are all enjoying the ending ride as much as we can. ",

            "answer_text": "Estonia has perhaps unwittingly become a province of Sweden and Finland. Question: How does one get from Tallinn, the capital, to New York or Tokyo? Answer: Flies Finnair, via Helsinki. Question: How does one obtain a mortgage in Estonia? Answer: With the assistance of Swedbank of Skandinaviska Enskilden Banken. From what I understand, this was the actual foreign policy of the Swedes under the Bildt government in the early 1990s. They saw a tiny vacuum opening up to project \u201cSwedish power\u201d (if this actually exists) and they took it. By the late 1990s, it was consolidated. (Meantime, look at how some of the Scandinavian banks have used Estonia as an intermediary for doing business with Russia). Lennart Meri was half Swedish, and Toomas Hendrik Ilves was actually born in Stockholm. This is the odd aspect of \u201cSwedish neutrality\u201d \u2014 they are not taken seriously, even as a regional power, and yet, just look around. I have always told anyone who asked, Tallinn is between Stockholm and St. Petersburg. It always will be between these two places. It will always be provincial, and it will always be a sort of intermediate country between the Scandinavians and the Russians. So I think the state will survive, although I think its foreign policy may become more aligned with Swedish and Finnish foreign policy over time. ",

            "answer_text": " Illustration shows countries with larger GDP PPP per capita (List of countries by GDP (PPP) - Wikipedia) than Lithuania in 1995 vs 2017. I think this illustration perfectly answers the question if Lithuania and other Baltic states are heading into a right direction. We had a trash level economy due to the USSR heritage, but we, without large amounts of any natural resources in our countries territories, progressed very well in less than 30 years. Yes, we have problems with emigration, but this is simply because some citizens wants to earn as much money as possible in the shortest period and this is their right. Ireland was a poor country with huge emigration to the USA around 100 years ago, but most of emigrants descendants came back to Ireland over the years. As Baltic states continue to develop, I think emigrants will come back (and they are already doing that now, at least in Lithuania). ",
