            "answer_text": "The two parts of this question are quite unrelated. Being a monopoly does not preclude you from having legitimate competition in the future. If you have no legitimate competition at the moment, then you are a monopoly. I believe that Google and maybe Facebook are monopolies at the moment, in that they have no legitimate competition at the moment in their primary fields. That being said, I think it\u2019s very likely that in the future they will have legitimate competition. It would be naive to think otherwise. Google and Facebook need to keep innovating and getting better in order to keep others playing catch-up and maintain their market dominance. I\u2019m a pretty big fan of Google and their products, but the moment there is a better search engine, I will switch to it. I use Google because it\u2019s the best. ",
