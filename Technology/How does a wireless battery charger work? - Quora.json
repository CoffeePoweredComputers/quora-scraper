            "answer_text": "Wireless Charging is essentially the transmission of an electrical current from a power source to a receiving device without the use of a physical connection.  The electrical current is then used to charge or re-charge the battery of the receiving device. In this circumstance the receiving device can be anything from a smartphone or wearable, to a large industrial forklift. How does wireless charging work?Wireless Charging is based on the principle of Wireless Power or Magnetic Resonance \u2013 the process whereby electricity is transferred between two objects through coils.The diagram below simplifies the process of wireless power transfer into 5 key steps:   Mains voltage is converted into high frequency alternating current (AC).The alternating current (AC) is sent to the transmitter coil by the transmitter circuit.  The alternating current then induces a time varying magnetic field in the transmitter coil.Alternating current flowing within the transmitter coil induces a magnetic field which extends to the receiver coil (when within a specified distance).The magnetic field generates current within the receiver coil of the device.  The process whereby energy is transmitted between the transmitter and receiver coil is also referred to as magnetic or resonant coupling and is achieved by both coils resonating at the same frequency.Current flowing within the receiver coil is converted into direct current (DC) by the receiver circuit, which can then be used to charge the battery.Through the process described above, power can be transferred safely over an air gap and also through any non-metal object which might exist between the coils i.e. wood, plastic, granite.  The addition of extra (or larger) transmitter coils can also extend the range at which the power can be transferred. Source: Page on powerbyproxi.com ",

            "answer_text": "Wireless battery charging uses an inductive or magnetic field between two objects which are typically coils to transfer the energy from one to another. The energy is transferred from the energy source to the receiver where it is typically used to charge the battery in the device. This makes wireless charging or inductive charging ideal for use with many portable devices such as mobile phones and other wireless applications. However they have also found widespread use in products such as electric toothbrushes where cordless operation is needed and where connections would be very unwise and short-lived. The system is essentially a flat form of transformer - flat because this makes it easier to fit into the equipment in which it is to be used. Many wireless battery charging systems are used in consumer items where small form factors are essential.  Wireless battery charging basics The primary side of the transformer is connected to the energy supply that will typically be a mains power source, and the secondary side will be within the equipment where the charge is required. In many applications the wireless battery charging system will consist of two flat coils. The power source is often contained within a pad or mat on which the appliance to be charged is placed. ",
