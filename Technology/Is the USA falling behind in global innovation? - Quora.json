            "answer_text": "The problem is that many people in the US refuse to recognize problems such as environmental protection and education. This leads to an almost \"stubborn\" attitude that does not help to make any sorts of changes or progress. Quite opposite, other countries realize the problems and face them by switching their strategies to focus on the future. Long-Term instead of Short-Term investments into start-ups and new technology have been the key players in many countries. In the US, companies such as Tesla, Apple or Microsoft are the number ones that drag wagon out of the gap, otherwise, the US could be happy to be even ranked inside the top 30. It is time to wake up and stop sugar coating problems otherwise the economy will see downturn during the next decades. ",
