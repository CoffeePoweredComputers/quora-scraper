            "answer_text": "As this question is not device specific. I shall proceed to give a generic answer. There are mainly two ways of updating your phone, they are: You wait for your OEM to update it officially through an OTA update. This method is the most reliable and easiest way to do for layman user who just uses the phone for what it was meant to be. However in most cases the OEM may not provide an update or your phone is too old to receive an update. Then proceed to the next point.This method is likely to be used by those who are well versed with \u201cman-handling\u201d phones as in playing around with ROMs and all that stuff. In order to follow this method, a generic way would be to look up for your device on xda-developers forum. You will definitely find your device as most of them have their own communities. Once done with this, you will have to search through that forum for a guide or a method or a ROM developed by some enthusiast for your device and then install it.I hope this helps you. ",

            "answer_text": "First of all, you should unlock bootloaders. You can do that using loki doki tool down load clock work mode and get the google play edition. My advice for you is to make a nandroid back up save it to your sd card use titanium back up save it to your sd card save everything important to the sd card because to do this your going to wipe your internal storage so pictures music apps text messeges not saved on the external sd card will be erased it will be like when you first got the phone. Now you can download rom manager from the play store and it will download and flash clock work mod for you but you must use the loki tool to unlock the boot loader Also use call log back up and restroe and sms back up and restore set the file path to your ext sd card and your text and call logs will be backed up. Make sure your battery is on the charger and at 98%+ So what you need to do after you get your custom recovery and back everything up is to download the rom (extsd card leave nothing on the internal!!!!!) Ok so your backed up good now you have your rom good now boot into recovery and find on your sd where you saved the rom flash it it will ask you to factory reset and wipe dalvic cache and cache have all 3 boxes checked so this only wipes your internal (in the event they have an option to wipe your ext sd card dont click that box) then you will just sit back and wait for it to flash boot up and then log into your google play use titanium to restore your apps then call log and sms and boom your on kit kat.

            "answer_text": "First off if it is an official update i.e. if it is officially released by you phone manufacturer then it is easy to update your phone by either proceeding with the update yourself (Phone manufacturers provide easy instructions!) or taking it to a service centre where they will update it for free for you. Now if your phone doesn't have an official update but you still want to update your phone then it is going to be a bit tougher and there is a risk factor involved that you may brick(in other words completely ruin) your phone but still some risks are worth taking!You will have to root your phone,and install a custom rom(if available).For more on rooting and custom roms,google it and if you have any other doubts,contact me!

In case, there\u2019s no authentic update, you can manually root your smartphone and install a custom ROM.

Otherwise for the mid segment smartphones, there are very rare chances that the vendor will provide update to us. All new Android releases requires a lot of porting, testing, hardware compatability etc. That's the reason vendor tries to only target the high end smartphones unless promised for which nobody does. Also, now almost half of the market segment is preloaded with Android L for all segments. Like I said, all varies with the vendor. A prominent vendor like Google works very well for providing the updates asap for its devices. P.S. I am writing this on an Android one phone from Google running Android L. ",
