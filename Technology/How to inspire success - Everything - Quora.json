            "answer_text": "This same question whenever I try to answer, I wish and believe it will change the views of people and make them practical and realise the real success. We are programmed by our society about what to do and what not to do to get the so called \u201cSuccess\u201d. We just follow the way that is more related to our society and what Sharma ji ka beta/beti did at our age. We are also at the same time told by some influencers that we all are not the same. We all have different kinds of skills and potential. We should follow our passion. But the thing gets more complicated here. Now we are absolutely confused about the term SUCCESS and how to get that prefix to our name so that we can become examples for our little bros and sisters. I have had the same thing happening with me before. But now as I'm quite thoughtful and observing the differences between the \u201cSuccess to show off\u201d and the \u201cReal Success within us\u201d, I am so happy and writing this to make you all realise the true meaning of Success. It is very simple as it is said by many but to get it simple you have to be very disciplined and honest to yourself first. See if you have a lot of money, but to earn that much you forget your life and family, then there will be no peace there and you are not successful. Similarly if you have your good relationships but no money here you are not successful either. So how to be successful???? To conclude, if you are happy and enjoying what you do daily and also for that your personal life not get poised and therefore your relationships are strong enough to support you, at that time you will realise the PEACE. And if you are at peace of your mind, it is the original SUCCESS. So try not to get more money or more power or more of something. Just follow your mind, not heart. If you are satisfied with yourself then you are the most successful person. Thank you. ",

This person below is a \u201cTrevor Noah\u201d a famous comedian from South Africa a country which was under apartheid for much long. So what's special about him.  He is a man who lived in conditions you can't even a normal person from India or a beggar will also be not lived in a condition he had lived and in a country which has very high rates of crimes and less education. But this man turned the circumstances upside down, in his book \u201c born a crime \u201c which I would you to read of course he tells about how the life was in South Africa and tells how within such atmosphere of no money, racism and pressure of being dead the very next moment he remained cool and worked out to first start a small businesses in his area a area full of gangster but still he did it. Then with responsibility of her mother and two younger brothers and a step father abel who beats like shit and was drunk arrogant. He lived and became a comedian with just his determination and taking odds into evens, how live in such a place he sharpen his talent, paid out bills, and never ever complained about it. When everybody in his black world remained backward he \u201c Worked hard\u201d Met people collected money completed education when only few of black people at that time able to do it. And again racism and police always behind \u201c blacks\u201d. But he never sacrificed his dreams no matter how bad the condition was. This story is for every one who feel that they can't do anything. I say if he can from such place\u2026 you are very privilege d do read the book you will find out much much in it.. Don't worry it's a comedy book .. But a very \u201c struggle \u201c hidden in it. Thanks \u2764. Hope you will inspire to dlbe great like Trevor hats off to this man. ",
