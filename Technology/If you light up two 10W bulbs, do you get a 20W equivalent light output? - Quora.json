            "answer_text": "Light output isn\u2019t measured in Watts. It\u2019s measured in Lumens. The total power in Watts consumed will of course be the sum of the Watts of individual lamps. Total light output will be the sum of the Lumens of the individuals, because it depends on the efficiency of the lamps. This applies also to the case where two lamps may have the same power consumption (say 10W each), but different light outputs, because of different efficiencies. For example, if you add a 10W incandescent and a 10W Low Pressure Sodium, the total consumed power will be 20Ws, but the total light output will be 10W*15Lm/W+10W*120Lm/W=150Lm+1,200Lm=1,350Lm. Much higher than if you used just two incandescents of 10W. ",
