            "answer_text": "Quite frankly, most VoIP service providers all offer the same services with some variation, of course. When analyzing the VoIP market, a few common factors seem to apply to every VoIP service: \u00b7        Everyone is a leading provider in the industry.\u00b7        Their service(s) are free* or boast \u201clow rates.\u201d\u00b7        You\u2019ll receive unprecedented service and award winning support. What it really boils down to, is the quality of service experienced, total cost and ease of use. Cost should be assessed through speaking representative from the company, not from a landing page on a website. Many hosted providers have an activation or start-up fee which drives up the first bill. It\u2019s also worth mentioning that the final rate you\u2019re billed on a monthly basis will be a little higher than the stated service fee because of taxes for services like E911. The quality of the service may be hard to assess as it is speculation until the service is truly in use at your location. Many times, factors attributing to call quality can be attributed to circumstances beyond the provider\u2019s control such as the bandwidth provided from an ISP. This is why it is best to take advantage of a free trial or at the very least, don\u2019t sign a contract until you know you\u2019re happy with a VoIP provider. User reviews are usually one of the best ways to gain honest feedback about a service after a little prodding. There are a few sits that have user review sections for the more recognized brands in the VoIP. The review section here is a good, non-biased review forum for just about every kind of VoIP service in the market. There was blog posted too about disseminating information found in customer reviews. Basically, read commentary thoroughly as you\u2019ll inevitably run into spammers which you will find almost everywhere. Personally, I use Broadview Networks for calling at my office. It\u2019s a hosted service that\u2019s cheap and simple. They don\u2019t have a mobile app but I prefer Skype anyway. ",

            "answer_text": "Before delving into which VoIP is the best, here\u2019s a little background: VoIP services providers cater to different niches. Since VoIP is used primarily in offices, you\u2019ll find plenty of excellent VoIP providers available in the market. Different VoIP providers offer services for different departments such as a customer support department, team management, etc. Likewise, you\u2019ll find many VoIP service providers for homes as well. All of the VoIP providers offer features such as call forwarding, three-way calling, music on hold, do not disturb, international calling, enhanced 911 (E911), etc. But they all face limitations due to varying internet speeds. This causes latency, jitters, and packet loss during calls. Even the \u201cbest\u201d VoIP service may face problems because of factors beyond the control of the provider. The best VoIP: If you\u2019re looking for a VoIP service in the US and Canada, AxVoice is a decent VoIP service. It\u2019s quite cheap and very easy to install. It\u2019s good for your home, but I wouldn\u2019t recommend it for businesses. However, voice quality depends on the internet speeds that you have. The service provider offers different codecs. In the case, the connection experiences a low bandwidth, the voice is converted to a low bandwidth codex. This ensures that a call isn\u2019t dropped. Requirements for a home-based VoIP: When you\u2019re looking for a VoIP service, always be sure to ask about the requirements such as internet speeds. Normally, in a home, you don\u2019t expect to receive more than one call at a time. The recommended internet speeds are 3Mbps up and down and a minimum bandwidth of 100 Kbps. If you expect more than one call at a given time, obviously you\u2019ll require different internet speeds and bandwidth. Moreover, you also require an ATA (Analog Telephone Adapter) which connects your phone to the router. Many service providers offer this device free of cost, but you should ask the provider about this before subscribing. The ATA performs two functions. First, it converts the analog signals (your voice) to digital signals so that it can be converted to data packets for transmission via the internet. Secondly, it establishes and terminates a connection when you make a call or receive a call. There are many VoIP providers out there that offer good services. However, you should be clear on what you require from a VoIP service before you subscribe to it. Moreover, compare the pricing of several VoIP service providers so that you have an idea of which one is better. Hope this helps! ",
