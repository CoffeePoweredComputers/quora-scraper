            "answer_text": "Eniac is a very different beast compared to today\u2019s computers. For starters , a modern microprocessor is litterally hundreds of millions times faster than ENIAC . With modern manufacturing , a transistor-based re-creation of ENIAC could fit on a single grain of sand. That\u2019s how far we\u2019ve come. Modern microprocessors use transistors , tiny electric \u201cswitches\u201d . This has allowed to drastically reduce to their size and ocst , and increase their power. In 50 years , we\u2019ve made transistors that were over 10 \u00b5m wide all the way to modern transistors measuring only a couple dozen nm wide.ENIAC uses vacuum tubes and a complement of various discrete electric components (capacitors , resistors etc ). These were power hungry and unreliable . Eniac used 170Kw . A modern PC uses a couple hundred watts at most.Servers and mainframes can use that much though , but we\u2019re talking much more powerful machines. Size has also been drastically reduced , with ENIAC taking up an entire room. Those were the obvious differences. Aside from that , ENIAC wasn\u2019t truly general purpose machine . It was primarily made to calculate ballistic trajectories. That\u2019s relatively simple math, and can be done using integers or even fixed point math . No floating point math here. It wasn\u2019t made to do much else ( though it did help with nuclear weapons development ). It had no storage to speak of , programs were instead entered through a plug board . This process was laborious . Eniac was a decimal computer , not binary like today\u2019s machine. Eniac didn\u2019t even work off the same computing models of today\u2019s machines. While ENIAC did work off an ancestor of a von-neumann architecture , it was not a stored-program computer (at least not at first) was fundamentally very different from today\u2019s modified-Harvard architecture.
