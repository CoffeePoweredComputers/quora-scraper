            "answer_text": "Well if you are asking for the very basic answer then I would suggest initially you download some file manager app on your Android device ( such as file commander or something like that) from the playstore. Now open the app and you will see three types of memories ( condition you have already connected your OTG pendrive to the system) namely internal storage, SD card and the third one will be your OTG storage Now go to the internal storage and search for the files you want to transfer to the pendrive ( many file managers also provide the search option which can be used to easily find your files). After finding select the files and the from the options select copy. Now Go to the pendrive (from the start menu which showed you all the storages available as I had stated above) and select paste and it is as simple as this to copy your files from the internal storage to the OTG pendrive ",

            "answer_text": "I KNOW YOU KNOW THE ANSWER ! So i am answering this question in very easy language to understand you in OTR ( One time read ) . First of all ensure that you have enough juice in your battery , its sound senseless but if battery get drain while copying the files and you took the phone to charge then might be otg connection disconnect from your phone and then you need to repeat that process again ! On modern versions of Android, you\u2019ll get a notification saying the drive is \u201cfor transferring photos and media\u201d after you attach it. You\u2019ll see an \u201cExplore\u201d button that will allow you to browse the files on the drive, and an \u201cEject\u201d button that will allow you to safely remove the drive.  On Some Android phone you will be ask for to choose storage like this :-  simply click on select then choose the your portable drive . Now Download Es File explorer and open the app then select your files then select copy then come to homepage by clicking small icons which are in the top then swipe from left click on local then select your drive. Now you can create new folder or simply paste into root folder ! That's it you done ! Thanks Anurodh Mankar [ Sorry for Bad English ] ",
