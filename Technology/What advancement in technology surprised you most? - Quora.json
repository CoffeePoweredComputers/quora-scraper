            "answer_text": "I think for me what surprised me the most is the fact that technology has definitely improved education. Today, thanks to technology and the internet, students can take online classes, given by the best teachers in the world, wherever they are themselves in the world. Schools and universities must evolve, it is a matter of life and death. Mooc\u2019s have given the chance to so many students to receive education in ways they could not have before. But it isn\u2019t the only advancement that technology has brought to the educational world. For instance, thanks to technology, you can now use digital tools as a student or a teacher to optimise the learning and teaching process. At Wooclap, for instance, we are convinced that face-to-face courses can bring real added value to these online courses available thanks to Mooc\u2019s. Wooclap is an online voting system that enables teachers to ask questions to their audience, during the class and students\u2019 answer in real time on their smartphone, computer or tablet. The results are then displayed live on the teacher\u2019s presentation, and he can then assess the level of understanding directly during the classroom. This increases participation and interactivity while at the same time integrating technology to the classroom. At Wooclap we strive to improving the classroom and learning experience experience. Recent studies show that attention decreases drastically after 10 minutes. Ideally, it would be necessary to vary the educational activities ... every 10 minutes. If in practice, it's easier said than done, Wooclap has thus also created a blog to help teachers in their approach. Whether with small groups (5-15 students) or with larger groups (500-1000 students), the Wooclap team tries to show you through concrete cases how to get the best out of the different tools available, provision to improve the learning process of students.

That was one of its original selling points.) Two things that surprised me that didn\u2019t happen were the Crosby stereo FM system (it wasn\u2019t compatible with SCA, but it had far better inherent separation) and the field-sequential color TV system (there were no color adjustments - no orange skin or blue grass). But RCA couldn\u2019t patent it, so it never made it. ",
