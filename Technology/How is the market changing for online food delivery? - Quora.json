            "answer_text": "The online food delivery market is increasing due to the high demand for food delivery at doorsteps. Another important reason is the convenience that it offers to the users at large. It is easy for users to get food anywhere anytime and save a lot of time as well. Creating online food delivery apps have also become easy and almost all the food outlets have their own valets who are prompted for delivery based on the orders that are raised using the app. An easy way to create such an app is to use an online food delivery script.  There is a great proliferation of online food ordering applications due to the surge in demand. Every food delivery app holds a special selling proposition which makes them different from others. So, even though there is a huge competition, every company stands a chance to hold the customer's attention. Readymade food delivery app script like food plus helps in building an app for food delivery with a unique design and essential features. As you own a food delivery app, you become an aggregator as you provide a common platform for multiple restaurants as well as offer an easier method for users to place orders. Your platform would also help the users to learn about the local restaurants, different cuisines, reviews, and ratings before going ahead to order the food of their choice. There is no more calling and placing an order, a simple app multitasks, linking the user, the restaurant, the admin and the delivery personnel all at once! What an innovation, isn\u2019t it? ",

            "answer_text": "The market is changing because people in general want more control and choice in their food obtainment. OnLine food delivery is just a fad and a trend to be short-lived. People want to go to the market and see, feel, touch, smell, and squeeze (and maybe even sample their food. Just because people have the ability to go online, doesn\u2019t mean that they will or that they want to. There are too many negative variables to online food delivery. The standard has always been: \u201cDon\u2019t put that in your mouth, you don\u2019t know where it has been.\u201d That standard is more important than ever and will continue to be so. There are some things that are inviolate even in this so-called \u201chigh-tech\u201d world and the procurement and obtainment of people\u2019s food is something that they want to do themselves and not leave it to some mystery delivery driver.
