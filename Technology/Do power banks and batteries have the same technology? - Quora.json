            "answer_text": "No batteries and powerbanks won\u2019t have same technology. Batteries have anodes, cathodes,electrolytes, seperator, overcurrent/thermal protection board. Powerbanks has BMS circuitary that follows similar standards that are used in mobile manufacturing Ex: Qualcomm QC, Oppo VOOC, One+ Dash etc. Since the subcomponents are not same they will always have different technology. But they have inter-operable specifications Ex: BMS charges battery at rated charge voltage, BMS discharges battery fast or slow based on mobile connected but always ensure the rate of discharge is within the rated limits of battery.
