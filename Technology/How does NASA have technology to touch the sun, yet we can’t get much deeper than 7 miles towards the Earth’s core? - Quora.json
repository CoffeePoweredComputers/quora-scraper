            "answer_text": "Strange question, space travel is a different kind of sport than drilling holes. It is a bit like \u201cwe can transplant hearts, so why can't we cure cancer yet\u201d. There is one common technical hurdle to take however, and that is the high temperature. If the drill bit temperature gets too high it will no longer perform properly, because the drilling itself will also produce a lot of heat. The Kola Borehole took about 19 years to reach a bit over 12 km; they stopped at a temp of 180\u00b0C. They might have gone a bit further but had calculated that at 15 km the crust temp would have risen to 300\u00b0C and the drill bit would certainly fail at the resulting combined temp. [A suggested way to get around this would be, it may sound crazy, a foot wide tungsten ball filled with radio-active Co-60, heating itself up to 1000\u00b0C and melting itself a way through the crust material and partly mantle to a max of ~100 km] The Sun will not really be touched, the Parker Solar Probe is only getting rather close (at about 8 solar radii) through the very thin outer parts of the Aurora. It will have to withstand temperatures of around 1377\u00b0C and a special C-C-composite will be able to so. But that material will not be requested to drill itself through something. ",

            "answer_text": "The solar probe will be about 3.2 million mile from the Sun's surface (known as the photosphere), not quite a touch. And not even remotely the equivalent to drilling through solid rock. The solar probe is made of two layers of compressed carbon bonded to layer of carbon foam, which would quickly crumble if tried to drill into rocks. Drills into Earth are tipped with material that would vaporize near the Sun ",
