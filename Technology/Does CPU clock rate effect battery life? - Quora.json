            "answer_text": "Ofcourse it does however there are many other things to be considered first like the CPU architecture, different architecture will consume different power hence have different impact on the battery.  For example a mobile processor working at 2GHz will consume much less power than a PC processor running at 2GHz, why? because they have different architecture, different amount of transistors and stuffs. Even if you compare it between two different generations of same processor things will get complicated. But if you keep everything constant, the generation, architecture and all usually higher clock speed will reduce battery life. For example let's look at the pictures.     In the first picture my laptop is running at Green mode where the clock speed is about 700-800MHz and if I use this mode I can use this system for about 2-2.5 hours on full display brightness playing youtube videos.  But on the lower picture whenever I use the high performance mode the clock speed goes up to around 3GHz(Turbo) and in this mode battery will be drained in about 1.5 hours running the same task. Just gonna add two more pictures to show you the difference between high performance and low performance backup time, be advised in high performance mode battery life will be much less.     ",

            "answer_text": "Yes. In general CPU power is generally directly proportional to the rate of changes (e.g. clock frequency) of a CPU. This is very true when CPUs had no internal clock management and it ran all functions full clock speed all the time.  Its hard to measure these days, so many parts of the CPU operate on different clock domains and of course if you are considering the CPU board as opposed to the CPU chip even greater ranges of operating frequencies are encountered.  Many parts of the CPU board are optimized and individually clocked  for frequency required to minimize the power yet achieve the performance required.  Even within a CPU chip some parts are dynamically clocked slower and faster when the computing load changes. ",

It depends on your usage patterns, at most.Games all day; battery dies before your day ends!Screen on all day on 3G social surfing; battery does a full day at max.. .Device usage partially, and the device is kept on standby most of the time; TWO days acheived!
