            "answer_text": "No. It will continue to be in production. Often, people misunderstand \u201cdiscontinuation\u201d For Apple, discontinuation means : Removing the product from the website (Online buying as well as product description pages)Stopping further production of the model (will be sold only till existing stocks last)Discontinuation does not mean that your phone becomes obsolete \u2014 you will get 5 years of software updates, which is the Apple standard for software support, and you will continue to be able to use your favourite apps. In 2019, after launch of iPhone 11 series, the iPhone XR remained on the website and production, while the iPhone XS and XS max were discontinued. 2020 is likely to follow suit, with the iPhone 11 still remaining and the Pro models being discontinued. As for the iPhone XR? I cannot say what should happen to it. It currently is $599 and the SE is $399. If Apple keeps it yet another year, and decrease the price, there\u2019s no use because it might cannibalise iPhone SE sales. If it doesn\u2019t lower price, then what should happen to the iPhone 11 price? Because already, rumours are suggesting a $649 starting price for the iPhone 12. ",

            "answer_text": "No iPhone 11 will not be discontinued after the launch of iPhone 12 series. It might get a price cut as iPhone XR got after the launch of iPhone 11. Apple always cut the price of last year models when launching a new model. But discontinuation only happens after 3\u20134 years. Cheers !! ",
