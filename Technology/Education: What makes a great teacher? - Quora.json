            "answer_text": "For a teacher, the greatest joy is to see a child\u2019s success. If you have to put someone on a pedestal, put teachers. They are society\u2019s heroes.\u2019 \u2013Guy Kawasaki It is said that a teacher can open a mind and touch a heart. It is one of the professions that are considered noble and the highest form of understanding. Children begin their learning with preschool. A preschool teacher moulds children and prepares them for the outer world. Here is a list of qualities that a preschool teacher must have: \u00b7 PATIENCE: In their initial years, children are the most curious. They tend to ask a lot of questions. Moreover, teaching them something can be a difficult task because they will need repetitions. Patience is also required to deal with parents or guardians. A good teacher must remain calm in all circumstances. Patience is one of the most essential traits of a good preschool teacher. \u00b7 CREATIVITY: Making the classroom a fun place for children to learn needs creativity. Creativity is not just in terms of art and craft activities. Providing a fresh perspective to an existing lesson in a way that is easy to understand for children also requires creativity. A good preschool teacher must be able make the optimum utilization of available resources with creativity. \u00b7 SENSE OF HUMOUR: The ability to be able to make children laugh and be able to laugh with them is a trait a good preschool teacher must possess. Humour is a way to keep the children entertained and engrossed in the subject when they are bored. \u00b7 PASSION: Passion is one of the foremost traits required in a good preschool teacher. The ability to passionately work with children and help them learn in the most effective ways is a precious quality symbolizing a good teacher. \u00b7 COMPASSION: Providing emotional support to children is one of the most demanding tasks of a preschool teacher. Preschool is where children have to bid goodbye to their parents for brief periods of time. This brings a lot of fear and tears for the kids. A preschool teacher needs to take care of these situations with compassion and provide comfort to the children. \u00b7 INNOVATIVE: A good teacher must be innovative and willing to take initiative. This could be by teaching about the environment by taking field trips to the nearest garden or creating games that the kids would enjoy. \u00b7 CONSIDERATE: Every kid is unique in his or her own way. A good preschool teacher should give the child the freedom to explore and respect their individuality. The teacher must be considerate to handle situations of individuality appropriately so that the child can learn. Every teacher should remember the beautiful lines said by William Arthur Ward : \u201cThe mediocre teacher tells. The good teacher explains. The superior teacher demonstrates. The great teacher inspires.\u201d Shanti Juniors make sure that teacher at their schools always inspire kids to explore their full potential. ",

            "answer_text": "When you find out, tell me! Being amazing is really, really hard. Here\u2019s what I do know: You have to mix things up. Some of you talking, some projects, some labs, some student led stuff, some inquiry, some reading, some\u2026everything. Try to do at least 2 different things every day, and then mix them up from day to day.Rules. You gotta have reasonable rules that you discuss with your students. Let them in on why certain things are rules, why certain things are \u201csuggestions\u201d, and why certain things don\u2019t matter to you. For example, I teach chemistry. It is a rule that you wear safety goggles during a lab. This is not something I want their opinions on - safety trumps opinions. But sharpening pencils? Just get up and sharpen your pencil. I find the question \u201ccan I sharpen my pencil\u201d far more annoying than the random kid getting up and sharpening her pencil. Also, be fair about enforcing rules, but be ready for kids to notice even the slight deviation from fairness (\u201cYou were nicer to her than me\u2026\u201d)Relationship building. Try to get to know your kids. Ask them how their day is going. Be part of their lives, not just their teacher. This is really hard, especially when you have 150+ students, as you will if you\u2019re a 6\u201312 teacher. Some kids just don\u2019t talk much / don\u2019t want to have a relationship. But you can get to know a lot of them. Also, this does not mean becoming friends with your students. Friendly, not friends. Friends they have - teachers they need.Focus on the positive and set realistic goals. Tell students something they do well, and then give them something small to improve on. I regularly praise students for having improved attendance or writing something particularly interesting on a test question. Do NOT just call out your \u201cA\u201d students. Praise them sometimes, but make sure you make it rain for kids who don\u2019t get a lot of praise. One of the best ways to do this is to say \u201cGood Answer Jordan!\u201d Just hearing their name out loud makes a kid feel amazing, and it shows that you know their names. Did I mention you should learn their names? Learn their names!Hold them to those goals. \u201cWe talked about you coming to tutoring on Wednesday. You didn\u2019t come to tutoring on Wednesday. What are you going to do about that?\u201d There\u2019s nothing wrong with \u201cWhy did it happen?\u201d but don\u2019t get sucked into the trap of school drama - students have a million excuses, but as we say in the business, excuses don\u2019t solve problems. Focus on the what - \u201cWhat are you going to do to improve?\u201d Don\u2019t expect miracles, but do expect progress.Get everyone involved that you can. Parents, counselors, coaches, other teachers, etc. I\u2019d estimate that 75% of my \u201cproblems\u201d with students are solved by a phone call to someone. Kid won\u2019t behave in class? Call the coach. No homework? Call band teacher. Bad attendance? Call mom. When you call, always start with the positive: \u201cStudent X is capable of so much more, but they\u2019re not living up to their potential because they don\u2019t do ______. I need YOUR help to get them back on track.\u201d I love that one, too. \u201cBack on track\u201d. It implies \u201cThis kid is smart, but has just lost his way.\u201dAccept defeat. Sometimes you work and you work and you work and a student fails anyway, almost as if to spite you. Let it go. If you care about your work, this is nearly impossible advice to follow. You should be pissed off and angry and you\u2019ll second guess your actions, etc. But in the end, you are just a human being. Do your best and accept the results.Walk around. I sit at my desk to take attendance\u2026and that\u2019s about it. Sit ON your desk if you need a break. Otherwise, walk around. I love sitting in student desks - keeps kids on their toes.No free days. This one is a personal pet peeve, but if you really care about them, you\u2019ll try and squeeze as much as you can into their brains in the little time you get them. This doesn\u2019t mean 100% full intensity all the time, but don\u2019t give them party days\u2026it just cheapens school. Not even elementary school. That leads us to:Enjoy yourself and be willing to be laughed at. Self-deprecation is a great way to remind students \u201cI\u2019m just like you, awkward and uncertain and insecure, just a little older, that\u2019s all.\u201d Story about your failures, your embarrassing moments, your ridiculous ideas - these are the things they remember, and hopefully the important information you say right after that.By the way, expect to be really crappy at all of this on a regular basis. This is year #18 for me, and I regularly fail to do almost all of these. I\u2019m pretty good at #9. Otherwise, sometimes I\u2019m just really tired and need to sit in my chair. Sometimes I can\u2019t accept defeat and I get really mad at my students. Sometimes I lecture and it\u2019s boring but I do it anyway. I\u2019m not an amazing teacher. Maybe nobody is. Just be the best teacher you can be, and never stop trying to improve. That may be the most anyone can ever hope to accomplish. ",
