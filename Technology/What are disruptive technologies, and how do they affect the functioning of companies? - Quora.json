            "answer_text": "Disruptive technologies are technology-driven changes in the fundamental economics or assumptions upon which an industry or an employment structure is premised. Amazon\u2019s effect upon brick and mortar retail stores or the Internet\u2019s effect upon printed newspapers are examples. Digital photography\u2019s effect upon Kodak\u2019s film business is a classic example because Kodak invented digital photography and held all of the important early patents. However, Kodak tried to bury digital photography to protect their cash-cow film business, with the foreseeable result that Kodak was late to market and ultimately overwhelmed and bankrupted when their early patents expired or were worked around by others. Another example would be recent advances in oil and gas drilling where advancing technology allows many fewer employers to actually produce more oil and gas compared to prior petroleum production techniques. In a military context, a missile-armed Burke-class destroyer has only about 300 crew but far more firepower, and more effective, longer-range precision firepower, than a WWII battleship crewed by 2500 to 3000 people. These are all examples of technologies that up-end the traditional business models. ",

            "answer_text": "Disruptive technologies are those that are growing at an often \u2018exponential\u2019 rate and are increasingly digitized, demonetized and democratized. Also often referred to as exponential or emerging technologies (too many terms being thrown around these days\u2026). Examples include blockchain, AI, robotics and immersive reality (AR/VR/MR). Many of these are converging at a rapid pace and will be reinventing the way we work and live. You can learn about all of the above (\u2018101\u2019) on School of Disruption :) ",
