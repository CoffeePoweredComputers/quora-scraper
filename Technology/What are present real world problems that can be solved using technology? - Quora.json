            "answer_text": "Well, as it happens, there are relatively few problems that can be solved by technology alone. Usually other things are required. For instance, farmers in Rwanda might have trouble getting their crops to market regularly. So the technological solution might be a little truck. But the roads are bad, and rains can wash them out. So they need paved roads and strong bridges. Also, trucks break down. So they also need skilled mechanics, a supply of spare parts, and enough cash to pay for the repairs. Local laws might require a driver\u2019s license, but to get a license you may have to bribe a local official, requiring more cash. And the official might not give you a license even with a bribe, maybe because you are the wrong tribe, or because you didn\u2019t want to date his daughter. Etc. All these problems of corruption, poor governance, poor infrastructure, poor supply and repair capacity, and just simply poverty are not usually thought of as technological problems. They are often called \u201cdevelopment\u201d problems. However, sometimes technology really can directly address some issue. One common issue that technology can often fix is the issue of competing and differing methods of communicating or controlling things. For instance, notice that your tv remote has to be specific to your tv brand. If you lose the remote, then you can buy a universal remote, but it still has to be programmed with your tv brand, which is a pain. But if all the tv manufacturers got together and agreed upon a common standard (or \u201cprotocol\u201d) for remotes, then any remote would work with any tv. Problem solved! Alternatively, the manufacturers could be required by regulation to create a common standard. However it comes about, a common standard is a kind of technology, and creating a common standard allows easier and cheaper communication. Here is another example. Obamacare and market forces have called for hospitals and doctors to adopt electronic medical records (EMR.) EMR is faster, more flexible and more easily shared than paper files, as you can imagine. The problem is that there are many different EMR systems, and they are all use underlying databases that are built differently. The result is that EMR systems typically cannot talk to each other, which removes a lot of the potential benefit. Making that happen takes many hours of additional programming work, wasting many millions of dollars. If they all adopted the same underlying database structure, then EMR systems could all talk to each other, and then they would have to compete on ease of use, and other user-oriented issues. I understand the Veteran\u2019s Administration has a very powerful EMR system. The federal government could simply give it away, and save us all tons of money. (But then computer companies would not make as much money.) Another example of where a common standard solved a problem is with the Internet. TCP/IP is a communication protocol that is very powerful, flexible and reliable. Because it was developed by the government (more or less,) it was made available to everybody for free. The result is now we have an Internet, where all sorts of different devices can talk to each other easily. Problem solved. :-) ",
