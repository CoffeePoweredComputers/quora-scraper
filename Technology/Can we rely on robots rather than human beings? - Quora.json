            "answer_text": "Humans and AI robots both follow their programming. With AI and with humans, the programming is in the form of goals and motations that machine will seek, vs precise laws of behavior. So with both humans and AI we must carefully watch and control the motivations to get the results we want. Humans are hard to control exactly because they are driven by motivations, instead of having their actions precisely controlled. This is why when we see a problem with humans, such a crime, we say, follow the money \u2014 follow the motivations to find the guilty party. we don\u2019t say \u201ccheck their programming\u201d. AI will have the same problems in that we will have to define and control their motivations. It won\u2019t be simple, but I\u2019m sure we will learn how to do it, and how to keep ourselves safe. We will end up relying on robots for sure. They will be far smarter than us and more knowledgeable about everything. Not only will the robots do all the work we don\u2019t want to do, but we need to have done, they will be our sources of wisdom and knowledge. Just as we use Google now to find answers on Quora written by humans, we will turn to the internet to find the answers to all our questions in the future. But the questions will be answered by the AIs, and the robots, not by other humans. ",
