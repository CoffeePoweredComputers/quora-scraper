Yes, you could use copper for some things, but the tradeoffs are immense. Except for local Ethernet, no one installs copper anymore. It\u2019s all fiber, cell, and Wi-Fi. ",

Anova and AOptix have hybrid laser/millimeter-wave wireless systems that can support 99.97% average annual uptime, with latency lower than fiber, but up to 40 Gbps in throughput. Meanwhile, Telia Carrier and other could sell you 1-Tbps wavelength service over fiber, Zayo and others could let you \u2018roll your own\u2019 with dark fiber, etc.  ",
