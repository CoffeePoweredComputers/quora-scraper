            "answer_text": "It depends on how you measure success. Apple success is measured so differently than other companies. Apple launches are compared to their other mature and wildly successful products. The iPhone was compared to the iPod, not at launch, but the current market. The Apple Watch, in spite of selling more units than the iPhone did in their first year, is often called a flop.  There are two ways to look at the iPhone's success. The first iPhone laid the groundwork and set the stage for the first wildly successful iPhone in the consumer market: the iPhone 3G. The first iPhone was too expensive and too exclusive to be mainstream. In that it accomplished Apple's goals and set the stage for the iPhone of the future, it was wildly successful. In that it completely changed how people thought of smartphones, it was dramatically successful. In that it moved the power of industry from the carriers to the manufacturers with one product, it was successful beyond the wildest dreams of anyone in the industry. As a consumer product release, it wasn't all that successful. Apple has sold more iPhones on launch weekends for every iPhone since the iPhone 5 than the original iPhone sold in its entire run. However first generation products don't need to be successful in and of themselves. They simply need to show there is a market demand and then have improved sales on the second generation. The iPhone did that. So in all ways that matter, the iPhone was a success.   ",

            "answer_text": "You may all know how big the CES (consumer electronics show) is to this whole, a whole lot bigger than this world, all the biggest minds of this world put up their big brains to drive this world forward to future... Why Iam saying is that iphone was introduced in the middle of the CES and you know what - after the introduction of the iphone no people or no one in this world ever talked about CES, all they had in mind and mouth was the iphone, it just blew up the CES, after that no one talked about the CES and it was totally stagnated!!!  You can now see how the iphone made its massive impression even at the first time it was introduced... That's how big the iphone was and how it will and is today!! Hope you know the weight of the answer.  ",
