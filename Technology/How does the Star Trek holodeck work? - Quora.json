            "answer_text": "It doesn\u2019t. It\u2019s science fiction entirely. The word holodeck deck is based on the word hologram. A hologram is essentially a three dimensional picture. Although it\u2019s rendered in a pane of glass, when you look at it and move around it\u2019s as if there is a three-dimensional object behind the pane of glass even though it\u2019s just a single flat pane of glass. The effect is created by intersecting laser beams and the use of what is called an interference pattern, which is embedded in the glass. The physics are non-trivial but it does truly look as if there is a three-dimensional object behind The glass even though you can\u2019t actually look at it from all directions and they are generally of a single color, not full color. In TV and movies holograms are represented as if they are floating visual 3D images of people and objects which look as if they are the real thing, and can be viewed from all angles. In fact, this is completely impossible even though many people think that\u2019s what a hologram is. Probably the best known example is in the Star Wars movies where R2D2 projects an image of Princess Leia in front of Luke Skywalker. Again, this is not possible since in order to view a hologram you either need to be looking through a pane of glass or have a pane of glass immediately behind the image (another way to render the hologram). In both methods the viewing angles are very limited and the color is not realistic. Some movies make it look as if the hologram is actually an identical representation of a person or object such that you cannot tell the difference between it and the original. Again, this is completely impossible. So, given that is what people think holograms are, Star Trek created the concept of the holodeck which is a deck on the ship which has technology that is able to reproduce in 3-D various objects including people which are supposed to be images even though they look like and can be interacted with as if they are the real thing. It is a clever concept that many fans including myself enjoy, but it is 100% science-fiction and not even remotely possible with today\u2019s technology. ",
