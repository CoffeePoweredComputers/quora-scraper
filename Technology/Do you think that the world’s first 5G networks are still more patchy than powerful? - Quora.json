            "answer_text": "Deployment of all new network technologies are patchy. :-). It depends on back-end infrastructure availability and User adoption rate. In many parts of the world, even 4G has patchy deployment. 5G implementation will pick-up slowly and it's relevance is more with IoT or internet of things. More smart cities, more autonomous cars, more immersive games, more augmented reality demand will accelerate 5G deployment. As far the question of Power goes, having engineering background, I can only say that power per cubic meter (watts) for 5G will be not more than 4G. It looks like 5G is going to be implemented over 2GHZ and higher frequency, if so, operators will have to adopt nano cell architecture and if so, per cubic meter power requirement will be less. (BUT FAR MORE DENSE). I know its too much detail, so I will kerp it short. :-). ",

We actually have indoor plumbing and toilets that flush\u2026But, I just checked my cell phone\u2026and its still working in a 4G network\u2026(ATT) As for power, the 5G is better than what the 4G has to offer, which was better than the 3G\u2026etc\u2026 I think we see the 4G vs 5G as the app\u2019s it supports, offering better data and video services with an increase of speed\u2019s, to keep up with the latest iPhone on the market\u2026. Plus, kids like looking cool, with all the technology they can carry in the pocket\u2026 Be well Dave ",

            "answer_text": "It\u2019s still pretty early for 5G networks so I\u2019ll go on the patch side with plans to fill in the holes as time goes forward. There\u2019s no doubt the networks have the potential to do more than current 4G infrastructure. Only issue now is a \u201ckiller app\u201d for 5G. But that\u2019s understandable since we\u2019re still waiting for 5G builds to finish and for people to get compatible devices in their hands. For instance, the Gig Economy is the killer app that benefited tremendously from 4G. Let\u2019s remember that it took sometime for this to develop (4G networks debuted in the early 2010\u2019s). Time will provide the answer but for the immediate moment, work still needs to be done to get 5G out for everyone to use. ",

            "answer_text": "That depends on where you are in the world. If in say China it is very much more powerful than patchy as they are the leaders in deploying it. In other parts of the world it would be more patchy than powerful. Some more than others. Here it is rolling out pretty good in most cities and rolling out rather well in Helsinki, Turku, Tampere, and others. Here is a link to where it is being deployed around the world.

However, in those little patches where they do work, they are, relatively speaking, substantially more powerful in terms of data rates (without yet even having reached the full potential of the 5G standard).
