            "answer_text": "Hi.. This is actually an interest of mine. I\u2019ve seen some of your other answers, and I tend to agree, I\u2019m sure if you saw a speaker maybe 30 or 40 years old, it would still look like a speaker to you..\u2019 The materials used today are much better, Paper cones are still in use, but now using various polymers for paper reinforcement and protection. The magnets and coil winding are of a better material as well. I think some of the biggest improvements, is the housing or the box they are mounted in. The wood resonates, with internal sound waves, and the tunes ports for the speakers to move the air inside.. Maybe call it breathing. I have a set of Bose speakers, for my entertainment center. The sound is large and clean, for something so small. And last, my PA /DJ system is a 3way with a tuned port baffle, and a fancy crossover, inside, allowing my 12 and 15 speakers to fill an auditorium or an outside stage venue. So, the speakers themselves, still look like speakers, just maybe the technology around them have changed, to keep up with the times..as evident as some cars vibrate with so much noise, as to make my car vibrate some\u2026kinda hurts my ears.. I can only assume the driver is now deaf\u2026.see attached speaker sample..  Good Luck Dave ",

            "answer_text": "I don't know how to quantify it. I am just an enthusiast who has listened to more that his usual share of speakers. However, I have observed a few things in recent years: Speakers that sound good are no longer expensive. Maybe it's trickle down technology, better mass production of materials, cheaper electronics, I don't know. What I do know is this tiny little JBL Charge 2 that I got a few years ago sounds better than my big component system from the last 2 decades. Now, a Martin Logan bookshelf speaker with ribbon tweeters costs $230 in Amazon!Digital Signal Processing. It's getting more and more common, and much much more affordable. From the autoequalizer that came with your receiver to the dedicated built-in DSP in Dynaudio speakers, they are everywhere! This improves the sound in lots of ways, although I'm sure many enthusiasts will frown, if not look down, on you (who cares, right?). From very powerful, 16th order crossovers with slopes of up to 96 db, to phase and time alignment and room correction\u2026 DSPs sometimes work like magic!Connectivity. Bluetooth, Air Port, Wifi Direct, etc.. while they do not directly make the speakers sound good, an unintended consequence led to better sound: full active amplification and crossovers.Digital-analog converters and audio formats. Very good DACs are now very affordable! Some even have processors that can simulate the sound in music halls, open air concerts, and the warm sound of tube amps. Meanwhile, the latest lossless audio formats push the limits of high fidelity!Subwoofers and supertweeters. The former is now very common and adds a different level of depth to bass reproduction. Supertweeters add more headroom to high frequencies.Indeed, now is a good time to be alive! ",
