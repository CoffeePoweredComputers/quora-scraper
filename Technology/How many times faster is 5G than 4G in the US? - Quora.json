The next-generation mobile network is on the horizon. 5G, the next iteration of 4G Long Term Evolution networks, will enable significantly greater mobile speeds as much as 20 Gbps with less than one millisecond latency to enable real-time connectivity for mission-critical and potentially life-saving devices and applications. 5G will also provide truly ubiquitous connectivity in the most challenging and remote areas of the world whether on land, in the air, or at sea even on the 50th floor of an office building in downtown Chicago! Finally, 5G networks will connect billions of Internet of Things devices with a wide variety of speed and data volume requirements. But 5G is an ambitious goal. Work on key technologies to enable 5G has already begun. In much the same way that 4G LTE was rolled out in 2008, but is only now achieving the 4G LTE goal of 1 Gbps speeds. Many technologies that have emerged in the evolution of 4G LTE, such as carrier aggregation and multiple inputs multiple outputs, will continue to develop to achieve the massive speed and scale required in 5G.

            "answer_text": "We're looking at 5G being 4 times faster than existing 4G networks. That's assuming the average 4G connection is at 25 Megabits per second (Mbps). Some mobile operators like AT&T and Verizon are reporting their customers are reaching speeds 1 to 2 Gigabits per second (Gbps)! That's insane for a wireless connection. Speeds will vary across the board as the network is deployed and once more customers begin to use data. The speed increase will be significant for 5G. It's already being considered as an option by service providers like Windstream[1] to provide home Internet access.
