            "answer_text": "For intel, It would be the 8th generation core i3,i5 and i7 but if you want performance or rather butchered 1080p video rending or play crisis 3 for days then the core i9-7900x which has 18 cores and 24.75mb of cache. As for AMD, it would be the Ryzen series, but not just any Ryzen series but the Ryzen 5 2400g and Ryzen 3 2200g with Radeon RX Vega 11 graphics. In terms of value, AMD take the crown for that. As for the Intel, you really have to make good use of the power. I am running a core i5 8600k that has 6 cores instead of 4 in the previous generation and produces a little more power than its older brother the 7600k but packs more need in it and cost a hit more. Top it all of, it is the ideal processor for my gaming/working/homework rig. ",
