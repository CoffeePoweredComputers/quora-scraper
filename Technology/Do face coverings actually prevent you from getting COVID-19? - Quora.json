            "answer_text": "Yes, more precisely they change the odds of getting infected. A face covering combined with distance and sanitation very much reduce the odds of getting infected or infecting others. The virus is tiny and difficult to filter. HOWEVER the moist droplets that it is expelled with are easy to filter. Distance enables the \u201csnow fence\u201d effect to keep your droplets inside your 6\u2032 diameter and someone else's droplets not captured by their mask inside of 6\u2032 A snow fence can slow the force of wind and while snow passes the fence it drops into a drift keeping it off roads and buildings. The droplet distribution and the virus distribution that results is nicely captured with fabric masks. Not as well as medical masks but combined with distance well enough. The properties of medical masks are interesting. The modern thermal spun non woven filter material captures material much smaller than the porosity might indicate because of electrostatic properties. The result is a respirator with modest back pressure and useful filtration. Should production and supplies permit more people at risk will be advised to use better masks. At the beginning of this pandemic there was no modern data on hand made fabric masks. The lack of PPE had doctors and nurses making their own and some have been tested and are worthy and unlike thermal spun fabric can be washed. Washing the modern filter material wrecks the electrostatic properties making them clearly single use. Some special procedures not available at home do work well enough that some organizations collect used masks and send them out to be sanitized sufficiently to be used again. The velocity reduction \u2014 snow fence \u2014 effect combined with distance is useful and moves the odds in the correct direction if we all wear a face covering. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes if they are made of material that prevents the passage of viruses through the mask into your nose, mouth. Many of the home made masks now are being well designed, but I prefer to add an ordinary surgical mask under the cloth mask for extra protection. The usual advice now is that masks are primarily important to keep people who are infected from transmitting the virus, but it is logical that a well made mask worn properly also will help safeguard you from inhaling viruses transmitted by an infected person. Other than distancing yourself from others, masks and careful cleansing when you may have contacted viruses from a surface are the only ways there are now to protect yourself. ",

            "answer_text": "The short answer is NO. A N95 mask can\u2019t stop a virus because a virus is far to small. You need an electron microscope just to see one. A cloth mask is just a joke. I don\u2019t mean to be a mask snob but the only good a mask is for is to try and stop a cough or sneeze from getting out to others. The whole mask situation is to protect others whether they are close enough to get infected or not. A mask can not stop a virus the only thing it can stop is the droplets from a cough or sneeze. The primary way the virus is transmitted is by droplets from an infected persons cough or sneeze. The infection is not easily spread by touching something that has been infected . ",
