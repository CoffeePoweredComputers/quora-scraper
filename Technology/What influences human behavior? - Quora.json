            "answer_text": "The way we act towards reality is predicated by various factors which constitutes ourselves, we behave with regards to the environment we are subject to as well. The set of behaviors we exhibit differs from age, gender, culture, religion and beliefs. Our conscious behavior at this instant perhaps is the result of past experiences having shaped our perception of the world which defines how we act as in the development of a child to an adult as the child is distinguishing between right or wrong by always experimenting about things which is driven by the curiosity. The adult behavior is the result of a long learning process which involved multiple failures so as to tune the brain to make the best decisions and to be efficient. Both good and bad memories also influences our behaviors, for example, traumatic experiences yields specific behaviors in individuals. The unconscious greatly determines our behaviors as it inhabits our hardwired biological instincts such as desires, urges, aggression which are illogical and sometimes does not make sense to the conscious mind. Psychopathological disorders also directly impacts behavior. So to conclude, human behavior is influenced by our primitive instincts, environment, beliefs, age, gender and mental health. ",

            "answer_text": "Natures forces act upon us constantly and because we live in a systems of laws that nature has set before us, they govern us and it\u2019s what we do with the sensations and thoughts we receive that matters. We act a certain way to things that feel good and a certain way to those that don\u2019t make us feel so good and all of these things combine to if we go left or if we go right. Truly we all rely on each other the whole world over like one organism that moves together under the forces of nature. This is why it is important to know these laws and how they effect us because then we can come to know the system and how to work with it.  ",
