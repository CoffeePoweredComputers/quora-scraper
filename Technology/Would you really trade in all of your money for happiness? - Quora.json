            "answer_text": "Our fear and insecurity trumps our desire for happiness. Few of us will take that chance. Besides, money or the lack thereof, has nothing, except in the most extreme cases, to do with our level of happiness, so why jettison the dough? Do you ever wonder why the very rich never become enlightened and subsequently give all their money away? I\u2019m not sure, but I think the heir to the 31 Flavors ice cream dynasty gave up his inheritance to live on an island. That was some 45 years ago. I wonder how he feels about that now, if he\u2019s still alive. Here\u2019s the other side of that coin, \u201cWould you really trade in all your happiness for money?\u201d Anyone who would say yes to that one isn\u2019t really happy. ",

            "answer_text": "If I had money, no, probably not. Paradoxically, considering I worry about security more than happiness, I would be happier knowing I had some money than none at all. Money can bring a degree of security. How happy can you be without security even if true security is never a guarantee in life. Money can be stolen, lost, squandered. ",
