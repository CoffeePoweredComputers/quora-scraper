            "answer_text": "The latest info we have is: Oculus Rift release looking even less likely for 2015 So it will probably be next year. DK1 was released at the end of 2012, DK2 mid 2014, considering that the next release is planned to be the consumer version, it would place it during the first half of 2016. This assuming the gap between release and DK2 is the same as the gap between DK2 and DK1, which is certainly not the case.If I had to make a bet, I would say first half of 2016. Update: it's now official: Virtual reality headset Oculus Rift is coming in early 2016 ",
