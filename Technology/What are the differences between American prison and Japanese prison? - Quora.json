            "answer_text": "Everything about them is different. Two totally different cultures you are talking about. American prisoners get beds, pillows, tv and other things that you won\u2019t even think of getting in a Japanese prison. They make you work a job in the American prison, they make you break rocks and do manual labor in the Japanese. American guards can\u2019t beat your ass for no reason without having to lie about it to their superiors. Japanese may beat your ass and who you going to tell? Totally different cultures and rules. In America you are innocent until proven guilty, in Japan it\u2019s guilty til proven innocent. There is a reason that like 40% of Americans end up being repeat offenders and only like 2% of Japanese do. They don\u2019t play in their prisons. You aren\u2019t getting anything that resembles luxury. Americans get used to the cozy conditions of our prisons. While it\u2019s not a great place to be, it\u2019s not bad enough to deter them from going back. Especially if you are going to minimum security. I never went to a Japanese prison, the Japanese jail experience was enough for me to reconsider my path. Lol. Then I moved back to America and years later end up in prison for a marijuana thing. I don\u2019t do what I did to end up in prison anymore, learned that lesson. But I do still smoke pot all the time, and if I end up in jail again just for smoking or personal possession. Then so be it, I\u2019ll do the time and as soon as I get out. I\u2019ll light one right back up. ",
