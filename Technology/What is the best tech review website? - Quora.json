            "answer_text": "I feel the same exact way that you do when it comes to tech review sites. It\u2019s really frustrating to go to some of the top tech sites and read a few review then realize that the review does come from an expert opinion. And if the review isn\u2019t lacking in detail then it is usually extremely biased which isn\u2019t useful either. I follow about 10 sites a day, mostly for niche computers called small form factor systems. Four of my favorite sites that never disappoint are: Small Form Factor Systems SFF.Network \u2013 Newsfeed Performance Computer: Best Tech Reviews | PC Build Guides | Latest News Small Form Factor PC \u2022 r/sffpc The first two focus on SFF builds, cases and parts. The third one has a lot of SFF content but also does some interesting articles on big tower PCs. The fourth one is a subreddit which has a lot of good community stories and experiences with SFF systems and PC parts reviews. Anyway hope this helps and don\u2019t lose hope Frank there are some really good websites you just have to look for them. ",

            "answer_text": "If you are looking for the latest in tech products and software online then you will find it\u2019s hard to find a website that has a wide variety of what\u2019s new in tech and what is the hard part is finding a reliable site. Not all websites are reliable and end up getting information misconstrued with a jumble of other peoples hard work copy and pasted into the blogs, it\u2019s important in finding a source that is honest with tech reviews.  One site I found on Twitter is AZ Tech Reviews and they do a wide range of different categories on things in tech such as for products and latest software. Another thing to remember is most of these sites are opinion based and not everybody is going to have the same opinion, so it\u2019s key to finding a source that can provide the most honest reviews when it comes to product review in tech. If you are searching for a product features you want to be able to compare the pros and cons and know the list of all the attributes so you can easily understand the good, the bad and the ugly details.
