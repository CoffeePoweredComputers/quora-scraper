For instance, the Hubble Space Telescope revolutionized astronomy and cosmology research.GeoPositionalSatellites permit us to survey the world on both land and sea and help us identify where we are, where we are going, and how to get there.",

            "answer_text": "Often abbreviated as comsat, a communications satellite is a satellite that has been stationed in space for the purpose of providing telecommunications. Communications satellites are commonly used for mobile phone signals, weather tracking, or broadcasting television programs. Communications satellites are artificial satellites that relay receive signals from an earth station and then retransmits the signal to other earth stations. They commonly move in a geostationary orbit. Satellite communications technology is often used during natural disasters and emergencies when land-based communication services are down. Mobile satellite equipment can be deployed to disaster areas to provide emergency communication services. ",
