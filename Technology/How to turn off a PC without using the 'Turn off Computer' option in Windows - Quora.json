            "answer_text": "Well, lots of answers saying many the same thing. If so many give the same answer, then the answer is likely either to be right, or a whole bunch of people copied each other\u2019s mistake; I think this is a case of the former, not the latter. I don\u2019t agree with Michael Daniel when he states that if one holds in the power button for \u2018too long\u2019. then \u201cthe BIOS will turn the computer off immediately without the shutdown sequence having been completed properly\u201d. I have done that technique hundreds of times without any significant (actually, without any) damage to the computer hardware or software. What I find to be damaging to both h/w & s/w is when one jabs at the power button too quickly, causing the computer to very quickly lose power and turn off; many modern machines can\u2019t easily be made to do that, but any anti-bozo factor can be overcome with enough persistence and stupidity. Another way to damage a computer (and therefore not recommended) is to push the reset button while the hard drive (platter-type only) is doing something intensive. If you\u2019re really (un)lucky, you can brick the hard drive and make data recovery a very expensive affair. The reason I disagree with Michael Daniel is that holding in the power button without letting go does what I can only surmise is to send a signal to the bootstrap files in Windows to tell it to do a quick shutdown, and then hand the hardware shutdown \u2014 the reverse of the BIOS/UEFI hardware bootstrapping procedure \u2014 to the BIOS/UEFI. It\u2019s a last-ditch means of shutting down the computer if it\u2019s locked into some process and the CPU can\u2019t be unlocked. You see, I\u2019ve worked as a tech support/systems admin/troubleshooter for many years, and have dealt with a more-than-fair-share of locked-up computers, some so badly locked that even the reset button won\u2019t reset the computer. That\u2019s happened to me around 3\u20134 times, and it\u2019s very strange, because you\u2019d think that a hardware reset switch would override the software. I haven\u2019t seen it happen lately, so I think the newer BIOSes and UEFIs have some sort of \u201cmaster override\u201d built in. Holding in the power button will typically not cause the computer harm, so on the other hand, Michael Daniel is right in implying that it\u2019s not a good technique and should be avoided as much as possible. Thanks for the A2A ",

As \u201cshutdown\u201d is so well hidden in the menus of modern versions of Windows, it is usually more convenient to rely on tapping the power button which, by default, initiates shutdown. You only press it. If you hold it in for too long, the BIOS will turn the computer off immediately without the shutdown sequence having been completed properly. ",
