            "answer_text": "I guess it depends on how you define problem and where you want to go with this question. At work, I currently have two different ones. We\u2019re putting together a job description to go out and hire someone, but our needs are fairly specific, as is the type of person we\u2019re looking for - so putting it together in a way to attract the right target has had me toss out about 10 different attempts. I\u2019m also in the middle of optimizing one of our trading models. I got exposed to some amazing software the other day that can analyze actual and theoretical trades and find out where optimization can occur. You ALWAYS have to worry about curve fitting. That said, there have been a couple obvious tweaks that have emerged that will improve things by at least 1\u20132% per year on average (that\u2019s the theory anyway). Of course, sifting through this much data over a 12 year period is mind numbing after you\u2019ve been at it for 12 hours for three days straight. Outside of work, my wife and I are in the middle of nighttime potty training our oldest. So far so good. In local politics, public education. I know this is a national topic to, but things across the public school system here in Dallas are slowly getting more and more abysmal - yet we keep trying the same things. I would love nothing more than some county to do somethin very radical, just to TRY. The fact that public school overhead approaches 50% while private school overhead is so much smaller, is also nauseating. Then there\u2019s the roads. In 2016, Dallas spent just over $110m on its roads. There\u2019s only about 11,000 lane miles of road in TOTAL in town. Of course $50m of that number goes to fill potholes. According to the State of Texas, the average cost to repair a road is $25k per lane mile. In other words, for that amount of money, EVERY road should be able to be completely repaired and replaced every 2.5 years. Let\u2019s assume 50% slippage. That\u2019s every five years. Only residents are being told that will NEVER happen. Like most government math, something VERY screwy is going on. And that\u2019s at government rates. I am 100% certain if things were TRULY opened to bonded contractors, it could be done for significantly less. Then there\u2019s the time factor. I live near Royal lane in Dallas. The road has now been under repair, over the same 1.5 mile stretch, for 2 years. Here\u2019s what they did: Stripped the surface of the asphalt off;Put down \u201ctemporary\u201d lane dividers;Removed temporary lane dividers;Put down a new layer of asphalt;Put down new lane dividers;Remove new lane dividers to paint road;Put down new lane dividers over the new paint;Tear up entire road all over again to put in new pipes under the road (the department that puts down pipes/repairs pipes does not talk to the road department, so QUITE FREQUENTLY, road repairs will get done on a road that is scheduled to be torn up by another city department);Re-place rebar/repave/reasphalt road;For some reason don\u2019t repaint road for 3 months;Put down lane reflectors;Remove lane reflectors to paint road;Paint road;Realize wrong asphalt was used and repave road with new asphalt;Put down temporary lane reflectors;Remove temporary lane reflectors;Paint road;Put down new lane reflectors;Leave barrels up blocking lanes (this is where we are now).I can\u2019t figure out if (a) there are hundreds of crooks at all levels, (b) the people in charge are that blindingly incompetent, (c) there is so much government bureaucracy BS at ever turn it doesn\u2019t matter how smart or hard working people are, nothing will get done, or (d) all of the above. Oh and for this, my property taxes went up by 10% again, for the third year in a row. I can\u2019t send my kids to my local elementary school because (a) they employed a PREVIOUSLY CONVICTED child rapist, (b) there is \u201coccasional\u201d violent crime in lower schools, and (c) English is not the primary language at the school. But I guess this goes back under \u201ceducation.\u201d However, my life overall is quite good. I deal with most of the above (politics/school/roads) by ignoring them. If they get too bad, I\u2019ll move. ",

            "answer_text": "Changing the myths and misconceptions about Africa and her people. My biggest problem right now is changing the narrative about Africa and what we have to offer to the world. I am more interested in tourism and investing on the continent.  Rwandan Culture through traditional dance and music. When I moved to the US, I noticed that the perception that people had about Rwanda and Africa was very negative, demeaning, and humiliating. It was not the Africa I had lived in for 20 years. Throughout college, whenever I came back home, I traveled with some college mates, professsors, and other friends to Rwanda. They were all surprised and amazed. Some fellow Americans ended up moving to Rwanda and have started businesses there. One American businessman who was retiring fell in love with Rwanda that he has even set up many successful businesses in Rwanda. Today, he is a good friend of mine. More like an acquaintance today. On top of that, he has also become good friends with Paul Kagame ( the president of Rwanda). Today, he is part of the PAC ( Presidential Advisory Council). A team of former presidents, diplomats, businessmen and women from all of the world who advise Paul Kagame on how to move Rwanda forward, making Rwanda, a self-reliant country, by free market enteprise system through trade, tourism, inovation, and investment.  Rwanda is doing business with Arsenal to promote tourism in Rwanda. A move that will make Rwanda, the first aid-free country in East Africa by 2024. Today, Rwanda supports her 83% of her national budget. The rest comes 17% comes from multinational aid and soft loans. If Rwanda can do it, so can any African country. I am very proud to be part of that journey. Showing the world that Rwanda and Africa is much more than the narrative of wars, conflicts, poverty and other negative stuff that the western media is fascinated with. Today, I have set a target to travel to every single nation in Africa. I want to show the world that majority of African countries are indeed safe to travel, and are very developing. From Africa Rising, to Aspiring Africa, Africa is the future and the next economic frontier. Those who study Africa will be the next millionnaires and billionnaires of tomorrow. For more abour Rwanda and Africa, feel free to check out my articles.  My dream is to own of the largest private equity firms, focusing on investment in Africa. I spend a considerable amount of time, studying, learning, and analyzing African markets. There is really no place like Africa at the moment.

In practice, attackers escape undetected more often than not, based on what we know from penetration tests and attacks that are discovered after the fact. Historically, we tried to detect malicious activity using pattern matching against signatures of known exploits and malware. This works horribly. Attackers can simply purchase every commercial product on the market and automatically mutate their exploits until the commercial products don't detect them, and they can innovate new attack techniques that the defenders don't know about. That's basically the state of the art today. When we catch attackers, it's because they screw up or we get lucky. We don't have a reliable way to catch them. That's what I and my team are trying to figure out. We have ideas, but we aren't sure any of them are going to work. It's a hard problem! And that makes it interesting. ",

So, my biggest \u201cproblem\u201d is a new measurement for that breaking mechanism. The lack of fear and worry are so liberating and worth the cost of aging.
