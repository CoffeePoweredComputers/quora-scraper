            "answer_text": "Generally speaking, all actual laptops (cf. tablets) have a dual head display adapter, with an external video port of some kind, since using laptops to give presentations is a core business activity. So you just plug in the external monitor, and do whatever keyboard-fu is required to activate the display settings (on older laptops, often F5 or Alt-F5). You also need to use the monitor controls to select the correct input. Sometimes it all works seamlessly and automatically, on other occasions you need to tinker with settings. In a few cases, it may never work as the laptop and monitor have no video settings in common. On newer laptops, you may be able to use WiDi/Miracast and connect wirelessly to smart TVs/monitors. In some cases, you may need an adapter. DVI-I to VGA or DVI-D to HDMI adapters are simple and inexpensive. VGA to HDMI adapters are active and need external power, e.g. from a USB port. ",
