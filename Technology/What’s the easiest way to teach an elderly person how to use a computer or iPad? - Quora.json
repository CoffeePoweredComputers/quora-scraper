            "answer_text": "I second the other answers here. I had not heard of the Grandpad before and it looks like a good thing. I do wonder about the screen size. Many seniors have difficulty seeing and need a large screen. I work with seniors (and am one myself) to help them with their computers, tablets, and phones. The things I need to remind myself of. Ask them what they want to do with their devices. Sometimes I get an answer like, \u201cTeach me everything\u201d. Yeah, right. Keep it simple. One step at a time. One on one is best. Get them to practice it themselves - more than once if there is time and they have the patience. Be patient. Be prepared to repeat yourself several times. Seniors get very frustrated with the technology and don\u2019t have a lot of patience. I don\u2019t know what that says about me. Because the keyboard on a phone is small, the speech option is a good one but many seniors are not comfortable with that. Many seniors have visual and hearing issues. I have also found that many seniors are overly (I think) concerned about security so they simply do not do things like online purchases and banking. They are mostly interested in keeping in touch with family and friends - hence Facebook, Facetime, and all the other apps. I have had seniors say that they don\u2019t use apps - they have no idea what an app is. Treat them as individuals with specific needs. It is classic that a senior will be given a laptop, an iPad or whatever by their children because they think it will help them and then don\u2019t have the patience to help them with it. I had one person who brought in an iPad and we couldn\u2019t turn it on. We asked her if she had charged it up and she said, \u201cYou need to charge these things?\u201d ",

            "answer_text": "Depends on the elderly person. My mother started using computers in the 60\u2019s and used her own PC at home until about 5 years ago, when she stopped being able to remember how to do things. We moved her from there to an iPad and that worked for a few years and then she stopped being able to remember how to use that too. Now we have her using a Grandpad (see Tablet for Seniors), a very simple tablet with a utterly consistent user interface built on Android. It is by far the simplest tablet that she\u2019s used and she mostly manages to navigate it without prompting. We mostly use it to send her pictures of our lives and her (now great) grandchildren. She likes that and listening to music. She sometimes manages e-mail, but it\u2019s always voice e-mail now. You\u2019ll have to figure out what works for your elderly person, but I\u2019ve found the Grandpad an effective way to keep her in the family loop, especially in this challenging time when we can\u2019t visit her except through a window.
