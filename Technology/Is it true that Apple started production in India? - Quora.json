Now they\u2019re focusing on manufacturing the iPhone X in India by July. I\u2019m not sure why they would manufacture the X since it\u2019s been discontinued, but multiple reports suggest that they will also start manufacturing the XR and XS models. The factory has been set up by Foxconn. Apple contracts Foxconn to produce their phones. Note that most of the components will be sourced from China since India doesn\u2019t have the electronics industrial complex to produce the components required in an iPhone. Some of the components will be sourced locally and assembled here. Apple to start mass production of iPhones in India with the help of Foxconn ",

            "answer_text": "Thanks for A2A saikat. Yes!! Soon Apple will start production of iPhone SE models in india.  Apple Inc will in the coming months start assembling its lower-priced iPhone SE models at a contract manufacturer's plant in the southern Indian technology hub of Bengaluru. Apple is setting up a plant in Bengaluru to focus solely on assembling iPhones. Apple planned to initially assemble 3,00,000 to 4,00,000 iPhone SE handsets in India. It\u2019s too early to say what other phone models Apple would assemble at the Bengaluru plant. Hope you got your answer. Source: Economic times. :):) ",
