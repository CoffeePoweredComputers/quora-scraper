            "answer_text": "Can I be happy while depressed? No, you can\u2019t. Not at the same time. Depression feels powerless. Being happy feels empowered. Depression indicates your body is stressed (among other things). Happiness indicates you are not stressed. You can shift from feeling depressed to feeling better. You usually cannot jump from depression to happiness. Even if the depression is because of something you\u2019ve focused on such as someone who disappeared from your life. A child who ran away or a mate who is MIA. After the first surge of relief when they come back there is often anger. That\u2019s because anger is the next step up from depression. You don\u2019t have to stay that way long but most people have to journey through anger to get to even better emotional states. Guilt might be your next stop. Then frustration. Then hope that life will be better now. Then comes happiness. You can find ways to be happy. Any situation can lead to depression if you process it in ways that lead to chronic stress. Situations by themselves do not trigger depression. The following formulas explain it well: Life + Healthy habits of thought = less stress\u00a0Life + Unhealthy habits of thought = stress\u00a0Anyone who has lived very long knows that some people become more stressed and/or anxious in a situation than others who are in the same situation. That\u2019s why people talk about how important how we respond to a situation is to our well-being. The Why is because we make meaning for the events in our life. Until we give an event meaning it doesn\u2019t affect us.If our significant other is rude to us and we see it in one way it feels highly stressful. If we perceive it in another way, we may even be amused. Here are some possible interpretations (there are about a million different ways to interpret most situations and most of them are right from the perspective from which they are viewed). She is rude because she is planning to dump me. (high stress, unless you want out of the relationship but are too scared to tell him) She is rude because he had a bad day. It has nothing to do with me. (I\u2019m going to do something nice and she will really appreciate my providing a distraction that will help her feel good - no stress or eustress (good, anticipatory stress like foreplay) She is rude because he is an absent minded professor and she is thinking about her latest discovery. (No stress; it isn\u2019t personal, unless the person feels neglected) She is rude because he is worried about her Mom\u2019s health. (rudeness doesn\u2019t increase stress; it isn\u2019t personal) She is rude because she takes me for granted. (high stress)She is rude because I married a moron. (stressful, sense of being stuck) She is rude because she wants me to cave in to her demands. (some stress) I could go on for a long time but it is difficult for me to come up with stressful answers because I have trained my mind to give others the benefit of the doubt so I tend to interpret things in a low stress way naturally. I have to work to come up with examples that would be high stress.The point is that the person\u2019s rudeness has the impact it has because of the meaning the person gives it\u2014not because of the rudeness itself. We create the meaning we give events in our lives.We can even change the meaning we gave to events in our lives long after the fact and change the amount of stress and/or psychological pain those events cause. I have a new book coming out soon, Mental Health Made Easy: Maintain and Restore Your Mental Health: Develop Health Habits of Thought, The Smart Way to Permanently Reduce Stress that provides information on how to develop healthy habits of thought. When I went from depressed to happy it was because I changed my habitual thoughts. Best wishes to you.  Two questions I answered were merged into this. Here is my other answer: Originally Answered: How do you be happy when you have depression? \u00b7 Remove Banner How do you be happy when you have depression? You can\u2019t. Not at the same time.

            "answer_text": "I am so sorry you are feeling depressed right now. This is definitely a difficult time for us all. I guess the way I would answer your great question is this. There is a difference between happiness and joy. Happiness comes and goes, but if you can bring joy into your heart, that will last for ever. I guess another way of saying it is this\u2026although you might not be able to happy while you are depressed, you can be joyful while you are depressed. So, the thing for you to do is to find something that brings you joy. From what I have learned during my nearly 50 years on this planet is there is only one thing that can bring true joy. You see, we are all born with a void inside of us. And most of us go through life trying to fill that void with things of this world. We try to do that by seeking things like money, power, sex, alcohol, drugs, friends, etc\u2026but the more of those things we get, the more we seem to want. There is never enough to satisfy us. That\u2019s because the only thing that can fill that void is a relationship with God through Jesus. But, we live in a world full of sin. And because of that sin, a great chasm exists between God and us. And there is nothing we can do on our own to cross that great chasm. Although we desire to be with God, and He wants us to be with Him, we just can\u2019t cross that gap between us\u2026because we are filthy sinners, and God is perfect. We are all sinners and we have all fallen short of God\u2019s standards for our lives. And because we are sinners, we deserve to be separated from Him. But God loves us and wants us to be with Him. So, He provided a way for us to cross that gap that separates us from Him. For, even though we are sinners and are deserving of an eternity separated from Him, He died for us. And when He died for us, He created a way for us to cross that gap to be with Him. It\u2019s a free gift from Him to us, and all we have to do to accept that free gift is to admit we are sinners, do our best to turn away from those things that separate us from God, and accept Jesus as our Lord and savior. When we confess Jesus is Lord with our lips and believe in our hearts that He was raised from the dead, then we are saved. And that void in our hearts is immediately filled. And then, not only do we get to spend eternity with God, we also begin to feel that everlasting joy that carries us through even the most depressing times. If you would like to learn more about this life changing joy, maybe look at peacewithgod.net. What have you got to lose? ",
