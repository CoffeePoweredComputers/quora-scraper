            "answer_text": "I turned eight years old in 1993. My family lived near Portland, OR (Clackamas, technically) at the time. I feel like Portland was a little different then vs. today. More blue-collar and rough around the edges. But that is a vague impression, since I was so young at the time. My dad worked at Precision Castparts, on QA measurement machinery. We only lived there in the first place b/c he lost his job in Texas during the previous recession. My family had no ties to Portland (and would in fact move away in 1994). Everyone was hoping the Trailblazers could get back to the NBA Finals and get their revenge on the Bulls, but they had started their slow decline. It was Michael Jordan\u2019s era. Bill Clinton was the new President. It seemed like a lot of people in my area liked him, but a few people *really* disliked him. One of my friends said something about how he wanted to kill babies. I had no idea that he meant or what he was talking about at the time, but it seemed like an extreme desire for someone who was President. But I heard other people say good things about him. I also knew my dad was a Bush supporter, and my mom liked Clinton, and they argued about the news almost constantly. In fact, they got divorced that summer. I went to a local elementary school. I rode the bus everyday. I played basketball/baseball or Nintendo with my friends in the afternoon, depending on how much it was raining that day. There were newer systems by that time, but we didn\u2019t have them yet. My mom went to Portland State \u2014 she was trying to learn Accounting. I went downtown with her a few times to see campus, and so on. I sat in class one time on a day off school, and passed the time reading a book. I remember reading stuff like Judy Blume, Beverly Cleary, and E.B. White children\u2019s books a lot. I did pretty well in school. I really liked this girl Laura in the first half of 1993, but she clearly couldn\u2019t stand me. Then, in the second half, there was a girl Katie and she really liked me. We became good friends and would eat lunch together every day and stuff. Usually at recess everyone would play basketball or dodgeball. In class, we would say the Pledge of Allegiance every morning, and learn the typical spelling and maths that kids that age learn. My dad moved to a different apartment in the summer. I would go there every weekend and Monday evenings. It wasn\u2019t unusual to have divorced parents in that particular area. It seemed like that was a definite trend. I had a half-brother who was 12 years older and lived with us. He worked out a lot, had a bunch of Nintendo games, and was also at college a lot. He liked action movies \u2014 anything with Arnold Schwarzenegger was really big at the time. I didn\u2019t know who the groups were at the time, but later I recognized a lot of songs by Guns n\u2019 Roses, Nirvana, and Pearl Jam in particular because I heard them on his tape player/radio. We had a janky computer in the corner, but it wasn\u2019t really a big thing. It was just for typing up papers for college, more or less, plus it had a few games on it. The concept of the internet hadn\u2019t filtered down to us yet. Our family car was a Chevy Caprice. It was freaking enormous. I\u2019m not really sure how the fuel economy was on it \u2014 it didn\u2019t matter as much in Texas, but gas was over $1 a gallon in Oregon. I heard complaints about that from time to time. In the fall, it was football season. My dad was a huge Dallas Cowboys fan. I was usually at his apartment on Sunday, and they were usually winning. They won the Super Bowl that season. I fantasized about being like Emmitt Smith or Troy Aikman when I grew up. When I look back at the big events from that year, the ones that really registered with me at the time were the World Trade Center Bombing, the Waco Fire, and the Mississippi Flooding. My mom watched CNN for quite awhile on the day of the WTC Bombing, definitely surprised that something like that could happen. Not related to any specific news story, but I also remember talk about how there were too many gangs, too many divorces, too much teen pregnancy, too much drug use, too much graffiti, and too many kids with tattoos and colored hair. I definitely overheard a vague sense from adults that the youth were becoming more anarchical and disengaged. The old people I remember from then, though, were a lot more serious. Generally not much flair at all in how they dressed, would correct my English sometimes, and basically expected very good manners and conduct. It was very easy to meet a World War II veteran when I was out with my dad at the American Legion hall. The main links to the outside world were a newspaper every morning, and the evening news. I would pore over the sports section for NBA scores, articles on the Blazers and the NFL, and the standings sheet. I started saving the section each day, because once it was gone, it was gone. There was no going back and looking it up again in two weeks. All other news went right over my head. I had a bunch of playing cards though, and I knew right away when some player like Xavier McDaniel, Sedalle Threatt, or Rolando Blackmon checked into a game, who they were and how long they had been playing. In our living room, there was a big TV which sat on the floor. It was the size of a large box and took up a lot of space. The picture was a little wacky towards the top of the screen, but it was an older TV and that was just how things went. I remember my mom loved to watch Murphy Brown and Seinfeld, along with Mary Tyler Moore reruns whenever Nick at \u2018Nite showed them. My dad wasn\u2019t into TV as much, aside from football. Both of my parents smoked. There wasn\u2019t any thought about only doing it outside or in certain rooms. They kicked back on the couch and lit up all night long. I got used to the smell of cigarette smoke and didn\u2019t think twice about it. I never played soccer or saw a soccer ball, even though it would later become my favorite sport. ",

            "answer_text": "There seems to be some interest in 1993 specifically, not sure why. I was asked something about that year earlier this week. I can only talk about it from my personal experience. I graduated from college that year, and moved back home with my mom, until I found a job. She had to move out of the triplex apartment she had been renting. The owner was selling. She tried to find another place in the town in which she\u2019d lived for the past 13 years, but rents had gone out of her range. She found a duplex apartment to rent in farm country, just outside of town, and so that\u2019s where we moved. We didn\u2019t want for anything. We had electricity and phone service. Even though we were on a well, we had indoor plumbing, and a washing machine. We had the water tested (it was fine), but we got bottled water for drinking, just to be safe. The only utility we didn\u2019t have access to (aside from city water) was cable TV. However, even there, we managed to find a substitute. There was a company that leased a microwave receiver that enabled us to get many cable channels over the air through their transmitter. People had largely switched to walk-around phones by the early \u201890s, and we may have had one. I remember us still using a corded phone. I split the rent with my mom. Until I found work in my field, my mom brought me into her housecleaning business, which she\u2019d been running for many years, so I could earn some money. There weren\u2019t that many non-students who had access to the internet then. I had managed to get internet access over the summers, when I wasn\u2019t at school, through a group of volunteers that had set up an old PDP-11 system at a local university, running Unix. It had a bank of phone modems, so that members could call in and use it. I had internet access through my university (due to the fact that I majored in CS), but my account was deleted shortly after I graduated. My alma mater had started offering paid internet service to non-students a couple years before I graduated, but I would\u2019ve had to call long-distance for that. The great thing about the volunteer-run service was it was free, and open to anyone who wanted to open an account. All I needed to do was send in an application form, and a photocopy of my state ID. Each member got access for a half-hour, I think 3 times a day, if one could get in. They had a limited number of modems, and sometimes I\u2019d have to wait to get an open line. They took donations to fund the service. I was so thankful that they offered it, that when I got my first tech job, I sent them a nice big \u201cthank you\u201d check, which they greatly appreciated. This was before the web became popular. I was using the text internet. The Mosaic web browser was around. I\u2019d seen it, since my local library set up a PC as a web terminal for patrons to use (I guess hooked up by Ethernet), but I didn\u2019t know what it was, or why I\u2019d want to use it. Aside from the move, my biggest project that year was finding my first tech job. It was not easy. The average time it took for a CS graduate from my school to find their first job was a year. I was no exception. I didn\u2019t keep a count, but my memory is I sent out a few hundred resumes over that time. I took to cold-calling local tech companies I could find in the phone book, asking if they were looking for anybody. No takers. What was pretty demoralizing was despite my efforts, I got hardly any interviews. I think I got three over that time. I finally got an entry-level C programming position at $9 an hour (for comparison, the minimum wage was about $5.25/hr.), I think through a newspaper ad, at a small, local software firm that produced scientific databases on CD-ROM. I was glad to have it. ",

            "answer_text": "Before the internet, google maps, and smartphones I think the world was a more romantic place. Things, people, and places seemed more unknowable and unreachable. Network TV and movies held a much more central role in defining our shared culture in the USA. Personal time seemed more available, and you could count on getting lost once in a while driving around in your car. Digital cameras and selfies were not yet a big thing, and people didn\u2019t try to make their friends jealous by posting pictures on social media. The world was a bit more of a private place, where your pictures and information weren\u2019t easily accessible with a google search. People read more and the 90s became the golden age of huge bookstores like Borders and Barnes and Noble. I liked 1993. ",
