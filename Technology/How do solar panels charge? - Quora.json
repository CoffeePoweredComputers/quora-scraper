            "answer_text": "The solar panel converts sunlight into DC electricity to charge the battery. This DC electricity is fed to the battery via a solar regulator which ensures the battery is charged properly and not damaged. How Many Solar Panels To Charge a 12 Volt Battery? One solar panel can charge a 12-volt battery. However, many other accessories are also needed to distribute power to a battery's cells. If you don't know how to charge a drained battery using solar hardware, this guide can help. Go to my Profile and you can find all about Solar Panels material there... ",

            "answer_text": "Solar panels are one of the widely used solar products. Solar panels are made up of silicon plates that convert solar energy into electrical energy with the help of other appliances. Silicon is a semiconductor inserted between conductive layers in a solar cell. Solar panels have photovoltaic cells that convert sunlight into electricity(DC). But mostly we at homes and businesses use electrical appliances which run on alternating current (AC) electricity, so the DC electricity is then passed through an inverter to convert it to usable AC electricity. The process of solar paneling starts during the day time when proper sunlight is there. The sun rays fall on Solar PV Panels that are installed on your rooftop, and photovoltaic refers to the scientific process by which solar energy gets converted into electrical energy. ",
