            "answer_text": "3D printers are machines that can produce an object made of plastic (or metal) using an additive process.  Additive processes are where you build up an object using raw materials like powder, liquid, or filament.  The opposite of this is a subtractive process, such as CNC milling machines, in which you insert a block of material that is larger than your final object, and it gets cut away to leave only the object that you want. Subtractive processes are more wasteful than additive ones, because you must always start with raw material that is larger than the object you want, and in many cases the off-cuts are either discarded or must be recycled.  With additive processes, you use exactly the amount of material that you need, any left-over material can be used without any addition processing in future prints. Subtractive processes are also in many cases more limiting than additive ones because you are limited to where your toolhead can reach.  This means it is impossible to make fully hollow objects, as there is no way for the toolhead to cut away the inside of an object.  Additive processes on the other hand, can easily form internal cavities; this is a very important property allowing the strength, weight, and cost of objects to be easily changed.  It also allows complex interlocking objects to be printed (a technique known as \"print-in-place\"), allowing fully assembled dynamic objects to be printed with joints and hinges that are usable right out of the printer. The Strandbeest is the textbook example of the possibilities with print-in-place techniques.  there are plenty of videos on the internet of a Strandbeest fully operational when it comes out of an SLS printer.  You can see it briefly at 18 seconds into this video:   3D printers come in many forms, Dylan Lawson Brown describes fused deposition modelling (FDM), which push out molten plastic to build up a model layer by layer.   However, there are other types of 3D printers such as laser-sintering systems (SLS), which uses lasers to melt together plastic or metal powder (DMLS), layer by layer.      There's also resin-curing/photolithography or stereo lithography (SLA), which uses either lasers or a projector to harden liquid resin layer by layer to create the object.   This is just a small selection of specific examples of 3D printers out there, there are many many variations on these themes, go out and explore. ",

            "answer_text": "A 3D printer is a machine that can create physical parts from computer generated designs. Everything from jewelry, phone cases, buildings, and cars. Most use plastic by melting it just before depositing it on a surface. The plastic then rapidly cools and hardens in place. Buildings are created by using cement, but instead of melting it starts in it's wet state and gradually dries once in place. Here is a video of my 3D printer in action:   The main advantage of 3D printing is that the material is all stored in one location and the printer head does all the work in getting the material where it needs to be. Also, because the printer is controlled by mechanical parts and motors they can generally do the job much faster and with greater precision and accuracy than any other process. From what I've found, the greatest use of 3D printers for at home hobbyists is for people that work with Arduinos, Raspberry Pis, and similar parts to work with drones, cameras, or other DIY projects. For commercial uses, 3D printing is now becoming popular for rapid prototype parts. For example, parts that would typically need hundreds of thousands of dollars for tooling before they can be made can now be made for just a few thousand dollars to get a concept going. Then, once the design is refined you can invest the big money on a proven design. There are also some cutting edge ideas starting up, for example printing buildings and cars. Also, prosthetic parts are being printed. It really is too early in the life cycle to fully understand all of the capabilities this technology will have, but if you're someone who likes tech and design and spends time with DIY projects I'd say this is a must have. I bought my printer for $600, a small price compared to the capabilities it gives. ",
