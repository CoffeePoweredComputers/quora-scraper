            "answer_text": "How are the chances that Bitcoin and Blockchain will fail? When we talk about failure, we should know about what it's trying to achieve. Replacing common transaction system? In this regard Bitcoin will ultimately fail, maybe not in your lifetime, but later. Take my words. Bitcoin is assumed to be a currency, but something which started as a form of investment, which fluctuated against an already established common transactional system cannot become a common transaction system itself. Even as an investment, it's no actual value, no production, no service. It's just a redundant, assumed currency which is played personally by individuals. Anyone can create a new startup(digital currency in this case) and promote it, people will join and capitalise it. After capitalisation, there has to be production or service. But if it's not against any product or service, it will eventually fail, because it would militate against the foundational ways of economy. Digital currency can replace traditional currency for sure, but without changing the value of pre-existing currency. Bitcoin has already become a personal asset, so it won't be able to replace common transactional system. The power of sharing resources cannot be changed in the name of replacement of currency, so just the ways would be changed and not the values. All kinds of assets are subject to financial regulations of a country, and since bitcoin began without any such regulation and under non cognizance of the regulatories and international economic balance in the name of \u201cdigital currency\u201d, it has to fail. It would not be able to address disparities between countries and define their purchasing powers. One who got to know about bitcoin earlier than others would not naturally gain advantage of it if it becomes common transactional system. Otherwise international economic balance would collapse. And Blockchain is a success. It's definitely the future and more developments will come. ",
