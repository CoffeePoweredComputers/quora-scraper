            "answer_text": "Machine learning is technically a branch of AI. It is based on the idea that we can build machines to process data and learn on their own, without constant supervision. AI is the technology in which we make machines intelligent but Machine Learning is the technology using which we train our models so that it can beat human intelligence. Here is an awesome video tutorial that will clear all your doubts about the difference between AI and ML:  Here is a diagrammatic representation of relations between AI, ML, DL, Data Science:  As you can see in the diagram, AI is the main head of all the other technologies and at the same time, all technologies are co-related to each other. ML, DL, NN all are the sub-parts of AI. Thinking how AI works? Computers are good at following processes (a sequence of steps) to execute a task. If we give a computer, steps to execute a task the computer should easily be able to complete it. The steps are nothing but Algorithms. So, how can we accomplish this? Let\u2019s take an example of predicting the weather forecast for 2019. First, we need a lot of data. Let\u2019s take the data from 2006 \u2013 2018. Now, let us divide this data in an 80:20 ratio. 80% of the data is going to be our labeled data, and the rest 20% of the data is going to be our test data. Note: We have the output for the entire 100% of data which has been acquired from 2006 \u2013 2018. What happens once we have collected the data? We are going to feed the labeled data i.e. the 80% of data into the machine. Here, the algorithm is learning from the data which has been fed into it. Next, we need to test the algorithm. We feed the test data, i.e. the remaining 20% of the data to the machine. The machine gives us the output. Now, we cross verify the output given by the machine with the actual output of the data and check for its accuracy. Once we check for accuracy and we are not satisfied with the model, we tweak the algorithm to give us the precise output or at least somewhere close to the actual output. Once we are satisfied with the model, we then feed the data to the model so that it can predict 2019\u2019s weather forecast. Types Of AI Artificial General Intelligence: It is an emerging field aiming at the building of \u2018thinking machines\u2019. This intelligence involves reasoning, thinking, learning without giving any input. It is less common because it is difficult to create. A generalized AI would be capable of handling all kinds of different tasks, just like human handles.Applied Artificial Intelligence: It is commonly defined as an application of artificial intelligence to enable a high-functioning system that replicates human intelligence for a dedicated purpose. This is the most common form of AI. It includes everything from intelligent stock-trading systems to automated self-driving. For example, an advanced applied AI system can gather employee background information such as user name, title, location and authorized resources from across disparate data sources.Now coming on to the Machine Learning: Now that we have access to a huge amount of data, Machine Learning researchers are constantly working on making use of this data in order to provide intelligence to the model. Machine Learning uses large sets of data and hours of training to make predictions on probable outcomes. But when Machine Learning \u2018comes to life\u2019 and moves beyond simple programming, and reflects and interacts with people even at the most basic level, AI comes into play. AI is the step beyond Machine Learning, yet it needs ML to reflect and optimize decisions. AI uses what it has gained from ML to simulated intelligence, the same way a human is constantly observing their surrounding environment and making intelligent decisions. Here are some real-life applications of ML: Moley\u2019s Robotic Kitchen: The kitchen comes up with a pair of robotic arms, an oven, a shelf for food and utensils, and a touch screen. Moley\u2019s kitchen is a gift of Machine Learning: it will learn n number of recipes for you, will cook with remarkable precision, and will also clean up by itself.Netflix Movie Recommendation: More than 80 percent of the shows and movies are discovered through the recommendation section. To recommend movies, it goes through threads within the content rather than relying on the genre board in order to make predictions.Amazon Alexa: The latest innovations of Amazon have the brain and the voice of Alexa. Alexa is the voice-controlled Amazon \u2018personal assistant\u2019 in Amazon Echo devices. Alexa can play music, provide information, deliver news and sports scores, tell you the weather, control your smart home, and even allow prime members to order products that they\u2019ve ordered before.Amazon Product Recommendation: Amazon, it recommends a set of items that are bought together or items that are often bought together, along with your ordered item. Have you ever wondered how does Amazon recommends you that? Well again, Amazon uses Machine Learning algorithms to do so.Google Maps: Google Maps anonymously sends real-time data from Google Maps users on the same route back to Google. Google uses a Machine Learning algorithm on these data to predict accurately the traffic on that route.Machine Learning Vs. Artificial Intelligence: Which Is Right For You? Both AI and ML can have their own valuable business applications. Determining which one is best for your company depends on what your business needs. These systems have many great applications to offer, but ML has gotten much more publicity lately, so many companies have focused on that source of solutions. However, AI can also be useful for many simpler applications that don't require ongoing learning. Hope this answer helps! ",

            "answer_text": "During the past few years, the terms artificial intelligence and machine learning have begun showing up frequently in technology news and websites. Often the two are used as synonyms, but many experts argue that they have subtle but real differences. And of course, the experts sometimes disagree among themselves about what those differences are. In general, however, two things seem clear: first, the term artificial intelligence (AI) is older than the term machine learning (ML), and second, most people consider machine learning to be a subset of artificial intelligence. One of the best graphic representations of this relationship comes from Nvidia's blog. It offers a good starting point for understanding the differences between artificial intelligence and machine learning. Artificial Intelligence vs. Machine Learning \u2013 First, What\u2019s AI? Computer scientists have defined artificial intelligence in many different ways, but at its core, AI involves machines that think the way humans think. Of course, it's very difficult to determine whether or not a machine is \"thinking,\" so on a practical level, creating artificial intelligence involves creating a computer system that is good at doing the kinds of things humans are good at. The idea of creating machines that are as smart as humans goes all the way back to the ancient Greeks, who had myths about automatons created by the gods. In practical terms, however, the idea didn't really take off until 1950. In that year, Alan Turing published a groundbreaking paper called \"Computing Machinery and Intelligence\" that posed the question of whether machines can think. He proposed the famous Turing test, which says, essentially, that a computer can be said to be intelligent if a human judge can't tell whether he is interacting with a human or a machine. The phrase artificial intelligence was coined in 1956 by John McCarthy, who organized an academic conference at Dartmouth dedicated to the topic. At the end of the conference, the attendees recommended further study of \"the conjecture that every aspect of learning or any other feature of intelligence can in principle be so precisely described that a machine can be made to simulate it. An attempt will be made to find how to make machines use language, form abstractions and concepts, solve kinds of problems now reserved for humans, and improve themselves.\" This proposal foreshadowed many of the topics that are of primary concern in artificial intelligence today, including natural language processing, image recognition and classification, and machine learning. In the years immediately after that first conference, artificial intelligence research flourished. However, within a few decades it became apparent that the technology to create machines that could truly be said to be thinking for themselves was many years off. But in the last decade, artificial intelligence has moved from the realms of science fiction to the realm of scientific fact. Stories about IBM's Watson AI winning the game show Jeopardy and Google's AI beating human champions at the game of Go have returned artificial intelligence to the forefront of public consciousness. Today, all of the largest technology companies are investing in AI projects, and most of us interact with AI software every day whenever we use smartphones, social media, Web search engines or ecommerce sites. And one of the types of AI that we interact with most often is machine learning. Artificial Intelligence vs. Machine Learning \u2013 Okay, Then What\u2019s Machine Learning? The phrase \"machine learning\" also dates back to the middle of the last century. In 1959, Arthur Samueldefined machine learning as \"the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed.\" And he went on to create a computer checkers application that was one of the first programs that could learn from its own mistakes and improve its performance over time. Like AI research, machine learning fell out of vogue for a long time, but it became popular again when the concept of data mining began to take off around the 1990s. Data mining uses algorithms to look for patterns in a given set of information. Machine learning does the same thing, but then goes one step further \u2013 it changes its program's behavior based on what it learns. One application of machine learning that has become very popular recently is image recognition. These applications first must be trained \u2013 in other words, humans have to look at a bunch of pictures and tell the system what is in the picture. After thousands and thousands of repetitions, the software learns which patterns of pixels are generally associated with horses, dogs, cats, flowers, trees, houses, etc., and it can make a pretty good guess about the content of images. Many web-based companies also use machine learning to power their recommendation engines. For example, when Facebook decides what to show in your newsfeed, when Amazon highlights products you might want to purchase and when Netflix suggests movies you might want to watch, all of those recommendations are on based predictions that arise from patterns in their existing data. Currently, many enterprises are beginning to use machine learning capabilities for predictive analytics. As big data analysis has become more popular, machine learning technology has become more commonplace, and it's a standard feature in many analytics tools. In fact, machine learning has become so associated with statistics, data mining and predictive analytics that some people argue it should be classified as a separate field from artificial intelligence. After all, systems can exhibit AI features like natural language processing or automated reasoning without having any machine learning capabilities, and machine learning systems don't necessarily need to have any other features of artificial intelligence. Other people prefer to use the term \"machine learning\" because they think it sounds more technical and a little less scary than \"artificial intelligence.\" One Internet commenter even said that the difference between the two is that \"machine learning actually works.\" However, machine learning has been part of the discussion around artificial intelligence from the very beginning, and the two remain closely entwined in many applications coming to market today. For example, personal assistants and bots often have many different AI features, including ML. Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning Frontiers: Deep Learning, Neural Nets, and Cognitive Computing Of course, \"machine learning\" and \"artificial intelligence\" aren't the only terms associated with this field of computer science. IBM frequently uses the term \"cognitive computing,\" which is more or less synonymous with AI. However, some of the other terms do have very unique meanings. For example, an artificial neural network or neural net is a system that has been designed to process information in ways that are similar to the ways biological brains work. Things can get confusing because neural nets tend to be particularly good at machine learning, so those two terms are sometimes conflated. In addition, neural nets provide the foundation for deep learning, which is a particular kind of machine learning. Deep learning uses a certain set of machine learning algorithms that run in multiple layers. It is made possible, in part, by systems that use GPUs to process a whole lot of data at once. If you're confused by all these different terms, you're not alone. Computer scientists continue to debate their exact definitions and probably will for some time to come. And as companies continue to pour money into artificial intelligence and machine learning research, it's likely that a few more terms will arise to add even more complexity to the issues. ",
