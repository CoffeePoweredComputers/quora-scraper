            "answer_text": "There are some very interesting use cases for AI and machine learning in nearly every facet of our world. My field, marketing, is all about solving efficiency issues, improving intelligence gathering, and understanding so that we can predict and react faster than anyone else. Using NVIDIA (my employer) as an example, we have a lot of visual based User Generated Content (UGC) being shared across social media. Things like in-game screenshots from your favorite video game, architectural or product design simulations in Iray, and the list continues. As you can imagine, the volume of content flowing in our direction can be massive. Especially in the video game world. And in terms of Community Management, a critical component to brand and social marketing, UGC identification, promotion, and nurturing is an essential task that is an ongoing requirement for a healthy community. Since there are thousands of images posted online in any given month by our fans, with peaks around game launches or contests, it is an almost entirely unfeasible ask of community managers to find, tag, store, and develop strategies with this amount of content. In comes AI/Machine Learning. Begin Scenario (hypothetical): On May 2nd, 2017 , a fan named \u201cChristian Johansen\u201d posts on Instagram a picture of the computer he built with his own two hands. It was his first time building a computer, and was extremely proud of his creation. He then spent A LOT of time taking a picture. Click. \u201c@NVIDIAGeForce #nofilter.\u201d Post. Using social media listening technology, companies like NVIDIA \u201clisten\u201d to the constant feed of internet postings looking for any time they are mentioned. We make long Boolean queries that say \u201cGrab any mention of NVIDIA or its products on the internet, and pull it into a report so we can see what people are talking about.\u201d Now, that\u2019s an oversimplification, but that\u2019s essentially what\u2019s happening. That itself isn\u2019t AI, but that\u2019s just where this gets started. Natural Language Processing for Sentiment Analysis: As that \u201cmention\u201d gets pulled into the system, an AI called Natural Language Processing reads the post text and determines its \u201cSentiment.\u201d Sentiment is used to determine if the post is positive, neutral, or negative, (and in some advanced cases, the emotion like \u201canger\u201d \u201csadness\u201d or \u201cjoy\u201d). Doing this manually for every post that comes in isn\u2019t feasible (we see tens of thousands of posts on any given week). AI does this automatically for us, and it can \u201clearn\u201d to improve its NLP Sentiment analysis as more posts pass through it, and as manual adjustments for errors are made. And speaking of Christian\u2019s post, he used the \u201c#nofilter\u201d hashtag which can be assigned a \u201cproud\u201d tag since its basically saying \u201cmy picture was so good, I didn\u2019t need to edit it.\u201d Image Processing, Computer Vision, Object Detection and Recognition: This is where it gets cool. Through computer vision models, we can train a system to identify pictures that contain our products. This takes pictures pulled in from listening queries, passes them through the system to \u201csee\u201d what\u2019s in it, and if it finds one of our GPU\u2019s in it, for example, it will tag the image with the product name in our system. Once that happens, we can set up a rule that says, \u201cIf an image has positive sentiment, ask the poster of that image if we can use it.\u201d So, a message goes to the poster that says \u201cHey Christian! We loved your picture, is it cool if we share it and use it in some of our marketing materials? Reply with #NVIDIAYes or #NVIDIANo.\u201d If he says yes, the system will download the image directly into our digital asset management system within our digital marketing platform, along with all the tags the AI applied and the post and author information as metadata. Now, that\u2019s just one use, but others can be along the lines of crisis management. Like, someone posts a picture of a car fire in the NVIDIA parking lot, the system can pull the image in, identify a fire on our property (based on post location data), and alert our onsite security to respond. So, this can help IDENTIFY, CLASSIFY, and NOTIFY.

I\u2019m Emma, a self-learning technology based on artificial intelligence and machine learning developed to solve the problem of authorship identification using more than 50 mathematical parameters. I\u2019m here to help writers, journalists, literary critics, publishers, lawyers, students and educators, political scientists, historians, and even FBI. Is it too presumptuously? Is that myth, fiction or reality? Give me a go. And you will see. ",
