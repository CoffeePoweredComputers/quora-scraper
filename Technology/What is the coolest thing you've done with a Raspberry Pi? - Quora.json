            "answer_text": "My raspberry pi now has more than 25 times as many followers as me on Twitter!  I have interfaced it to an array of vintage neon display tubes and it acts as a clock and window onto random twitter utterances for my workshop. It is also a twitter bot that will react to the right hashtags and, using the raspberry pi camera module, send back movies or pictures of custom text to any twitter user who can get the command syntax right. I had an idea that it would be interesting to see how people reacted when given such a resource ( no real surprise, the young ones use it mostly to hurl insults and mindlessly repeat \u201cmemes\u201d ) and maybe that the fact that their actions would be open for all to see might elicit more thought before commanding a broadcast of words to all followers\u2026 Evidence would suggest otherwise :) Maybe Quora users can help the signal to noise ratio? There have been some good uses: at least one guy was building up a large lexicon of neon words for some yet to be realised art project recently, I\u2019ve seen a few declarations of undying love and marriage proposals go by too. The pattern of usage is quite interesting as one group will suddenly discover it and things get very busy for a short while . There is a rate limit on how fast an app can post to twitter of about one every 50 seconds, so the queue of requests can quickly hit a point where there is a delay of an hour or more before a user gets a picture back. This tends to cause traffic to drop again until the next interconnected group discover it and so on. To try it out simply post a tweet with the hashtag #NixieBotShowMe followed by a word or a phrase:separated:by:colons and wait and see. Due to its account getting suspended once or twice for automated replies to keywords, you also need to \u201c@mention\u201d nixiebot. It uses twitter\u2019s stream filter API to find all instances of that hashtag. This happens astonishingly quickly considering the amount of traffic that Twitter must get, I can see a search result pop up on the console almost immediately a tweet is sent, kudos to twitter engineers on that! Full instructions for the many other features I keep adding (did I mention it can give \u201coblique strategy\u201d or \u201cmagic eight ball\u201d answers too?) can be found on it\u2019s tumblr pages: NixieBot The source is free to browse, grab and modify on github: Zedsquared/NixieBot it\u2019s a big old pile of python that has no pretense to structure any more so you have been warned! It uses the Twython library to access twitter and is running under the command line only version of raspbian Jessie. The tubes are Burroughs B7971 nixies from the early 1960\u2019s and were once used as stock ticker displays. The camera is mounted using these handy camera to HDMI cable adapters from Tindie: https://www.tindie.com/products/freto/pi-camera-hdmi-cable-extension/ Some more hardware and software details are now available on Nixiebot\u2019s page on hackaday.io: NixieBot .

            "answer_text": "I don\u2019t know why this question appeared in my feed. But this gave me an opportunity to share something. Not me, but my son did something cool with Raspberry pi. In 2015 our younger granddaughter underwent a tracheotomy, when she was five months baby. I have written about this in detail in my answer Vijaya Lakshmi's answer to What has been the most difficult situation in your life which you finally overcame?. After this surgery, she could not cry. I mean no sound would come out of her mouth. Even if she cried it would be without any sound. So how to monitor her when she was sleeping? Baby monitor with video works but one should constantly watch the monitor. But what if the baby wakes up in the night and cries(without sound)? In such a case oximeter will make no sound. Staying awake through out the night for two years even by taking turns was impractical. So that time my son got this idea. He purchased a Raspberry pi, a mic and a high resolution web camera. Within two days he wrote a code. So whenever the baby makes any movement in her sleep or after waking up, it would give loud signals shouting \u201cBaby is moving\u201d He also attached that Raspberry pi with oximeter. This app would open in any web browser(after logging in) and smart phone. When ever the baby moved, it would give a loud alarm. It detects not only baby\u2019s movements but also abnormalities in oximeter. Everybody in the house either had a laptop or smartphone with them always. So even the slightest movement would alert all of us. We would wait to see if the movement was just a normal movement in sleep or she had woken up from sleep. This equipment along with the app served its purpose really cool for two years. After two years when the trach was removed, son and daughter-in-law donated the equipment to one of local hospitals. Many people advised him to sell that app in the market and make some money. But he was against it. He made the code public. Location of these files is available in the answer I have mentioned above. After 2 years the trach was removed. Now she is the most mischievous chatterbox. ",

            "answer_text": "I used Raspberry Pi for my undergraduate final sem project. Basically I mixed in a bit of Wearable Technology, Computer Vision and the Pi to create an Assistive wearable Low vision device.  The Initial idea was to try and find out which computer vision algorithms actually help people with low vision. Just so a normal vision person can see an algorithm improve the view doesn't mean that a low vision person will experience the same way. We have to test it in Person and take systematic feedback. I thought even if the zoom coupled with contrast sensitivity correction works, it could greatly improve the lives of people with low vision. The things I used for the prototype are as follows: HARDWARE 1)  Vuzix wrap 920 video eyewear : I used this as it was the only good eye wear available at that time. Provides decent field of view and has good control settings. It has audio too, though I didn't use it in this experiment.   2) Raspberry Pi and the Camera Module: The awesome 35$ computer to perform computer vision operations. And the amazingly capable Raspberry Pi camera module which can churn out HQ video with greater than 30 fps. 3) A Mobile Power Bank : A power bank (3500 mAh) to power the whole setup. SOFTWARE 1) OpenCV : I used the python wrapper of OpenCV for the computer vision algorithms. Basic ones like Enhanced Zoom, Histogram equalisation for Contrast sensitivity improvement and some edge detection techniques. The implementation could not be simpler.  1) Get the frames from Pi Camera 2) Process them in the Pi 3) Route the processed feed to Vuzix eyewear I made a quick assembly to test if the idea would work. This was what it looked like :-).   I wore it around my neck with camera at my chest level and experienced it. It was good and working as expected. But to make it ready for testing I had to package it well and make it a bit durable to survive atleast 2 months of testing. After lots of glue, cardboard, soldering and white paper it transformed to this.  I had the great privilege of testing this device in a famous low vision clinic in Chennai, Sankara Nethralaya. Every year thousands of people come here for treatment of their eye diseases. With the help of the friendly passionate staff of SN, I was able to personally test the device with 30 volunteers who suffered from Low vision. Here it is with a test volunteer.    Test ResultsReceived overwhelmingly positive reviews from the volunteers. It's wonderful how a simple algorithm like zoom with minor enhancements could help people so much. I would like to mention one volunteer, a 11 year old girl who has extreme low vision. She normally can see letters only below 2 feet distance. With the help of this device, she was able to read letters which were at 8-10 feet distance very fluently and without facing any difficulty. Her Mother who was there in the room felt very happy. She explained to me how she met many doctors and eye clinics over the years and asked me when this device would be available as a clinical device. I explained to her that it could take a while. She appreciated my effort and it was one of the proudest moments of my life. pic credits(vuzix) : Amazon ",

            "answer_text": "I created my own custom controller for my in-ground sprinkler system. I was never happy with the rain sensor on my RainBird system, and since I already had a custom Arduino-based home weather station that gathers the normal readings (temp, humidity, wind speed, wind direction, rain amount) I decided to build my own sprinkler system controller using my own actual rain amount readings. The software is written with C#.NET WinForms app (running on Mono). The official Raspberry Pi touchscreen is the interface and the sprinkler system solenoids are controlled with a simple bank of 8 relays. The hardware is really pretty straightforward. Right now, though, I'm powering the solenoids separately from the Pi since they run on different voltage. This winter I'm hoping to build a power converter so I'll only need one outlet to power the 24VAC solenoids and the 5VDC Pi. The real work on this piece is the software. There are two main pieces: the client device software and the backing web application. The client app is about what you'd expect. It lets you start and stop the program and test an individual zone. The web app, though, was the fun part. One of my biggest annoyances throughout the year was changing the programming in the spring, then again in the summer when it gets hotter, then backing it off in the fall when it cools down. The web app lets me create multiple different programs (the runtime for each zone), the start time of the program and when it should run. Just as you'd expect for any scheduling software. Additionally, the website lets me stop or stop the entire program or just an individual zone, and since it's a responsive website, it works from my phone, as well. I built the web app so it could technically be used by many people, just as any SaaS service. After creating an account on the website and turning on the client device, the device connects to the website, tries to authenticate and if it can't it gives you a activation code (just like when you'd open Netflix or any TV app on an Apple TV or similar). You log into your account on the web app, put in the activation code, and you're connected. Somebody when it's stabilized I might open it up for use and type up the direction for building a client device. This winter I've got further plans for the whole system. Rather than running a WinForms app on Mono I'm re-writing the app as a UWP app and running it on Win 10 IOT, which should definitely be more stabile than Mono on Raspbian. (I'm a C# developer professionally so it's much easier for me to work on my hobby projects on that platform since I don't have that much free time to begin with.) Additionally, now that Xamarin is free I'm working on an iOS app to control the systems. I'm also planning on getting a 3D printer and designing a more solid case for the whole device. Eventually I plan on taking more than just rain into account when determining when the program should run. I could look at temp, humidity, how windy it was, how sunny it was, or any number of factors. And not only could I tell it to run or not run, but I could have it run a bit longer or shorter depending on those factors. ",

            "answer_text": "Well, looking at the answers I see a lot of innovation. Well I have also tried to exploit the features of raspberry to build out something. I don't know how cool it is, hope it is worth sharing!! :P   I have built a self navigating robot that recognises the environment and moves accordingly. The interesting point here is that I have just used opencv and usb webcam module of the raspberry pi to build the same. The operations happen over a tcp connection  and main opencv computations are done over my laptop as a server. I will split the actions on the basis of scenario. Scenario 1: Firstly I connected my pi with  over wifi with my laptop and through a tcp connection managed to send the command to pi. The command can be send by a keyboard or an audio signal from android. Command can be like \"go to kitchen\" or \"kitchen\" or \"dining table\"  The video below shows how to enter the command:    Scenario 2: Here goes the video for the movement of the pi over to the target for the command \"kitchen\". I have also put the feature to notify me about the whereabouts of the robot. It's done over the UDP socket service.     Theory behind the project: Through this project I made a small step forward in the field of AI using IOT. I loved how machines worked synchronously. I loved when I saw the machine moving in the right direction. Through this project I was amazed that what a great thing opencv is. You can extract such features right from the open source things. It's just amazing isn't it. Talking in technical terms, I used the concepts of surf and sift key point extraction and training my server to define a path for my pi. I used opencv surf objects to train the server about is environment and used TCP connection to stream the surroundings to my system over the camera. The stream of environment that the machine received were compared to images on which I trained the machine, and it returned a flag bit that was again passed to the pi to decide its path. The analysis generated by the flann matcher gave an educated perspective to decide the path of the pi. Talking about the project,   there are some assumptions I  made.  Some of them are: Agent is aware of only right direction of world, so if the object lies on its left side, then it has to rotate in its initial position to cover the same which is just not optimised.Due to slow connection problems (of course due to unnecessary tcp overheads) it may lead to timeout and failed results. Use of protocols such as CoAp, UDP for IOT should have been usedLightening factor is always an issue. Environment variation of training and testing also plays a major role to define the result.The android app I talked about, well it has a service class in it which helps me notify as soon as the robot reaches its target. The app contains feature of handling voice queries and facial recognition to suggest the person according to him. The project inspires suggestion to user on the basis of location and user specification.For instance, in kitchen it would suggest you something to cook, but what to cook depends on person to person and hence the facial recognition. I don't know if this is cool or not, but it certainly helped me to make an initiative to program my own Jarvis kind of machine and feel like a iron man. :P   Here are the sources of my project. rishav2708/self-navigating-robot   To read about feature matching through opencv in python have a look at :  http://docs.opencv.org/3.0-beta/doc/py_tutorials/py_feature2d/py_matcher/py_matcher.html   ",

            "answer_text": "Going down the memory lane. Just after graduating when I was looking for a job. I spent my extra hours developing insane things. So, during all of this, I found the cheapest possible way to build a home automation system. I know you must be thinking just another home automation. People misinterpret the word automation. Automation means it should always operate on its own without any human effort or direction. I had 3 objectives: The lights should turn on when I am in the room and should turn off when I am not. (Should Also have the ability to understand how many people are present in the room. Lights should remain off when no person is present in the room).To control the room temperature only when a person is present in the room.Have the ability to control instruct raspberry pi manually through Wi-Fi.This is what my setup comprised of. Red Laser, LDR, IR Sensor, IR Emitter, Temperature Sensor, Relays, Analogue to Digital Converter and a Raspberry. The most important task for me was to implement the first task successfully without buying an expensive motion sensor. So, this is the solution I came up with; I installed two Red Lasers along with two LDR in parallel at the beginning of the room just before the door. I recorded the pattern of which Laser was interrupting first to determine if the Lights should turn on or not. The same method was used to count how many people are coming in and how many are going out. Relays were used as a switch to change the state of lights from ON to OFF and vice versa. Now, for the second task, I used IR Sensor to decode the instructions of AC remote control. Then I used IR Emitter to transmit particular instructions to AC. I used a temperature sensor along with the state of the relay to automate AC. And finally. built a mobile app to set up and change default states of every single component. So, did you like it? :) ",

            "answer_text": "I had an event in my office and I was in the organizing committee and one of my task was to aware the other employees about the event. After rejecting a lot of small and big ideas I came across an advertisement on youtube, in the video there was a billboard in a metro(underground) station with a picture of a beautiful model, but the moment any train enters the station the model\u2019s image come alive and all her hairs starts waving, as if she is actually standing in front of the train. Initial Billboard:  When a train enters:  With this idea in mind, I though of making a similar billboard for my event. So the plan was, I will ask the organizing team to record a short video in which initially everyone would be just standing and chit chatting with one another and in another video they would just start jumping with a big banner with our event name somewhat like this:  So this entire thing would be put on a big 100+ inch TV Screen installed at the entrance gate, initially the video of people chit-chatting would be played, but as soon as someone walk across the TV, my PIR sensor would detect the movement and the video of people jumping with banner would be played. After some time of inactivity the initial video would be played again. With a week of sleepless night I finally made a prototype with Iron man test - flying scene. Here is the video:  In this video, Iron man is just standing and trying to fly, But as soon as I move my hands the sensor detects my gesture and the video with Iron Man flying starts playing. And if there is no movement, the Iron Man lands back. Though it looks little simple, but there were lot of complications involved with making video continuous. And this entire POC was made with client-server mechanism. So I had made a small server and a website which was keep looking for change in service response and act accordingly. Though i was unable to to present it for the event, but it is still one of my favorite project apart from small and big Home Automation projects like, controlling lights by Alexa, automatic plant watering system, anti theft alarm system which only works at night, and a cool alarm which will only stops if you stand and dance(continuous movement) for 5 mins :p ",

            "answer_text": "Designed a HAT and built a control unit for a Monotype composition caster. See, back in the 20th century there was this old technology named \u201chot metal typesetting\u201d which allowed to compose texts for printing (which still ran on lead type) much quicker than manually. Two most common systems were Linotype (which assembled matrices in a row, then cast a slug of lead) and Monotype (which cast whole pages of text composed of single sorts). The Monotype used two machines. The compositor worked on a typesetting machine (\u201ckeyboard\u201d) which coded the text and all typographic decisions (justification, kerning, single or multiple columns, formulae, accented characters etc.) to a perforated paper tape (\u201cribbon\u201d) which was basically a 31-channel parallel interface. The ribbon was then put on the casting machine (\u201ccomposition caster\u201d). Different combinations of holes, or a lack thereof, addressed the matrices in the matrix case, put the ready line out to the galley, etc. The machine read the tape by passing compressed air through the holes in the ribbon, and then directing it through a network of copper tubes into three assemblies (\u201cpin blocks\u201d), where miniature pistons were raised and lowered, blocking the movement of certain mechanical parts (the machine has a few thousands of moving parts, some of which are made with a precision of single or even fraction of a micron). The problem is that the machines see some sort of a revival for fine printing and letterpress typography, but the factory has been defunct since 1980s, so spare parts are very hard to get. Our museum has a keyboard, but can\u2019t operate it without the parts that translate the keypresses into different combinations of holes in the ribbon. Plus the ribbon itself is already expensive as there is probably a single place in the world that makes it. So, computer control. The device has 32 solenoid valves (4 8-channel valve blocks from Matrix, Italy - model BX 758) and an opto sensor coupled with the machine itself (it needs to know when to let the air in and cut the flow). It\u2019s connected to a 24VDC power supply, Ethernet LAN and compressed air input. It has a special connection block that attaches where the perforated tape readout normally takes place. I made three units up till now, not counting early prototypes and proofs of concept. The first prototype was based on a RPi B rev. 2 and built on a perfboard; everything later used B+ / 2B / 3B and a HAT controlling 32 outputs at 24VDC (basically, two MCP23017s and four ULN2803s as the output drivers). See it in one of my photo galleries: Type foundry at Book Art Museum, Lodz, PL The hardware design is stable and pretty simple; software is where I\u2019m struggling a bit\u2026 I have two separate programs (rpi2caster - a typesetting/casting utility that runs on anything that supports Python 3.5, and rpi2casterd - a machine control daemon that runs on the Raspberry and exposes a REST API for communicating with the utility), still not released. I host the code at elegantandrogyne/rpi2caster (typesetting/casting utility) and elegantandrogyne/rpi2casterd (machine control daemon). I was thinking about telling MagPi about the project\u2026 ",

I had the complete weather graph for more than an year and it was a very interesting thing to see. But now that is lost, I do not see the benefit in setting it again. As per multiple blogs, that i went through, SD cards have a very small life cycle with limited read and write capabilities. And logging data every 1 minute and indexing it continuously for more than an year crashed it. So, i am now using it as a simple file server - torrent box and to access the home network from outside.

I downloaded the \u201craspi-sump\u201d code for it (I take zero credit for the actual sump pump monitoring, I just followed the instructions on github) which monitors the sump water level and sends out an alert if it gets too high. I added a camera to it to take pics every 5 min and to create a time lapse mp4. I have a separate pi that monitors line voltage and if it detects a power outage, it will sent out an email / text alert as well as attach the last pic taken. The time lapse video is uploaded to google docs every hour so I can see how fast the water level is rising so I have an idea how much time I have to get home before my basement starts turning into a swimming pool. I put two raspberry pi\u2019s to work at our firehouse. They are essentially in kiosk mode and open up to a specific web page which displays a subscription service we subscribe to.. the pi / site displays fire call information.. who is going to what firehouse and the location of the call on a map. It gives the people coming to the call a quick glance where it is and who is coming. Planned projects - For the spring, a pi that monitors the soil and waters as necessary for a vegetable garden we plan on building. I also have a ham radio project to use a pi zero w and a SDR receiver for a remote receive antenna for some specific radio bands. ",

The files were cut on my CNC machine. Due to time constraints and cut path layer confusion, I used a hobby knife to cut the frame. Cutting access ports in the frame with a hobby knife. Cutting through layers of plywood. Test fitting. Trying on the top cover. A bit from the top of the frame has to be cut out too. It fits! Cutting in the rest of the components. Frame with all cuts complete. Looking good on this side. This side looks good too. I later found out this was far too much foam tape. Measuring for the SD card slot. My DIY drill level looks ghetto but it worked great. Clearing out the SD card slot with a coping saw. Smoothing out the SD slot with a strip of sand paper. Everything fits nicely! Almost ready for the top frame. It took a bit of sanding to get the LCD to fit correctly. Finally got it sitting flush into the frame. Everything fits! Time to stain. All hardware was removed for finishing. The carbon fiber backing was glued into place. A nice bead of glue. Final component installation. Notice the missing Ethernet and USB port? The completed setup running RaspBMC (the touchscreen driver doesn\u2019t work in RaspBMC.) ",

It can help the user in doing simple tasks like checking mail inbox, time, weather conditions etc. as well as complex tasks like computing arithmetic problems, searching Wikipedia and face recognition for security at home.  The project has features pertaining to information, entertainment and security. The user can check his Gmail for unread messages, ask the current time and calculate basic arithmetic problems using just voice commands. In addition to this, the system can search Wikipedia for any term that the user asks, and gives the results through voice only. The user can also entertain himself by telling the system to play music from his playlist in both normal and shuffled manner. For security, the system can click a picture through the webcam, and detect the face in the image. It further processes the face and tells whether the person is a friend or stranger. It does so by matching the face to a set of faces, already stored and labelled as friends in the system. OpenCV and normalized cross-correlation has been used for face detection and matching. It can help the visually impaired to connect with the world by giving them access to Wikipedia, Calculator, Email and Music all through their voice. The voice controlled calculator can be used for visually impaired students in primary school. The prototype can also keep people secure as it can be used as a surveillance system which captures the face of the person standing at the door, and tells the owner whether the visitor is a known person or not.

Next, put a long metal pin/wire [this will be the antenna] and hold it to the GPIO-4 pin in the Raspberry Pi board. Test: [Receiver Configuration] You just need a radio receiver [I used my phone] , and tune it to FM band 103.3 and keep adjusting the antenna until you hear the sound being broadcast and you get a awesome feel of the power of Raspberry Pi.

I bring my Pi because my laptop is not that portable. I can only cool it with this fan and it requires a power outlet and my battery died too. So I need to carry a keyboard, mouse, charger, fan etc.Right now I installed prota os to an SD card and using it for simple things that controlled by Google assistant. For example i say \u201cHey pi play music\u201d and it plays music in USB and that USB is accessible from every computer in network. We can transfer songs to it without plugging it out. Also it can execute scripts or commands in remote computers. For example i can say \u201cshut down my computer\u201d to my Google assistant and it powers off my computer. This is my computer.

You know, considering the fact that I got an RPi after doing a lot of research (loads and loads), it was basically extremely hard for me to decide what to do with it. I, by the way, am a young 15 year old and don\u2019t own much stuff so I couldn\u2019t create any accessory for anything as well. I looked at many options and finally on the final list were: A Raspbian running P.C. A Personal Assistant A Retro-gaming console And the most eccentric and difficult to make, A SATNOGS! (About ) I was really confused and I thought of making it all together. So I did. I created a basic device, An RPi, a Waveshare 5\u2033 display, a mouse-keyboard set ,a controller and a lot of 16 GB Micro-SD cards. On one, Raspbian, on another, the P.A. program, and on the other one Retropie. It was a very good plan and it worked! I could get anything I wanted to use anytime and I created a kind of case to store all the cards together. So it was a good creation and extremely useful and impressive too! P.S.- I later bought a power bank so now its a +1 for portability! Thank you for the question, and hope you liked my answer. ",

I found a tutorial of a person who's built Alexa's replica using C.H.I.P so I followed it to build on Pi. Although I didn't had to code it took a lot of time for me debug errors. Finally when successful it was really cool. It was taking my voice input through mic attached to pi through sound dongle. The pi would process it and give output via speaker attached to pi through sound dongle. I tried all things possible with regular Alexa and it worked perfect. ",

My wife's parents are in their late 70s and are very involved in politics and have become target to hundreds of scam and sales calls to the point that their home phone was annoying to the max and they had fallen for a couple scams and were taken for some money. I built a Pi project that used a USB modem and listens for caller ID information. I built a job that sends the log entries for the calls to an api I built on my cloud based web server and in that same job, retrieves updates and then modifies the whitelist and blacklist and restarts the daemon when the lists are updated. I built a web interface for my father and mother in law to log in to and edit the block list or mark annoying numbers as bad or whitelist numbers that got blocked. When they click save the update flag is up and waiting on the Pi to check in and retrieve the data.  An update from my father in law two months later is that no bad calls have gotten through and they feel much more at peace now without their phone ringing off the hook. Big win!  ",

Fast-forward two years, as a senior, I worked on two very interesting projects using Raspberry Pi Model 3 B+. The first project was a 12-DOF bipedal robot that would do basic maneuvers and walk crookedly. For me, it was the first time I was using all the capabilities that this amazing device offered. I used the GPIO pins, sensing capabilities, UI and communication interfaces to get the project working. I think it was basically a hack to use the Pi board instead of a more real-time application suitable microcontroller, but I am glad things worked pretty satisfactorily in the end. My second project was a smart animatronic humanoid face that we built, inspired by Sophia robot from Hanson Robotics. This project was another great experience that I explored several concepts of programming, robotics, controls and machine learning.PS - Links to the complete project webpages WELCOME - AKSHAY KUMARThe Smart Animatronic FaceI hope you like it.

I later tweaked it to turn devices on when the temperature crossed a certain limit.  \u200b   \u200b I am certainly not stopping there. I'm working on adding illumination controls, so I can set the lights to go on automatically when it starts getting dark. Another cool idea is to throw in a few motion sensors and have it let me notify my activity in various rooms, though I doubt whether my parents would approve of that! It was a great week, and I'll probably write a neat blog post explain how to do it yourself. I'm sure it's not that complicated, but I think it'll help a lot of beginners get started. ",

Dusk, of course, occurs at different times over the year, while bedtime can be set to, say, 10:30pm. I designed, built and programmed (with some purchased help & coaching from an Upwork expert) a Raspberry Pi to be that controller. It also hosts a website (via Tornado/nginx) that I can reach from my house\u2019s network, which lets me (a) force the lights on, (b) force the lights off, or (c) automatically control the lights. Once per minute, my \u201cpispi\u201d program wakes up, compares the current time to today\u2019s dusk and bedtime values, and acts accordingly. Didn\u2019t break any new tech ground, and doesn\u2019t cause the Pi to even break an electronic sweat in terms of workload, but it was fun to do and I learned a lot. Here\u2019s a picture of it in action. (Admittedly it\u2019s not that pretty in this photo \u2014 it\u2019s been hanging outdoors for about a year now.)  ",

The Raspberry Pi is connected to 4 motion sensors on all 4 sides of the house and to a solid state relay that controls the lights.     The code checks sunset and sunrise using a REST Web Service and during the daylight hours everything is off. For the first 3 hours after sunset the lights are on and through the rest of the nighttime hours the lights are triggered by the motion control sensors. Sunrise and sunset varies a lot in Sweden due to time of the year. The project is running outdoors in a waterproof box. Pretty simple overall. Tried it first in Python but the thread behaviour pretty weird so I moved to Java. ",

Even needles were connected to ground. The pi could then detect a water drop falling through the top sensor and the bottom sensor and use the formula Gravity acceleration=1/2A*(seconds)^2 Display on a monitor so the whole class can see the calculation after the water drop hit the second sensor. It was easy, it was cheap, and the prof said it was better than very expensive stuff that the school could have bought. Now that Wolfram gives you a Mathematica license there is a ton of stuff you can easily do on a mathematica worksheet to make really slick lab demonstrations for chemistry or physics even when you have to do a little calculus.

(A personal assistant) You will create an application with wolfram alpha, Google voice recognition API and Google TTS (text to speech) API. And just search in google, you will get a number of useful links on how to build it.  Apart from that, you'll need a SD card, external power, USB microphone, external speaker and an ethernet cable (or a wifi usb). It depends on the capabilities of Wolfram alpha.  A sample transcript of our conversation:  Its more fun and informative! One thing to note here is it was better than Siri in understanding my accent. I tested my voice on both of them simultaneously. But I do know that Siri does more than just answering, like assisting you in every other applications on the iPhone. What more, is you can go on and build something more of an Q & A machine which can process your question (based on NLP), retrieve information from the web and answers you, more like a factoid Q & A system. BTW, I am still reading. ",

So that I used HOSTAPD service which configures RPi into hotspot with static IP as well as developed one simple webpage . Whatever I write on that Webpage will get written into \u2018/etc/wpa_supplicant/spa_supplicant.conf\u2019 which usually contains WIFI SSID and PASSWORD with specific format. After this RPi will reboot. After boot-up Rock and Roll, Your Raspberry Pi connected to Your Router.

In the 80's and 90's people loved to tinker and design new things. Unfortunately this has been lost on today's generations.  The people over at Raspberry Pi thought up a clever solution to this problem and built a small computer that can fit in your pocket, that is also capable of using Linux based code to do just about anything.  Some popular raspberry pi projects are making personal arcade machines and video game consoles and other projects include things like making code locks. Some really cool creations have been automatic pet feeders and whether monitoring systems. However the potential of the raspberry pi is only limited by your imagination! Hope this helps! ",
