            "answer_text": "Assuming you have a 3\u20134 year old cpu, the new CPU architectures that give you better performance with a lower power usage. You get more cores and hyper threading (hyper threading means if your CPU has 4 cores, you will have 4 virtual cores for a total of 8 cores) so all in all, better performance and more cores with a lower power usage. There is a downside to getting a brand new CPU if you are coming from old hardware. If you want an i7 6700k you have to get a socket 1151 motherboard and you will have to get DDR4 ram, so if you are coming from old hardware it is much more then just a CPU, if you are buying a CPU that is in the same family as your old one, my first statements apply.

It equips 159Wh battery and support me to work over 10 hours under light load. It weighs 2.3kg like. Now, I upgraded to ThinkPad X270, the best battery life laptop in 2017, 95Wh battery. It holds up to 15hours under light load and produce much less heat. CPU: 2540M VS 7300U, both were high-end vPro Dual Processor. Time change things. Just upgrade. ",
