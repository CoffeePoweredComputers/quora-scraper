            "answer_text": "Thank you for the A2A. This is actually a very good/interesting question, despite the disrespect from some previous respondents. Because arguably, if it weren\u2019t for the huge influence from Tang Dynasty through the \u9063\u5510\u4f7f\uff08\u3051\u3093\u3068\u3046\u3057/Kent\u014dshi\uff09missions, Japan may not have established a centralized government as quickly. And a lot of Japanese \u201cofficial\u201d garb from the times before, including what ended up as kimono, probably came from Tang Dynasty. Last but not least, we would not have as much Buddhism! At the time Tang Dynasty started in 618 AD, Empress Suiko (\u63a8\u53e4\u5929\u7687 Suiko-tenn\u014d) was the monarch of Japan. She (yes, she) was the 33rd empress/emperor from 592\u2013628; she was the first of eight women to take on the role of empress regnant. (She lived until 74\u201375, which seems impressive for that time.) After Empress K\u014dken (\u5b5d\u8b19\u5929\u7687 K\u014dken-tenn\u014d, reign 749\u2013758 & 764\u2013770), the sixth female tenn\u014d, there wasn\u2019t another empress for 859 years, until Empress Meish\u014d (\u660e\u6b63\u5929\u7687 Meish\u014d-tenn\u014d, reign 1629-1643). So one could also suspect Tang Dynasty\u2019s influence might have been a patriarchal one (likely due to the Confucian leadership influence, and not because of Buddhism). Japan\u2019s Asuka period (\u98db\u9ce5\u6642\u4ee3 Asuka jidai, 538\u2013710), both overlapping and somewhat preceding Tang Dynasty, was a period of artistic, social, and political transformations, largely affected by the arrival of Buddhism from China. This is when the country/region changed its name from Wa (\u502d) to Nihon (\u65e5\u672c), with its government becoming much more centralized. Before then, the area was in a state of constant flux. What existed was Yamatai-koku (\u90aa\u99ac\u53f0\u56fd) , which is the Sino-Japanese name of an ancient country in Wa (Japan) during the late Yayoi period (BC 300-300 AD). During that time the most successful ruler in the country was Himiko (\u5351\u5f25\u547c, 170\u2013248 AD), a shaman queen of Yamatai-koku. Prior to that there was a 70\u201380 year period of reign by male kings, and after much infighting, they decided on making Himiko the queen. But it wasn\u2019t as though the country was united - it was 30 or so separate regions. Following that, during the Asuka period, Empress Suiko\u2019s nephew, the infamous Prince Sh\u014dtoku (\u8056\u5fb3\u592a\u5b50 Sh\u014dtoku Taishi) , was instrumental in establishing a centralized government. He is credited with promulgating a Seventeen-article constitution, and was an ardent Buddhist. So he is responsible for spreading Buddhism as well. Historians have noted that prior to Himiko\u2019s rule, Japan had sent diplomatic missions to the Western Han commandery in Lelang, Northern Korea, in order to gain recognition, but back then Japanese missions to Chinese dynasties and kingdoms were spaced out over centuries, possibly due to turmoil back home, as stated in the following: \u201cWa diplomats, however, never called on China on a regular basis. A chronology of Japan-China relations from the first to the ninth centuries reveals this irregularity in the visits of Japanese ambassadors to China. There were periods of frequent contacts as well as of lengthy intervals between contacts.\u201d \u201cThe earliest written records about people in Japan are from Chinese sources from this period.  The golden seal said to have been granted to the \"King of Wa\" by Emperor Guangwu of Han in 57 CE. It is inscribed \u201cKing of Na of Wa in Han Dynasty\u201d (\u6f22\u59d4\u5974\u570b\u738b). Wa, the Japanese pronunciation of an early Chinese name for Japan, was mentioned in 57 AD; the Na state of Wa received a golden seal from the Emperor Guangwu of the Later Han Dynasty. This event was recorded in the Hou Han Shu compiled by Fan Ye in the 5th century. The seal itself was discovered in northern Ky\u016bsh\u016b in the 18th century.[13] Wa was also mentioned in 257 in the Wei zhi, a section of the San Guo Zhi compiled by the 3rd century scholar Chen Shou.[14]\u201d definition of Yayoi period and synonyms of Yayoi period (English) It's, thus, sound to conclude that there were some significant contacts between Japan and China prior to the Tang Dynasty and that Chinese scholars were prominent in having recorded early Japanese contacts. Although \u9063\u5510\u4f7f\uff08Kent\u014dshi\uff09missions are most famous since they lasted for nearly 200 years, it\u2019s not as though Empress Suiko (\u63a8\u53e4\u5929\u7687) did not interact with China prior to Tang Dynasty. She was known as a very fair ruler who allowed \u8056\u5fb3\u592a\u5b50 (Sh\u014dtoku Taishi) to flourish, and she had her own missions (\u9063\u968b\u4f7f/kenzuishi) to Sui Dynasty, hoping for them to recognize Japan\u2019s legitimacy as a country. She sent exchange students along with the mission, just like \u9063\u5510\u4f7f. She is also responsible for building H\u014dry\u016b-ji (\u6cd5\u9686\u5bfa) temple, as she was as much of an advocate for Buddhism as \u8056\u5fb3\u592a\u5b50 (Sh\u014dtoku Taishi) . During the Asuka period, nobles ate \u53e4\u4ee3\u7c73 (\u3053\u3060\u3044\u307e\u3044/\u201cancient rice\u201d):  A typical aristocrats\u2019 meal had things like snapper, abalone, cheese (\u8607/so - cow milk was introduced during this period) etc., and sometimes they were said to get too much nutrition, resulting in lifestyle disease.  Source: yamatoji.nara-kankou.or.jp A typical commoners\u2019 meal: Brown rice, salt, seaweed soup, and maybe some boiled vegetables. This hadn\u2019t changed much since the preceding Yayoi period; it was basically \u201c\u4e00\u6c41\u4e00\u83dc\u201d (one soup one vegetable); sometimes people fainted from malnutrition. Due to the influence of Buddhism, animal meat was often prohibited.

It\u2019s interesting to know how normal people lived during that time period, too, partly because some of the most gorgeous Buddhist buildings and sculptures were constructed around this period. As with many societies around the world, resources were not well-distributed. EDIT: Thank you, Vikraant Singh, for edits and addition of a few paragraphs regarding Japan\u2019s contact with China prior to Tang Dynasty, about records and the golden seal. ",
