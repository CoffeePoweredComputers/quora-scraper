            "answer_text": "The Roman Republic and later Empire controlled a massive amount of territory. At its height, people living deep in Roman lands wouldn't have to worry about a lot of the issues that contemporaries dealt with, like sustinance farming, warfare, and banditry. This gave people time to stop worrying about dieing and instead focus on creating things. With a history stretching over centuries, we definatly should expect that the Romans would have invented stuff. Many inventions were the result of practicality, and a want to improve daily life, such as improved roads and bridges, aqueducts, and sturdy buildings. The Romans were also able to piggyback off the worlds most technologically advanced civilization before them, the Greeks, borrowing and improving what they started. With a large span of history, a stable and safe life for many romans, and a Greek tech precedent, there was a lot of opportunity for creating new technologies. ",
