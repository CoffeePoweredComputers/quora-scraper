            "answer_text": "Google\u2019s assets and infrastructure would simply be sold off. Much of what Google owns now was originally separate companies, and if Google somehow went bankrupt or got broken up in the near future, I envision a scenario along these lines\u2026 YouTube gets sold to Amazon, since they have experience with Prime Video and Twitch.Android gets sold to Microsoft, since they have experience competing with Apple, doing Surface hardware, and licensing operating systems to third-party hardware manufacturers.The Chromium open source project continues on without Google, perhaps with a foundation along the lines of the Mozilla Foundation to coordinate things. A lot of people have a vested interest in continuing Chromium development for their own business purposes. People probably switch to Microsoft Edge, Vivaldi, or Brave.AT&T acquires Google\u2019s core search, advertising, and e-mail business, claiming they need it to counter Verizon\u2019s Oath (old AOL/Yahoo/Netscape) acquisition. You may notice little difference at first except a small AT&T copyright notice in the corner when you visit Google\u2019s website.Google Fiber is likely acquired by Verizon, since they would be getting brand-new fiber in very desirable service areas without legacy assets, though there would be a big fight among telcos for those assets.Widevine and reCaptcha might be sold to IBM, because they\u2019re focusing a lot on AI and security lately.In theory, it sounds horrifying to imagine life without Google because everyone imagines all those services disappearing overnight. In practice, when companies go out of business, their assets get purchased and other companies continue operating their infrastructure, often under the same brand name for a while. If the transition goes smoothly, customers may barely even notice the change of ownership. There\u2019s precedent for this kind of thing and there would be a lot of effort to keep all this infrastructure going during a transfer of power. ",

The one thing that will happen for sure is finding things in a more organised way will be hard as other services are some what behind Google on that, it will be very easy to switch to other email systems, and I am sure that not much people will miss the Google+ or the Google  Translate, Google Drive will be very easily replaceable by dropbox, onedrive and such but the data stored will be lost as they this service would be stopped. The one and the most important thing that will happen is that sharing videos will not be the same never again with YouTube going out with Google. They have almost perfected the art of sharing videos and it will be hard for other services to offer what Google has been giving the users. As regards android, since it is free, the development would surely be taken up by some big corporations as they are sure about the profit returns, the community will be effected to some extend as there will or might be a change in the policy of using android but I am sure Android will grow with out Google supporting it. The profit of numerous services based on Google will fall or they might need to close down, those people who live with the Ads revenue from ADwords will have to change their earning methods. It is silly to even think of something like this as Google will be the first or will surely be involved in making the first AI that human race will encounter, the company have grown out of the stage of being stopped, they are on an spree of buying out companies, till date Google have bought more than 100 Companies that do things which we cannot even associate with Google.

            "answer_text": "If Google suddenly shut down for good it would take many businesses with it. Even though Bing provides similar services, the sites that rank well on Google often rank poorly on Bing. Entire businesses would suddenly find they'd lost nearly all of their revenue. As if losing Google search wouldn't be bad enough, losing AdWords / AdSense would be crushing for many publishers who rely on that revenue, and marketers who rely on that marketing channel. Sudden sharp drops in revenue would force a vicious cycle of firings, defaults on payments, and bankruptcies. Ironically I think the biggest winners would be SEO / SEM professionals who would suddenly be in enormous demand as companies scrambled to recoup some of their losses by trying to make the most of increased opportunities on Bing and elsewhere.

Might be due to bad luck or bad there is downtime for certain period of time for Google website. Actually I am 200 % sure that they already taken care of this type of situation and they have definitely backup plan for this situation. If they found main DNS name server is not able to pick request they will redirect all traffic some other name server. Also I believe they have world best site reliability team which make sure high availability and performance of Google server. In case if this happen, lot of things will be affected from the world. We even can not imagine this type of situation for 30 sec. also. Few countries have their own search engine. So people will use that search engine. Lot of things will happen if this kind of situation happen. People hit Google website to check whether their Internet is working or not? :) ",

Something new which could fulfill the need already created by search engines in a much better manner. Something which can read your mind and provide you answers without the help of a machine or hardware probably. I guess Google might re invent but not shut down. Nothing which keeps pace with changing needs or is able to create need in people of what it has to offer, ever shuts down But if it does, due to some unforeseen event, life would move on, people would find newer alternatives of information channel and would adapt though with a bit of difficulty initially. Definitely human beings are much bigger than Google Facebook etc..We make them, they don't make us. ",
