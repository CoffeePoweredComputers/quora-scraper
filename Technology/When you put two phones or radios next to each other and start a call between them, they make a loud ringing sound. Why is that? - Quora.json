            "answer_text": "Sounds like you\u2019re referencing an audio/acoustic feedback loop happening. It\u2019s most commonly noted when a microphone is forward of speakers. And you get that squealing sound. What\u2019s happen\u2019s happening is the sound level from the speakers that are making it into the mic is high enough that it would result in an output of the speakers being even higher than what it was when you were speaking, so the first sound that gets made that would result in this happening, you get the squeal. You can either turn down the volume of the speakers, move the mic, or reduce the gain on the mic. In the case of two phones, you\u2019ve got each with a mic and each with speakers feeding back and they can feed off each other, and it can reach a harmonic based on the delay. ",
