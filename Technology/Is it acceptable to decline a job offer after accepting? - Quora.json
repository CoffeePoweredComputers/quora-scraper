            "answer_text": "It is acceptable- not always advisable, but ultimately, in some cases it has to be done. I\u2019ve done it before, and I\u2019ve hated doing it, but sometimes it is necessary. There are, of course, plenty of valid reasons why someone might do this: 1- You were misled about the nature of the job, what it entails, etc. I\u2019ve quit a job shortly after starting for this reason- the job description and interview stated it would be in one department, and the actual job was in a totally different section with different roles. So as far as I was concerned, they hadn\u2019t kept their side of the bargain, so I wasn\u2019t going to keep mine. 2- Significant changes to your personal circumstances, such as health problems, personal crises, etc, may mean you\u2019re no longer in a position to be able to do the job. It happens, nobody likes it, but sometimes it happens. 3- You\u2019ve been made aware of significant concerns about the employer, the workplace, etc, that weren\u2019t apparent at the time you accepted. Again, seen that before. 4- You\u2019ve got a better offer elsewhere. Ultimately, my view is you don\u2019t owe employers anything other than what the contract you have with them implies. Over time, they may earn your loyalty (or they may not- some are better than others!), but until they do, you do what you have to do. Most employers, for all their talk about valuing their employees, etc, would do the same thing to their employees if it would benefit them. Ultimately, the only person who really has your best interests at heart is you, and you shouldn\u2019t put yourself in a bad situation for an employer, unless they are really going to make it worth your while. Now sure, there are risks with doing this that need to be considered. The biggest, of course, is negative reputation and difficulty getting hired again. This does depend a lot on what the employer is- not all jobs are in closely-linked industries where everyone knows everyone and you\u2019ll get put in some kind of industry blacklist that means you will never work in that field again! Those things do exist and in some fields you do need to worry about them, but it\u2019s not true of every field, and many fields are actually relatively decentralised and these sorts of things don\u2019t exist everywhere. Also keep in mind that what an employer will tell you about the unsalvageable reputation you will get by quitting isn\u2019t always the same as what will actually happen. Anyway, I\u2019d say do it, if there is a valid reason. I wouldn\u2019t do it at the drop of the hat, but if it really becomes necessary, sometimes it has to be done. I did this once, and I\u2019m not proud of it, but I had my reasons. Specifically, the job offer completely misinterpreted the nature of the of the job, and when I first met my supervisor to discuss the nature of the job, he was, quite simply, completely unintelligible- I walked away from that meeting feeling totally bewildered about the nature of the job. I only found out more when a friend of mine who knew about the job heard I was doing it and put me in contact with someone who had recently finished it, who told me a bit more about what it was really like (which wasn\u2019t pretty). Now I\u2019d only accepted this job in particular because at the time, it was the only one I\u2019d gotten out of that recruitment round. However, I got a late-round offer after that, which meant I got another offer, and ultimately I decided to take it. Now sure, the other guy- who by now I\u2019d learned had a reputation for being a very difficult person who routinely got into conflict with others- took the whole thing very personally and made threats that I would get a terrible reputation and never work in his specialty again and blah blah blah (none of which happened, oddly enough). The whole thing was extremely stressful to deal with and I was immensely relived just to walk out of there and never see the guy again\u2026 man, he was a jerk! Anyway. So in that situation, where it would have been truly untenable to stay there, I felt it was worthwhile to pull the trigger and take the risk. The next place I worked at wasn\u2019t too impressed when they found out (the other guy found out who they were and called them to complain), but by just keeping my head down and being a good employee, they forgot about it pretty quickly. That\u2019s the only time I ever really felt the need to do it, and I didn\u2019t enjoy it. On the other hand, after that, I actually saw the odd offer for technically better jobs, but I didn\u2019t apply for them because I was loyal to the place I was at. ",

            "answer_text": "It depends on the situation. There are people who will tell you that it\u2019s unethical.There are people who will tell you do what\u2019s best for you. The truth lies somewhere in the middle. Look, the basic facts of life are this. We live and work in a Capitalist society.Workers are commodities, particularly in STEM roles, but pretty much everywhere now.Accepting a role and backing out after you\u2019ve accepted is totally acceptable. It is all how you approach the discussion. If, after considering the role, you decide that you\u2019ve had a change of heart, better to make that decision now during the acceptance phase then after you\u2019ve quit your current job and started the new one. Most of us are really busy. We don\u2019t often take the time to consider what accepting the job really means. Oftentimes, this realization doesn\u2019t set in until you\u2019re about to give your notice at your current job, or prepare to get mentally and physically ready to start a new role. If there\u2019s ANY doubt in your mind about whether this is the right position, the answer should be NO. Never go into a new role with reservations, or feeling like you need to continue on with the new role ONLY because you have accepted the role. That\u2019s not a good sign. You should NEVER commit to something as important as employment based upon guilt or \u2018trade-offs\u2019. There are lots of legitimate reasons for backing out after accepting a new role. New to the area, and unfamiliar with location and company.Excessive travel commitments, including \u2018super commutting\u2019 (3\u20134+ hrs a day).Contract vs. Permanent roles. No one really wants to be a contingent staff member.Inadequate benefits.Limited or no Paid Time Off.Joining a \u2018project\u2019 vs. joining a team and/or a company.Extensive pressure from Recruiters and Account Executives who are working on commission. If they don't close a sale by hiring you, they don\u2019t make money.Limited / no opportunity for advancement.Money (and this is usually towards the top of the list, but it\u2019s not the most important consideration after a certain level).Ability to be in control of your own destiny.Accountability to family for presence, stability, and enough energy to be available and not be brain dead from work or commute stress.The ability to live a life outside of work.I recently accepted an offer and rescinded my acceptance. I was put under a LOT of pressure by a 3rd party recruiter to make a decision before I was finished with final interviews and offers. I was asked to make a decision before I could asses the opportunities properly. This is, of course, exactly what they were hoping for with an aggressive push to \u2018close\u2019 my candidacy. So I made an initial bad decision by accepting the offer. After multiple offers came in, I had to evaluate them against each other on their own merits. I realized that I had made a big mistake with my commitment. I withdrew my application after 2 days of acceptance. At the same time, the company I agreed to work for made an aggressive push to start me the same week, even after I told them that I already had a job that I hadn\u2019t given notice yet. This was a red flag and my radar was active and making me look at this situation in a different light. In hindsight, it\u2019s clear that this was a tactic to get me to start immediately so that no other offers would be in play. Aggressive sales tactics usually yield very unpredictable results. When I sat down to prepare to give notice with my current employer, and to start to be mentally and logistically ready to take on the new role, what I realized is that I would be signing up for a 4+ hour daily commute each day. I was new to the area, and didn\u2019t understand the time commitment involved in the travel back/forth to work. In hindsight, the recruiter and account executives both knew what I was committing to in terms of travel. They also knew that this wasn\u2019t a viable work commute. No one in their right mind would sign up for that unless they had no other alternatives. They pushed to \u2018close\u2019 the sale because that\u2019s the business that they\u2019re in. I realized that there was no possible way that I could support that kind of commute. The next morning I sent e-mail and explained that I wasn\u2019t able to accept the role and would be backing out. The blowback from the account executive was initially very strong. When I agreed to speak with her on the phone, things settled down. I explained that an aggressive \u2018close\u2019 on my candidacy really was a disservice to all concerned parties. If I took the role, I\u2019d just end up quitting after a short time. No one could sustain that kind of daily commute. It was a Lose/Lose situation. I would lose my existing job, lose my new job and be unemployed. The client employer would lose the resource that they desperately wanted, and the recruiter and account executive would lose the revenue. In all likelihood I\u2019d end up burning multiple bridges, including my own, in the process. We agreed to let the acceptance fail. They were not happy, but it\u2019s my choice. There are sometimes circumstances that are beyond candidate\u2019s control that result in backing out of an accepted offer. Aggressive sales and closing tactics by AE\u2019s and Recruiters can yield very unpredictable results. For them, they just want to put an approved body in a chair so that they can pick up commissions and residuals. Good recruiters, account executives and hiring managers know that it\u2019s not just about the sale. They will provide you the time that you need to make the best decision for your own needs and circumstances. If it results in you not accepting the offer, they\u2019re generally ok with that too. People come and go from companies every day. It's a huge risk to force someone to take on a role that they aren\u2019t comfortable with, for whatever reason. Good managers know that a single bad hire can ruin a team. It\u2019s up to each person to evaluate their own needs and risk tolerance. Backing out of an acceptance is totally OK. It\u2019s your life, your family, your money that\u2019s riding on this decision. Honor has nothing to do with that. You can\u2019t eat cheap nobility. ",
