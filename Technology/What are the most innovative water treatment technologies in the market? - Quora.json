            "answer_text": "One of the most fascinating and innovative methods that come to mind involve replicating the ecological services provided by wetlands. While one may not consider the use of plants as a technology per se it is a process that has served us for millennia that we are only just beginning to understand and incorporate into our towns and cities.  Professor of urban design and landscape architecture at MIT, Alan Berger researches restructuring of local ecosystems to perform ecological services. One example of a restoration project is a partnership between his company P-Rex (http://www.theprex.net/) and regional officials of Lazio in the provence of Lativa, Italy to use restored wetlands to clean up the Pontine Marshes. http://web.mit.edu/newsoffice/2010/italy-water-0407.htmlAlan Berger - Systemic Design (c) Can Change the World The conventional way of dealing with the problem would be to build water treatment plants that cover nearly 300 sq. miles. The solution proposed by Alan Berger would require just under one sq. mile of restored wetland using winding channels, slowing down the water speed to less than a mile an hour, to clean up the toxins in the Pontine Marshes. What's novel about these constructed wetlands as opposed to similar systems is that the end result is a beautiful landscape that can provide economic as well as ecological value to the surrounding area. To answer Aseem's question, the plants that are often used for water purification are Typhas and Phragmites (cattails and the common reed), which are invasive species. With a shift to promoting biodiversity, companies will use up to 200 species suited to all climate types and often include plants indigenous to the area. Other plants include Yellow Iris (Iris pseadacorus), Simplestem Bur-reed (Sparganium erectum), Water Soldier (Stratiotes aloides),  European Frogbit (Hydrocharis morsus-ranae), European White Waterlily (Nymphaea alba), and Eurasian Water-milfoil (Myriophyllum spicatum) are included. However there's more to it than selecting the right plants. You need to reconstruct and seed a healthy ecosystem which also includes selecting non-predatory fish and supporting bacteria. That way the system will hopefully be sustainable on it's own and more energy can be put into reducing the pollution in the first place. A slightly unrelated but very impressive project is the Sahara Forest Project. Led by Michael Pawlyn, Charlie Paton and Bill Watts, it uses biomimicry to generate fresh water and reverse desertification using greenhouse desalination techniques in combination with concentrated solar power.

            "answer_text": "There are several innovations in technology used for water purification. These filtration methods are effective, affordable, and clean the water in no time. I collated a list of some of the effective and innovative technologies- Ion Exchange water treatment TechnologyUltraviolet Irradiation TechnologyReverse Osmosis (RO)Nano filtrationAdvanced Oxidation andElectro adsorption technologyElectro adsorption technology (EAT) is one of the most effective water purifying process as compared to other methods in the above listing. Methods like UV technology only kills the virus and bacteria while not proving any effect to heavy metals and chemicals. Nano/Micro filtration methods only remove particle based of a certain size. RO allows only pure water molecules to pass through its membranes disallowing any ions and essential minerals. But, EAT offers 5-stage purification process. In the first stage, the filter removes the Sand, Silica, Slit, Dirt, and Dust, next it removes the suspended solids from water. In the later stages, the EAT filter removes the Harmful Bacteria, Virus, and Cysts. And lastly exchange of ions take place, and the specially activated carbon granules remove heavy metals like lead and arsenic and then removes volatile chemicals and pesticides. One product which uses EAT technology and is available in the market is- nkd Pod+ Home - nkd LIFE . The nkd filter is charged by Electro Adsorptive technology for water purification and filtration. Antibacterial technology filters up to 99.9% of contaminants. A layer of pure activated coconut carbon improves tastes, reduces odor and chlorine without stripping the water of its natural minerals. Natural minerals ionize, raise the antioxidant level and slightly alkalizes the water. This filter incorporates technology that was developed by the NASA space program.  The filter in nkdpod+ produces water that is slightly alkaline, ionized and charged with natural antioxidants as found in nature which help combat free-radicals in the body.
