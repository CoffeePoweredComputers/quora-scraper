            "answer_text": "Saving on printer costs starts with the printer itself, but it also pays to educate yourself about what you can do or buy to make it even cheaper to use over time. If you shop carefully, you can save a lot of money and still enjoy high-quality prints. Inkjet Printers  Epson's B-510DN inkjet, with its cheap inks and competitive speed, should make sellers of low-end color lasers worry. It also offers two input trays and automatic duplexing. The rule of thumb with inkjet printers is that the less expensive the printer is, the more the ink will cost you. The rule\u2019s origins lie in ink-cartridge configuration and capacity. Lower-end inkjets might have a configuration with a tricolor cartridge, combining cyan, magenta, and yellow inks into one package. Tricolor cartridges usually end up costing you more, because once a single color runs out, you have to replace all three. Inkjets that offer separate cartridges for each ink put an end to that problem; models that separate the ink tank from the print head can save you even more money. One of the most inexpensive consumer inkjets to run is the $100Canon Pixma iP4700. It has a separate print head and five ink tanks, a full set of which ships with the printer. The pigment black (PGI-221) costs 4.3 cents per page, while each color costs 2.6 to 2.8 cents per page. A four-color page would cost about 12.2 cents. Photo black, used only with images, lasts for 665 4-by-6-inch photos (about 2 cents per photo). On Canon\u2019s own paper, photos were accurate and sharp. Plain paper presented more challenges: Flesh tones appeared excessively pink, for instance, and text was black but slightly fuzzy. This model comes with an automatic duplexer, which can help you conserve paper, as well. The most economical inkjets we\u2019ve tested are business- oriented models. They carry higher price tags but offer high-yield cartridge options, with a lower cost per page compared to standard-size cartridges. As with anything you buy in bulk, make sure that you can use such cartridges in a reasonable period of time. If you print just a few simple pages per day, buying a cartridge that lasts for 1000 pages would be overkill. The $180 HP Officejet Pro 8000 Wireless Printer, for example, comes with one standard input tray and one optional one, plus automatic duplexing and Wi-Fi support. It uses two print heads and separate ink tanks that load easily into a front bay. Among the standard-size supplies, black costs about 2.6 cents per page, and each color about 2.2 cents. A typical four-color page would cost about 9.3 cents. The high-yield cartridges are an even better deal: Black costs about 1.6 cents per page, and each color about 1.9 cents per page. That pegs a normal four-color page at just 7.2 cents. Overall, the Officejet Pro 8000 Wireless produced very good print quality. Text was crisp and suffered virtually no defects, while grayscale graphics showed a level of detail in darker areas that many printers miss. Color images had a rich (albeit somewhat dark) cast that we often see in output from HP printers. Flesh tones tended to be orangey. Last and least (in ink costs) is the recently introduced Ep\u00ad\u00adson B-510DN. This $599 inkjet printer\u2019s consumables are cheaper than those of many lasers we\u2019ve tested. Its standard-size supplies cost 1.3 cents per page for black and 1.4 cents for each color. A full-color page would cost just 5.6 cents. The high-yield colors each cost 0.9 cent per page. Epson offers high-yield and extra-high-yield black inks, priced at 1.2 cents and 0.87 cent, respectively. Built for maximum efficiency, it offers two input trays and automatic duplexing, plus record-breaking speed rivaling that of some lower-end color lasers. Its print quality is very good, too, just fuzzier on plain paper\u2014which is acceptable for text, worse for photos. Snapshot Printers  For the Epson PictureMate Show PM 300 snapshot printer, a 150-print paper/ink pack works out to about 25 cents per print\u2014economical compared with its rivals. Designed simply to print photos at one or more sizes, snapshot printers appeal to convenience, rather than to economy. No longer must you upload images to an online site and wait for them to come back in the mail, or schlep your media card to a local store for one-hour printing\u2014though both of those options cost less per print. Just put your media card into one of the slots, select a few layout or editing options, and out comes a finished print. Most snapshot units print just 4-by-6-inch shots, but Hewlett-Packard sells some models that can print on 5-by-7-inch and 4-by-12-inch paper as well. Among the snapshot printers we\u2019ve reviewed, Epson\u2019s inkjet-based models have the lowest cost per print. Its $150 PictureMate Charm PM 225 and its $300 PictureMate Show PM 300 both ship with a starter ink cartridge that prints up to 20 images. A replacement pack containing a 150-print cartridge and 150 sheets of paper costs $38, which works out to about 25 cents per print\u2014very economical compared with rival units. Both Epsons also produce quite nice-looking prints. Color Laser/LED Printers  With the Kyocera Mita FS-C5300DN, even starter-size toner supplies last many thousands of pages. The separate photoconducting drums take 200,000 pages apiece to be exhausted. If you think laser printers are always cheaper than inkjets, think again. Our familiar rule of thumb applies here: The less expensive the printer, the more expensive the consumables. The most economical color laser or LED printers are those designed for high-volume use, which accommodate consumables that may last for tens of thousands of pages. Kyocera Mita\u2019s FS-C5300DN is very fast, and its operating costs are by far the lowest among color laser models we\u2019ve tested, but it carries a steep list price of $1739. The photoconducting drums (one for each color) and toner supplies are separated to minimize waste. The drums last 200,000 pages apiece, so you\u2019ll take a while to exhaust them. The starter-size toner supplies last an impressive 6000 pages for black and 5000 pages for each color. A full-size, 12,000-page replacement supply of black ink costs 0.9 cents per page, while each 10,000-page color toner supply costs 1.5 cents per page. Color image quality was adequate but unsophisticated. Solid blocks of color, as in pie charts, looked fine, but color photos tended to appear grainy or fuzzy, with a yellowish cast. Grayscale images struggled with subtle gradations and looked too dark overall. Following close behind the FS-C5300DN is the $799 Oki C610dtn, an LED model. The printer\u2019s output speed is impressive, but you might need to tone down the color palette, which produced ruddy flesh tones and dark or lurid colors. We also noticed grainy or fuzzy qualities in solid-color areas. Its consumables are very economical, though: Separate drums are built to last 20,000 pages each. A full set comes with the printer; replacing them costs about $71 to $77 apiece (per Oki\u2019s estimates\u2014the company does not sell them directly), adding about a third of a cent per color per page to your costs. The starter-size cyan, ma\u00ad\u00adgenta, yellow, and black toner supplies have a mere 2000-page yield, but the replacements are economical: Black toner costs about 1.1 cents per page; and each color, about 2.6 cents per page. A four-color page would cost just 9 cents\u2014a bargain. The $1549 Dell 5130cdn Color Laser Printer costs a wee bit more per page than the Oki, but it compensates with far better speed and print quality. It also ships with standard-size supplies (versus the Oki\u2019s paltry starter sizes): a 9000-page black cartridge ($107 to replace) and 6000-page cyan, magenta, and yellow cartridges ($195 each to replace). That\u2019s about 1.2 cents per black page and 3.3 cents per color\u2014or 10.9 cents for a four-color page. High-yield supplies offer greater savings: The 18,000-page black cartridge ($137) costs less than 1 cent per page, and the 12,000-page color cartridges ($245 each) cost about 2 cents per color, adding up to a superlow 6.9 cents for a four-color page.

            "answer_text": "I use Canon printers with refillable cartridges. The ink costs about $50 a gallon. A gallon is close to 4000 cc, and since a cartridge refill uses about 8 cc, that means the gallon will refill around 500 cartridges. So each refill costs about 10c, which is good for about 300 pages. I really ought to get a continuous ink supply system (CISS), it would save quite a bit of time refilling cartridges. The colour is not quite as intense as \u201creal\u201d ink. As I print about 5000 pages a month, which would use of the order of $1000 of retail ink, I do not care. ",
