            "answer_text": "155. None of the first six replies are answers to the question. Quora is about answers, not being like politicians on Sunday morning TV talk shows who ignore the question and give a little speech. At least make a guess. Humans as a group are very good at guessing things they can't know, by collecting all the guesses then taking the average. Francis Galton found that crowds came within 1% of guessing the number of beans in a jar at a fair, by taking the average of the guess number. My estimate is 155, based primarily on his earlier aptitude tests, his ability to read and apply technical information, and his ability to use numbers to make process changes unique in the history of a complicated industry. I think I am more qualified to make this estimate than average because I studied Elon Musk specifically to guess his IQ and have successfully guessed how he would think in some areas. In NLP terms, this is called modeling his strategies. It's something like that, honed by guessing IQs of people who had documentation, then seeing the actual numbers. I've gotten reasonable good at these guesses and I am typically within 2-5%, for what it's worth. My estimate of his IQ would be higher, but I spoke to Elon face to face about some things that were very crucial to achievement of his larger goals, and was stunned to see he had not considered the implications. Some of these were bullets dodged, things that authentic journalists should have asked and, if Musk's answers had been printed, would have led to scientific criticism. 155 is still high, and I imagine it's far higher than the IQ of most billionaires. I know 18 billionaires, and Musk gets a higher estimated IQ than any of them. Edit: After over 32,000 views, I have not had a single person give me a different number. (That will likely change now that I posted that sentence, of course.) If I were a data scientist (yes, they exist, and they're in high demand), I'd consider that 32,000 without a different number a pretty interesting result, and just as relevant as someone's claim about their IQ presented without evidence. Seriously - have you ever in your life seen someone claim an IQ, then offer to take a test and prove it? Didn't think so. Even if someone claiming to be Elon Musk came onto Quora and posted, \"My IQ is 200\", who would argue that that would settle the issue any more than my answer? When you are skeptical, you can always argue, or ask one more question. And what would be the payoff for Elon to say this? Whatever his IQ is, if it's 160 and above - genius level, according to popular acclaim that has no scientific basic - there would be a backlash against saying this, and thus no incentive to go to this point. If it's lower, why not just let my number stand? I mention this because several times a week, someone freaks out about this answer. It's fascinating how many people get upset by either this question, or my answer, or both. I have something like 300 questions and answers on Quora, but this one tweaks people like no other. People like to post on Quora words to the effect that IQ is irrelevant. What the experience of this Elon Musk IQ question has taught me is that some people get emotional about discussions of someone's IQ, and anything that gets people emotional is the opposite of irrelevant. To put it another way, what you think of people who guess IQs says more about you than the person guessing. If a person offering an opinion upsets you, perhaps you should bring that up in your next therapy session. ",

            "answer_text": "It\u2019s difficult to intuitively understand what IQ is. Let\u2019s use a metric more easy to understand: orders of magnitude. Let us say that levels of intelligence can exist thus: 1/10, 1/100, 1/1K, 1/10K, etc. Let\u2019s use only the United States population, since using the rest of world (including all the poverty, disease, and starvation that probably messes up your intelligence levels). This means that the smartest person in the United States is 1/300M. Here\u2019s the thing: whatever quality describes \u201cbeing Elon Musk\u201d is more complicated than sheer intelligence. It takes incredible hard work, dedication, an ability to inspire people, etc., etc. These traits are not exactly common ones. Elon Musk\u2019s work ethic alone is probably at least 1/1,000, certainly 1/100. You would not expect the smartest person in the world to also have a good work ethic. This is just statistics. We can put an approximate baseline to how smart Elon Musk is: at least 1/100, probably 1/1000 or more. Someone with less than that probably would not get accepted into an applied physics PhD at Stanford. We combine these traits to see Elon at a \u201c1/100,000\u201d general extraordinary-ness baseline. How does that compare with his actual results? Well, he\u2019s about the 23rd richest person in the US, and possibly the most generally awesome person, so at least 1/14M, up to 1/325M. We guessed a 1/1000 intelligence and 1/1000 work ethic, so how do we account for the extra orders of magnitude? Charisma, business instincts, and luck. As you can see, his intelligence is rare, but not that rare. You\u2019d expect about 325,000 Americans to be smarter than he is. What happened to them? At least 50% of them have below average work ethic, and did nothing special. Many of them are mathematicians, physicists, or other academics, and many are bankers and engineers. Some probably work at Tesla or SpaceX. ",
