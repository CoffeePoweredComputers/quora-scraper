            "answer_text": "You first need to determine what you want to test.If you are on municipal water, they are testing the water on a pre-determined frequency and they can give you the results. Many times you can find the results published online.If you are on well water, contact a local laboratory. They know what contaminants are specific to your local area. For example, in CT, we have very little arsenic, some radon, more nitrates (due to farming communities) and in some areas, MTBE due to old gas stations. The lab can help determine what tests you should purchase. Also, let them know if you have children because you may then include testing for lead and fluoride.",
