            "answer_text": "The ideal power supply produces exactly what voltage or set of voltages required regardless of changes in input voltage or current draw, and is 100% efficient. It also weighs nothing and costs nothing, and never fails. It also has an infinite number of interfaces for setting output voltage/current levels to whatever precision is required. Needless to say, nothing like this exists, so engineers usually design or select a power supply based on the requirements of the end applications. There are always trade-offs among these various factors in real scenarios. ",

A narrow boat will need one lead acid optimised for engine starting and several more optimised for long discharge domestic use. Pocket torches with LED lamps seem to use AAA alkalines. ",
