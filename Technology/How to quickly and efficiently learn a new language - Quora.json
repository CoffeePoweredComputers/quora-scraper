            "answer_text": "Learning a language is hard. One method alone won't get you very far. You have to use a bunch of them. Below is a programme of learning that has worked for me. The basic principle is that you focus on the easiest thing first, get reasonably good, and then move onto the next, harder one. The parts of 'knowing a language', from easiest to hardest, are:  ReadingWritingSpeaking/ListeningSo it makes sense to take them in this order, overlapping as you go along. Once you're somewhat good at reading and can comprehend sentences at a basic level, you also begin to learn writing skills (the details of verb conjugation, etc.). Once you're somewhat good at writing, you also start working on speaking/listening - still working on the previous two. Once you've gotten good at one stage, you shift emphasis to the next. I find that if I don't do it this way, things get frustrating. Most books want you to start writing at the same time as you start reading, but what I'm more interested in at the beginning stage is just being able to decipher a given sentence. Once I've got a gestalt idea of how the language works, I start driving into the lower level details which will help me to begin writing it and eventually speaking properly. Reading You need to learn: Basic grammatical and syntactic structureWhat the words mean1. Syntactic/Grammatical Structure The goal at this stage is, for a given sentence, to be able to say roughly what is going on in it without knowing the exact meaning. Example: \"the cat sat on the mat\" = a noun (cat) in some relation to another noun (mat). Things stop being like deciphering a set of hieroglyphs and become more like 'OK, I have some idea what's going on here, I just need to know the meanings of these words'.  For this stage, you need a good overall guide to the grammar (Schaum's do really good ones), you need an easy book in the target language, and you need a dictionary (as well as Google Translate).  What works for me is to get a book in the given language, and start working through it with the aid of a dictionary and Google Translate. At first, you'll be completely clueless. Gradually, though, you get the sense of how the sentences are constructed in the language. There's no need to focus too much on memorizing unusual words, just remember the basic building blocks that keep cropping up.  Progress will be slow. You just have to push through. I enjoy this part, but then I enjoy puzzles of all kinds.  2. Vocabulary The next stage is developing your vocabulary. You can make some vague sense of sentences but your reliance on the dictionary and google translate is still very heavy. Now the goal is to refer to the dictionary less and less as you read. (I set numerical goals for number of words; see below). To do this you need flashcards, and an understanding of how best to memorize things. The flashcards bit is easy and well-covered across the internet. Just get a bunch, or make a bunch, write the word in English on one side and the target language on the other. 25-35 flashcards in a 'stack'.  When using flashcards, make sure that you look at the 'target language' side first, and don't flip over straightaway or give yourself any clues on that side. You want to strain for the answer, so that stuff is actually happening in your brain. Only when it's a complete blank do you turn it over and look at the other side.  The quickest way to memorize a 'stack' is visualization and mnemonic techniques based on that. For example, the Spanish word 'barco' means 'boat'; I remember this by imagine a huge, gnarly tree trunk being used as a boat, taking especial care to associate the word 'bark' to it. So my thought process when I see 'barco' goes: 'barco' sounds like 'bark', 'bark' brings this huge thing floating on the sea to mind, oh it's a boat, it means 'boat'!  Carry these stacks everywhere with you, use them at lunch breaks, on commutes and so on. When you've gotten perfect at one stack, put it away for a few days, move onto another stack, and then go back to the previous stack and try again. You'll find you may have forgotten some of the old ones. Keep doing this and rotating stacks. (This mirrors Pimsleur's method. The idea is that you memorize things best by being forced to recall them at steadily increasing intervals; after 1 day, 5 days, 2 weeks, a month...)  For numbers types, a rough rule of thumb is that 2000 words gives you 80% coverage. They say 95% coverage is required to be able to guess reasonably successfully at the meaning of the remaining ones. Set goals for numbers if this helps. Writing You should keep reading, and keep doing flashcards, making sure to retain old stacks. At the 2/3 month stage (depending on how hard you're working), your comprehension is OK and you can get the rough meaning of texts at a reasonable level. At this stage you should start getting more into the detail of the grammar; the goal is to be able to construct sentences using common verbs in all tenses, of a good degree of complexity. The thing to do here is get your grammar book and work through it properly, making sure to do all the exercises.  Write your answers down. Writing things down has magic effects on the memory. Your visual memory gets trained to do certain things. Work through the book, and use interval techniques on the tougher exercises (if you don't feel confident you could do it 100% right a week later, it's a 'tough' exercise) - come back to them after certain intervals and redo them, again writing it all out.  Speaking/Listening As you're working through the grammar book, there's no reason not to also start the speaking/listening development, since you'll naturally be forming sentences anyway. The goals here are to be able to comprehend heard speech, and eventually to speak fluently yourself.  1. Listening For listening, your key tools are: Training tapes (Pimsleur's are good, I haven't used any others)SongsMovies, TV showsWhat you have to do is obvious: go through whatever course you end up purchasing, and watch movies/TV shows in the target language. One nice trick is to watch dubbed shows: get the original in English, watch it, then watch the dubbed version with subtitles, then once you're familiar enough with it, remove the subtitles.  Repetition is KEY here: your conscious mind may think it's terribly boring, but what you are doing is training your brain to recognize certain audial patterns, which means repetition. Take the soundtrack of a TV show, put it on your iPod, and listen to it on your commute. Sentences that initially sounded like gibberish begin to take shape and you get pretty good at picking out individual words.  2. Speaking The holy grail! The tools here are endless: the main thing is that you have to interact with a real person. How you do this is up to you. Find someone who speaks the target language who's willing to spend some time with you and just speak the language with them, e.g. for an hour on the phone every 3 days. Don't allow yourself to lapse into English at any point during this hour.  If you can't find someone through friends, there are plenty of sites devoted to matching up language learners either in person (meetup.com) or over Skype. I've never used any of these myself. The key thing is to make sure the other person corrects your mistakes. Tell them specifically at the beginning that they are to do this whenever they spot a mistake - that's the only way you'll improve.  You'll be pleasantly surprised at how quickly you improve: speaking, and conversation, is good fun. The more you do this, the quicker you become fluent. ",

            "answer_text": "Lots of time listening to native speakers with input (speech) that is comprehensible but difficult. You should understand most of what is being said, but always be adding to your vocabulary and grammar. If you can spend 50 hours a week listening to native speakers and responding in the appropriate environment (no speaking for the first week or two), you will greatly increase your chances of learning quickly and learning well. You can try learning vocabulary very quickly. Connect the sound to images and events in the real world. That will help you communicate like an infant and understand the general topic of someone else\u2019s speech. If you can learn several hundred words (probably 500\u20131000) you can communicate decently but like a little child. Even if you\u2019re putting lots of effort in, you\u2019ll probably only learn 30\u201350 words per day. If you\u2019re really fast, and studying full-time, maybe 100 words per day. That would be very odd and very fast. I learn 25 or 30 words in 4 hours of studying. I have serious doubts about most people being able to learn 1000 words in two weeks and actually being able to speak and understand them. More likely, it will take you 3\u20136 months to learn 1000 words. That\u2019s with pretty dedicated and intense study. Don\u2019t study written language first. It will slow you down and prevent you from understanding. You need to listen, listen, listen, and always be comprehending and struggling to comprehend. Only study written language after you\u2019ve heard words and begun speaking short sentences fluently. With dedicated study, you will be able to have actual conversations after 6 months. They will probably not be deep and complex conversations. If the language is closely related to your mother tongue, you will learn more quickly. Generally, I would advise acquiring language rather than learning it. There is a technical difference. Acquisition is related to understanding and using in context (that\u2019s not what it really means, but close enough). For instance, even the most proficient readers of ancient Greek or Latin have learned thelanguage well, but have probably not acquired it. If they have conversations in the language, they\u2019ll be relying on things they read in books rather than experience listening to and speaking the language. Things you read in books about language are language learning, not acquisition. ",
