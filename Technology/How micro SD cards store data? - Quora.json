            "answer_text": "How Does an SD Card Work? By Contributing Writer ShareShare on FacebookSecure Digital (SD) cards are a form of flash memory used to store data from many modern digital devices. They differ from other storage media in that they can be written to thousands of times and do not require power to retain their contents. This makes them an ideal choice for electronics such as digital cameras, which have strict power requirements and need media that can be written to multiple times. In contrast to traditional hard drives, SD cards also contain no moving parts, so they are significantly more resilient to accidental bumps and falls. This has contributed to their use in MP3 players, which are often subject to shock. SD Card Basics To make use of an SD card, your electronics must first be capable of reading the cards. Electronics such as digital cameras and cell phones often contain an SD slot but may not be modified to accept the cards if they do not. Many computers include memory card slots for SD and other memory cards, and you can purchase USB memory card \"readers\" to enable your computer to use the cards otherwise. Some electronics cannot read all sizes of SD cards, so make sure to read your owner's manual. Data Storage Data in an SD card is stored on a series of electronic components called NAND chips. These chips allow data to be written and stored on the SD card. As the chips have no moving parts, data can be transferred from the cards quickly, far exceeding the speeds available to CD or hard-drive media. The NAND chips in an SD card do not wear out easily, so data can be written to them thousands of times over their lifetime, making SD cards resilient and long-lasting in use. ",

            "answer_text": "In most cases, once the Micro SD Card is inserted in your phone, your phone automatically starts scanning the card, pulls out all the information MicroSD Card needs, and immediately stores information in the appropriate location. So that Micro SD Card will start working directly. If you want to increase the memory of your phone and securely backed up data or pictures, the Micro SD Card is an ideal choice. Whatever, you need to be careful when deleting your memory card. Ideally, you only need to delete the card when you change your phone. When your phone is actively accessing the memory card, but the connection is disconnected, normally, the card does not know how to handle it. So this may cause your picture can not open correctly, your app crashes. or even for a very sluggish phone, when the phone is completely turned off the SD card can be removed. But many phones have an \u201cUninstall SD Card\u201d option in their settings, so you can switch them when you need . As time goes on, more and more big capacity cards are coming out. Mobile cameras increase megapixel size and apps and games getting bigger and bigger. So you do really need a SD card you can get. ",
