            "answer_text": "As per the International Energy Agency (IEA), renewable power is set to expand by 50% between 2019 and 2024. The IEA World Energy Outlook report models three policy scenarios The first is the Current Policy scenario where the world continues to function according to the old regulations, and the energy demand rises annually by 1.3% by 2040. The second scenario is the Stated Policy Scenario, formerly known as the New Policies Scenario, which incorporates new policies already announced by governments. The energy demand rises by 1% per year. The third, more ambitious, Sustainable Development Scenario (SDS) scenario charts out a path aligning with the Paris agreement to maintain the global temperature well below 2\u00b0C and pursuing efforts to limit it to 1.5\u00b0C.  Under the Stated Policy scenario, the IEA has projected a rapid increase in installed capacity of solar power by 2040 ahead of coal, gas, and other renewable sources. Optimistic policy changes around the world back up this projection of the strong growth of solar. Solar power is much more effective and versatile than wind energy and does not alter their environment and can be built in a matter of months, unlike hydro. So, the answer is solar energy. ",
