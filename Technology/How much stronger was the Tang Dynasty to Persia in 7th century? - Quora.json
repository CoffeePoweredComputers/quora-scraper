            "answer_text": "The answer would be very tricky. Around the 7th century, Islam was emerging as a religion, and Arabs used the opportunity to invade the already weakened Persian empire. It is safe to assume that the Tang Dynasty was in its prime, and the Persians were declining. Still, it would be a mistake to think that any side would emerge victoriously in a short amount of time.
