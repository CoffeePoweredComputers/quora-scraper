            "answer_text": "Technology in the Future:However, the advancement in technology like the Internet, computers and tablets has changed the dynamics of the print industry tremendously. Newspaper, Magazine, and Book circulation is at its lowest, the print industry is expected to lose 25% of its jobs over the next few years. The print industry is drastically declining because the Internet has and continues to shape the way we communicate. The future of print is not very bright, in my opinion I do not believe that print will be a part of the future because there will be no need for anything printed. While the print industry is suffering it is predicted that applications like eBook, iBook, and audiobook are expected to increase vastly. In a few years newspapers, books, and advertisements will all be created and made only for online.  Therefore, future technology should be more compatible with people\u2019s needs; tablets should be Nano sized, lite and slick, interactive, and portable. Users should be able to explore endless possibilities from writing word documents to creating and designing websites. Future tablets should be able to bend, fold, and roll while giving the user the experience of reading a book or a magazine.  Prospective tablets should allow users to browse the web, take pictures, upload, and watch videos. Upcoming tablets should not take away people interacting with each other but it should enhance people\u2019s interaction globally. Upcoming tables should translate different languages making it easy for users to communicate internationally. The future holds a lot of promise for auto voice translating and interpretting, which will remove any language barriers. The future progression in technology will change the dynamics of communication all across the world, in the classroom, the workplace and in the public sphere. It is unknow what the future may hold for the advancement communication technology, but it is not far-fetched to say that we may one day be able to send emails with our own thoughts or brainwaves where ever we are.
