            "answer_text": "Never. At least not for experienced photographers.  Photography, no matter what you\u2019re doing with it, is ultimately about capturing light. Depending on just how high-end you get, a high-end camera sensor can capture 10x-180x as much light as a phone sensor. That\u2019s sticking to conventional digital cameras, not anything considered large format. Yes, smartphones have been improving their photographic ability, adding better plastic lenses, more cameras, etc. But any new hardware technology going into a smartphone can be used in a larger-sensor camera as well. So sure, if you compare a smartphone of today to a professional digital camera from 2000, you\u2019ll probably be happier with the smartphone for many uses. However, that professional camera still has the advantage of being able to change lenses, adapting itself to situations a smartphone can\u2019t hope to match. Smartphones are currently shooting a bit above their pay grade by using computational photography and artificial intelligence. There is actually nothing in any smartphone, by way of image processing features, that couldn\u2019t be implemented in a professional camera. However, novices and professionals do not use a camera in the same way, so it\u2019s unreasonable to expect identical features. In the smartphone, the goal is to take over the functions of the photographer\u2019s brain for a novice who doesn\u2019t have access to a photographer\u2019s experience and training. That means an AI to decide on an image\u2019s exposure, maybe another to coordinate taking multiple shots based on image content or motion feedback/sensing. Then, once the photo is shot, another chunk of code analyzes the image and adjusts it \u2014 probably for display on the phone or on the internet, specifically \u2014 and then encodes it as a JPEG.  When I take a photo with a professional camera, I\u2019m going to have the camera\u2019s opinion of the exposure, a preview of it in my electronic viewfinder, and my own knowledge of photography, of this camera, etc. to choose the final exposure. The electronics are offering me a suggestion, not making a decision for me. I know photography better, but even more importantly, I know my specific photographic intent when I press that button. Even if there\u2019s an AI helping me out, it doesn\u2019t know that intent. Well\u2026 not completely. Lots of cameras know you\u2019re trying to get sharp focus on eyes. At least one other can be told you\u2019re looking for classes of vehicles in terms of autofocus specialization. And that\u2019s again one of those things that\u2019s offering help. Focusing decisions can be too fast to make on your own, in some cases. So it\u2019s great to have a camera with a reliable enough ability to focus on what I\u2019m intending to focus on. Sometimes I force that using spot focus, sometimes I let the camera pick out the eyes, sometimes I just do it all manually. My choice \u2014 the camera doesn\u2019t get in the way. You can do that on a smartphone in manual mode, but it\u2019s usually awkward, and sometimes not even an option in the manufacturer\u2019s default app. My cameras have a number of computational functions, but again, they\u2019re oriented toward helping me get the shot. The presumption is that, in most cases, I\u2019m shooting raw images which I\u2019ll edit/finish later on a PC. So the camera\u2019s not concerned with much of that. Well, most of them aren\u2019t\u2026 I do own one camera that has an amazing amount of control of the image you\u2019ll record in JPEG. But it\u2019s still control I have, not decisions being made for me. Another factor is fast shooting. One of my cameras can record 30 shots before I even press the button. It can shoot 18 frames per second with full image stabilization and continous autofocus, or 60 frames per second with one-shot autofocus. Is that more than I need? Nearly always. But even in single shot mode, it\u2019s effectively instant no matter how quickly I press the shutter button. Your typical phone camera is laggy, never intended for the sort of applications that need fast shooting, high end DSLRs have storage specifically designed for a high rate of image storage.  And then there\u2019s adaptabiliy to any situation. My camera with the right lens can shoot a closeup of the moon, or a closeup of a bug. When the memory card is full, I can put in another\u2026 or two. When the battery runs out, I can put in another. Or add an accessory grip and use two batteries. The typical modern smartphone is going to fill up on photos or run out of power. They will never even match a typical consumer point-and-shoot on flexibility. My camera is designed to have a flash gun fitted or link to an array of flash lights. So, bottom line is, what\u2019s better for you, not what\u2019s better on an absolute basis. If you just want perfectly good snapshots for the internet, a smartphone will handhold you better than any dedicated camera. It\u2019s common, and probably will be increasingly more common, for a beginner to learn photography using a phone camera and find, if they get a real camera, they\u2019re not getting better results. Possibly even worse. There is an absolute need to master a professional camera. Anyone can pick up a phone and get the same technical result as anyone else using the same phone, because the phone makes all the decisions. However, the creative result? That\u2019s up to you\u2026 for a while, anyway. ",

            "answer_text": "Everybody has great answers as to why \u201cNo- smartphone cameras will never be as \u201cgood\u201d as high-end cameras. So I\u2019m going to leave that there. Except\u2026 Good for who? Smartphone cameras are GREAT\u2026 for the audience they are intended for. In fact, I would argue that smartphone cameras are BETTER than high-end cameras\u2026 FOR THE AUDIENCE THEY ARE DESIGNED FOR. One response said that you can get great images from smartphone cameras using AI and software, at the expense of giving up your decisions to some engineering team and software development team that has no idea who you are. This is SO true. People who use high-end cameras like the advice, but ultimately want to make the decision. This is the core difference between \u201ctaking a picture\u201d and \u201cmaking a photograph\u201d. Smartphone users (most of the time) \u201ctake pictures\u201d. If you see someone walking around with $12K of kit at the lake he\u2019s either a) an idiot, b) a blowhard or c) someone that\u2019s gonna go make a photograph. Unfortunately, there\u2019s far too many a\u2019s and b\u2019s out there and not enough c\u2019s. But nevermind the philosophy of it all- the hardware in a smartphone is just always going to be lacking, and for good reason. And on purpose. You need small, energy conscious sensors. You need small, durable and lightweight lenses. The average consumer does NOT take as good a care of their smartphone as a seasoned pro photographer and his/her significant investment. And on a small technical note, because the lens is SO CLOSE to the sensor, that means the point where the beams of light cross each other (The focal point) is somewhere between the back of the lens and the front of the sensor\u2026 in 10ths of millimeters. DSLR lenses have that critical point happening somewhere within the body of the lens, allowing for much more versatility. The whole reason you really can\u2019t get a nice blurry background from your subject on a smartphone is related to this fact. The smaller the lens, the smaller the sensor, the less control you have over depth of field, and the less \u201cprofessional\u201d your technical photo may look. \u201cProfessional\u201d in quotes up front because I know some BRILLIANT smartphone photographers, that can run circles around people with bags of kit. But that\u2019s another story\u2026 ",
