Organizers can create a trip page, collect payments and manage group communication. Participants can join a trip and securely pay for it through WeTravel\u2019s website.  One major differentiator is that we got rid of credit card fees for participants by giving them the option to pay directly with their checking accounts. This also allows us to currently offer our platform completely for free to organizers. ",
