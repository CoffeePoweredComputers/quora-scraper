            "answer_text": "First of all, you ask her if she\u2019s comfortable with that as just because you want to, does not mean that it will be comfortable or pleasurable for your girlfriend. If she agrees, you need to get her suitably turned on. The more wet she is, the better and easier it will be to achieve. I would recommend bringing your girlfriend to orgasm at least once before attempting this if it\u2019s not something that your lady is used to. When she\u2019s ready to go again, use plenty of lubricant on your hands and start off slowly with one finger, perhaps giving her oral sex again at the same time, then go to two fingers. When she\u2019s really starting to enjoy herself, have her tell you when she\u2019s ready for the third and gently slip it in without removing the other two fingers. To make it most comfortable for her (unless otherwise stated), put your index and ring finger together and your middle finger on top so your fingers resemble a triangle. Go slowly and allow for her body to open up around your hand. ",
