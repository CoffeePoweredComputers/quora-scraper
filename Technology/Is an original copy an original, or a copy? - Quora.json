            "answer_text": "The term \u201coriginal copy\u201d can and does have several meanings. I will start with printed stuff. When you print something and you photocopy it, you have an original and you have a photocopy. However, what happens when you print the same document several times, without ever photocopying? All of the documents from the printer, in this case, are original copies. They are all copies of a single document \u2014 the same document \u2014 but each one is an original. \u201cCopy\u201d is also a term used in Advertising. It refers to the written portion of an ad, as distinct from the visual portion. For example, look at this ad: WE DID IT \u2014 The Partnership for Responsible Growth You see a graph and you see an image of a thermometer. And the rest is just words. The part that is just words is the copy. What you are looking at is the original copy \u2014 the copy originated at some advertising firm. Any variation of this copy is a variation on the original copy. But there is also another possible meaning. The copy in the printed ad is, obviously, the copy that got printed, also known as \u201capproved copy\u201d or \u201cfinal copy\u201d which is, almost every single time, very different from the \u201coriginal copy.\u201d Similarly, there is the iconic milk ad: Got milk? That copy (Got milk?) is the original copy. When you say, for instance, \u201cGot keys?\u201d to see if your wife has the housekeys, before leaving the house, you\u2019re mimicking the original copy. Original copy also, often, refers to handwritten vs mechanically reproduced stuff. So, for instance, if you wrote a poem, on paper, using pen and ink, that\u2019s the original copy of the poem. In this case, also, the word \u201ccopy\u201d is being used to indicate, not that it has been copied, but that it is the original, handwritten text of the poem. If someone were to etch the poem on metal, then the metal etching would also be an original copy of the poem since the method of transcription is different. Similarly, if you were to produce a volume of poetry, including that one poem that you wrote by hand, the first book that rolled off the press would be the first, the original copy of the book. There are thousands of possible variations on the idea of \u201coriginal copy\u201d in re print. Let\u2019s move on to non-print materials. Some types of sculptures uses casts. In other words, the sculptures aren\u2019t carved or chiseled. The sculptor makes a mould and pours metal into it. In a sense, the mould alone is the original work. Everything produced from that is a copy. The first sculpture to come out of the mould is the original copy. Even every subsequent sculpture that emerges from the same mould is an original copy. With today\u2019s technology, of course, one can re-create a mould an infinite number of times, even thousands of years after the sculptor\u2019s death. But then copies from those moulds would not be original copies in re that particular sculpture. In film, there are celluloid copies and digital copies. I don\u2019t think people use celluloid to film stuff any more. I don\u2019t know. I do know, though, that people still sell \u201ccels\u201d of the celluloid version of Disney\u2019s animated movie, \u201cSnow White.\u201d There are, of course, several copies of each frame (on celluloid). Each of these copies is an original copy, stemming from the original celluloid version of the movie. If you were to transfer a digital version of the movie to celluloid on your own, then you would not have the original copy. I don\u2019t even know if this is possible. I\u2019m just explaining the difference, here, between original copy and non-original copy. In short, there are many contexts in which the term \u201coriginal copy\u201d means something different from the sum of its parts (\u201coriginal\u201d & \u201ccopy\u201d) just as a waterfall or a river or an ocean is different from the sum of its parts (parts = drops of water, in this case). There are, of course, times when people use the term incorrectly, just as there are times when people walk or dance or swim incorrectly. But there are many contexts in which the term (original copy) is used correctly also. ",

            "answer_text": "There's no such thing as an original copy. There are originals, and there are copies. Except sometimes, it\u2019s not so clear. If you're referring to artwork, there are forms of art that rely on making multiple copies of an original piece, like casting several sculptures from the same mold. In that case, the first run of casts, each numbered with the order they were cast and the total number of casts in the series, are all originals. They will have a designation that looks like this: 6/100. The sixth casting in a run of 100. Ethical artists will either destroy the mold, or mark it in some way, so additional castings will not be the same. Unethical artists and dealers will make additional castings, but they won't be originals. Molds become less precise over time, how quickly depends on the material they are made from. The same is true of all kind of physical prints, like etchings, lithographs, screen prints and the like. They are printed in series, usually in limited numbers, and the plates are either destroyed or marked when the full series has been printed. With the right equipment and a good eye, you can tell if a print is an original or a print from a degraded medium that has been remastered. Once you move out of the realm of traditional art, things can become a bit less precise. I used to do a lot of Xerox art from collages. My originals depended on the degradation of line and clarity that developed in fourth and fifth generation copies. The collage, the piece from which I made the first generation copy, wasn't the end goal. It was just a step along the way. People would ask, \u201cCan I see the original?\" I would point to the fourth generation Xerox copy and say, \u201cThat is the original,\u201d because in my mind, it was the first piece that had the combination of clarity and fuzziness I wanted. It becomes a bit fuzzier if we're talking about things that can be printed with no loss of clarity, and exist digitally. If I create a digital drawing, and print 100 copies, are they all originals? Is the digital file the original? Do they become originals if I sign and number them? You can print infinite copies of a 3D model, share it with other modelers, make it open source and allow people to use it for their own purposes. At what point does it become a copy if every model printed from the same file is identical? They are either all copies, or all originals. The laws regarding intellectual property and digital content are still being formed, so sometimes it isn\u2019t as clear as we want it to be. ",
