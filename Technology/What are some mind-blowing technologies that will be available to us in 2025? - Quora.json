            "answer_text": "1) Bio Technology  Bionic Hand controlled by brain signals Okay, it doesn\u2019t let you crush rocks like you would think, BUT it does allow people without fingers to have fully functional hands that can pick up and handle delicate objects. It is completely controlled by the brain and requires no surgery. Touch Bionics, the company the produces the Pro Digits hand, is able to install the hand complete with \u201cliving skin,\u201d a plastic covering resembling human skin, for under $50,000. A small price to pay for a new hand I think. 2) Architecture  Revolving Tower in Dubai While Dubai is currently known for it\u2019s ridiculous extravagance, developers in the region are building a tower that has fancy and extremely practical applications. This beautiful building is going to be made of 59 independently rotating modules/floors so that inhabitants will have a constantly shifting view of the outside world. Each floor will rotate at approximately 6 meters per minute so that the inhabitants will not notice the movement. The independent rotations will also give the building an ever-changing exterior that can warp into very complex designs. All of that aesthetic stuff is great and all, but the real innovation comes from the wind turbines built in between each floor. The resulting pollution-free energy will be enough to power the tower and several buildings in the surrounding area. Just Wow. 3) Computer Speed, Size and Usability Speed Most people tech-nerds know of Moore\u2019s Law from 1965 (the number of transistors we are able to cheaply put in computer chips doubles every year, thereby doubling the speed). However, most people don\u2019t know that Moore, himself, came out and said his law will most likely fail finally in 2020 where the number of transistors we can put on chips will be limited by the laws of physics. Does this mean the exponential rise in computer processing speed will come to a halt in ten years? Not a chance, says Jim Tully, chief of research for semi-conductors at Gartner. \u201cThe technology which will replace this is a bottom-up approach, where chips will be assembled using individual atoms or molecules, a type of nanotechnology.\u201d Ray Kurzweil, a well-respected Futurist, stated in 2008 that when this molecular computing technology comes out in 2020, computers will have the intellectual capability of human beings. You might want to digest that for a minute before moving onto the next section. Size and Usability  That Macbook Air is pretty damn thin. So thin, in fact, that it makes you wonder if physical computers will even exist in 2020. Well according to developers at Intel, the keyboard and mouse surely won\u2019t. Who needs QWERTY when you can control a computer with your mind? \u201cWe\u2019re trying to prove you can do interesting things with brain waves,\u201d said Intel researcher Dean Pomerleau. \u201cEventually people may be willing to be more committed \u2026 to brain implants. Imagine being able to surf the Web with the power of your thoughts.\u201d Pomerleau and countless research groups around the world are working with brain scanning devices to map blood flow in the brain. They have found that when different individual focus on the same image, they have very similar patterns of blood flow in their brains. For example, one British group announced that they could discern where subjects where in a computer generated virtual environment by looking at where blood flowed in their brains. 4) Cars and Fuel There are tons of different fuel-types for the \u201cautomobiles of tomorrow\u201d but the only kind that seems to have any realistic chance of actually being used by the masses in the next ten years is electric. We still can\u2019t figure out how to make hydrogen fuel cells efficient, safe and practical and hybrids/deisal cars are yesterday\u2019s news. Fossil fuels are so 2009\u2026   This is the Tesla Model S sedan that will be coming out in 2011 for the modest price of $57,000 (very good for a luxury, electric car). Besides the sexy curves, you get 160, 230 or 300 miles per charge depending on the battery size you choose. And another small detail, it goes from 0 to 60 mph in 5.5 seconds while seating 7 people. So despite all of the automaker\u2019s best attempts at making alternative-fuel cars so hideous that no one would ever buy them, it looks like market competition will soon push some very attractive and efficient cars onto the market. 5) How We Interact With the World The way in which we interact with the outside world has changed SO much since the introduction of the internet, smart phones, etc. In the very near future, another huge jump will be made: integrating the information on the internet with our surroundings. By that I mean being able to look at a building, product or place and immediately seeing information about the subject on our devices and eventually just with our eyes. If you\u2019re still confused as to what I mean, check out the earliest innovation of this concept, Goggles by Google. This app allows you to take a picture of whatever you are looking at and instantly receive info about it on your Android phone. Like the video says, Goggle is only scratching at the surface of this technology. Kurzweil says that \u201cBy 2020 we\u2019ll routinely have pop ups in our visual field of view that give us background about the people and places that we\u2019re looking at.\u201d Your memory and the vast information bank of the internet will be one at all times. Until we can do this with a chip in our brain, a new device has come out that overlays video onto our normal vision using special glasses. It\u2019s called the Vuzix display Wrap 920AR and it goes on sale soon for around $800. 6) Energy Solar energy will soon leave fossil fuels and inefficient wind farms in the dust. According to Kurzweil, \u201cthe cost per watt of solar energy is coming down rapidly and the total amount of solar energy is growing exponentially. It has in fact been doubling every two years for the past 20 years and is now only eight doublings away from meeting all of the world\u2019s energy needs.\u201d Emerging technology from a company called Sandia is making the reality that much closer:  Sandia\u2019s solar cells are made of 100 times less material than the current top solar cells while operating at the same efficiency. Since the biggest hurdle in the path of solar power is the expensive and large nature of solar panels, these new microscopic cells will make a huge difference. For example, current panels are massive and require large motors to move them to track the sun. Sandia\u2019s cells, on the other hand, would only need to be moved a fraction of a millimeter to track the sun efficiently while weighing next to nothing. Even more amazing, they can be suspended in liquids and printed on flexible materials, allowing the cells to be places on any surface. What if your entire car was covered in these powerhouses? Bye bye, Chevron. 7) Health While we still can\u2019t cure the common cold, custom-made organs are just around the corner.  A company called Organovo has developed the first commercial 3-D bio printer that builds custom organs cell-by-cell. Each individual cell is based upon sample cells from the body of the customer. Organovo reports that veins and arteries will be available in 5 years, and more complex organs like hearts and livers in 10. On a more general note, nanotechnology is revolutionizing the health world. The awesome combination of a higher understanding of how DNA works and the ability to create very small cellular parts is painting a very bright future for medicine. Scientists are finding specific sequences of DNA that code for conditions like schizophrenia, autism and even aging. The cures are actually in sight. 8) Success and Popularity Accessibility By that, I mean the ability of a Joe Nobody to come from nowhere and suddenly gain recognition and become a well known someone. The internet has been continually leveling the playing field so that you don\u2019t need million in capital or marketing to get your ideas, creations and business into the spotlight. 10 year-olds are making thousands off their viral YouTube videos. Anyone with a business idea can start a website and get going for little to no capital. Even Twitter (which I am not a big fan of) can launch people into the spotlight if they can work the system in the right way. Many people are getting huge jobs because companies are seeing how well their content does on the web. For example, Fede Alvarez, a director from Uruguay, recently had this short film go viral and was offered $30 million from a Hollywood company to direct a film for them. The internet is the perfect tool for capitalism, entrepreneurship, and dreaming. Whatever you can dream up, you can make possible on the World Wide Web. ",

            "answer_text": "1. Jet Pack International H202 Jet Pack International are making great strides in jetpack technology H202 and H202-Z jetpacks. As the name suggests, both the H202 and H202-Z are hydrogen peroxide-fueled jetpacks that will allow uers to fly at up to 77 miles per hourat a maximum height of 250 feet. So far thought, the higher-capacity H202-Z is only capable of a maximum flight length of 33 seconds and a maximum travel distance of 3,300 feet.  But you have to admit, it\u2019s a start. The Jet Pack International units have great potential, and the lacking travel time and distance is outweighed by how mobile and controllable the flight is, not to mention how compact the units actually are. The Jet Pack International H202 and H202-Z are actually currently available, albeit not commercially: you can assemble the jetpack yourself, if you have $100,000 lying around. 2. Aerofex Aero-X If you\u2019re a Star Wars fan, the Aerofex Aero-X, a real-life equivalent of the Star Wars speeder bike, is definitely something you\u2019ll want to keep your eyes on. The Aero-X is the result of more than 15 years of research and development. Powered by a water-cooled 240 horsepower engine and two large rotors, the Aero-Xcan hover at an altitude of 12 feet and at speeds of up to 45 miles per hour power. It can also carry up to 310 pounds. Think of the potential.  Also, as a result of this extended research and development period, Aerofex claims to have overcome the dangerous coupling effect that can arise due to using two rotors, ensuring that the Aero-X will be safe and easy to control. The Aero-X is currently available for preorder for a refundable $5000 deposit. The final unit is scheduled to be available in 2017 at the price of $85,000. 3. Prosthetics With A Sense Of Touch In March 2013, Denis Aabo Sorensen had the privilege of testing a new type of prosthetic hand, created by a group of European engineers and scientists. Unlike conventional prosthetics, the new prosthetic hand connects directly to the remaining nerves in Denis\u2019 upper arm. This means that the \u201chand\u201d has a sense of touch and is actually controllable. Blindfolded tests showed that Denis was indeed able to differentiate between different items such as a bottle, a baseball and a mandarin orange. It also could exert different levels of pressure, allowing Denis to touch, hold or grab something.  While this prosthetic hand is indeed a great leap forward, it\u2019s still far from ready for widespread use: the arm required electrodes to be implanted directly into Sorensen, and tests still need to be carried out to determine the durability of these electrodes. In addition, the hand required a lot of processing power, and was hooked up to a laptop; researchers are working on making the processing computer small enough to be integrated within the implant itself.
