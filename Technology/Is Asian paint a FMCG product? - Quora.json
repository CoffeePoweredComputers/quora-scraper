            "answer_text": "Well paint is not exactly an fmcg product as far as the end use is concerned. It lies somewhere between consumer durables and fmcg. But for the comparison and industry purpose Asian paints is considered to be top class fmcg company which thinks, strategise and acts like a typical fmcg company. Right from the supply chain to sales and distribution channels everything is comparable to fmcg companies. It even falls in top 10 fmcg companies in many rankings. Also the people do switch to other fmcg companies and vise versa. Hope this helps. Thanks. Cheers ",
