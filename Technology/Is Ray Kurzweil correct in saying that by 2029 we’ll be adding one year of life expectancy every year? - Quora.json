            "answer_text": "Probably not, especially not for most people, but it\u2019s really not impossible. By the mid to late 2020s we could have a wide range of anti-aging therapies available, which could be sufficient to add decade or more to our healthy lifespan. Dr. David Sinclair is working on developing NAD+ boosters, which have showed the ability to rejuvenate mice and extend their life, and if it all goes well, we should have such drugs really available for humans by the mid 20s. Companies such as Unity biotechnology are developing senolytics, which already showed the ability to rejuvenate mice and extend their life, and if it all goes well, we should have such drugs available for humans by the mid 20s. Few weeks ago Company Libella Gene Therapeutics started human trials with telomere extending gene therapy, developed by Dr. Bill Andrews, which might also extend healthy human lifespan. This could also be available by the mid 20s. Countless companies are developing many different stem cell therapies which will be applicable for treating aging. For example, when you threat the hypothalamus of an old mice with stem cells, you rejuvenate them and extend their life. Dr. George Church has stated that, they plan on developing rejuvenating gene therapies within 10 years. Then there\u2019s Google\u2019s Calico, with a budged of 1.5+ billion dollars and a mission to cure aging, who know what the hell they are doing. Then there are also therapies such as CAR-T Cell therapy against cancer, which could also add some years, if we perfect it and make it cheaper. And all of this is just scratching the surface. So, if a decade from now we are able to add more than a decade to our remaining lifespan, that means we will be further away from the diseases and disabilities of old age than we are today, and if science continues to accelerate we should be able to continue adding more than 1 year per a year.

            "answer_text": "Thanks for the A2A. I think it\u2019s realistic with some caveats. I don\u2019t think it will be true for the broad population by 2024 because the most people don\u2019t care about their health. More accurately, most people take their health for granted. But for the people who care about their health, who stay aware of and focused on doing all that they can to be healthy, we are pretty close, even now, to being able to add one year of life expectancy for each year that passes. Kurzweil has even claimed as much about himself in a recent interview with Peter Diamondis, that he thinks he\u2019s added more than a year to his life span for each year passing, based on his own assessments. By my own outside vantage, he does seem younger to me now than he did a few years ago. I am one of those people who doesn\u2019t take my health for granted, but considers my health as being on the short-list of my primary focuses in life. I definitely feel younger at 57 than I did at 53. I was probably my oldest at 53. I noticed I wasn\u2019t able to jump, and I didn\u2019t like taking stairs, and that woke me up and I started back into focusing on my health again, after 5 years of lost focus. With each passing year since I\u2019ve regained my focus, all my capacities have been increasing. Most notably, my strength in all but one exercise is at an all-time high, surpassing even what I could do at age 40 when I was previously at my strongest point in life. I\u2019m working to do the same with my speed and flexibility. The idea of adding a year to your life span for each passing year is not as far fetched as it seems. If you look at the broad actuarial tables that the life insurance industry uses to rate the likelihood of you living through the next few years, the tables have been shifting about 2 and a half years per decade. By these mathematically incontrovertible evidence, people added about a decade to their life expectancy over the 40 years from 1960 to 2000. I was born in 1960. By the time I reached 40 the life expectancy in the tables were about the same as it had been for a 30 year old at the time when I was born. So biologically, all of us 40 year-olds were more like prior 30-year-olds than prior 40-year-olds. This trend was speeding up between 1990 and 2010, but then reversed a little post 2010, before resuming course more recently. So I don\u2019t think 2024 applies to the entire populace as much as it does to people who pay attention to their health. I think the entire populace will be adding about 6 months to their life expectancy every year come 2024. Currently they\u2019re adding about 4 months. There\u2019s definitely enough science going on to make it possible for everyone to reach that point, but most people won\u2019t take advantage of it. ",
