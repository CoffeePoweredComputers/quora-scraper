            "answer_text": "The Whirlwind would have been at a serious disadvantage above 23,000ft, but not because of \u2018engine problems\u2019 as is commonly stated but instead due to propeller blades that were too thick and hit compressibility drag issues at height. Air Vice Marshal Dowding would not introduce the few Whirlwinds available into the Battle of Britain for that very reason. Low down, however, they proved later, in their few encounters with the Luftwaffe, to be effective bomber destroyers and able to take on fighters on what the pilots certainly felt were equal terms. The only severe losses were when they were \u2018bounced\u2019 by superior numbers of FW\u2019s during the Channel Dash - and that would have happened regardless of aircraft type. When they found their forte, attacking ground targets in occupied France, they did a lot of damage to the Luftwaffe on the ground, destroying very may aircraft on French airfields. In that respect they were very effective indeed against the Luftwaffe. ",
