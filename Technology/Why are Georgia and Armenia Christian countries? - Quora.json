            "answer_text": "After the death of Jesus, various apostles made their way to the region to preach Christianity. The apostles Bartholomew and Thaddeus preached in Armenia and had some success, the former eventually being killed by the Armenian king at the time for his activities. The apostle Andrew preached in Georgia, also achieving success, and possibly being joined by Bartholomew and Thaddeus from Armenia. Christianity grew as a minor religion in these territories until the Roman region of Cappadocia, which bordered Armenia, became majority Christian. Influential figures, particularly Gregory \u201cthe Illuminator\u201d, made their way across the border from Cappadocia into Armenia to further spread the religion. Eventually Gregory was able to convince the King of Armenia to adopt Christianity as a state religion. Soon Georgia, under heavy influence from Armenia at the time, followed suit. Later the entire Roman Empire adopted Christianity officially, solidifying a Christian axis in the region. The domination of Christianity continued for centuries as Rome was replaced by Byzantium. With the invasion of the Arabs, and centuries later the arrival of the Turks, Islam became dominant in the region, but Armenians and Georgians held on to Christianity as it was integral to their national identities.
