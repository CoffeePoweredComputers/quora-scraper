            "answer_text": "Predjudice Some senior citizens struggle with societal predjudices that promotes the perception that senior citizens are unable to absorb new technology. Such predjudice creates an unfair disadvantage for older workers and is, unfortunately, a self-fulfilling philosophy for some older people. Such predjudice Contributes to people approaching older people in amazingly patronizing ways when explaining technology.Is a cause of age discrimination in hiring. I've hit this wall myself despite being an early adopter of stuff for over 40 yearsIs sadly believed by some older people who give up and walk away from useful tech.Impacts retail sales because some older people get mistreated by some sales people at the mobile phone or electronics store (despite having large disposable incomes). I prefer to shop online because nobody can see my gray hair and avoids me in the aisles.Specific age-related difficulties As far as specific age-related barriers go, let's look at specific challenges, and not lump people of a certain age into a category of \u201cstruggles with technology.\u201d Some but but not all, older people have challenges that occur because they are older. Many of these challenges are not unique to older people. Some senior citizens have challenges seeing or hearing. These difficulties also occur to people who are younger, have been injured, or who have congenital problems. These difficulties can be mitigated by good reading glasses, hearing aids. They also can be helped by use of special fonts on screen and phones and Bluetooth and wifi accessories that intereconnect devices. Or speech synthesizers.Some senior citizens have impaired memory. As do some people of all ages, such as those with PTSD, traumatic brain injuries, ADHD, or other learning conditions. These difficulties can, to some degree, be mitigated by technology itself. Consider reminder apps, etc.Some senior citizens reject some technology. As do some people of all ages. Just because a person rejects snapchat or tinder and won't return texts immediately does not make them unable to learn other technologies. I've seen some really dumb questions on Quora by younger people who seem to have their own challenges with technology beyond snapchat and tinder.Some senior citizens are rigid and set in their ways. But so are some people of all ages. And consider that many older people have been eagerly adopting wave after wave of new technology since the 1960s. I can't keep up with my 80 year old dad, for example.Some senior citizens are not agile or nimble-fingered because of arthritis or other problems. As are some people of all ages with various conditions and injuries. Again, some of these challenges can be addressed by education or tech itself. Or by subtle redesign of tech.My point is that, if there is a specific challenge or disability, the specific challenge should be addressed and mitigated directly, not by prejudicing an entire category of citizens in ways that deny them access to technology. Being challenged by adoption of new technology is nothing new I worked in the workforce in jobs where I was tasked with introducing technology to coworkers from 1976\u20132006. I was responsible for software and computer design, implementation, training, and selection in the workplace in several companies. This was long before the Internet. Regardless of age, some people didn't want to have a computer in their office. Many people wouldn't use email when it was first introduced. Many people would not use word processors or spreadsheets because they thought they were for secretaries or bookkeepers only. Etc. Believe me, there were plenty of people of all ages who were challenged by technology and fought introduction of computers and software into their jobs. Sometimes rather loudly. This was not just a problem with older people. But eventually most people learned and adopted the technology. Consider that many senior citizens who are now in their 80s have been using technology since before many Quorans were born. ",

            "answer_text": "To me the real challenge for the Senior Citizen is not only the wording of certain things as it is the technology itself. When one looks at a computer or other piece of technology, just the size of it and what this item can do, can be so overwelming that this alone can lead to difficulties; itself. Many older people grew up in a world where things were in general large in size. These machines had to be this way, just to work. The knowledge to put such knowings into somwething so small was beyond the abilities of a senior citizen to be able to comprehend. To be able to hold a Iphone in ones hand and walk down the street talking to someone else miles away is just mind blowing to a Senior Citizen. The concepts of this form of technology is so advanced that it can cause issues never seen before in the human race. It is like a form of culture shock for the Senior Citizen to grasp. ",

            "answer_text": "The main struggle they face is the attitude that new technology is beyond them, and that only younger people can get it. That attitude has no basis in fact, as new technology is designed to be easy and fast to use. I recently had occasion to wait in line at a bank in a  heavily immigrant, non-native speaker, lower income area and I noticed that every person in line was using a smart phone. It told me there is no \"digital divide\" other than access to the devices themselves and willingness to use them. I am writing this answer with my thumb, if I didn't have use of my thumb I could use any other finger, albeit a little slower. If I didn't have fingers I could use my voice. The biggest barrier to anyone who doesn't use the new technology is just attitude. ",

            "answer_text": "There are two issues with seniors (and indeed people in middle age as well) when learning new things - Habit, and Brain chemistry. Habit - You've heard the old saying \"You can't teach an old dog new tricks\". While that is not true, the saying does come about because it is a bit tougher to teach people something when they already have a habit to do something a different way - you have to unlearn the old way the same time you are learning things the new way. Brain chemistry - As you get older, your cognitive functions and memory start to decline - not drastically, but it does add up over time. It becomes slightly harder to figure things out, and slightly harder to recall things, and you have to rely upon habit (see above) to help you out. ",

I realized that the concept of \"MENU\" is the key point. When I tried to explain anything like searching a phone numer using vieotext (in the 80s 90s), or selecting some options using the TV Remote Control, accessing the menu, she said \"what menu ? are we in a restaurant ?\"This may look kindly funny, but I think this a a point.

Not setting a goal Aside of these significant barriers seniors may face, there is another very common one: seniors often mention the lack of instructions and guidance. So why not teach mom and dad the basics so they can do all they need without asking for you to intervene? The world has evolved, and it is becoming more and more important for seniors to keep learning. We built a site easytechseniors.com to show how seniors can use new technology. You can get more details there. ",
