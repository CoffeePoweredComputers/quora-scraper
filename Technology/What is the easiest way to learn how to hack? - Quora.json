            "answer_text": "First, ask yourself why you want to learn the craft. It takes time, skill, and persistence to be a hacker, plus a particular type of person to be successful. Assuming you are certain you wish to proceed, there are several important steps you should follow. First and foremost, purchase a small server-class machine or build a robust (and isolated!) virtual machine to use for accessing useful sites and resources and for practicing your skills. Do not connect this machine to any of your internal networks, as you don\u2019t want to potentially spread malware to your own systems. Once you\u2019ve established a secure environment for learning and testing, remember these three points: Listen. This includes reading material and/or making note of the discussions of others. Pay special attention to any information you can verify through testing or observation and after careful analysis, throw out the useless or obviously incorrect information sometimes obtained via the Internet;Question. Ask questions from those who already practice the craft. Don\u2019t worry about your questions being basic or simplistic, you\u2019re learning so there really are no stupid questions. That being said, try to ask intelligent, well-formed questions which will (hopefully) give you intelligent answers. As time progresses, you\u2019ll figure out who knows their sh*t and who is just full of it; \ud83d\ude09Practice. Assess the risk and for those acceptable to you, load up an appropriate tool in your secure environment and try to replicate the activities you\u2019ve seen or learned up to that point. Once you\u2019ve been successful, try it again using a different tool or method. Keep practicing until the concepts and mechanisms become established in your mind, then practice some more.These steps may seem simple but they work to get you started. And ultimately, that\u2019s what you want, to get started so you can develop your own methods, scripts, preferred attack vectors, etc. All of which should lead to increasing your curiosity and ramping up the desire to learn more complex concepts. Sorry to be the bearer of bad news but the learning never ends! Hope this helps and welcome to the club! ",

As long as you\u2019re hacking your own computers, there is absolutely nothing that anybody can tell you. Just make sure something doesn\u2019t escape from your network, or that you don\u2019t accidentally direct some tool to the wrong IP address or something (that\u2019s why \u201clab\u201d networks usually aren\u2019t connected to the router at all). Otherwise, you can learn to hack from the Internet. Google \u201clearn to hack\u201d. ",
