            "answer_text": "You're better off getting a Concept 2 rowing machine, which can be had for a bit less than $1000 and at that price point completely blows any home elliptical machine out of the water for durability. In coaching fitness, I have never found a piece of exercise equipment which matched the full body results, efficiency, and durability of indoor rowing, which I myself have done since sophomore year in college--20 something years ago. You probably won't be able to handle 90 minutes a day, but the calorie readout it much more accurate than the typical elliptical machine, the exercise is low-no impact, and it conditions virtually your entire body. Between rowing, pushups, squats, and perhaps pullups if you can do them you essentially have all you need to train your entire body. Good luck with your search; if you decide to opt for a rower certainly check out used--they can be had for even less and effectively last forever. ",
