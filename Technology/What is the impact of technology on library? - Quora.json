            "answer_text": "In short, fundamental and profound. Libraries have gone from warehouses of books with Librarians acting as \u201ckeepers of the knowledge,\u201d so to speak, to now being spaces and places where individual learning can happen in a variety of ways. Librarians are now creators of content for library users, pulling together and culling facts and figures from the internet, local resources, and primary sources in print, audio, video, and digital formats to help the user find the answer they are looking for. And, yes, they still will pull a great read from the shelf to share with an interested reader. A modern library may now have available - besides print books and magazines and newspapers - computers, tablets, e-readers, kiosks that print out short stories or novels, online keyword-searchable catalogs (replacing the venerable card catalog of old), makerspaces, culinary centers with state-of-the-art cooking equipment, audiovisual studios, commons where people can meet and network face-to-face.
