            "answer_text": "One reason is because most people live in or near cities that are brightly lit at night. Dust in the air above scatters and reflects this light. The result is that the air itself is brighter than most stars and all artificial satellites. One exception: the ISS is so bright that, like the Moon, it is visible anywhere on clear nights when it passes overhead. Once my area had a power failure on a warm summer night. We lay on the grass and watched many sats passing overhead during the unusual dark-sky opportunity. ",

            "answer_text": "Because the moon is more than 2,000 miles across, but there's no artificial satellite bigger than a school bus (except the International Space Station). Also, it's not correct to say that you can't see any artificial satellites. There are several of them that you CAN see if you know when and where to look. In the night sky, they look like moving stars. ",
