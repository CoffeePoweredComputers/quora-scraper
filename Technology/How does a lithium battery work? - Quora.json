            "answer_text": "Like any battery, a lithium-ion battery is also made up of units called cells. These cells are known to generate power. Each cell consists of three essential components: an anode, a cathode and an electrolyte between them. Additionally, it has separator and current collectors. The anode and cathodes are known to store the lithium whereas the electrolyte is the medium through which they are transferred through the separator. When the battery is charging , the cathode gives up some of its lithium ions, which move through the electrolyte to the anode and remain there. The battery stores energy during this process. During discharging, the lithium ions move back across the electrolyte to the cathode, producing the energy that powers the battery. In both processes, electrons flow around the outer circuit to complete the process. Electrons do not (and must not) flow through the electrolyte. This would act as a disadvantage for the battery. The movement of these lithium ions happens at a fairly high voltage, so each cell produces 3.7 volts. This is much higher than the 1.5 volts typical of a normal AA alkaline cell that you buy at the supermarket. Sony\u2019s original lithium-ion battery used coke as the anode (coal product). But, Since 1997, most Li ion manufacturers, including Sony, have shifted to graphite to attain better performance. ",

            "answer_text": " Schematic of a LIB. The negative electrode is a graphitic carbon that holds Li in its layers, whereas the positive electrode is a Li-intercalation compound usually an oxide because of its higher potential that often is characterized by a layered structure. Both electrodes are able to reversibly insert and remove Li ions from their respective structures. On charging, Li ions are removed or deintercalated from the layered oxide compound and intercalated into the graphite layers. The process is reversed on discharge.The electrodes are separated by a nonaqueous electrolyte that transports Li ions between the electrodes. cite from doi: 10.1126/science.1212741. ",
