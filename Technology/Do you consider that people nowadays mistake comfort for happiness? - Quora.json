            "answer_text": "Yes. Comfort is a form of pleasure, which is often mistaken for happiness; it \u201cpleases\u201d the senses. Pleasure seeking in our culture has become endemic in many forms from food, to alcohol, fashion, body image, drugs, sex, power, living conditions, cars, and other things. The problem with \u201c\u201cpleasure seeking\u201d is there is never enough to keep us satisfied or content; we constantly want more: \u201c\u201csuper sized\u201d beverages, \u201cdouble burger\u201d, \u201cthe works\u201d, \u201cthe best\u201d, \u201cfastest\u201d, etc. Of course, \u201ccomfort\u201d is relative, and for a homeless person, it might be a piece of cardboard. For others, it might be a 20 room mansion with a staff of 8. The real question is \u201cwant vs. need\u201d. unfortunately, our culture has glorified certain lifestyles as the goal in life to find happiness; all of which are heavy on comfort. Its definitely more \u201ccomfortable\u201d to fly on a private jet, than to deal with the hassle of airports and crowded planes. But, do we really need it? Problems like crowded airports are simply a normal part of life, as is waiting in line at the drivers license office. If we construct the mental picture that \u201cwe\u201d shouldn\u2019t have to endure this violation of our time and comfort, we are creating a mind set for constant frustration, anger, and unhappiness. When we realistically ask ourselves what \u201ccomforts\u201d we actually need, they are not much, and simpler is better. We didn\u2019t need a flashy, expensive car to go shopping, or see the doctor; they cost too much, and get beat up in parking lots. We don\u2019t need a lavish home, when something simple, secure, quiet, and warm will suffice. We don\u2019t need an \u201chaute cuisine\u201d meal, when all we really need is nourishment. Do we: \u201clive to eat, or eat to live\u201d? simple things are truly more beneficial for happiness because we are no longer shackled by a constant quest for something better (which we don\u2019t actually \u201cneed\u201d). There\u2019s an old adage attributed to Ghandi that is appropriate here: \u201cThere is always enough for need, but never enough for greed\u201d. Metta ",

            "answer_text": "When we have many choice and we choose the wrong one that can be called as mistake but when your number of choices are already fixed and you are told you have full freedom to make your decision. You have right to choose. And finally you made your decision and start running whole life because of your single choice. That is called slavery not mistake, While making choice you were not even aware that this one choice will cost you your whole life. But do we have any other choice ? For now, No. We have structured our whole economy, business, politics around survival. Survival of the fittest is the motto of current economic model not happiness. Comfort is luxury for people nowadays forget happiness. ",
