            "answer_text": "One word : Rule 34[1] But , This is a pretty paradoxical question to answer! Any information which is not on the internet, if was written here, would then be on the internet , and hence it would be on the internet and would not count as information not on the internet !! However there is actually a lot of information not on the internet, when you talk about personal lives, personal details and other confidential information ( which may be on the cloud , but not accessible to the public) But most knowledge will be there in some form or the other. Also there is a dark web which is a lot larger than the internet most of us are used to and hence even if you can't find it , it's still there. Just a bit harder to reach Cheers!
