It also has reviews and how-to-do videos which are very helpful.The Verge- created in 2011 is an excellent source for any information related to smartphones, laptop and tablets.TEA- all news about Apple and includes podcast and reviews. It also approached major news on the technology field.These are the three websites I use everyday for tech news and I find them extremely useful ",
