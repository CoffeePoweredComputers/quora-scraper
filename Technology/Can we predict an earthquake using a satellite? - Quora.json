            "answer_text": "NO. It is not currently possible to predict earthquakes by any means. It is accepted in some quarters that major earthquakes occur at the Full moon and New moon, or within a few days of those occurrences. There are many instances where this has happened, too many in fact to categorically deny the probability that it is the case. This is disputed by others, but mainly those who also believe that CO2 is responsible for climate changed. ",
