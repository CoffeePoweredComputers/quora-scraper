            "answer_text": "Wireless networks are a large universe with multiple architectural implementations and standards. I would suggest you to zero in to areas, for example: mobile network, wifi, satellite communication network etc. All these wireless networks follow an evolutionary path through new technology advances. Since wireless translates to mobility or area of coverage , all wireless networks have an access part which is visible (for example cell towers, WiFi hotspots, satellite dishes/ antenna,etc.) and a core part which is a convergence area for the access network device\u200bs. In short start with an architecture diagram for any of these technology areas I mentioned above. Start with overall technology overview, basic functionalities of devices. Then get into the medium or interfaces and protocols basis the communication or call flows. All these terms can be googled for resources - for example: 4G Network architecture, etc. Read blogs which will provide key information. Further, depending upon your palatability or requirements for complex technical know how you can read technical specifications or standards for bodies like 3GPP, ITU-T, IEEE. And of course, keep asking questions on Quora :) ",
