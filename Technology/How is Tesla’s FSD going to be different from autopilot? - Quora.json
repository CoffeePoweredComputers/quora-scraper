            "answer_text": "It\u2019s a little bit confusing because some of the FSD features used to be included in Autopilot - but no longer are. Autopilot is essentially the same kinds of enhanced cruise control and lane-centering steering that many other cars have. Tesla describe it as: Enables your car to steer, accelerate and brake automatically for other vehicles and pedestrians within its lane. So you put the car into the lane you want and set your speed preferences - then the car will speed up and slow down for vehicles and people ahead of you - and steer to stay in the lane you chose. That includes emergency braking and collision/lane departure warnings. FSD is CURRENTLY: On highways: Pretty much the car drives itself - so it changes lanes as needed for slow traffic, changes lanes to avoid roadworks, merges into traffic and handles traffic merging into it\u2019s lane. It gets you into the correct exit lane when the SatNav System says it\u2019s time to turn off. It puts on the turn signal as needed. It works hard to avoid a crash if some idiot strays into your lane. It knows about speed limits\u2026pretty much everything. You can\u2019t yet sleep while it drives - but it\u2019s getting so good now that you almost could.In town: It manages speed and steering WITHIN YOUR LANE but doesn\u2019t change lanes automatically. It stops at STOP signs and at red traffic signals - but still requires you to tap the gas pedal to give it permission to move off again - unless you\u2019re behind another car, when it\u2019ll do it automatically. It doesn\u2019t turn corners - and it\u2019s kinda patchy on really complicated junctions.In parking lots: It can literally drive itself - you don\u2019t even need to be sitting in the car. You can park your car - go off and do shopping, then when you\u2019re standing at the edge of the parking lot - push and hold a button on the Tesla phone app and your car will drive across the parking lot and pick you up. They call this \u201cAdvanced Summon\u201d - you summon the car - and it comes to you. This is mind-blowing! The car backs out of the parking place, avoids people, shopping carts, politely lets other cars out, figures out how to get through the maze of lines of cars - and stops right in front of you. It also has autopark - so you can drive slowly past a line of parked cars - and if the Tesla can see an empty space that\u2019s big enough - it flashes a \u201cP\u201d at you and you can tell it to park itself - either in parallel parking or nose out/nose in parking..COMING SOON: The key thing about FSD is that you\u2019re buying **FULL** self driving - even though that\u2019s not all working yet. You\u2019ll get it in small steps just as soon as Tesla pushes their software closer and closer to it. So you get free updates that the car downloads and installs for you. The expectation is that once the software is done and the law changes, you can sit in the back seat of your car and fall asleep as it drives you wherever you want to go. They have an experimental version out there which self-drives in town, taking turns, overtaking, etc, etc. That\u2019s expected to be out by December. CONFUSIONS: For cars more than maybe about 18 months old (I think) some of the FSD features are available in AutoPilot-only cars. My son didn\u2019t get FSD - but he does have \u201cAdvanced Summon\u201d, for example. But new cars have only the features I described above. If you\u2019re looking at a used Tesla\u2026you might want to see if it has the better version or not.The very cheapest Tesla (the Model 3 \u201cStandard Range\u201d - which you can only order by phoning Tesla directly) doesn\u2019t even have AutoPilot. But the cheapest on their web site (the \u201cStandard Range PLUS\u201d) has it.Tesla did have a thing where existing Autopilot owners could buy some of the FSD features for (IIRC) about $2,000\u2026so that\u2019s a kind of intermediate level.You can buy FSD as an after-market thing. But the price is going up rapidly as the software gets more and more capable. I paid $6,000 for it on my car a year ago. Since then, it went up to $7,000 then $8,000 and just today, they announced that it\u2019s going up to $10,000.They\u2019re also talking about you being able to rent the autopilot software\u2026so maybe if you\u2019re going on a long road trip - you rent it so you can let the car drive you where you\u2019re going. I haven\u2019t seen any news about the price of that.",

            "answer_text": "There have been several Tesla self-driving products. Note that Tesla has an array of advanced driver assistance and safety systems that are standard on the cars, apart from the self-driving options, and not covered here. Enhanced Autopilot (EAP) Convenience Feature This feature was available on late 2014 Tesla cars forward. I don\u2019t exactly when it was discontinued\u2014sometime after August of 2018 when I bought it. It was originally part of the \u201ctech package.\u201d The product originally used the MobilEye system (2014 - October 2016) and had these features: Autopark \u2014 parallel and perpendicularAuto lane change (the car would change lanes when the driver activated the turn signal)Traffic-aware cruise controlAutosteer (only works well on divided highways)Speed assist (warns when the driver is speeding and displays current speed limit)Summon (the car can move up to 39 ft in a straight line by remote control)Tesla changed self-driving hardware and software in November of 2016 from the one-camera MobilEye system to its 8-camera system using an NVIDIA Drive PX-2 computer chip and Tesla\u2019s own software (then called TeslaVision). Eventually the software reached the point where it was on parity with the MobilEye system, and it began to perform better on secondary roads thereafter. Tesla sold Enhanced Autopilot at various prices, but the feature set was pretty much the same. Full Self-Driving (FSD) was first sold as an add-on to Enhanced Autopilot. For over a year, FSD did nothing that EAP didn\u2019t already do. People who purchased EAP with the new hardware got a free upgrade from the NVIDIA-based computer to a new Tesla FSD computer based on its own custom chip. Eventually Tesla discontinued the EAP/FSD combo, replacing it with Autopilot and FSD, with Autopilot a standard feature on all cars. Autopilot Autopilot is a standard feature on all Tesla cars now. It consists of: Traffic-aware cruise controlAutosteerBasically what the car will do is maintain speed, and a safe following distance behind other cars, and it will keep the car in its lane, both on a controlled access highway and on a rural highway. Quite a few modern cars do this basic function. And limited as it is, Autopilot is a great way to relieve stress on a long trip. FSD Full Self-Driving continues to evolve and there is right now an FSD Beta available to some customers. Here\u2019s what FSD does (BETA identified where applicable): AutoPark \u2014 parallel and perpendicular parkingAuto lane change (the car will change lanes when the driver activates the turn signal)Traffic-aware cruise control (maintains speed and following distance)Autosteer (keeps car within its lane)Speed assist (displays speed information from posted signs and maps, and indicates when the driver is speeding)Summon (the car can move up to 39 ft in a straight line by remote control)Advanced Summon (the car can drive within a parking lot with no one in the driver\u2019s seat to a designated point using the Tesla smartphone app)Navigate on Autopilot (the car decides when it needs to changes lanes on a controlled access highway, it can automatically take exits and merge from an on-ramp)Traffic signal chime (chimes when the light turns green)Stop sign and traffic signal controls (the car automatically stops for stop signs and red lights).Vehicle shows traffic signals, trash cans, traffic cones, other cars and pedestrians on the screen.Car will obey traffic signs and signals, automatically making turns at intersections under navigation (BETA)Car will navigate roundabouts (BETA)The two BETA features listed pretty much complete FSD. What remains is to improve its reliability and to handle more special situations. The ultimate goal is to remove the requirement for a human driver entirely.
