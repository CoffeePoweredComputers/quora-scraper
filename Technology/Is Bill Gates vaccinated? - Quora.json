            "answer_text": "Yes he is. I don\u2019t know what the deal with that other dude is, but Gates runs a massive charity that ships vaccines to Africa trying to eradicate a number of often fatal diseases from the continent. He certainly believes in their efficacy, so I assume he himself is vaccinated. As an aside, he\u2019s done more to help the developing world than 1000 Mother Theresas could in their lifetimes. ",

            "answer_text": "Vaccinated for what? If you mean for COVID-19 then the answer is no. There is at this point no approuved vaccine for it. I doubt he would be a test subject. Has he received other vaccines? He probably received the normal vaccines other people receive: childhood vaccines, those required or recommanded when travelling to various regions of the globe. That\u2019s the sensible thing to do. Unless you\u2019re one of those conspiracy theorists who thinks vaccines contain mind control chips, which is not a sensible thing to think in the first place.
