            "answer_text": "While many people would suggest Marques Brownlee aka MKBHD, I think Michael Fisher aka Mr.Mobile is a better one. He is not known like MKBHD and his reviews are not always the first, but he does take his time for each review and its just amazing. In depth review and great explanation. The Verge also has pretty good reviews. It has a whole team dedicated for different products. So they are in depth and also on time. The videos are great and they have other stuff too like \u201cHistory of Android\u201d, \u201cDifference between displays\u201d and many more. ",

            "answer_text": "Well , this goes back to my 9 the grade. I was a huge fan of MKBHD ( Marques Brownlee) .He gives a full technical review mostly of flagship phones and tries his best at jokes ( but fails terribly) . But Unbox Therapy is really good both at the technical side as well as the humour part So if you're looking for some entertainment with the usual reviews then Unbox Therapy is best. But if you want a more technical review you must really go to Mkbhd. Here's a link to both the channels Mkbhd:Marques Brownlee Unbox Therapy:Unbox Therapy Thanks Pranav. ",
