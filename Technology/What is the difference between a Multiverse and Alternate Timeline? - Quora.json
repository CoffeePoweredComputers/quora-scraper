            "answer_text": "One of the genuinely best comic questions I came across rather than to see something like Superman vs Goku and Goku vs One punch man who would win stuff. Multiverse: A Multiverse is explained as multiple universes with different realities. Yeah! This explanation sucks anyway! Let\u2019s do a better job of explaining this. As I said a multiverse is a multiple number of universes. Suppose you live in Universe-1 and you work as a detective here.In Universe-2, you are a smuggler. There should be an evil version of you, it\u2019s more fun.Maybe in universe-3, you are a world leader with psychic powers. Psychic is cool.It can vary to anything. Like in The Flash TV show, Barry Allen is a speedster in Earth-1, a geek in Earth-2.  In easy words, you exist in all the universes but you have different abilities and qualities. More or less like a parallel universe. Alternate Timeline: Alternative timelines happen within the same universe or better yet, the same Earth you are living in. This is a little crazy! Suppose, you are currently a detective in this Earth and mysteriously, you can travel through time. With the help of the TARDIS, maybe.You have a partner (Simon) and a girlfriend (Emma).One normal day you don\u2019t like something you came across and travel back in time to change the past. We all want that, don\u2019t we?You do that successfully but you see that, due to the change in the past, you also altered a few other things. Your partner (Simon) is a homeless drunk and your girlfriend (Emma) is your new boss! Female bosses are bad-ass, trust me!The worst or the best part of an Alternate Timeline is you're the only one who will remember what happened in the previous timeline and the others will be leading a normal life with no memory of the previous timeline. Like in The Flash, Barry Allen saves his mother to see that Wally West is the new Flash and Iris West doesn\u2019t even know who Barry is. Didn\u2019t get a simple image to explain this event! Hope this helps. Thanks! ",

            "answer_text": "All multiverse are generated with the difference in decisions at a particular time in that universe. Alternate timelines are restricted subset of multiverse generated by alternations in actions pertaining to a shorter frame os time (where human lived) For example. 10 universes are created when I go from my office to my home due to my or someone else\u2019s actions causing differences in the fate of my son ranging from he being an engineer when adult to not being born. such small alternations cause a small change in realities and we can say alternative timelines. But when we see a larger time frame there is a great chance that a small decision may cause a drastic change in the fate of massive lifeforms. For example, Hitler being good causing no mass destruction. It will cause a huge change and a resulting universe will not be just an alternative timeline but will pass the threshold to be called an alternate universe. Just as the accumulation of mutations cause the new organism to called a new species. One more example could be no ice age to kill the dinosaurs and in current time the universe is flooded with them and very fewer humans or not at all. As well exemplified in the movie \u201cJustice League: Crisis on Two Earths\u201d: Owlman wants to destroy primitive earth causing all realities to destroy. Actually meaning go back in time where destroying earth will ensure no evolution of life forms. It is a perfect poetic explanation showing how space alternates are generated due to time and how difference in-universe is directly related to time as the change increases between two universe as the time proceeds beyond the changing event.
