            "answer_text": "Let\u2019s walk down the path a bit. Climate Change is how the Earth\u2019s climate systems are changing from human impacts. It is the results of the advances of human technology. The burning of fuel and its byproducts, the ways we change how the land is. Both of these have increased by large amounts over roughly the last 50\u2013300 years. Humans of some sort have been around for a few million years, but ones like us only for a few tens of thousands of years. Most of both of those has been during climatic conditions colder than now. But the major strides in human advancement have taken place though only over about the last 12,000 years, during the Holocene, where the climate has been pretty much like it is now; around 14\u201315 degrees Celsius. The stability of this interglacial has allowed many things to happen. Our history goes back about 5,000 years with the rise of writing, but it\u2019s only been since the 1700s, more so since the 1800s, and even more so since the mid 1900s, that the bulk of the technological advances have occurred. The negative aspects of a changing climate (regardless of what tenths or few degrees that is, and regardless of exactly how much is due only to us) are many, depending on if the change is up or down, the time frame and the aspect. But of course not every aspect is negative or negative to everyone. And many of the impacts are not to humans, but to other life both animal and vegetable, many of which we certainly rely upon. Other of the impacts are to the planet itself, which on their own are immaterial (it is not alive or feeling) but the results of which many times have an effect upon the living things upon it. So, the rapid changes to the environment since the 1850s and especially since the 1970s, are the results of science, knowledge, learning, technology. We\u2019re smart enough to create the things that can be damaging and likewise to recognize the damage, it\u2019s difficult to do one without noticing the other. It would seem we\u2019re also smart enough to be able to figure out ways to either adapt to or mitigate the damage. The advance of technology is not stagnant, it grows, it improves, it becomes more efficient and faster and less expensive and cleaner. Not perfectly, not without cost, not as quickly as some imagine it should. The world in 2018 isn\u2019t like the one in 1968. The world in 2068 won\u2019t be like the one now. The question is, what would lead us to believe that technology won\u2019t solve the same problems it created? There is awareness, work being done on all sorts of areas that can solve various problems, research and development continues. The answer is that more than likely technology will solve the issues that exist, but just remember; scientists provide knowledge and information, it\u2019s the people implementing policy (in both government and business) and the general populace though a variety of methods, that will make it work. If that\u2019s true or not, only time will tell. But again, what would make us think things won\u2019t continue to get better? ",

            "answer_text": "Probably not, but it\u2019ll make a few people an enormous amount of money. Climate Change isn\u2019t a problem to be solved; it\u2019s been going on for 4.5 billion years, and life deals with it. \u201cNone so outraged as a Vested Interest masquerading as a Moral Principle.\u201d By making it a problem, it now allows the Vested Interests to create solutions that will make them money/ gain them power. Remember, all the \u2018problems\u2019 of climate change are models; the actual weather isn\u2019t bad, and weather events - hurricanes, droughts, floods, tornadoes and etc - are less extreme than they\u2019ve been in the recent past. The Antarctic isn\u2019t melting; Greenland\u2019s edges might be, but it\u2019s interior has waaaaay thicker ice. The solution is trees by the billion, not \u2018schemes\u2019. The IPCC/governments/Vested Interests want $100 Trillion to be spent by 2100. Currently we are spending $1 Billion PER DAY to try and \u2018solve the climate change problem.\u2019 If we spent a few million $s a day only doing research into technologies that could help, we\u2019d save trillions of $s and only spend the money on solutions that work. (Moore\u2019s Law will bring the cost of any technological fix plummetting in only 2\u20133 decades.) In the meantime, plant trees. (And fire 99% of the activists/politicians/civil servants/\u2019scientists\u2019 who are too vested in climate change to ever tell the truth/do the right thing.) ",
