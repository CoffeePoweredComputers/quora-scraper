The Ford Pinto and Maverick, the Chevrolet Vega and Chevette, the Dodge Omni and Plymouth Horizon\u2026 all built to be entry-level/economy cars, and now so rare that most millennials wouldn\u2019t recognize any of them! Most only know what an AMC Pacer is because of the movie \u201cWayne\u2019s World\u201d! Much less the AMC Gremlin\u2026 How about a Plymouth Sapporo? A Dodge 600? A Plymouth Reliant? A Oldsmobile Omega or Pontiac Phoenix? A Chevrolet Citation or a Ford Probe? Does anyone remember (or mourn) the Ford Fairmont? All gone, and pretty much forgotten\u2026 ",
