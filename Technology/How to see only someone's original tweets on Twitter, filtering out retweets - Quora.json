            "answer_text": "Go the Tweetdeck way. This is an app given by Twitter and has access to virtually all the content on Twitter. You can also safely call it a client or interface. It began as an app developed and maintained by some fellas, and then Twitter bought it. Tweetdeck in its early days was so great that Twitter wanted it as part of their \u2018product\u2019! Tweetdeck has seen some interesting changes since it came under the management and development of Twitter. Some have been to take away some of Tweetdeck\u2019s capabilities; I can only say that it is a shadow of its former self.Interestingly though, it still has its ability to show you all the tweets of a Twitter user. You can even filter out the retweets so that you remain with the replies and original tweets made by the user!  So, go on and search for Tweetdeck on the internets. You will be directed to \u2192 TweetDeck \u2190. Some logging-in to Twitter will be required, so you must have an active account on Twitter. Once the deck loads, use the search tool on the left side of the interface to get the account of interest you want. Click on the account and then add a column for the tweets from your account of interest. New columns on Tweetdeck are added at the extreme right of the arrangement. At the top of the column you just added, go to the three (3) dots. Click on them and you will see a drop-down menu come up. Click on \u2018Tweet Content\u2019 and then go to the lower part of the tweet content section where it says \u2018Retweets\u2019. Include or exclude retweets as desired. Welcome to Tweetdeck, and enjoy it. Thank me later ;) You should also check out this article \u2192 Curating User Tweets by Engagement - Nestwebia ",
