            "answer_text": "Information Technology can be as hard or as easy as you like. There are so many fields and sectors that the diversity gives you choices. Sometimes the courses get hard, sometimes it is only temporary, for example although I didn't study IT I did a BSc in another subject and for my first year I had to study very difficult mathematics. I failed and had to retake mathematics over the summer and I scraped through with enough points to pass. Once I passed that course I didn't have to worry again. Sometimes there are difficult parts to a course, and you need extra help to get through, but if you can work hard and push through you often find you can overcome and be successful elsewhere. If everything is too hard then you might need to change course but there are other ways of working that perhaps aren't so technical but still relate to IT, for example Business Information Technology was a course which I know a few people took and the technical stress was much lower. That kind of qualification is still useful to employers, but perhaps for different jobs. So, my advice: As yourself, was it one subject you found too difficult? Or most of the courses?If it was just one course or area you really struggled to complete then get extra help, find out how to concentrate on solving your weakness, even temporarily to get you over the hill.If it was the entire course you struggled with then look for related subjects that perhaps combine other subjects you might find less stressful.",

            "answer_text": "It seems from your explanation that you don\u2019t think IT is very hard. Maybe you have the aptitude for it; as for that physics? I couldn\u2019t do it. Not everyone is made for IT, but most people figure that out pretty quickly with a few courses. Take a minute to think about all the various courses you have taken and you need to decide what you enjoyed and excelled at. For the classes you struggled with, is that why you didn\u2019t like them or did you struggle because you didn\u2019t like them? For the readers, one of the things my better half and I did when we started college was start with the 4 year and got permission to take courses from the junior (2 yr) colleges. This way we knew in advance if the credits would transfer. ",
