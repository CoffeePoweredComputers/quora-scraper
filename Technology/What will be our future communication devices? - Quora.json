            "answer_text": "Brain wave communication might be possible.For instance,now there are projects of mini quadcopters being controlled by our brain.Depending on the state of the brain the direction of the copter is being controlled.With good research, communication using brainwave technology may be feasible atleast for small ranges. LIFI is another emerging concept.The main disadvantages is that light cannot penetrate through walls and there is interference from sunlight.But we can definitely expect this concept to revolutionize communication industry atleast in another 10 years or so.
