            "answer_text": "I love a story with huge emotional impact. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \u201cIt just happens sometimes.\u201d Hundreds of years old and yet an adolescent on the verge of womanhood, Miri has been living her seemingly endless youth with her peers, the Onlies and with the horrible memories of monstrous adults, the Gr\u2019ups. She is managing her existence as best she can, living off of a dead civilization\u2019s dwindling remains. Making the best of things and avoiding at all costs a future she knows deep down is coming her way whether she wants it to or not. She\u2019s in constant fear, as are the rest of the children, but she seems to bear the weight of it all. She manages not to gaze too closely at what the weight actually is, and why it seems to reside specifically with her. She knows one day soon she will have to look and it will most assuredly be too late. On that day, she will be an adult and become a grotesque monster just like the Gr\u2019ups of long ago and just like the friends older than her who invariably pass into the hellish nightmare. She is floating in a sea of quiet terror when along come adults. Jim and the landing party. They are not monsters, but good people, and she latches onto them as if they are the safe haven she has been seeking. They are that. Very much they want to help her and the others. Because they have knowledge, they analyze the problem and seek answers. Their lives as much as the Onlies are all in peril. \u201cMiri\u201d is the one episode that seems to draw out the terror of the unknown, which is also the known. It singles out the human capability of knowledge of death and looking the other way. Miri spends her life avoiding the truth of what she knows deep down, because it frightens her to the core. The arrival of Jim and the rest of the landing party is the turning point for her. With Jim\u2019s help specifically, due to her girlish crush on him, he is able to break into that fear and help her grow up, because she needs to in order to help them all survive. He\u2019s not nice about it. He can\u2019t be. KIRK: \u2026the moment you become a young woman, you get the disease. All of you. MIRI: That's not true. It just happens sometimes. KIRK: All the time, Miri! It's happening to you right now! Look at it. Look at it, Miri, it's in you! He literally forces her to look at the disease taking hold in her own body, and then when the realization hits her finally and she sees the truth, he comforts her. Kim Darby is brilliant in that scene. She has to receive credit for revealing that terror so clearly. \u201cMiri\u201d is an excellent episode, and yet because it is mildly flawed, probably doesn\u2019t get the credit it deserves. ",

            "answer_text": "\u201cTomorrow is Yesterday\u201d - episode 19 of the first season. I remember watching that episode with my Dad, when I was either three or four years old. The plot of the episode is that a gravitational interaction with a black star has thrown the Enterprise back in time to the 1960s and into a very low Earth orbit. The Enterprise is observed by an American fighter jet and captured on film. Kirk and Sulu beam down to the Air Force base to steal the film so that history will not be changed. Kirk is captured and interrogated by the base security chief. The security chief becomes frustrated with Kirk\u2019s answers and says \u201cI am going to lock you up for two hundred years.\u201d Kirk responds by rolling his eyes, smirking and saying \u201cThat ought to be just about right.\u201d I remember not understanding that response. I was standing next to my Dad\u2019s chair. I turned to him, looked up and asked him what it meant. My Dad explained that Star Trek was two hundred years from now. I was horrified. I thought I was going to be on the Enterprise when I grew up. That the Enterprise wouldn\u2019t exist for two hundred years was unacceptable. It didn\u2019t make sense that it would take that long. I decided right there and then, standing next to my Dad\u2019s chair and in front of our 19-inch black and white television, that I was going to go work at NASA and make that process faster. It never occurred to me that little boys from failing pottery and mining towns in the midlands of England don\u2019t get to work at NASA. That toddler outrage fueled my ambition and today I do work at NASA where I get to train astronauts, send commands to spacecraft, and develop the operations for future vehicles and missions. \u201cTomorrow is Yesterday\u201d completely changed my life. But I have absolutely failed in getting the Enterprise built earlier. ",
