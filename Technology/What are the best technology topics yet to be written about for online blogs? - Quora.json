            "answer_text": " When it comes to choosing what to write about, I feel like the best blogging topics satisfy all three of the following categories: Something you are passionate aboutSomething that you have unique perspective onSomething that is useful for othersPersonally, I created The Imperfectionist (my blog) around sharing how to make your own ideas happen because: I am extremely passionate about helping others create their own paths and pursue their own ideasI\u2019ve been freelancing/pursuing my own ideas for my entire professional career (almost a decade)Throughout this time, I\u2019ve met countless individuals who are struggling with common issues (how to position their idea, how to remove yourself as a roadblock, etc.) and they fall into three categories: 1) students, 2) independent creatives, and 3) people who work in corporate settingsIf you\u2019re still not exactly sure, I would consider using the following exercise in order to write your first blog post: 1. Write down a list of 10 topics that interest you (5 minutes) 2. Turn these interests into questions (10 minutes) 3. Do a little research in order to form an opinion for each topic (30 mins) 4. Answer each question in one sentence to create your BIG IDEA for each article (15 mins) 5. Expand on one of these answers in order to create your first draft (30 minutes) 6. Show that first draft to three people: Someone you know who writesSomeone you don\u2019t know who writesSomeone who would be a target reader in that category7. Take feedback from all three people and revise your first draft (30 minutes) 8. Check for grammar and spelling (5 minutes) 9. Click \u201cPublish\u201d and get ready to share your article 10. Make sure to thank and respond to each person who leaves a comment on your article You could easily apply this same approach to technology. ",
