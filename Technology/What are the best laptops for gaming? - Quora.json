            "answer_text": "The best gaming laptop is no longer the sort of chunky desktop replacement machine that comes with a fan profile to set your teeth on edge the heat generation of a small star. Gaming laptops are now sleek, quiet, and just as importantly, still pack a real punch when it comes to handling the latest games. While those hulking workstations still have their place for some people, we're definitely advocates for ultraportable machines able to keep pace with the best gaming PCs in desktop trim. The best gaming laptops will still cost more than their desktop counterparts\u2014smaller definitely doesn't mean cheaper in PC gaming\u2014but the delta is narrowing. The fact that AMD, Intel, and Nvidia focus so much of their efforts on power efficiency and thermals means that the best gaming laptops are on the cutting edge of what's possible. The Razer Blade 15 Advanced Model remains the king of premium gaming laptops with both its design and unrivaled performance. For anyone who doesn't over $3000 to spend on a gaming laptop should look at the Dell G3 15, which is proof that you don't have to pay the price of a used car to get some decent gaming. Performance is incredible as well, with AMD's 4000-series CPUs bringing the fight to Intel and its 10th Gen processors. Meanwhile, if you want to handle real-time ray tracing on the go, then there's nothing to stop you. Nvidia RTX 2060, 2070, and 2080 models are all present and correct, and the Super variants have now joined the party, too. 1. Razer Blade 15 (2020) The best gaming laptop.  CPU: 10th Gen Intel Core | GPU: Up to Nvidia RTX 2080 Super Max-Q | RAM: Up to 16GB | Screen: Full HD 144Hz, 300Hz, or OLED 4K 60Hz | Storage: Up to 1TB SSD | Battery: 80Whr | Dimensions: 9.25 x 13.98 x 0.78 inches | Weight: 4.63 lbs We've been waiting all year to see the new 2020 edition of the mighty Razer Blade 15, and it was worth it. The new model takes everything that made the Blade 15 our pick as the best gaming laptop over the years and only improves it. There's the same gorgeous CNC-milled aluminum chassis as its predecessor, only this time it holds the latest graphics chips from Nvidia\u2014namely the RTX Super cards\u2014and the new Intel 10th Gen CPUs. We've recently checked out the new Razer Blade 15 Advanced Edition, with its 300Hz screen, octa-core processor, and RTX 2080 Super Max-Q Design graphics silicon. And we fell in love all over again. But one of the best things about the Blade 15 is the number of configurations Razer offers for it. From the GTX 1660 Ti Base Edition, all the way up to the RTX 2080 Super Advanced, with OLED 4K panel, there's something for almost everyone. It's one of the most beautiful gaming laptops around, and still one of the most effective. It's light, robust, stylishly subtle, but also eminently powerful\u2014the Blade 15 is certainly anything but style over substance. It's style and substance. Whatever config you pick, we think the Razer Blade 15 is the overall best gaming laptop on the market right now. 2. Dell G3 15 The best budget gaming laptop with great battery life.  CPU: Intel Core i7 9750H | GPU: Nvidia GTX 1660 Ti Max-Q | RAM: 16GB | Screen: 15.6-inch Full HD IPS 144Hz | Storage: 512GB SSD | Battery: 51 Whr | Dimensions: 0.85 x 14.4 x 10 inches | Weight: 5.40 lb Let\u2019s face it, trying to find a decent gaming laptop on a budget can be a chore. You have to make compromises in areas like performance, design, and even battery life. Thankfully, the Dell G3 15 offers decent 1080p gaming with configurations under $1,000, and the battery is actually good. The most significant improvement from its previous model is a slimmer, sleeker design. Along with thinner bezels around a 144Hz display, the sleeker design gives it a more high-end vibe. It\u2019s a welcome toned-down look, in case you\u2019re hoping for a gaming laptop that doesn\u2019t shout \u2018gamer\u2019 as soon as you pull it out of your bag. The display itself seems the only downside, not having as rich a color range as the other gaming laptops on this list. 3. Asus TUF A15 The best mid-range gaming laptop.  CPU: AMD Ryzen 7 4800H | GPU: Nvidia RTX 2060 | RAM: 16GB DDR4-2666 | Screen: 15.6-inch Full HD IPS 144Hz | Storage: 1TB M.2 NVMe | Battery: 90Wh | Dimensions: 14.1 x 10.1 x 1 inches | Weight: 5.07 lbs The new Asus TUF A15 is one of the best gaming laptops of the year so far, thanks mainly to the AMD 8-core Ryzen 7 4800H APU that can be found beating at its heart. Throw in the speedy 1TB NVMe SSD and RTX 2060 graphics, and you've got yourself a hell of a workhorse for a non-workstation gaming laptop. In our review, we called the TUF A15 an \"incredibly versatile, affordable gaming laptop, with a battery life that is almost unprecedented at this price point or performance level.\" The only slight downside is the price, especially when there are plenty of $999 RTX 2060 machines out there. The TUF A15's game performance, CPU power, and impressive battery life make it an excellent laptop for both work and play. Even at its current price, it still outperforms pricier mid-range gaming laptops, which is kind of wild. 4. MSI GS65 Stealth Thin The most stylish gaming laptop.   CPU: Intel Core i7 8750H | GPU: Nvidia GeForce GTX 1060 - RTX 2080 Max-Q | RAM: 16GB-32GB DDR4-2666 | Screen: 15.6-inch Full HD 144Hz | Storage: 512GB- 1TB M.2 SSD | Battery: 82 Whr | Dimensions: 9.75 x 14.08 x 0.69 inches | Weight: 4.14 lbs The GS65 Stealth Thin remains, year after year, one of the best gaming laptops you can find. It's a fantastic all-rounder that still packs a punch in terms of specs and design. It has the versatility of a notebook and, because it's light and sturdy, it's incredibly easy to just pop into your bag and carry around all day for whatever you need to use it for. It has a sleek matte black aluminum body with gold accents that feels sturdy and luxurious\u2014and thankfully it's lacking in obnoxious gamer aesthetics. Best of all, in addition to a slim, 18mm thickness, the screen's 5mm thin bezels allow for an overall chassis size that's about an inch smaller than most 15-inch laptops, while still packing the same screen real-estate. There are other nice details on the GS65, which still makes it a great laptop: a keyboard from SteelSeries that's solid and responsive (and RGB-lit, if you care about that sort of thing), a responsive touchpad, and a webcam that's placed at the top of the screen, thankfully avoiding the abysmally unflattering \"nose-cam\" found on most thin-bezeled laptops like the Dell XPS 13. The only gaming feature missing here is G-Sync, but this allows for both a lower price tag and battery life that legitimately lasts through a whole day of email, web browsing, and streaming video. 5. Acer Predator Helios 300 - 15.6-inch The best budget gaming laptop for around $1,000  CPU: Intel Core i5 9300H, i7 9750H | GPU: Nvidia GeForce GTX 1660 Ti - RTX 2060 | RAM: 8GB-16GB DDR4-2666 | Screen: 15.6-inch Full HD IPS 144Hz | Storage: 256GB-512GB PCIe NVMe SSD | Battery: 3720 mAh | Dimensions: 10.01 x 14.23 x 0.9 inches | Weight: 5.07 lbs We loved Acer's Predator Helios 300 during the GTX 10-series era: at just over a grand, sometimes less if you could find it on sale, it offered a GTX 1060 6GB graphics card that could lock down 60 fps at near-max settings in most contemporary games. Now the newer model Helios is back with a GTX 1660 Ti GPU and a sleeker form factor for basically the same price. The new and improved Helios 300 has a 144Hz IPS screen as well as smaller bezels, putting it more in line with sleek thin-and-lights than its more bulky brethren of the previous generation. RAM speed has been bumped up to 2,666Mhz as well, which is a nice improvement. The only real drawback is the diminutive SSD, although there are larger storage options (thankfully all in SSD form) if you want more space.  ",

            "answer_text": " Mobiles are a way of life. Just because you are on the go doesn\u2019t mean you have to stop all of your online activities or leave your work altogether. This is precisely why mobile computing has become such an integral part of our day-to-day lives today. It\u2019s also the reason why there are mobile internet users today on smartphones than traditional desktops. According to the statistics shared by Statcounter, there are almost 52% mobile users around the world with laptop users coming close to 43% and 4% tablet users. This clearly shows the preference of the people all across the globe when it comes to using devices for work or leisure or whatever the need might call for! However, mobile computing has some distinct drawbacks, and this is precisely what we are going to highlight in this article. For one, they simply can\u2019t replace a laptop. Sure, you can take down a few notes at your meeting on the Evernote app. However, you cannot use Word easily on your smartphone. And neither would you want it, even if Microsoft offers you Microsoft Suite 360 that can run just about anywhere. You can\u2019t also run apps like other media software tools on your laptop that you can\u2019t on your smartphone. Additionally, smartphones have a restricted OS \u2013 something you don\u2019t have to worry about when it comes to your laptop. Having a laptop is a must for people who love to have nice gaming experience. Pc gaming still has wide popularity among gamers in the presence of the mobile gaming world because of the big screen and high-end graphics that give you more precise moves. You can play the Clash of Clans well on your smartphone, or even games like NOVA but you can never play games like Grand Theft Auto Vice City on your smartphone. It would be hard to match this experience on your phone with a smaller screen, especially for pro games the laptop gaming is their highly preferred. For serious and avid gamers, there\u2019s nothing better than a good laptop to enhance the best gaming experience and outcome as well. If you\u2019re a nub in the gaming world or have a great passion for the professional level enthusiasm for computer gaming and dreaming to become an igaming champion, below are the important factors you should consider when selecting a gaming laptop for you. Brand: Top Gaming Laptops Now that you have your budget figured out and a baseline idea of what you\u2019re looking for, there\u2019s one final question to consider. ad What brand of a laptop are you going to buy? We\u2019re not going to push you one way or the other, but here are a few things about some of our top brands to think about when conducting your research. Acer \u2013 Acer has a well-rounded lineup with a mix of budget notebooks like the Aspire VX 15 and purely aspirational machines like the Predator 21 X, as well as everything in between. The company backs its gaming laptops with a one-year limited warranty that requires you to pay for the cost of shipping it to the company for service.Asus: Branded under the company\u2019s Republic of Gamers series, the company\u2019s laptops have a sleek, stealth fighter design with an impressive set of specs. However, Asus doesn\u2019t offer much in the way of customization. As far as the warranty, the Taiwanese tech giant typically offers a 1-year international with accidental damage coverage and 30-day zero-bright dot protection with 24/7 tech support.HP \u2013 You wouldn\u2019t immediately associate HP with gaming laptops, but the company has been making steady strides in the industry with its Omen series. HP\u2019s gaming laptops come standard with one-year limited warranties that include free shipping when your system needs service.Know 10 important factors that affect the speed of your laptop Alienware: Known for its distinctive spaceship design complete with out-of-this-world lighting, Alienware does a solid job of offering value while still delivering high-end specs. However, outside of its predetermined configurations, there isn\u2019t much room for customization. The company typically offers a 1-year warranty with on-site service after remote diagnosis.Lenovo: Lenovo laptops are synonymous with an understated design. But beneath the plain-Jane looks lie surprisingly high-quality specs that won\u2019t put a dent in your bank account. You can expect 4 to 5 configurations of each model and a 1-year warranty.OriginPC: OriginPC\u2019s default design typically won\u2019t turn heads, but they are the go-to-guys when it comes to customization. From custom paint jobs, thermal compounds to a TV Tuner, as long as you have the money, the sky\u2019s the limit. OriginPC\u2019s standard warranty offers lifetime 24/7 tech support and even offers a dead-pixel warranty in case of a defective display.MSI: One of the most innovative companies, MSI is known for its hulking, red-dragon-themed 17-inches as well as its svelte 15-inch notebooks. MSI isn\u2019t afraid to slap four SSDs and a mechanical keyboard with a digital touchpad into a system. MSI gives its customers a 2-year limited warranty.Razer: Like MacBooks for gamers, Razer\u2019s all-black laptops are some of the lightest and slimmest on the market. The only configuration options provided are for storage size and display resolution. The company has a 1-year limited warranty for all of its products.Gigabyte/Aorus \u2013 Gigabyte and its high-end subsidiary Aorus offer a diverse lineup of gaming systems. Where Aorus laptops are svelte, lightweight powerhouses with high-end specs while Gigabyte systems tend to be bulkier, more colorful and less expensive. All Aorus laptops and selected Gigabyte systems have two-year limited warranties while the remaining systems only come with 1 year.Check Your Budget while selecting the gaming laptop First come first the money you are going to spend will make a tentative idea about your next laptop purchase. Your budget will obviously be a huge factor in what type of laptop you can get. You would get a good and mid-range gaming laptops on the market will normally cost around $800 to $2,000. But if you want to experiment with VR gaming, nothing less than $3,000 or more for a great laptop, that will bring the perfect gameplay. For example, one of the best gaming laptops for under $1,000 right now is the Lenovo Legian would cost you around $849. However, if you want to upgrade it, expect to pay as much as $1,800. The Razor Blade 15, though, is currently one of the best gaming laptops of all, and it starts at about $1,800. Type of Gaming Besides budget restrictions, the type of laptop that you\u2019ll want to buy depends a lot on the type of gaming you want to do. For example, the system requirements for playing an online tournament on GameBattles are slightly different than the requirements for playing a multiplayer game like Gunfight. With online poker, you can play on almost any operating system, but it\u2019ll work best on Windows 7 or newer. You\u2019ll also need at least 1GB to 2GB of RAM (but 4GB is preferable), 1GB of disk space, 512MB of memory, and a graphics card that supports at least Open GL 2.0. Dota 2, on the other hand, requires Windows 7 or newer as a minimum, a dual-core Intel processor, 4GB of RAM, 15GB of disk space, a DirectX Compatible sound card, and a graphics card like NVIDIA GeForce 8600/9600GT. If you\u2019re not totally sure what type of gaming you want to do, or if you want to mix it up now and then, keep it simple: Aim to get the nicest laptop possible within your budget, paying special attention to RAM and the graphics card. For VR gaming, look for a laptop with an NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2080 Ti graphics card for the smoothest experience. Everyday life and your gaming laptop  Does this really mean when choosing a gaming laptop for me? Yes, it does mean a lot and you should consider whether or not you plan to travel with it. First, you\u2019ll want to think about how you understand the term \u201ctravel.\u201d That is, traveling within your own city is a lot different than other cities or international travel. The laptop size and weight will affect your type of travel because it will make a big impact on your future travel and packing arrangements. If you plan on doing a lot of domestic or international travel, stick with a 13.3-in laptop or smaller. Sure, it won\u2019t be fun to compromise on the screen size, but when you\u2019re lugging it around all the time, it just makes more sense. It\u2019s easier to lift, transport, carry and fit into bags. With 15.4-in laptops and up, you\u2019ll have a hard time fitting it in most backpacks. Then there\u2019s the weight to factor in. This isn\u2019t much of an issue with modern laptops \u2014 which weigh next to nothing compared to the laptops of a decade ago \u2014 but it might be an issue if you choose to purchase an older model that\u2019s refurbished. If you choose to get an older laptop model, don\u2019t purchase one that\u2019s more than a few years old. The newer the machine, the more likely it\u2019ll support the latest software updates (not to mention games!). Don\u2019t plan to travel much, but the screen size is important to you? Go for the 15.4-in laptop. If you plan to only use your laptop at home, a 17-in laptop \u2014 yes, they still exist \u2014 is still an option to consider. Regardless, no matter the size or type of laptop you get, you can always purchase an external monitor, mouse, and keyboard to enhance your gaming experience for when you\u2019re at home. That way, you\u2019ve got a portable machine and a solid home machine all in one. Bottom Tips Don\u2019t buy a gaming laptop for low-end titles like World of Warcraft or Candy Crush. These games can easily be supported by an integrated graphics card.Avoid touch screens. They\u2019re more expensive and drain the battery.17- or 18-inch laptops are typically more powerful, but the least portable while 13-, 14- and 15-inches are easier to carry but often lack higher-end components.Make sure the keyboard is comfortable. If you can, take a trip to the store and try out the keyboard before you buy it.Ditch the M. Thanks to Nvidia\u2019s 10-series GPUs, mobile chips are a thing of the past. These new GPUs are faster, more powerful and are VR-ready.Avoid laptops with a low-res display (less than 1920 x 1080).Get solid-state storage. Invest in an SSD for faster game installs and load times.Get a laptop with at least an Intel Core i7-6700HQ processor, an Nvidia GeForce GTX 1060 GPU and an HDMI 1.3 port if you want to be able to enjoy virtual reality games with an Oculus Rift or HTC Vive.So, here are the top suggestions for your next gaming laptop that may help you to enroll in the next world gaming championship for sure.
