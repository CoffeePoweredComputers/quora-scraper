            "answer_text": "The Xbox One CPU features 8-core AMD versus 3.2 GHz PowerPC Tri-Core Xenon on the Xbox 360. It has 8GB of RAM versus 512MB. Xbox One has an integrated TV experience, can directly interface with a cable box, and also has a built-in IR blaster. It interfaces with the \"cloud\" better for automatic updates, and you can save the position of a movie or TV show and watch from the same position on a different console. Xbox One features a Blu-Ray player and the console is 4K capable. Kinect is now integrated and no longer an optional extra. Coming in December, the next Xbox One update will give it the ability to play Xbox 360 games. ",

            "answer_text": "Think of it as the difference between a DVD player and a Blu Ray. Does it look the same and perform a similar function? Well yes, but that's where the similarities end. The Xbox One is newer, stronger, has a Blu Ray player inside instead of a DVD player allowing it to play massive games without switching disks. The One can play much more advanced games than the 360 can just like a computer that just came out is able to do more than one that's 10 years old. The One actually has a downloaded update that allows it to function as a 360 so it can play a lot of the older games too. ",
