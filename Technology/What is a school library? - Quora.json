            "answer_text": "A place where students can go and take out books on loan for a couple of weeks. It can be novels to read for pleasure, research books, back copies of national geographic etc. It is normally open for use before school, during breaks and after school. Students can sit and work there too. There is usually a librarian who trains up a team of students to also act as librarians. Most of these places have been turned into media centres and kitted out with computers where the kids can research online. I live in a country where there are huge disparities between rich and poor and one can never assume that everyone have the same access and the same cultural experiences. So I can just hope that this was a genuine question. ",

            "answer_text": "A school library is like any other library, except it is located at the school. Depending on the age level taught at the school, the collection will vary. An elementary school library will have books and materials suited to children. A high school will have books and materials relevant to young adults and teens. ",
