            "answer_text": "There are plenty of available tech solutions that can support collaboration - especially project management & communication tools which are designed for that purpose. Let\u2019s be honest: exchanging any important details \u201cin person\u201d would be challenging otherwise, and definitely time-consuming. Plus, if any of your team members work remotely, this would actually be impossible.  Here are a few ideas on what you can achieve with such tools: Taking care of internal communication and giving the opportunity to share relevant details within your organisation. This way, you\u2019re basically eliminating the chances of your team members doing the same tasks, or performing them with insufficient information.Integrating all your software. Nowadays, you have a lot of software at your disposal. These tools are likely to boost your productivity - however, using many tools, devices, and storage spaces can also cause major chaos. At the same time, there\u2019s no \u201cone tool fits all\u201d solution, so using multiple tools is simply necessary. There\u2019s nothing wrong with that - but what can actually improve your workflow is to pick the available solutions wisely, and integrate the systems whenever possible.Streamlining tasks (or even the whole processes). Take dull assignments and unproductive meetings, as an example. There\u2019s no need to waste time on them - instead, make sure there\u2019s a clear purpose and plan behind any meeting and task you\u2019re involved in. Yet again: there are tools for that.What are the examples of such tools, then? Stackfield - it lets you manage your projects in a clear and effective manner, stay in touch with your whole team, as well as upload and download relevant files and resources.Shared Contacts for Gmail - sharing is caring, right? If you use Gmail to communicate with your colleagues and customers, you should definitely try this tool to share your contacts whenever needed.CloudTalk has plenty of features that can help you facilitate all calls flowing through your company, and improve the collaboration & productivity of your team once you\u2019re at it.Harmonizely - if you struggle with scheduling meetings within your team (or with your clients, for that matter), this tool can make the whole process much easier.Kontentino, on the other hand, is a social media management tool that proves to be a game-changer when it comes to facilitating collaboration in social media teams and streamlining the whole social media content scheduling process.Whenever you implement new tools & techniques, though, you have to have your team on board. Otherwise, these tools simply won\u2019t help much if no one\u2019s willing to use them. ",
