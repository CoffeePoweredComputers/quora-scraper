            "answer_text": "Let me put in a very simple manner. What is IP address? (Laying off the technical definition...)- When you connect your computer to any network , your computer is assigned (automatically or manually by user) an IP address. Consider this analogy. You have parked your car in a parking lot. When you want to go back to your car , you need to remember where you parked it. Suppose you remember this , 'beside the elevators in the third row'. When you have parked your car in a parking lot , you have assigned an address to it. Anyone wants to reach your car-machine , one can go to the parking lot -your network and check for the address-ip address assigned to it. When you connect to the internet , generally you are connecting your machine to the network provided by your Internet Service Provider.  Ok. Knowledge of Public IP Address is also required. Here it is. Just as no two parking spot have same address , IP address on a network is unique. Internet is ultimately just a network.( a huge network). So , if your machine has some IP address while accessing internet, no other machine in the entire world (accessing internet at the same time) can have that same IP address. This is called Public IP Address. It is provided by your ISP.  How does your ISP get these Public IPs?ISP buys Public IP addresses in bulk.  Ideally , ISP having 50k customers should have 50k Public IP Addresses. But not all the customers are connected to internet all the time. So, to utilize it's investment , ISP buys less public IP addresses than customers. Say , 40k IP Addresses for 50k customers. (Another analogy if you didn't quite catch that. Consider a car rental company. If 10 customers come everyday to rent cars , company should own 10 cars. But life is uncertain , and customers are not all coming at the same time. And company comes to know that on an average , 3 cars are always in the lot , unused. So , to utilize its investment , company only buys 7 cars.)Now , one Public IP can't be assigned to each customer as there are 40k IP addresses and 50k customers. So , what ISP does is , whenever you connect to internet , it randomly assigns you one of the public IP addresses. Now when you connect to the internet the next time , it is possible that the previous Public IP address is now assigned to someone else and you are assigned some other Public IP address.(One day you go to car rental company and rent a black Honda Civic for a day. You go the next day and you may get a red Honda Civic because black is already taken by another customer. ) Simple as that. ;) ",

            "answer_text": "If you\u2019re using consumer-grade internet service, then the IP address assigned to your house network (i.e. the IP address used to communicate with the public internet by the cable modem and/or router that your ISP provides) is selected randomly from a pool of IP addresses that was allocated to your ISP. It can change; you explicitly have no guarantee it will remain the same. It\u2019s only assigned to your router temporarily (\u201cleased\u201d, in networking terms; other keywords here are \u201cDHCP\u201d where the \u201cD\u201d stands for \u201cdynamic\u201d, which is computer speak for \u201cit changes\u201d). Despite the no-guarantees-may-change-at-any-time aspect, often your dynamically allocated IP address will, in fact, stay the same for weeks or months at a time. You can pay extra for a \u201cstatic IP\u201d, but it usually costs more. The main reason you\u2019d need a static IP is to make something on your network (e.g. a web server) consistently available to the outside world. This usually costs extra. Also, most everything about how your ISP\u2019s network is set up assumes the connections are all going to be initiated outward-bound, so there may be issues with firewall and router configuration in your ISP\u2019s network infrastructure that they need to deal with to make your static IP available to the outside Internet.. There are \u201cdynamic DNS\u201d services (like dyndns.org, and others) that will make it easier to keep track of your router\u2019s external IP address. In a nutshell, they\u2019re like regular DNS \u2014 i.e. you reserve a domain name and the service hosts an entry that keeps track of what IP address goes with that domain name \u2014 except that it\u2019s set up to make it easier to deal with a frequently -changing IP address. To use a dynamic DNS provider, you run a piece of software on your computer or router (many home/small office routers now come with support for this built in). This software will automatically contact the dynamic DNS server and update their DNS record for your domain, whenever your ISP\u2019s DHCP assigns a new/different IP address to your router. The dynamic DNS server configures your DNS entry with a very low TTL (\u201cTime To Live\u201d) so that anyone who requests the details for your domain name will only cache it for a very short period of time. When your IP address changes and you update the dynamic DNS server, you won\u2019t have to wait hours or even days for the cached DNS records to expire. DHCP is also often used inside your home network (almost always, for consumer grade home or small office networks). Most consumer grade routers these days are in fact combo devices including router, firewall, DHCP server and wifi AP (and usually a 4-port switch). When you plug in a new computer, the computer broadcasts a DHCP request asking for an IP address, and your router\u2019s built-in DHCP server hears it and responds. The built-in DHCP server keeps track of which IP addresses have been assigned and which are still available for new devices. Network cards have a built-in identifier called a MAC address, and most consumer router/etc combos these days will remember which IP address was handed out to which MAC address, and re-issue that same IP address to the same MAC address when the DHCP \u201clease\u201d expires. That\u2019s not formally a part of the DHCP standard, but it simplifies life a lot. ",

            "answer_text": "This is a complex question and depends on the context. I will now generalize some things. If you surf on the Internet and visit for example http://quora.com this service has IP-address which serves the quora website. This IP-address does not change. DNS (domain name system) maps the quora.com name to the to specific IP-address. These server IP-addresses do not basically change.  Each device that is connected to global Internet needs IP-address in order to send and receive data from Internet. So let's take for an example your mobile device. If you are surfing at home using WiFi, now your own Public IP-address is depended on your ISP (Internet service provider). If you disconnect your device from WiFi and use cellural data your Public IP-address changes to your cellural data providers IP address. ISP usually sends IP-address to you using DHCP-protocol. DHCP-protocol has leases for each IP-address they provide. Usually if you are using WiFi-router at home your Public IP-address does not change as the router acquires the same IP-address over and over again. But if you disconnect your router for a week and then connect that back your IP-address may have changed as your lease is expired and DHCP-server have assigned your IP-address to another user. IP-address space (for IPv4) is 0.0.0.0 - 255.255.255.255 these addresses can't change. So you can't have for example IP-address 300.1.1.1 ever. So on this context the IP-addresses don't change.  To summarize: - IPv4 address space is static and all devices have some IP-address between earlier mentioned address space. - Servers usually have static IP-addresses and these addresses do not change. (Very generalized) - Your own device IP-address changes based on the location on which your are using it.   ",

            "answer_text": "Most of the time, yes. Some of the time, No. And occasionally, maybe. I understand if that\u2019s a confusing answer. The reason for it is there are multiple ways IP addresses can be configured. Most of us have a Dynamic IP address. With one of these, your device connecting to the network or internet is assigned an IP address that is good for X amount of time (think hours or days). At the end of this time, if it\u2019s in use, it will renew it\u2019s assignment (most of the time) and you will continue with that same IP address. If it\u2019s not in use when it\u2019s assigned time (it\u2019s lease) is over, then the IP address becomes available for another device to use, and when you reconnect you get a new IP address. Some connections will be configured for a Static IP address instead of a Dynamic one. With this, instead of your device asking \u201cwhat IP address can I have?\u201d it\u2019s going \u201cHey, this is my IP address\u201d. Your device has a fixed IP address that your network provider (ISP) has set aside for you, so it never expires (well, as long as you keep paying the bill it won\u2019t expire). Servers (webservers, email, file servers, domain controllers, etc) are likely to have a Static IP because your server address changing is a Bad Thing. So why aren\u2019t all IP addresses static? Because there aren\u2019t enough. The theoretical number of IPv4 addresses is a bit over 4.2 billion (the real number of possibly usable addresses is less then that). That may seem like a lot, but remember, there are 7+ billion people alive right now. While IPv6 addresses this limit, it\u2019s adoption is far from universal so far. Ok, so what about that \u201cMaybe\u201d answer? Some ISPs (Internet Service Providers) and Networks use a 3rd category of IP addresses. These are basically dynamic IP addresses that are tied to a devices hardware address (it\u2019s MAC). They act like some weird combination of Dynamic and Static IPs. They are assigned like Dynamic IPs, but like Static IPs they don\u2019t actually change (unless someone at the network makes a mistake\u2026 which does happen). I want to say this type of IP address is going away, but I\u2019ve seen it in place just a couple weeks ago. ",

            "answer_text": "IP Addresses don't change, per say. They are re-assigned.  There are two methods of assigning IP addresses in your typical network - Static, and Dynamic.  Think of it as visiting a hotel - each time you go back you are unlikely to get the same room (IP Address). This would be a dynamic IP address.  Now, if you change to a house, you are guaranteed to get the same room/address each time you go back until a change is made. This would be a static IP address.  This, in very basic terms, is the difference between dynamic and static IP's.  It sounds like your question refers to dynamic IP addresses. If you take your laptop to a cafe and check your IP address, it could be (for example) 10.1.10.6. If you leave and come back the next week, it could be 10.1.10.104. When you left, the assignment to your computer expired on the router, which freed up the IP address to be re-assigned to another customer. When you came back, your computer requests a new IP address, and the router pulls one from its inventory to assign (if one is available).  Hopefully this makes sense and helps clear things up. It's more complicated than this in reality, but I tried to break it down and keep things simple. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes and No. So ill try to make this as simple as I can, IP addresses IPV4 that everyone knows (192,168.10.1) for example are ment for network to network communication. But there is also an IPV6 address (2001:DBA;ACAD:B::1/64) for example. These can both be assigned Statically or Dynamically: Static meaning: Pretty much a set in stone address for that end device (Mainly used for most often printers, or desktops that are used often) ((Mainly used in small networks like 200 or less devices)) Dynamic meaning: Its on a \u201clease\u201d where the device will send out a request for an address to the DHCP server. The server will acknowledge this, say I have this pool to choose from. Assign the device the address from say (2pm - 10 pm) after this the device will forfeit its address cutting off its access. (( Used in large or Enterprise networks, 200 - 1000+ devices.)) Reason behind this, this will help reduce the routers ARP table, so the router doesn't take up to much memory thus reducing the QOS of the routing process. This is pretty much best of my knowledge so if anyone see\u2019s anything incorrect. Feel free to correct me. ",

When a new device attaches to the Internet via your home modem or router a protocol call Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP)[1] is used to assign an IP address to the device. This assignment has a lease period after which a new assignment will take place. In addition to an IP address, DHCP can also provide other configuration details such as default gateway, domain name, the name servers, and time servers. Servers usually have a fixed IP address (or are at least fronted by a router with a fixed IP address) as the Domain Name System (DNS)[2] converts a name to a fixed IP address. Sometimes your home device might need a fixed IP address, for example as a security precaution when a server only allows access from specific IP addresses. In this case you would need to obtain a fixed IP address from your ISP, usually as a paid additional service.

Servers need an IP of their own. On your computers at home you use internal IPs which keeps them more secure and are dynamically assigned. DHCP dynamically assigns IPs - that means that if you unplug your computer you might be assigned a different IP. You can force a release of an IP from your computer by going into command prompt on your comoputer and typing ipconfig /release. When a network is sold sometimes the IPs go to the new company. On a network each computer is identified also by a MAC address. These don't change- not unless they are masked or spoofed. ",

Your ISP is responsible for distributing and maintaining a block of dynamic IP addresses that are continually circulated throughout their customer base. It stands to reason, therefore, that if you move house and change broadband providers, your IP address will also change. You can also change your IP when you connect to other IP addresses. This is usually done through proxy services or VPN. Since these services are usually used to avoid geo-restrictions or change your location, it also changes your IP address. This can be used for privacy reasons as well as for work-related matters or to access content that isn\u2019t available in your country/region. ",

Server addresses are allocated out of the pool/s that the service provider has allocated to them - you don\u2019t \u201cown\u201d the IP address, it is just loaned to you whilst you keep paying your bills and utilize their infrastructure in the same way. If you moved your server to a different site, even with the same service provider, you will be allocated a different IPv$ # - the old number typically stays routed to the same physical site and isn\u2019t migrated. Even \u201cfixed\u201d IP home/office Internet connections are not guaranteed to never change, just not change just due to time or reconnection. If we where being REALLY pedantic, you can say the address doesn\u2019t change, just the device it is allocated to may. (And generally not a good idea(tm) if two devices claim the same address) ",

If you're connected directly to the Internet via a layer-2 gateway, you'll have to change your computer's IP address. Most home network is connected via a router, so chances are that you need to change IP address of your router.

Using an IP address not intended to be used in such a scenario will probably make something stop working, but it will likely be restricted to your LAN.
