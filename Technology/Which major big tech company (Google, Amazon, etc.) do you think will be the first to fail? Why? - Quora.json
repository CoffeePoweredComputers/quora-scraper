Bezo, the founder of Amazon, and largest shareholder (though a lot went to his ex-wife after their divorce), has publicly stated that he does not see a future for Amazon, and has been selling his shares. Imu, he retains ownership of the computer algorithms that keep Amazon in business, and intends to redply them! Last I heard: Amazon has never paid a dividend to its its investors. It is a complete Ponzi scheme, where the company only has value whilst its shares are traded. Jeff Bezos to employees: 'One day, Amazon will fail' but our job is to delay it as long as possible ",

            "answer_text": "Excluding government action, I would bet Google. Google has a single point of failure. Advertising. Particularly search and display advertising. 85% of revenue comes from it. Google really struggles to create new businesses which are outside of advertising. They couldn\u2019t do social in any form. They have a lot of nowhere near profitable businesses in everything from cars to internet. When going head to head with Amazon in voice technology and cloud they have struggled. So if someone finds a more effective way to organize information and search it, I suspect that Google will be in trouble. ",
