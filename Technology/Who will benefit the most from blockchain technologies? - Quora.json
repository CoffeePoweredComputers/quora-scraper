            "answer_text": "So, nearly any industry you randomly pick can benefit from blockchain technologies. These are five industries that are the ones that mostly can get benefited from this world-changing technology. VotingElections are often termed unfair and rigged by opposing parties. Even if the accusations are correct, it is extremely difficult to retrace and inspect every vote. This is why blockchain technology can remodel the entire voting system. Firstly, users will have to be verified before casting a vote. Secondly, each vote would be permanently printed on the blockchain \u2014 similar to financial transactions, the election will become impossible to falsify or alter. Votes would be protected by cryptography, granting that no votes could be duplicated or emitted by the wrong person. Lastly, votes could be counted automatically on a blockchain which will make the electoral system reliable and authentic. Real EstateReal estate has always been the safest investment option for people all around the world. However, just like banking, this industry is outdated as it relies heavily on paperwork and intermediaries. In order to improve the housing market, companies need to consider implementing blockchain technology so these transactions are completed transparently. Smart contracts can also be used instead of manual documentation \u2014 the latter possibly including human errors and requiring changes for every single purchase, which would lead to a longer time of processing transactions. A few companies have already proposed platforms which will allow users to trade properties and get ROIs using blockchain. RetailShopping experiences can be improved if websites were to adopt decentralized methods for buyers and sellers. Instead of paying third-parties, using cryptocurrencies or credit cards on a blockchain platform would be a secure method of payment. Users also dislike filling huge credit card forms up when finalizing their order. Blockchain would solve this issue by allowing them to fill their cart and complete the transaction just by scanning a QRCode, and the payment would be instant. HealthcareHealthcare industry suffers from one problem that can cost a person his life: time. As soon as you enter a hospital or a clinic, you are required to fill out forms asking for your medical history. Or you have to create medical cards and pay in advance to initiate the clinical procedure. Hospitals understandably focus on the wellbeing of patients, which is why sometimes medical records are not secured and are easy to access. These problems can be resolved by employing methods to shift a patient\u2019s medical history to private blockchains that can be accessed by doctors worldwide using a private key. This way the patient can be diagnosed in a short period of time. BanksSince the concept of decentralized technology began with Bitcoin, it seems fitting that blockchain is the one to disrupt the banking industry. Banking is one of the oldest and most important industries in the world. Unfortunately, it is plagued by issues \u2014 banking fees are high and sending money abroad is a long and tiring process. Currently, banks don\u2019t accept cryptocurrencies, although implementing blockchain technologies on internal procedures could mean faster and safer operations. According to a report by Accenture, banks could spare $10 billion by using blockchain for clearance and settlement. Trade finance and identity verification can also be automated to cut down both the cost and time of the banking process. One of the project that I crossed paths with that is making blockchain payments simple and easy is called Multichain Ventures. Multichain Ventures is the parent company of several underlying entities including The Tokes Platform, Cubed, and EDEN. These brands produce blockchain-focused products including, but not limited to, cryptocurrency-based payment processing and supply chain visibility tools. Multichain Ventures\u2019 diverse product array serves businesses of any size, across multiple sectors, leveraging blockchain to increase the accessibility of emerging payment trends and visibility of both payments and goods.

            "answer_text": "Blockchain technology is no longer confined to cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. It is not all that distributed ledgers have to offer. Blockchain has the potential to revolutionize everything from music to the healthcare industry and have a significant impact on how we do business. Early adoption with variations of blockchain technology has a great impact and proven to some success in the financial sphere. Known for disruptive impact on cryptocurrencies, blockchain\u2019s impact is now being felt in countless many industries.  It\u2019s very complicated to say which industry will be hugely impacted by the Spheres of the blockchain technology. There are so many different applications that, in some ways, is fastest to adapt by blockchain technology The healthcare sector: An emerging business practice with blockchain technologies Medical and Healthcare services. As a distributed ledger, the blockchain's can also see wide use in Medical and Healthcare services due to facts that extensive data is exchanged and stored across all network nodes in a simultaneous, transparent and immutable fashion. Often it takes a large amount of time for obtaining the same data i.e form, medical records, diagnostics and prescription information etc. which otherwise can be very easy to access in secured manner by doctors worldwide using a private key thus by using Blockchain and can invest that time for the best of care to the patients.  Supply chain management.For supply chain management, Blockchain tamper resistant and distributed data storage features offer the benefits of traceability, transparency and cost-effectiveness. This not only solves the problems by providing the sophisticated systems for verifying shipments but also can be used to track logistics, supply, their origin, quantity and so forth and dramatically cut down on the amount of paperwork needed to track shipments. This brings a new level of transparency to B2B logistics ecosystems and will benefit massively by simplifying processes by its encrypted, decentralized, and \u2013 most importantly the tamper-proof ledger.  Smart contracts: The growth of every business suffers if the contractual transactions are not carried out timely and securely. Blockchain may be a good in terms of storing digital contracts, automatic validation. All the agreement, payment details, parties\u2019 information is stored in the distributed ledger blockchain by using the smart contract. Once all the conditions are met the transaction automatically happened and the parties which involve in this process automatically get the benefits. Thus this avoids the need for mediators and therefore saves the company time and money. Music Industry: Music copyright, smart contracts and artist pay are some of the activities that stand to gain significant improvements from blockchain technology. Currently, the music industry is undergoing some of the most friction, in terms of royalty payment, transparency and piracy, and required the middleman to manage the transaction. Zimrii music uses the blockchain to solve some of the most music industry problems by eliminating the middlemen.  ",
