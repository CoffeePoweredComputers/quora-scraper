            "answer_text": "Yes.  I have been doing option volatility trading for a very long time.  The market is heavily rigged in some ways that are illegal, some that are legal, and some ways that are borderline. The legal stuff is just what you know going in, such as about the bid/ask spread.  The borderline stuff is what you read about in flash boys, where the high frequency traders will jump in front of your order when they see it coming.  This steals profits off of long terms investors, but not all of them. Maximum Pain Theory The truly nasty stuff you see when you observe what happens when lots of money is on the line.  On a macro scale, there is something called Maximum Pain Theory.  It states that with high probability the price of a stock will end up at a place to cause the maximum pain to holders of options that are going to expire soon.  Options are worth the difference between their strike price and the option price at expiration, if they are in the money (the stock is above the right-to-buy price, or below the right-to-sell price).  Every Friday the price of a stock usually ends up such that the most number of outstanding option contracts become worthless before they expire for good. If you extend on this theory to make it more accurate, you would create a function that took into account what price all those contracts were bought at, and the stock would receive pressure to be at the point that captured the maximum amount of value across all of those outstanding options.  Then as time goes by they capture more value as time value drains from the options.  In my experience, this is a good way to predict option prices. Game Theory and Order Spoofing How are they doing this?  Well for one it requires collusion (game theory algorithms as market makers with the most capital use high frequency trading) to price fix at least to a degree, which is supposed to be illegal.  The people doing may conveniently argue that the outstanding options contracts imply an underlying value of the stock which is at the same point they want it to be anyways, and that collusion is required in order for market making to be profitable and not too risky.  This is absurd and highly convenient for them as they collect millions per week of investor's money.  It may also be justified by calling option purchasers speculators, and then blaming them for speculating. It is done through a technique called order spoofing.  Orders are placed in small lots within nanoseconds, and such orders placed by big money market making firms are what give the market most of it's liquidity.  If they wanted to set the price, all they need to do is remove some of that liquidity on one side of the order book and be sure that the other big dogs are going to play along with them.  Then the price moves even if there is the same amount of shares sold and bought.  The game theory algorithms partially depend on orders being split among different market makers somewhat, so that one doesn't have a huge incentive to do the opposite of what the others want.   SEC Limitations on autorigging the market However, their ability to price fix is not absolute and Maximum Pain theory doesn't always play out.  This is especially true during large news events affecting investor sentiment.  As I understand it, the SEC has said that these institutions must be market making a certain percent of the time and pursuing proprietary trading only in the remainder time.  This places a limit on their ability to overcome large amounts of pressure from regular investors as they can only unbalance the order book so much.  They also must choose which stocks to allocate how much funds for market making, so a large event in a cheap stock can still cause deviations since the requirement is based on the percentage of time they have to be legitimately market making.  There are also the smaller guys who can market make, but who collectively do not have as many funds and only lessen the impact of the big firms. There have also been cases where firms did other things, but got in trouble for them.  Some examples are a firm trading with itself millions of times a second to drive the price in a certain direction.  With game theory, different firms can simply do this with each other with the same purpose in mind.  Order spoofing has been used other ways, like it was in the open outcry days.  A firm places tons of buy/sell orders to get others on board and drive the price, but then cancels all those orders when they see a counter-party coming.   Personal experience with Blatant Manual Rigging I have also experienced other things that indicate that margin calls are used as a way to prevent large institutions from losing too much money.     For instance it is Broker Fraud for a broker to trade on your behalf without your permission on a cash account because it never affects them if your trade goes bad.  However, most traders use margin accounts, and cash accounts usually do not have much money at risk. I however have traded large sums of money on cash accounts before, in ways that are highly leveraged and found that brokers will go nuts and even cheat to try and prevent these kinds of trades from becoming profitable.   For example, say you purchase 100 million dollars worth of stock in some company partly on margin, and it goes up 1% by the end of the day.  You would make a million dollars, but if the price of the stock drops before that happens they can liquidate your position and lose you a bunch of money.  Well many retail brokers sell their order flow to market making firms.  This is also done under the pretext of having them give the best execution.  Well even if they do give the best execution right away, they can also use that information to manipulate the stock price to cause a short term scare which allows the brokers justification to margin call and liquidate the position.  In this case, the market making firm can kick some of the profit to the brokerage firm for doing so.   Now for one of my cash examples.  Once I tried to put 10,000 dollars into out of the money stock options on expiration day for those options.  This is, even under normal circumstances A HIGHLY RISKY MOVE which has a significantly high probability of causing total loss of the 10,000 and costs a lot in commissions.  I had a limit order for .02 cents on calls that should have gone through as the stock jumped up right after open.  The order was cancelled by my brokerage firm immediately before it went through without my permission.  Now, say the stock had gone up to 1.75 above those options strike price, and the options were then worth 2.00.  I would have made a 9900% return on my investment (aka 1 million).   My TDAmeritrade broker immediately called me and started yelling at me about all the risks and negatives about doing this kind of trade.  I told him I knew what the hell I was doing, that it was a cash account, and that it was none of his damn business as it only affects me other than the commissions they receive.  He then got nervous and said he was going to put a \"note on my account\" that I am doing these kinds of trades to avoid this thing in the future. Fast forward to a different brokerage firm and a similar thing happened.  My broker closed my  CASH ACCOUNT expiration day position at a loss without my permission minutes before the options went into the money would have been worth 10 times what I paid for them.   There is strong evidence here, besides the payment for order flow and other shady interaction between brokers and large market making firms, that they have a close working relationship designed to prevent big losses to retail traders.  The only reason I was able to gain a closer glimpse into this relationship was because of my unusual activity.  It is reasonable to assume that this vertical collusion occurs more smoothly and automatically for regular margin traders.   So basically yes it is highly, highly rigged. ",

            "answer_text": "Anyone who doesn\u2019t get what he wants out of the market assumes that it\u2019s rigged. If current stock markets in the US are rigged, it\u2019s pretty subtle, given the squint-eyed oversight by the SEC and other agencies. Let it be admitted that left to themselves, participants in any market will rig the game, if by \u201crig\u201d you mean deploying practices that give them an unfair advantage. That\u2019s what happened in decades past, when financiers could artificially inflate or deflate the prices of stocks. But in those days, regulators assumed that anyone playing in the market was a shark, and that there were no little fish. The idea was to let the sharks play. That scheme crashed and burned when the markets invited small investors into the pool, just ordinary people with some money to invest. Instantly there was a huge asymmetry of information between the professionals and the tyros, leading to systematic robbery of the latter. The government finally stepped in to make public companies reveal their true numbers and enforced it with numerous criminal trials for fraud. Today the machinations of a Michael Milken are so rare that they rate massive media coverage, not a shoulder shrug. But is the playing field always level? Not on your life. There are always those who know better and those who don\u2019t. In that sense, I suppose you could say the market was rigged. Many public companies fudge their data in legal ways (one of my favorite investing books is Financial Shenanigans by Schilit and Perler). Is that rigging? I suppose you could say so. What about insider trading as a rigging method? Not likely. Even high-fliers like Martha Stewart aren\u2019t immune to charges of insider trading and subsequent conviction. This doesn\u2019t seem to me evidence for tacitly approvals of rigging. The stock market of today is immensely sophisticated and complex, with trades being made at speeds so high that network latency is a limiting factor and arbitrageurs are pushing the very limits of network speed. If you can\u2019t participate in this arena, does that mean it\u2019s rigged? Doubtful. In sum, given the colossal amount of trading of massive numbers of companies on any given day, there has to be some devious table-tilting, but it\u2019s unlikely to be systemic and very unlikely to affect the market in general. If you bother to learn what you\u2019re doing, you can probably wade into the market with some small confidence if you plan to buy and hold for a while. If you want to day-trade, I suggest the book A Random Walk Down Wall Street by Malkiel. And a rosary and ouija board. ",
