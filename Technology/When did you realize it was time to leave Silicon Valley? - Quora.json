            "answer_text": " After the dot-com crash in the early 2000s, followed closely by 9/11, consumer and citizen confidence took a nosedive. I had been working in the Valley since the mid-1990s. Not in tech, but at the ad agencies which were an essential part of selling e-products and services to the masses. \u201cYou guys got all the money!\u201d claimed one guy from Thunderbird Business School, whose shared the same North Beach watering hole as me and my ad colleagues. The money, the VCs, the ad contracts and the jobs seemed to disappear within a matter of months. More and more, you\u2019d see former colleagues pulling espresso at Starbucks, or contemplating moving back to wherever they came from. Possibly to return to the employer they had left to chase their dot com dream, possibly to go back to law school or art school or finally chase their dream of teaching yoga in Tulum, Mexico. My boyfriend and I decided to stay. We\u2019d both managed to score some freelance work for the clients our agency used to service. Our rent-controlled apartment was cheap. And we discovered a fun and fairly lucrative side hustle, selling goods people abandoned in their hurry to get out of town. There was a three-month wait for moving vans, so it was common to see piles of furniture, clothes, electronics, and other discarded things with a \u201cfree\u201d sign on the heels of a vacancy. We\u2019d go out and gather what we could. TVs, vacuums and VCRs were easy to fix and resell on Craigslist. I remember selling 5 TVs in one day at $50 a pop. We collected nice china and crystal for estate sales; there was still non-dot-com money in town with a taste for luxury items of a bygone era. We also collected certain brand clothing (I remember Levi\u2019s, Patagonia, OP, vintage designer dresses and purses), and sell them to collectors, also on Craigslist. One guy \u2014 a middleman to several large boutiques in Japan \u2014 would come to our house, dig through our wares and take what he wanted, to the tune of $200-$300 cash. I got to be friends with that guy. We\u2019d prowl thrift shops before a big sale, setting aside the things we wanted and hiding them in racks where they\u2019d be less likely to be discovered (maternity clothing, children\u2019s wear) so we could come during the sale and buy them for half price. We\u2019d also go to flea markets really early, where people would bring out work clothes to sell. We\u2019d dig through the clothes, pulling out vintage Levis with the prized \u201cred tag\u201d and buy them for double the guy\u2019s price. Early bird got the worm, and the worm went to Japan, apparently, where vintage Americana sold for big yen. The freelancing and the vulturing didn\u2019t last. We reluctantly left our lovely Noe Valley apartment, packed up our most-treasured vintage finds, and left for the slightly-less-expensive and less-tech-dependent suburbs of Boston. After a few years, I got sick of Boston and ended up back in Seattle, in a job which has brought me back to Silicon Valley from time to time. I don\u2019t think I\u2019d want to live there again. Seattle has its own problems, but it\u2019s also home to me. I\u2019d never return to the East Coast, but I do enjoy walking the steep streets of my city, now taken over by a new generation of smart and hopeful young things with technological dreams. We\u2019ll see if another bubble bursts. It has to at some point. Maybe some will leave before things get too bad, maybe some will stay long after conventional opportunities have disappeared, maybe some will have the fun of living off the land, for awhile at least.

            "answer_text": "I\u2019m still here. But I think NOW is a good time to cash out any property you own, and, actually move out of state. I don\u2019t have the time or inclination to list all of my reasons. But to sum it up: I don\u2019t see real estate going up much more, or going down. There is too much uncertainty with Trump\u2019s tax relief, CA taxes, interest rates, and, for now, there are no big pending IPOs in the valley. (Google and Facebook dramatically spiked home prices forever). I suspect there will be oscillations, with no major changes.I don\u2019t believe the economy is set to expand much more, unless, again, Trump\u2019s tax relief does end up heating the economy. But, even if it doesn't help, and it appears to be, rising rates might keep the market tempered. I also suspect oscillations without any near term major changes.So, if you\u2019ve owned property for 10 years or more, and you have a lot of stock options in any company that has been public for 2 or more years.. good time to pack it up. California, which only does well during market booms due to our revenue coming from, mostly capital gains taxes, is set for some serious problems. Public employee unions in CA are and will bankrupt the state (they actually make more money than tech workers in many cases, I\u2019ve written about this in other quora posts, so forgive my laziness for not citing the amazing citation/site that actually lists public employee pensions and salaries for all san jose employees - it\u2019s shocking). This is why we have the highest tax rates in the nation, highest sales taxes, and the most people in poverty, the most homeless, and why college costs have exploded. The revenue crunch will get much worse, and since the state is a one party state, the only response will be to continually raise taxes. Therefore, on one hand, take historical market place and real estate valuations, the bleak future of CA taxes/regulations and apocalyptic city centers, and move. Not sure how much how much upside there is in holding, and the downside is nearly bottomless. I\u2019m leaving the Valley in the next 2\u20133 years. But I might stay in CA as my income should be in tax free munis (so I say, we\u2019ll see). ",
