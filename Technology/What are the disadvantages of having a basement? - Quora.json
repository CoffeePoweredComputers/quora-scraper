            "answer_text": "When we built our home 35 years ago, and our kids were in grade school, we built over half crawl space and half basement, finished. It was useful at times but not nearly enough to justify the extra cost (to us). Now that the kids are married and in their own homes the basement is largely unused \u2014 but not forgotten. Our furnace and water heater are down there, and our \u201cdry basement\" system which is reliant on a properly working sump pump. In all those years we have never had damaging water in the basement, but, we have to maintain the sump pump and have consider installing a second battery backup system. Not cheap. When the cheap plastic drier duct finally clogged up and leaked after 25 years, I couldn't simply and easily replace it without tearing up the finished drywall ceiling \u2014 not worth it. So I had to reroute the drier vent to the garage (next room over). Not the best alternative but the easiest and cheapest. We found out last year that having a dry finished basement does not increase the market value of the home appreciably. Looking back, I wish I never had the basement built. You have to decide what is of value to you. ",

            "answer_text": "If you asked my wife she\u2019d say she\u2019d never have a basement again. This is because it never stays dry whenever we get one of those toad strangler rain storms! It\u2019s mainly due to having a concrete block foundation wall that has a broken seal at the point where it meets the slab. Even if you have a \u201cdry\u201d basement you still have a lot of humidity in it. That\u2019s usually the case with any space that\u2019s below ground. I think it\u2019s because there\u2019s a lot of moisture that\u2019s trapped in the basement because there\u2019s no windows to ventilate it. If you had a walk out basement (windows on one or more sides) that helps! Another problem that comes up with a basement is plumbing. Sometimes the Sewer Main is higher than the basement floor. If you wanted a bathroom in the basement you would have to have a grinder pump in order to get the sewage out of the building. If the pump goes out (wear or power outage) any plumbing down there couldn\u2019t be used. If they were used they could back up into the basement. All that said a basement could be a great way to add more liveable space to your house, including a storm shelter and additional storage. ",
