They're millions of times faster than even the most powerful super computers, but the concepts behind them are complicated. Here's the basics that anyone can understand.  Image credit: Flickr/IBM Research Compared to 50 years ago, the computing power that we have available to us at our fingertips is astonishing. There\u2019s more number crunching power in our smartphones than there were in military computers back then. However, even with the most powerful supercomputers on the planet, some problems are still way beyond our reach and there are still some problems out there that would take longer than the universe has existed to solve. This is where quantum computing comes into play. Many people believe, including myself, that quantum computers will be able to solve problems that conventional classical computers (like the laptop on your desk and the smartphone in your pockets) just haven\u2019t got the power to solve. In this post, I\u2019m going to explain quantum computing, in layman\u2019s terms, in other words, in plain English. It\u2019s quite a complicated subject, but don\u2019t worry, I\u2019m going to explain it so that anyone can understand. What You Will Learn What is classical computing?What is quantum computing?What will quantum computers do?Latest developments in quantum computingWhat is classical computing? Before I get onto quantum computing, it\u2019s useful to understand a little bit about what classical computing is, and also how it works. Classical computing, refers to the number crunching that goes on inside your laptop or your phone. You might think of your computer as a cool device that allows you to do your internet shopping, chat to your friends on Facebook, but really, behind all that, it\u2019s a general-purpose number crunching machine that executes a set of prewritten instructions which when put together, is called a computer program. Conventional computers store numbers in memory and uses those stored numbers to perform simple calculations such as addition and subtraction. When computers perform a bunch of these operations in a sequence, it becomes an algorithm and that's when computers start to become useful. In order to perform calculations and store numbers in memory, computers use tiny switches called Transistors. Transistors can either be 'on' or 'off'. So if a transistor is switched on then we can store a number one (1) and likewise, if it's off, we can store a zero (0). Using a series of 1's and 0's we can represent and store any number, letter or symbol. Each of these ones and zeros is called a binary digit or 'bit'. Using just eight of these 'bits', a computer can store in total 255 different characters such as A-Z, a-z, 0-9 and a bunch of common symbols.  In terms of calculations, computers calculate using circuits known as logic gates, which themselves are made up of a number of transistors connected together. When logic gates are chained together, you start to build up the capability to perform more advanced calculations and algorithms. Transistors are awesome, they power every electronic device in existence today, and incredibly, electronic engineers and scientists have managed to cram hundreds of millions of these tiny switches onto pieces of silicon the size of your thumbnail. However, we have got to the point now where transistors are almost as small as an atom and can't get any smaller. This has forced us to rethink how we build our computers and devices. Amazing as they are, a computer is just a calculator that uses just two states ('on' - 1 and 'off' - 0) to make sense of the world, make decisions, calculate and execute a number of predetermined instructions. Quantum computers take the capabilities of classical computers to the next level. They will still perform calculations just like conventional computers, but they will perform them significantly faster and will be used to solve complex problems that are out of reach and far beyond the capabilities of normal, classical computers. What is quantum computing? When particles get smaller and smaller, towards the atomic scale, their behaviour gets a bit weird and they behave ways that you might not expect. For example, atomic and subatomic particles can exist in more than one state at time. As I mentioned previously, classical computers use bits to represent and store information and physically they are represented by transistors. Quantum computers are different however. They use quantum bits also known as qubits. These \u2018qubits\u2019 can be a one, a zero or a superposition of them both at the same time which can create nontrivial correlated states of a number of qubits, so-called 'entangled states'. One good way to think of this is to imagine a sphere where each pole is a different state. So, a classical \u2018bit\u2019 can be in one of two states, at either of the two poles of the sphere. The difference with a quantum bit is that it can be at any point on the sphere, significantly increasing the number of states. This means that a quantum computer that uses qubits can store a ridiculous amount of information using less energy compared to a classical computer. Because quantum bits can have multiple states, quantum computers will be millions of times faster than even the most powerful super computers that are in existence today.  continue\u2026 ",

            "answer_text": "Quantum computing is an area of study that focuses on developing computer technology that is based on the principles of quantum theory. Following the laws of quantum physics, a computer would gain enormous processing power through the ability to be in multiple states and to perform tasks using all possible permutations simultaneously. Quantum theory's development began in 1900 with a presentation by Max Planck to the German Physical Society, in which he introduced the idea that energy exists in individual units, as does matter. Further developments by a number of scientists over the following thirty years led to the modern understanding of quantum theory. The Essential Elements of Quantum Theory: Energy, like matter, consists of discrete units, rather than solely as a continuous wave.Elementary particles of both energy and matter may behave like either particles or waves, depending on the conditions.The movement of elementary particles is inherently random, and thus, unpredictable.The simultaneous measurement of two complementary values, such as the position and momentum of an elementary particle, is inescapably flawed; the more precisely one value is measured, the more flawed the measurement of the other value will be.The essential elements of quantum computing originated with Paul Benioff, working at Argonne National Labs, in 1981, but it is generally accepted that David Deutsch of Oxford University provided the critical impetus for quantum computing research in 1984. Current centers of research in quantum computing include MIT, IBM, Oxford University, and the Los Alamos National Laboratory.  Besides transforming material science, quantum computing could lead to significant developments in artificial intelligence and allow for search or analysis of much more data than can be handled by today's most powerful machines.
