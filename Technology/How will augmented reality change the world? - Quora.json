            "answer_text": "Augmented Reality will not change the world, at least not in its current state. Augmented reality is a tool, and mostly a visualization tool.  In its current state, it is a novel tool, great for standing out and getting the short term attention of consumers.  At its current best, it gives additional visual data and cues-- think machine maintenance walk throughs and \"what's around me\". However, augmented reality will change the world when the hardware and the content catches up. Current major limitations in AR include batteries, processing power, sensors (cameras included), form factor (right now, we're stuck with mobile and this eye-wearable bandwagon), and of course content creation.  Many people confuse the data accumulation and representation (i.e 3d models) that are associated with current AR experiences to be part of the core AR technology. The AR tech itself, can generally be broken down into 1. Recognition2. Tracking3. RenderingThese three parts can be amazing and an AR experience will still seem useless, unless the information it is rendering is awesome. To make the transmittance of information awesome, we need hardware that is unobtrusive and responsive, and content to match.  Once we reach this point, we're talking about a world where anyone can look at anything and have the correct and useful information about it pop up. 1. Navigation: You have no sense of direction.  You have a map, but you don't know which way is north. AR will provide the navigation overlaid on the real world path you need to take  2. Maintenance/ Training: You're training to be a pilot. There are hundreds of buttons. AR helps you go through the buttons in the order you need to fly the plane-- you'll simply see it overlaid on the actual control panel.  3. Everyday information: You need to catch a bus and know the weather. Looking at a bus sign gives you the schedule and next arriving bus; and looking at the sky and asking for the weather gives you that information. Augmented reality at its best will change the way we look at things and gather data. ",

Who would have thought we could experience the natural environment simply by clicking a button on the smartphone sitting in the living room! Augmented reality breathes life into digital creations It is sheltered to accept that AR had, no less than, a noteworthy effect on the achievement of the game. Indeed, its prosperity has incited designers everywhere throughout the world to bounce into the AR advertise with expectations of making another Pokemon Go.

Games are presently turning out at an unfathomable rate, every one attempting to exploit the promising new innovation and the astonishing capacity it needs to attract individuals when done well obviously. Catering: Now a day restaurants and other catering facilities are already using AR solutions for their benefits in various ways: \u00b7 AR games to lure new clients \u00b7 Interactive 360 view of every dish, correct size, portion, ingredients \u00b7 Using navigation to provide information about the restaurants, bars and cafes nearby Attraction: AR can be used in exploring various tourist destinations and attraction.
