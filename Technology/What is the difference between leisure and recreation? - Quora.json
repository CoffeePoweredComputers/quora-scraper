            "answer_text": "Leisure is the time we have which isn\u2019t taken up with work and other responsibilities. We can do whatever we want with it\u2014even sleep it away. Recreation is doing things in our free time which give us enjoyment\u2014sports, hobbies, board, card, and video games, etc. We can have recreation in our leisure time, but we don\u2019t have leisure when we\u2019re having recreation\u2014at least not completely. Any games where one is sitting down could probably be considered leisure-time activities, although some people take them very seriously, so I\u2019m not so sure. ",

            "answer_text": "Leisure to me is watching tv, going out to eat with friends. Things that don't require exercise gear. Recreation to me is putting on the exercise gear and running shoes. So recreation is more active even if it is just bowling or playing basketball. Your brain is engaged differently. Your body is working differently. ",
