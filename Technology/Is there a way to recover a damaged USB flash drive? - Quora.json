Once it completely dried up you can use your drive & check whether it\u2019s working fine or not, and also is your data is still safe or it completely washed away. In case you have lost your data then you need a data recovery service provider as it is a case of physical damage. Basically, there are 2 types of damages that can happen to any storage drive: 1. Logical Damage 2. Physical Damage However, the end result is the same i.e. \u201cLoss of Data\u201d Logical damage or logical errors are like corruption, formatting, lost partitions, accidentally deletion or unresponsiveness of drive whereas physical damages are like loss of data due to breakage, fire, water, etc. You can give a try with Stellar Data Recovery Professional Software, if it may help you recover your lost data otherwise you need a data recovery service provider who is well equipped with all the tools & techniques to take out all your data from that physically damaged drive.
