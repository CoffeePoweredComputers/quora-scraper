            "answer_text": "This was extracted from my complete evaluation of OMG, which you can find here. The OMG design is based on a Proof-of-Stake blockchain that maintains records corresponding to wallets that may represent any number of assets or commodities, from shopper rewards points, to digital currency, to fiat. The network allows for the matching and trading of orders across these wallets. Order matching is done in conjunction with network validation and recorded to a blockchain. Ethereum can be locked into the OMG network via smart contracts. With this Ether bonded into the OMG network, it\u2019s possible to trade alternate assets over Ether, thereby increasing liquidity. So OMG also serves to bolster Ethereum. So how it\u2019s set up is that a third party pledges to provide some Ether. The network then matches trades, leveraging this bonded Ether when necessary. When the majority of network members agree on a trade history, a block is registered. Meanwhile, that third party holder of Ether gets a cut of the transaction, provided they behave according to the rules of the network, otherwise they are penalized. The trading parties remain liable to each other through a system of Hashed TimeLock Contracts, (HTLC\u2019s). HTLC\u2019s are digital contracts that expire if they are not claimed. Two parties offer up these self-destructing contracts. When an approved third party is able to match these contracts under the terms of the network, a transaction is recorded that will be hashed to the blockchain. Transactions can also be moved to sidechains in order to reduce impact on the network. If you\u2019re using the platform to back a customer rewards program, for instance, you can conduct most transactions on a sidechain, reconciling to the main chain for major transactions. This is definitely complicated, and represents my own incomplete understanding of the system. But I\u2018m not entirely convinced that the creators of this platform have nailed down the details of how it will work just yet. As always, do your own research, and if you have a chance to go through the whitepaper on your own. ",
