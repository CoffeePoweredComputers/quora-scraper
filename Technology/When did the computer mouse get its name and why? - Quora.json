            "answer_text": " This is the origin of the term used for the pointing device in computing, but it took a long meandering journey to get from there to here. Back in Ye Olden Days, craftsmen of all sorts would take on apprentices - the apprentices were taught the craft in question in exchange for doing the low, menial labor.  The lowest of the low among apprentices was designated 'the mouse'.  They were practically slaves, subservient to all other apprentices (in addition to the master), and were to obey without question.  They learned to anticipate the needs of their \"betters\" and were to perform their tasks without causing any disruption (seldom even speaking). This sort of hierarchy waned in many professions though it the name persisted for similar positions.  In early textile mills, women would work the looms while a 'mouse' (usually a young boy or girl) scurried beneath to sweep up lint.  On assembly lines, a 'mouse' (usually a teen boy) would ensure that the workers' bins of nuts, bolts, screws, and the like never ran empty.  In offices, a 'mouse' was tasked to ensure that every typist had an extra ribbon, every stenographer had a few extra pens, every desk had adequate paper clips, and so forth. In 1950s science-fiction (there are numerous candidates and no one can agree which truly qualify), spaceships and other vehicles featured a device that one would rest their hand upon which required only the slightest of gestures to perform the most elaborate of maneuvers.  Though most often unnamed, it was identified a few times as a \"mouse\" - alluding to the underling who so unobtrusively enabled their senior to work uninterrupted.   (The manual flight controls for Max from Flight of the Navigator (1986) are illustrative - the concept is decades older, but I'm having trouble finding older images.) As with \"robot\", \"warp\", and many other now-common terminology, \"mouse\" was yet another term to originate in sci-fi and work its way into the mainstream once its far-fetched concept worked its way into the mainstream.
