            "answer_text": "Career growth in HCL is quite decent i will say. You will get to learn many new things here without much pressure of work. Flexible timings and work environment are the best pros of this company. It also depends if you are a fresher or an experienced individual. If you are fresher then you will get good opportunities to learn and will get onsite opportunities soon in your career. Hike is also quite decent i got 25% during my first appraisal. But if you are joining as an experienced resource then my friend you should stop thinking about money as you will not get an annual hike of more than 10%. You can learn and can switch to a different company after an year. To sum up this i believe Career growth depends on the individual also if he/she is interested to learn and accept ownership of tasks given Thanks! ",
