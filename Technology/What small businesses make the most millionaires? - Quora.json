What\u2019s sexy about waste management? Nothing \u2013 but it made Wayne Huizenga Et al billionaires.  What do you think the going price is for disposing of nuclear or hazardous waste materials? Right now, it costs $38 billion or more to store nuclear waste in the United States. The most millionaires aren\u2019t in the tech space. They\u2019re in heavy industries such as oil and \u2013 get this \u2013 accounting. The person locked in the back office crunching numbers all day? They\u2019re more likely than any of your neighbors to become millionaires. Get boring - not exciting. The young ones all want to start a sexy business. That\u2019s your opportunity to start something unsexy and profitable. Everything from fitting pipes and electrical wiring counts as a boring business. Here are a few more examples: Insurance: My goodness is insurance is lucrative. Do you know they have different accounting requirements than other businesses? It\u2019s basically a black box. It may be hard to get it off the ground (aren\u2019t all businesses) but once you hit a critical mass of customers \u2013 you\u2019re a juggernaut. Construction:  We\u2019ve been building since the dawn of time and will continue to build until the end of time. Two thousand years ago, it was the romans building roads to distant lands. Today, it\u2019s single family homes and skyscrapers. It doesn\u2019t matter. Everything from infrastructure to moveable homes is fair game. Cleaning: Cleaning services are surprisingly lucrative. The hardest part is landing contracts or repeat customers. Once you learn how to set up your pipeline, you\u2019ll enjoy high margins. It\u2019s a volume business. The more you do the more you make \u2013 period. Manufacturing:  Small scale high quality manufacturing commands a premium these days. Fifty years ago, it was about the mass produced products that everyone could get. Everyone was the same. Now, it\u2019s about being unique. Small batch production runs of expensive limited edition items are incredibly valuable. Percy out Connect with me on Quora to get all my answers ",

            "answer_text": "The Unsexy Ones  Ever wondered how much that little old lady who owns the dry cleaning business down the street may be worth? Probably over a million bucks? Surprised? Here\u2019s the proof Now that that\u2019s out of the way, let\u2019s get started. First things first, a million is not a lot of cash. I\u2019m not one of those stupid internet people telling you I make millions and I\u2019m crazy successful so a million means nothing; you can\u2019t deny it\u2019s good money, but it\u2019s not the benchmark it used to be. That being said, you\u2019d be surprised how many people around you are easily in the millionaire club without you knowing it. Let\u2019s begin with a story. I have a friend who owns a biohazard/crime scene cleanup business. His teams go in to clean up the fluids, body parts, etc that are present after a crime or accident has occurred. Some of the photos I\u2019ve seen are pretty disgusting (it takes a lot to make my stomach turn), and personally I would never do it. But he does! And you know what? He turns a profit of about $10M a year. Not too shabby right? Cleans up brains off the roadway, drives around in a Mercedes AMG GT S; That\u2019s life, Go figure. To put it in perspective, most executives, don\u2019t come close to this compensation. No longer do you have to be a wall street executive, hot shot trader, or big businessman to make a million bucks. Here\u2019s a list of some very unsexy ideas that can get you on the path to the coveted 7 figures: Dry CleaningGarbage CollectionLawn Care / GardeningEldercare / Assisted LivingB2B IT SolutionsFarmingCar RentalsPet ServicesBuilding Cleaning/Janitorial ServicesFuneral HomesThese are everyday things that everyday Americans spend money on. How much? Billions of dollars a year. They\u2019re not going to go anywhere anytime soon, so the business models are relatively stable. Additionally, there\u2019s not a ton of people that want to enter certain industries like janitorial services, or funeral homes so the number of providers offering services is smaller. Due to this, people will more likely turn to your services and you make a decent chunk of cash. Do the things that are hard/boring/unsexy or otherwise undesired and watch that bank balance grow! ",

            "answer_text": "5 Tiny Companies Making Millions  NEW YORK ( MainStreet) -- What do organic baby food, the relief of back ailments, nutritional water, IP-phone services and a golf simulator all have in common? Companies with less than 50 employees figured out how to turn each of these niches into multi-million dollar revenue streams.  No easy task, and the secret of these successful entrepreneurs is to find where the opportunity is and make sure your product is one that consumers (or commercial customers) can't live without. Though once the products gave these companies their start, they didn't rest on their laurels. Staying focused on their industries and constantly considering new products or markets keeps these companies in growth mode. 1. Happy Family 2011 revenue: $34.7 million Employees: 32 Shazi Visram launched Happy Family on Mother's Day in 2006 after being unable to find suitable home style healthy, organic baby food options. She started the company with the intentions of making the food for her friends' babies and her own family, but the concept took off. Six years later, Happy Family products are available in more than 17,000 stores nationwide and on Amazon ( AMZN) and Diapers.com. Last year, revenue totaled $34.7 million, up from $156,000 in 2006. What's more impressive is that this is all done with a staff of just 32 full-time workers. Happy Family's beginnings were very grassroots. After Visram's company started selling at a New York City grocery chain, it hired part-time workers (called \"Happy Mamas\") to spread the word about their products by handing out coupons to moms in parks and playgrounds. The company now has more than 50 Happy Mamas across the U.S. Happy Family's complete line of cereals, meals and snacks for ages from babies to toddlers and kids helps the company stand out in a crowded marketplace, Visram says. The products are certified organic and include nutrients that help brain and eye development, prebiotics and probiotics to support digestive health, as well as ingredients like Salba, kale and quinoa to make the products as nutritious as possible, she says. The company is continuing to launch new products, particularly as babies that have been eating Happy Family meals are growing up. Visram says parents are asking for products for their five- and six-year-olds and older. In March, Happy Family launched 15 new products, including a new line for preschool snack time and elementary school lunchboxes, pouches of nutritious drinkable snacks, and crunchy snacks in individual packets to teach self-feeding to toddlers, among other things. \"As a mom, I believe that everything we feed our families should provide the best possible nutrients, whether your child is a newborn or ready for preschool. We want to continue growing with our families and engaging parents and kids alike in learning about how nutrient-rich ingredients can be combined to work together, while also training young palates to crave healthy foods,\" Visram says. 2. Hint Water 2011 revenue: $30+ million Employees: 20 Kara Goldin, founder of Hint Water, also noticed that there was an opportunity in the beverage market while trying to satisfy her family. As she began to encourage her four children to make healthier choices she noticed they preferred her pitchers of ice water with sliced fruit. It was then that she realized she was on to something. Goldin, a former vice president at AOL ( AOL), decided to create the all-natural flavored water. Seven years later, her company has revenue of more than $30 million, with 20 employees and some big name investors like singer-songwriter and Grammy-winner John Legend. Despite the success, it's still very much a family-run business. Kara and her husband Theo head up the company's operations. The natural essence waters have zero calories, zero sugar and zero artificial flavors and preservatives and initially came in 10 flavors. The brand's message of \"Drink Water Not Sugar\" has resonated with health conscious consumers. More than 30 nationwide retailers carry her beverage including Whole Foods ( WFM), Starbucks ( SBUX) and Amazon ( AMZN). Last year, Hint Water added Hint Fizz, a carbonated version of the beverage. 3. Axia Technology Partners 2011 revenue: $8.2 million Employees: 25 Thanks to the popularity of Internet Protocol (IP)-based phone systems, Axia Technology Partners is projecting sales of roughly $10 million for 2012, just four years after it was launched. While the product itself is growing in popularity, Josh Ross, who founded the company with his brother Jason, says it was important for Axia to set itself apart from the competition in order to succeed. He speaks of several key areas to the Axia business model that is driving the company's growth. Customers of the company's systems range from municipalities to hospitals, power companies and corporations ranging from five to 2,500 employees across the country. So far, the company has more than $6.8 million in contract revenue booked for 2012, it says. Ross says it was imperative to focus on specific opportunities in the IP-service market, meaning where could they sell their product that others weren't. Second, Ross says by offering customers tailored IP-services instead of a one-size-fits-all product and excellent service, Axia stands out. \"While it is understood that revenue drives direction, consumers should not be pitched products or services that only benefit the salesmen and the selling corporation,\" he says. \"When this happens, a sale occurs, but is a short lived relationship. At Axia, we are all about long term solutions and relationships. We are building customers for life and ensuring we are the resource that they turn to when they need anything IP.\" Businesses should know their competition. Axia's competitors include Cisco ( CSCO), Avaya, Interactive Intelligence and ShoreTel ( SHOR) on the product side. On the service side, it's AT&T ( T) and Verizon ( VZ). \"While thousands of companies provide phone systems, internet, co-location, and phone service independently, an almost non-existent few provide a total solution that covers all of these spectrums,\" Ross says. \"This is the niche that has become a huge part of our success story. Not only do we provide tailored business solutions, we provide an all-encompassing approach to ensuring the best results for customers by becoming their phone company, internet and co-location provider, as well as their phone system and software manufacturer.\" Axia is positioning itself for even further growth. As part of that growth, the company is moving its corporate headquarters in October to a larger, more cohesive space in downtown Indianapolis. Ross expects the employee count to double and the company to continue to invest in its operational network and back office for equipment upgrades and to expand the services to other areas of the country. \"We are focused on providing a professional and consultative buying experience and look forward to attracting more corporations in the $25-$100 million in revenue range over the next year,\" he says. 4. BackJoy 2011 revenue: approximately $8 million Employees: 18 Why do all mothers tell their kids to sit up straight? They must be on to something. Indeed they are. Back pain is the second most common reason why people visit the doctor, according to BackJoy. The company, a maker of products that improves posture, was founded in 2005 to offer products that alleviate back ailments. It's mission: to change the way the world \"sits, stands and sleeps.\" The products are sold directly through BackJoy's website and through retailers like Bed, Bath and Beyond ( BBBY) and specialty medical merchants. In the last year, it started distribution in 29 countries. In December, BackJoy introduced Posture+ (shown above), a seat enhancement that helps consumers sit more comfortably and correctly, improving posture, strengthening core muscles to prevent back problems, it says. The company is launching a new pillow for sleeping that shares similar characteristics to the sitting products, but concentrates on a person's head and neck as opposed to the spine and pelvis. By the end of the second quarter, BackJoy will have three product lines -- Sit, Stand, and Sleep -- with multiple products in each category. The company plans to continue expanding product lines and distribution opportunities globally. BackJoy founder and CEO Bing Howstein says success has been a combination of the company's clear mission, consumer-centric focus and a management team that previously worked for Crocs ( CROX) and has experience with global brands. \"Our products are simple and our customers are fanatical,\" he says. \"We provide a timely solution that is a no-nonsense, non-pseudoscience ticket to personal wellness through better posture.\" 5. Dancin' Dogg Golf 2011 revenue: $4.8 million Employees: 13 Dancin' Dogg Golf is the maker of OptiShot, a virtual in-home golf simulator. The company launched an initial simulator prior to its launching of OptiShot in 2010 but it's with the newer version that sales took off. In 2011, the company more than doubled its sales. Dancin' Dogg Golf expects to do the same this year. So far, sales year-to-date are up 35% over the same period last year, the company says, and peak selling season starts late in the third quarter and lasts through the end of the year. OptiShot is sold online and at more than 1,500 major sporting goods retailers including Dick's Sporting Goods ( DKS) and Sports Authority, Amazon ( AMZN) and golf retailers. The company recently hired two employees to help them expand into international sales. \"OptiShot allows users to watch (PGA) Tour stars compete on TV, then immediately test their skills on the same course, from the comfort of home,\" says Brandon Theophilus, CEO of Dancin' Dogg Golf. \"We are selling and shipping product literally as fast as we're having them made.\" Product popularity aside, Theophilus says hiring a \"smart team\" and not being a micro-manager allows employees to succeed. The fact that the company is small also allows it to be nimble and to quickly change directions to beat the competition, he says. \"We've succeeded by delivering an amazingly affordable simulator with precise shot feedback to a truly underserved segment of golfers who can't afford $25,000-plus on an in-home system,\" Theophilus says.

            "answer_text": "10 Lucrative Small Business Ideas That Can Make You The Next Millionaire: 1). Education: The education sector runs in an endless cycle that leaves a revenue channel permanently open. When kids are born, they\u2019re first put into daycare, then nursery school, primary school, secondary school, the university, and other institutions if they choose to advance their knowledge. The wide spectrum of the education sector only shows premium potential for every investor that takes a dive in the right direction While not every investor in the education sector focuses on the common educational institutions, some others invest in special education, adult education, educational websites, educational technology, and even educational resources. With a very wide scope to cover in this industry; whether it\u2019s simply school education, higher education, or the unconventional education sectors, picking the right niche to focus on from a small scale will eventually make you a millionaire. Small business ideas like the education sector can never be overlooked. 2). Agribusiness: The agribusiness sector is one of the largest industries in Africa, India, and the world at large. Since everyone must feed everyday of their lives, the sector would never run short of demand. An increasing world population even makes agriculture a lot more lucrative. Nigeria for instance has a population of over 170 million people, and is expected to exceed that of the United States by the year 2050. This population explosion only makes the agribusiness industry more profitable for new and existing players. Already, many sub-sectors of the agribusiness are already churning in millions for successful farmers in their fields. Great examples are poultry farming (chickens, turkeys, eggs, etc grown for sale), fish farming (a sub sector of aquaculture with the fastest selling breeds such as catfish and Tilapia fish), cassava farming, palm oil farming, and several others. With thousands of small business ideas in agriculture to venture into, any new entrepreneur can easily do a robust market research and pick a high yield in the agribusiness sector to focus on. 3). Retail Stores: When an average individual thinks of purchasing clothing, groceries, medication, and a lot more, their initial inclination is to get up, dress up, and head out to a trusted store in their neighbourhood to purchase these items. The retail store industry in Nigeria and many other places in the world is only getting larger. Every year, thousands of stores start up to cater to the needs of their local community. While some are larger than the others, every retail store entrepreneur still generates varying revenues. As a new entrepreneur, you could choose to setup a brick and mortar store that focuses on selling groceries, fashion items, or one of the other diverse categories. Starting a grocery store, fashion boutique, or supermarket carries it\u2019s own cost implications. But it\u2019s important to start small, so you can understand the market, know what sells better, and how to reposition yourself to claim a bulk of the customers. 4). Web Design Agencies: Every small business needs a website. The problem with African businesses is that millions of them are yet to jump on the online scene to reach more potential customers. This gap in the web design space poses an opportunity for several web design agencies or aspiring entrepreneurs looking to go into web development. As a web designer, you can promote your web design company through SME events, blogging, social networks like LinkedIn, and several other channels. Taking advantage of the millions of small businesses yet to come online by offering them a great website design for their businesses makes this one of the most lucrative small business ideas new tech-oriented entrepreneurs can start up. 5). Mobile App Development Agencies: Many organisations use custom-built mobile applications to engage with their customers. From restaurants to media companies, mobile applications are built to cater for different needs. While not just organisations use mobile apps, thousands of individuals are constantly looking for skilled mobile app developers to bring their ideas to life. This need has slowly made mobile application development in Nigeria get more and more lucrative. In countries like the United States, the demand for mobile applications have more than skyrocketed, and the revenue from each built mobile app is extremely high, depending on the project. An average mobile app in America could cost anywhere from $10,000 to $200,000. In Nigeria for instance, it could cost between $1000 to $10,000. While the cost of building mobile apps in the two countries may differ, handling multiple projects at the same time is the ultimate key to success in the field. As one of the most lucrative small business ideas to venture into in the tech industry, mobile application development is a skill many new tech savvy entrepreneurs must acquire. 6). Digital Advertising Agencies: With hundreds of competing businesses cropping up in every sector, staying afloat as number one or in the top league can be a huge task. This is where advertising agencies come in. Advertising agencies practically help businesses grow by creating compelling campaigns, whether online or offline to not just increase the business\u2019s customer base, but to make their brand name have a meaning to millions of people. Companies search for the most creative digital agency they can find, and when they do, they pay them a lot of money so they can help their brands grow right, and faster. If you\u2019re an experienced copywriter, partnering with a few other copywriters and a really good artist could get your creative agency running in a short time. What determines how you acquire clients and at what speed, are the quality and success of the campaigns you execute. 7). Mobile Phones: Retail stores selling mobile phones online or offline have over time proven the extreme viability and profitability of the sector. In Nigeria for instance, many entrepreneurs have made millions from just selling mobile phones to the ever growing market. A great mobile phone retailer with a remarkable success story is SLOT . The mobile retailer has over the years grown to be the largest player in the Nigerian market. They\u2019ve not just built an unshakeable reputation, but have the largest customer base of mobile phone buyers. One way to get into the mobile phone market is to start by selling cheap mobile phones. Majority of the population prefer low budget phones. While many other people prefer to buy only the latest mobile phones, it\u2019s important you try various marketing strategies like offering mobile phone deals to entice many more individuals to patronise your smart phone business. 8). Real Estate: The real estate industry is currently one of the largest world wide. With several real estate companies focusing on either residential real estate or commercial real estate, the wide span opportunities the industry poses only simply grows. While many real estate companies focus more on the offline sales channels, there are several others focusing on the online channels by setting up real estate websites offering thousands of properties for sale. The property search on these websites are in thousands, and the comfort they give a prospective customer buying a house makes it a lot easier. Examples of some successful online real estate companies in Nigeria are Private Property , ToLet , and Lamudi . No matter the channel real estate companies offer houses for sale or rent through, there\u2019s always a buyer lurking around to buy at a good price. As an individual, you could act as a real estate agent and collect a commission on every sale you bring to the real estate company. Successfully acquiring a lot of customers to purchase properties through you would make you gain some considerable income. It\u2019s important you stay up to date with daily real estate news, so you would always be aware of any policy changes or market vices attempting to shift the market. 9). Small Business Loans: If you have a little extra cash to spare, you could start up a small business that focuses on just providing loan services to other small businesses that need them. Many small business owners hit gridlocks while trying to secure loans from banks and other financial institutions. These institutions set heavy loan requirements which are mostly difficult for small business owners to meet. As a professional money lender, you could provide short term loans with far lesser restrictions to multiple small businesses. Money lending is usually overlooked by many mostly because of the risk of a non-repayment, but is still one of the few modest small business ideas to venture into. 10). The Stock Market: The stock market has both created and destroyed the fortunes of millions of people. But irrespective of the inherent risk, a well seasoned stock trader mostly makes good bets, and also knows the stock market is one of the most profitable small business ideas to venture into. Trading stocks can result in heavy losses for your investments if you don\u2019t have a clue of what\u2019s going on. Before you decide on what stocks to buy, it\u2019s important you study the company\u2019s short and long term progression, talk to your stockbroker, a financial expert, or even a friend that\u2019s been trading successfully in the stock market for a long time. Investing in stocks doesn\u2019t just make you a millionaire overnight. The equity market is not that nice. But stock trading pays experienced entrepreneurs that understand the market trends, and know how to accurately (or almost accurately) predict how a certain stock\u2019s price direction may go.

            "answer_text": "The small business models that make the most millionaires are surprisingly solo-entrepreneur projects, with little overhead. When I discovered that Ryan Holiday was a millionaire I got excited. Hes an author that seems to be the only one working on his projects (I could be wrong) and hes able to make enough money with his business that he\u2019s a millionaire. Have you even heard of Ryan Holiday? The point I\u2019m getting at is that getting to a million dollars isn\u2019t impossible, and it might not even be that difficult\u2014especially with the power of the internet on your side. There are lots of blogs, and lots of authors\u2014who knows how many of them are millionaires? It costs almost nothing to set up a blog, email service provider, and market products that are delivered digitally. This business model, without any doubt, is the best small business idea that can make the most millionaires.  There are so many disadvantages to physical products I can\u2019t even list them all. Did you know you could create and market a product, only to have it counterfeited, copied, and sold at a lower cost within weeks? It has happened and will continue to happen. Even if it\u2019s another manufacturers product, no physical product is safe. Which is why creating intellectual property\u2014digital products such as books, courses, and audiobooks\u2014are the best products to sell to become a millionaire. You end up creating work that lasts because it can\u2019t be copied and made obsolete. Your sales will continue ostensibly for as long as your work remains relevant. The best advice I can give you is this: pay attention to what people are doing, not what they are saying.  If someone is trying to sell you a book on how to start an FBA business, why aren\u2019t they spending their time on an FBA business? Instead they are spending their time trying to sell you a digital product. Do what they are doing. If you find yourself about to buy something, ask yourself how you got there. Study the business you\u2019re about to buy from. Learn from it. Chances are if you are buying it online, that the business owner is a millionare\u2014especially if it\u2019s a digital product. I\u2019ve studied the businesses that sell digital products for years, so you don\u2019t have to. If you want to learn how to get started then I suggest you Sign Up and I\u2019ll send you the best business ideas I\u2019ve found. It all starts with an idea. Some might not work, but some might change your life forever.  Jim Rohn once said \u201cLearn to earn profits, not wages.\u201d He continued by saying \u201cWages make you a living, profits make you a fortune.\u201d To make profits, we need to build businesses.

            "answer_text": "53 answers and not one of them truly answered the question with actual data. The small businesses or industry that makes the most millionaires is farming. Farmers and teachers make up the largest share of millionaires, or to say it differently, there are more farmer-millionaires and teacher-millionaires than there are singer-millionaires or CEO-millionaires. CEOs and famous singers might get paid a lot, but you\u2019re far more likely to hit a million dollars in assets as a teacher or a farmer. This was extensively explored by the economist and author Thomas J. Stanley in his book Stop Acting Rich. He noted that there are a few elements that make farming and teaching more likely to produce millionaires:  Time: You have a long time. Most people aren\u2019t jumping around in careers and landing on farming or teaching. They begin their career right out of college (or earlier for farmers) and so they get the opportunity to learn their trade. The assumption is, you will keep working for the same school district or one that pays better throughout your career, increasing in wage. Pension: Teachers have a good pension, which helps with retirement. Farmers do not have a pension, but they acquire a large amount of farming equipment and other assets over their career which is its own investment. Cost of Living: Teachers tend to live below their means in low cost-of-living areas. Farms tend to be located in rural areas that also have very low cost-of-living, which helps you live below your means. Finally, there is no pressure for a teacher or a farmer (unlike a doctor or a lawyer) to act rich. They can just live their live, add to their investment account on a monthly basis, pay off their debts, and not feel like they need to keep up with the Joneses. ",

Join via the above link. 1). Education The education sector runs in an endless cycle leaves a revenue channel permanently open. When kids are born, they\u2019re first put into daycare, then nursery school, primary school, secondary school, the university, and other institutions if they choose to advance their knowledge. The wide spectrum of the education sector only shows premium potential for every investor that takes a dive in the right direction. While not every investor in the education sector focuses on the common educational institutions, some others invest in special education, adult education, educational websites, educational technology, and even educational resources. With a very wide scope to cover in this industry; whether it\u2019s simply school education, higher education, or the unconventional education sectors, picking the right niche to focus on from a small scale will eventually make you a millionaire. Small business ideas like the education sector can never be overlooked. 2). Agri-business The agri-business sector is one of the largest industries in Africa, India, and the world at large. Since everyone must feed everyday of their lives, the sector would never run short of demand. An increasing world population even makes agriculture a lot more lucrative. Nigeria for instance has a population of over 170 million people, and is expected to exceed that of the United States by the year 2050. This population explosion only makes the agribusiness industry more profitable for new and existing players. Already, many sub-sectors of the agribusiness are already churning in millions for successful farmers in their fields. Great examples are poultry farming (chickens, turkeys, eggs, etc grown for sale), fish farming (a sub sector of aquaculture with the fastest selling breeds such as catfish and Tilapia fish), cassava farming, palm oil farming, and several others. With thousands of small business ideas in agriculture to venture into, any new entrepreneur can easily do a robust market research and pick a high yield in the agribusiness sector to focus on. 3). Retail Stores When an average individual thinks of purchasing clothing, groceries, medication, and a lot more, their initial inclination is to get up, dress up, and head out to a trusted store in their neighbourhood to purchase these items. The retail store industry in Nigeria and many other places in the world is only getting larger. Every year, thousands of stores start up to cater to the needs of their local community. While some are larger than the others, every retail store entrepreneur still generates varying revenues. As a new entrepreneur, you could choose to setup a brick and mortar store that focuses on selling groceries, fashion items, or one of the other diverse categories. Starting a grocery store, fashion boutique, or supermarket carries it\u2019s own cost implications. But it\u2019s important to start small, so you can understand the market, know what sells better, and how to reposition yourself to claim a bulk of the customers. With retail store success stories in Nigeria like PEP, Shoprite, SPAR, or Health Plus, you can be darn sure you\u2019re headed for success. 4). Web Design Agencies: Every small business needs a website. The problem with African businesses is that millions of them are yet to jump on the online scene to reach more potential customers. This gap in the web design space poses an opportunity for several web design agencies or aspiring entrepreneurs looking to go into web development. As a web designer, you can promote your web design company through SME events, blogging, social networks like LinkedIn, and several other channels. Taking advantage of the millions of small businesses yet to come online by offering them a great website design for their businesses makes this one of the most lucrative small business ideas new tech-oriented entrepreneurs can start up. You can also help new businesses and individuals that want to make money from blogging set up a blog on WordPress or Blogger. Starting for as low as only $3.95 per month, anyone can follow this link to create a WordPress blog in minutes for a really cheap rate (this low price is only through my link). In addition to the low pricing, you will receive a free website domain (a $15 value), a free site builder, and a 30-days money-back guarantee through my Bluehost link if you purchase, at least, 12 months of blog hosting. With a computer, good web design skills, a portfolio, and various channels to reach potential clients, you can start earning an average of $500 to $10,000 for every project built. 5). Mobile App Development Agencies Many organisations use custom-built mobile applications to engage with their customers. From restaurants to media companies, mobile applications are built to cater for different needs. While not just organisations use mobile apps, thousands of individuals are constantly looking for skilled mobile app developers to bring their ideas to life. This need has slowly made mobile application development in Nigeria get more and more lucrative. In countries like the United States, the demand for mobile applications have more than skyrocketed, and the revenue from each built mobile app is extremely high, depending on the project. An average mobile app in America could cost anywhere from $10,000 to $200,000. In Nigeria for instance, it could cost between $1000 to $10,000. While the cost of building mobile apps in the two countries may differ, handling multiple projects at the same time is the ultimate key to success in the field. As one of the most lucrative small business ideas to venture into in the tech industry, mobile application development is a skill many new tech savvy entrepreneurs must acquire. 6). Mobile Phones Retail stores selling mobile phones online or offline have over time proven the extreme viability and profitability of the sector. In Nigeria for instance, many entrepreneurs have made millions from just selling mobile phones to the ever growing market. A great mobile phone retailer with a remarkable success story is SLOT. The mobile retailer has over the years grown to be the largest player in the Nigerian market. They\u2019ve not just built an unshakeable reputation, but have the largest customer base of mobile phone buyers. One way to get into the mobile phone market is to start by selling cheap mobile phones. Majority of the population prefer low budget phones. While many other people prefer to buy only the latest mobile phones, it\u2019s important you try various marketing strategies like offering mobile phone deals to entice many more individuals to patronise your smart phone business. Mobile phone sales is one of the most popular and lucrative small business ideas not just in Nigeria, but in Africa as a whole. 7). Digital Advertising Agencies With hundreds of competing businesses cropping up in every sector, staying afloat as number one or in the top league can be a huge task. This is where advertising agencies come in. Advertising agencies practically help businesses grow by creating compelling campaigns, whether online or offline to not just increase the business\u2019s customer base, but to make their brand name have a meaning to millions of people. Companies search for the most creative digital agency they can find, and when they do, they pay them a lot of money so they can help their brands grow right, and faster. If you\u2019re an experienced copywriter, partnering with a few other copywriters and a really good artist could get your creative agency running in a short time. What determines how you acquire clients and at what speed, are the quality and success of the campaigns you execute. If you can build a little app, game, or any creative campaign that goes viral, your client base would rise faster than you expect. An example of such companies that have successfully done this in Nigeria are Wild Fusion, and Anakle. Today, they\u2019re growing faster than many expected they would. 8). Real Estate The real estate industry is currently one of the largest world wide. With several real estate companies focusing on either residential real estate or commercial real estate, the wide span opportunities the industry poses only simply grows. While many real estate companies focus more on the offline sales channels, there are several others focusing on the online channels by setting up real estate websites offering thousands of properties for sale. The property search on these websites are in thousands, and the comfort they give a prospective customer buying a house makes it a lot easier. Examples of some successful online real estate companies in Nigeria are Private Property, ToLet, and Lamudi. No matter the channel real estate companies offer houses for sale or rent through, there\u2019s always a buyer lurking around to buy at a good price. As an individual, you could act as a real estate agent and collect a commission on every sale you bring to the real estate company. Successfully acquiring a lot of customers to purchase properties through you would make you gain some considerable income. It\u2019s important you stay up to date with daily real estate news, so you would always be aware of any policy changes or market vices attempting to shift the market. 9). Small Business Loans If you have a little extra cash to spare, you could start up a small business that focuses on just providing loan services to other small businesses that need them. Many small business owners hit gridlocks while trying to secure loans from banks and other financial institutions. These institutions set heavy loan requirements which are mostly difficult for small business owners to meet. As a professional money lender, you could provide short term loans with far lesser restrictions to multiple small businesses. Money lending is usually overlooked by many mostly because of the risk of a non-repayment, but is still one of the few modest small business ideas to venture into. 10). The Stock Market The stock market has both created and destroyed the fortunes of millions of people. But irrespective of the inherent risk, a well seasoned stock trader mostly makes good bets, and also knows the stock market is one of the most profitable small business ideas to venture into. Trading stocks can result in heavy losses for your investments if you don\u2019t have a clue of what\u2019s going on. Before you decide on what stocks to buy, it\u2019s important you study the company\u2019s short and long term progression, talk to your stockbroker, a financial expert, or even a friend that\u2019s been trading successfully in the stock market for a long time. Investing in stocks doesn\u2019t just make you a millionaire overnight. The equity market is not that nice. But stock trading pays experienced entrepreneurs that understand the market trends, and know how to accurately (or almost accurately) predict how a certain stock\u2019s price direction may go. ",

            "answer_text": "The businesses that make the most millionaires are businesses that alleviate pain, enhance pleasure or simplify life. To understand this concept let\u2019s look at Abraham Maslow\u2019s famous Pyramid of Needs:  Image Credit: SimplyPsychology.org[1] Basic Needs If you look around, there\u2019s a lot of human suffering all around us. People suffer pain through a myriad of issues like lack of food, water, shelter, safety, hunger, poor health, etc. As you can see from the diagram, the pyramid is wider at the bottom and grows narrower as you go to the top. This clearly shows that basic human needs have the highest demand. No one has ever been able to fulfill the huge demand for basic human needs. If you can position yourself in any sector within this segment of the pyramid and meet a human need or provide a service (e.g. food kiosk, shelter, medicine, etc.), then there\u2019re no limit to how much money you can make. Psychological Needs Psychological needs (sex, love, relationships, communication, etc.) are next in line up the pyramid of needs. This is why the pornography industry grows exponentially year after year. This explains why social media networks like Facebook, Twitter, WhatsApp and Instagram have made their founders billionaires. Self-Fulfillment Needs Self-fulfillment needs are the needs that come last after all the other human needs have been fulfilled. Success, wealth, career, ambition, status, personal development are some examples of self-fulfillment needs. Keep in mind that the demand for human needs declines as one climbs up the hierarchy of needs. As you can see, you can reach millionaire status far more faster if you set up a small business that satisfies the most basic human needs.

            "answer_text": "You know what\u2019s surprising? Most millionaires don\u2019t come from sexy industries. In fact, they come from some of the most boring industries you can think of. Why is that? Because those boring industries tend to deliver essential services that people need day in and day out. Here are a few industries that anyone can make a million dollars in. Financial servicesYes, those people on Wall Street earn a lot of money. Historically, finance has been an industry where people can make (and lose) fortunes in a relatively short time. It\u2019s also possible to do it without being in the top 1% of your field or owning your own firm. If you\u2019re in the top percentiles then you\u2019re looking at tens of millions of dollars or more.  ManufacturingA few hundred years ago, we made most of the things we used locally. Now, I couldn\u2019t make a shirt from scratch if my life depended on it. Most of what we have in our modern world is manufactured in factories. Those firms are raking in money. There are two ways this can go. You can manufacture for your own brand or you can manufacture to produce products for other brands. Whatever the case, there\u2019s money to be made. Real estateThis is an old staple of wealth creation. Not too long ago, the advice parents would tell their children was to make a bit of money and buy a house, it\u2019ll be the best investment you\u2019ll ever make. I can\u2019t say whether or not it\u2019ll be your best investment but income producing property is usually a good bet. It has also minted a lot of millionaires throughout history. EntertainmentNo matter when or where we are, people will always seek entertainment. In ancient Rome, they thirsted for blood in the Colosseum. Today, we\u2019re content with Kevin Hart and Robert Downey Junior on the silver screen. You don\u2019t have to be an actor to make millions from entertainment. There are many niches here like athletics, singing. dancing, event organization, etc.  ",

            "answer_text": "User-10082357234759790588 is right on about contractors. Of the people who started small businesses and became millionaires from virtually nothing that I\u2019ve met, I\u2019d say these are them: Contractors. It seems like a license to print money. Lots of cash flow (who knows if they \u201chide\u201d some money).Writers. This is a business. Some latch on to a major publisher and do quite well.Law practice. A one-person practice could be very profitable, if you network.Medical practice. Same idea.Real estate. A good Realtor gets the best properties and the commissions roll in.Publisher. Some people start a small magazine or newspaper, which can be surprisingly profitable in certain niches.Opening a dance school or exercise studio or similar. Again, lots of cash flow and some people get a loyal following.What doesn\u2019t make my list: Sales in general. Commission-based selling may result in some good weeks and bad weeks, but it never seems reliable enough to allow one to save a million bucks. There\u2019s also a high burnout rate. The few people who are mega-sellers usually get promoted to a management position.Building an Internet presence. The money just isn\u2019t there from ads or subscribers. And who knows what the business model will be a few years from now. Too unpredictable and unproven. Sure, there\u2019s the occasional Zuckerberg.Opening a single restaurant. I\u2019ve known some people who have done this and turned a great profit for awhile, but the lifestyle doesn\u2019t seem to allow for much savings. A lot of money goes back into the business. Plus, the business is so hard that one gets overwhelmed and starts to forget the little things; customers start to get bored and come less. One needs to open multiple locations and delegate to get to millionaire status.I may add more later. ",

If you truly want to be a millionaire, don\u2019t go out and buy one of these courses right off the bat. I\u2019ll tell you right now what you should do. Find what drives and excites you. I know a few millionaires, some make money in real estate while others own big ecommerce stores. The key to success that I see across the board: They get excited by what they do. As an example, one of my buddies runs a big digital marketing agency in SF. He is on track to hit $5mil in revenue in his second year. His profit margins are insane. The whole reason he started the agency was because writing excited him. Another one runs a dropshipping store. In his first year, he did $1.7mil in sales. Even though sales were good, he didn\u2019t really enjoy the business model. He then went on and started his own Amazon private label. This streamlined his business even more and now he makes even more. For me, I run one of the fastest growing startups called Sourcify. We make bringing a product to life or cutting manufacturing costs easy. I get excited by helping people source products. I\u2019ve helped hundreds of entrepreneurs manufacture everything from flip flops to bunk beds. Don\u2019t focus on making the most millions, focus on a business that excites you.  ^This guy needs to park better :) ",

            "answer_text": "Any business that helps other people grow their business exponentially. These include: Marketing AgenciesCoaching ProgramsFor marketing agencies, the core concept is simple: most business owners are old AF. They have one foot in the grave and the other is so mired in traditional business thinking that they neglect \u2014 willfully or not \u2014 the way businesses gain traction today: online marketing, under which I would include social media marketing (SMM), search engine marketing (SEM), search engine optimisation (SEO), and email marketing. That\u2019s where the savvy entrepreneur comes in: a simple email list or Facebook Ad campaign can be that simple wakeup call to help bring business owners back to reality, compounding their sales in the process. When you help businesses multiply their profits, that's when they'll be more than happy to share some of their profits with you. The best thing about this is that it doesn't really take much time or employees to serve up a social media marketing campaign or an email list. This means that you can have multiple businesses who trust you as their Golden Egg-Laying Goose, and who will gladly pay you a portion of what you helped them earn in the first place. Let\u2019s take a look at coaching programs. Again, it's simple: by positing yourself as an expert in a certain area (persuasion, marketing, investing or even niche areas like gardening or voice-overs, for example), you're going to have people who are interested in your area of expertise but who want to skip all the trial-and-error of creating a business in that area. They're looking for experts who can help them cut through all the bullshit, and who can give solid, real advice. Coaching programs can take the form of 1-on-1 coaching sessions, but, a more common and easily automated venture would be to create a membership site. The site serves not only as a place where you can store all your training videos and lectures, but as a townsquare where members of your community can mingle, interact and share experiences. Of course, they have to pay a monthly fee to get in and stay in. This is crucial for your money making efforts as it serves as a semi-automated method of producing income, all the while helping people along the way. In fact, most successful businesspeople incorporate these methods in some way. You're going to have to find out what works better for you, and make sure that what you do actually provides value to people, which is what actually makes people pay you. The money you earn is equivalent to the value you provide people. So, the businesses which make people millionaires are those that help as many people as they can, in the fastest time possible, and providing the greatest quality of help. ",

            "answer_text": "While it would still take good business sense and effort to keep your business afloat, the following businesses are currently popular and quite profitable due to its demand. These are also the types of industries that can produce millionaires, if the business is done right. Here are a variety of profitable small businesses across industries that you can start today.  Accounting Services With its consistent service demand and low overhead costs, the industry has become one of the fastest-growing industries over the last few years. With an 18.3% average net profit, the industry offers plenty of chances for gain and remains a good industry for business growth due to its demand. While it is a challenge to employ top-notch accountants, these kinds of professionals often demand higher rates thus also increasing an accounting firm\u2019s revenue. Legal Services Spanning multiple personal and professional areas, legal services are a necessary part of a business. With almost everyone needing legal services, the demand is constantly there. In addition, the service takes quite an amount of money, especially when hiring good and experienced lawyers or premium services. Services you can offer include: criminal law, business law, family law, trusts and estates, and employment law among many others. The possible downside of the business is the time and money needed to establish the business due to the amount of training and education required. Copywriting In recent years, the demand for web copy has risen increasing the need for skilled writing professionals. Mostly for marketing and advertising agencies, services include web content, blog posts, email marketing, and social media ads. Unlike the first two businesses, this is a cheaper business to launch because you would not need to invest in a commercial space as most copywriters can work at home. Personal Fitness Due to the industry\u2019s naturally low overhead, personal training businesses are a profitable and in-demand business. Due to the industry\u2019s high competition, a common problem faced by these kinds of business is building and maintaining its clients. Despite this, it is much easier to start a fitness centre because earning a qualification in personal training is not expensive and allows you to also offer physical therapy services. Dental Offices With a 14.1% average net profit margin, the dental industry offers plenty of opportunities for dental specialists. Dental procedures are often expensive thus generating higher revenues. A possible downside is that the business is not for everyone. You would need to have a bachelor\u2019s degree and a doctorate in dentistry. Equipment can also be expensive with the chairs costing an average of $3,000 (~\u00a32,258.01) or more. Graphics and Website Design We are in a time where visual content boosts a business\u2019 marketing and sales. Visual content is easier to digest for consumers thus most businesses use it to grab the consumers\u2019 attention. Graphics services include: logo design, banner design, brochures, infographics, and more. As for website design, the low expenses and high rates make. If you\u2019re thinking of creating your own web services, here are some tips to create your dream web team. IT Support As more and more businesses rely on IT to run or use the digital media to market, IT support services, such as web developers, will not be out of business.

            "answer_text": "Here\u2019s an uncomfortable truth - the businesses you think will make you a millionaire probably won\u2019t. In fact, most people who enter business won\u2019t get to a million in revenue let alone a million in net worth. Acting, singing, dancing, professional sports etc. have the lowest absolute number of millionaires. They\u2019re also uber selective and competitive. How many actors are really famous and by extension wealthy? Maybe a hundred or so. Tech likely won\u2019t make you a millionaire. It\u2019s possible but not likely.  Don\u2019t get me wrong; to make a million in any industry, you need to overcome a few challenges. The ones I mentioned are too sexy and tend to attract the wrong sort of people. The ones who want to get rich quick without putting in the effort. I digress. The sexier the business, the harder it is for you to make a million there. It comes with a lot of competition. The unsexy businesses tend to have A LOT of millionaires. Here you will find the companies which have been minting millionaires considering that the beginning period and will probably continue doing so: Finance. The people who manage your money and the money of other millionaires get paid a lot of cash to do so. Why? I\u2019ll never know.Real estate. Everyone needs a place to stay. That may be in budget homes or multimillion dollar mansions. Buy three homes and hold them for a decade, you should be a millionaire if the economy doesn\u2019t go south - again. Healthcare. Surgery, medicine, therapy, and everything concerned with keeping the body in peak physical condition will fetch you a pretty penny. The industry is by no means consolidated. There\u2019s plenty of room for you and the owners of private practices are often able to create incomes in the low seven figures.Energy. Fossil fuels have traditionally been difficult and expensive to extract. In our current political and social landscape, green energy is gaining prominence. Many governments have made larger organizations adhere to mandatory minimums when it comes to their renewable energy mix. This has proven to be a fast-track to wealth for huge numbers of entrepreneurs.Transportation/logistics. People have always needed and will always need to get from point A to point B. They\u2019re a hassle. You know what\u2019s better than transporting people? Transporting their goods. Last mile delivery has always been an issue and the people who\u2019re solving this problem are quietly making fortunes for themselves. The funny thing is, no one is talking about it. prepared to go your company to the next level, take our free email course to learn fundamentals as well as advanced strategies.

            "answer_text": "Any small business has the potential to turn anyone into a millionaire, if, and only if, one\u2019s finances (capital, profit, etc.) are managed well. I have also known and heard about too many people invest nearly all of their life savings on a business that they\u2019re hardly passionate about. Conducting a feasibility and market study is also crucial. You may think you have come up with the best product, or you\u2019ll solve a lot of people\u2019s problems with your service, but how can you entice people to buy your brand or avail of your service? Setting up a payment system in order to establish cash flow is one of the most important aspects to achieve success in managing a small business. Most entrepreneurs I know settle for accepting \u201cpre-orders,\u201d or asking customers to cough up 50% of the total cost of products, before proceeding to work on orders. Take into consideration how to go after customers/clients with delinquent accounts. And speaking from experience, I have come across a few times when some of the raw materials I use for my products become temporarily unavailable in the market. Prices of raw materials going up over time can be a legitimate concern, too. Cost cutting need not be done at the expense of compromising on quality. ",

You know how many people come up with ingenious ideas, only for their startup to enter the massive graveyard of failed businesses\u2026.. You can have the best idea in the world, but without the drive, passion, a little bit of luck and timing (which alone is not a recipe for success), it will never come to fruition. On the other hand, you can have a business that\u2019s neither innovative nor anything new, and become a millionaire by having street smarts, passion and other said skills. You can turn a cleaning business into a multi million dollar enterprise. It also comes down to your risk tolerance. And if you lack certain skills, hire giants. Surround yourself with people as smart if not smarter than you. Oh and if you google best small businesses to start, accounting firms consistently rank near the top (due to good profit margins and low overhead). But remember, no business nor industry (no matter how hot) guarantees success nor becoming a millionaire. ",

            "answer_text": "I would say online affiliate marketing makes a large number of millionaires and this is your most likely route through to making this type of money. You don\u2019t need any real skills to get started, or any money. All you need is a laptop and internet connection. You can work from anywhere you choose, when you choose so it opens up a much freer lifestyle for those who choose this route. Many others who start up other types of business find that in order to make a good income they have to work a huge number of hours and never see their families, or have the time to enjoy life. I have made this amount easily and I learnt how to do it initially by following the steps set out in a series of training videos which are pitched and helping people to make $200 per day in order to replace their income. The training videos can be downloaded here if you want to check them out: $200 a Day Blueprint Sales The videos were created by millionaire internet marketer Sarah Staar who sets out the blueprint for this level of earnings and beyond. She gives clear instructions and a process to follow and gives insights into the tips and tricks she uses in her own business. All the best ",

            "answer_text": "The best business to put up these days opting a franchise of a good company, they are best because once you take up your franchise, your franchisor won\u2019t simply wave you goodbye and let you run their brand into the ground without a word of advice. As well as training programmes and first-hand support, most franchisors help find and retain customers and assist with setting up accounting or stock control systems. Most importantly, your franchisor will offer financial help in getting the business off the ground. Many help with your initial start-up costs, such as equipment or vehicles, as well as organising marketing and advertising campaigns. The level of assistance varies according to the franchisor \u2013 some have 24-hour-a-day helplines, others have representatives on hand for quick visits to solve various problems. Either way, franchisees are not left to struggle alone. There are many reasons why they are best, some of them are there are many advantages to franchise of business one of the greatest being that it\u2019s possible to achieve a fast growth without making a large capital investment. Franchisees invest their own money and are keen to keep costs low and sales high. It\u2019s an excellent way to create new outlets for your products or services. Starting a franchise allows the franchisor (the company that\u2019s allowing their name to be used) to become more well known. More consumers come in contact with your products and the franchisee pays start-up costs and fees for the business. The aim of becoming a franchised company is to create more income for the company and these fees help increase the revenue and cash flow of the franchisor. Franchise business is on fire these days, my ideas for best franchise as looking forward to this period of time is the company, who is achieving success day by day because of their working ethics and responsibility of fulfilling there customers needs at time. The best franchise I would like you take is Phixman. One of the most intruiging firm in India.  They are best because :- Significant capital required.Large overhead.Borrowed capital utilized must be repaid.Large time & expense requirements.Management problems related to span of control, supervision demands, difficulty in hiring and maintaining competent managers.Phixman. The best company to rely on or spending your money on these days, Phixman is the Online Mobile Phone Repair Service Company. As we all know Smartphones has become part of lives.

            "answer_text": " Becoming a millionaire takes a hard work and persistence. Don\u2019t believe anyone who will tell you otherwise. Well, unless you win a lottery. Luckily for us, nowadays we have lots of jobs we can consider working if we want to become rich as soon as possible. Here are the business ideas I have in mind: 1.\tAffiliate Marketing If you haven\u2019t heard of affiliate marketing, then what are you doing with your life? I mean, probably every single one of you has come across affiliate marketers but did not recognize them as so. Let\u2019s clarify \u2013 Affiliate marketing is a type of performance-based marketing. In this field, the businesses reward one or more affiliates for each customer or visitor they have brought by the affiliate\u2019s own marketing efforts. What the definition says, is that basically you are paid by how many products you sell through that system. If things are not clear yet, let me tell you that all of the Youtubers you are watching are doing it. Why all of them have various links linked in their descriptions boxes that transfer to other websites? Because they are paid if you purchase something out of that sites. Well, this is an idea for you. You can do your research on good affiliate website such as Amazon, create an account and start spreading the words and convincing people to buy off of your suggestion. It can for sure make you millions.  2.\tPersonal Branding To be an influencer means to constantly work on your personal branding. Mark my words, the better you are at It, the more money you will ultimately have. Personal branding is nothing other than a practice of people marketing themselves and their careers. It may not sound logic, but who you and what you do can make you a fortune. So, focus on that, optimize your social media platforms, advertise yourself via the Internet and make the people hear about who you are and how good you are in what you do. Business offers are easier to come your way if you already have a name for yourself. Work on that and you will see magic happens.  3.\tProduct Developer Product developers are the ones who assist in the development of commercial or industrial products. As a product developer, you can go by any titles such as product development engineer, product design engineer, commercial designer, industrial designer etc. According to me, product development is a field which is yet to grow and you may want to be part of it. Money making is kind of guaranteed if you have a vision and you really are a pro.  4.\tE-commerce No wonder why the e-commerce is one of the most used types of marketing these days. Everything is digitalized so is the marketing. E-commerce is basically the act of selling or buying products or services online. It can be done through automated systems and according to me, it is for sure one of the most beneficial ways to sell or buy your products. Whatever your business is about, make it available online too. It\u2019s one of the best ways to grow your sales.  ",
