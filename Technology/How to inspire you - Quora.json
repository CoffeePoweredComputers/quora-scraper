All I can do is relate my story to you and show you how I came out better on the other side. Which ties in with the question here. \u201cHow can I inspire you?\u201d Just tell me your story and show me how you have become a better version of yourself than you were before. Show me how you learned from your experiences. Let me hear how your life has impacted the lives of others. None of this had to be big huge earth-shattering changes. Small changes are still inspiring. Sometimes more inspiring even. So be open, honest, and share the whole story. That is where inspiration rests. ",

            "answer_text": "First, understand the word inspiration derives from being in-spirit, or even simpler, from the heart.  To \"be inspiring,\" means that you surrender the external experience of your thinking, your ego, to the expression of your heart. When you are able to articulate that transition, from head to heart, thought to emotion, external to internal, limited to limitless experience, without even trying, you are now expressing your internal journey toward truth, love, and light (in light, enlightened), and you are now inspiring. Consciously choose to be in spirit, and by the nature of your existence, you are now inspiring. ",
