It can happen that, due to a glitch somewhere along the line, the number gets changed and the wrong phone gets alerted to a call, or gets a text,, but it\u2019s extremely rare. ",

            "answer_text": "I believe yes.. a phone is not identified by its phone number, but by the IMEI number assigned to it. There are therefore a number of translations and looking up tables of data,so either a human error or even machine error can happen. Every time a translation is done,there is a possibility of error. In addition there are tricks of cloning phones,so these could mean that multiple devices would get the information intended for one. ",
