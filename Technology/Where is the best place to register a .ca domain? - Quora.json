Becuase we waste a lot of time dealing with hosts that make everything as difficult as possible, we highly recommend using a top-rated commercial host like www.bluehost.com They allow you to add a key-word rich name for no extra cost that can be pointed to your .ca site. Bluehost actually answers the phone and walks you through any problems. We've had outstanding service for 6 years now for almost all our clients at www.kitsmedia.ca. ",
