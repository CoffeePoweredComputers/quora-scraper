            "answer_text": "I don\u2019t know if they secretly love other women. There have been statistics that have shown women find other women to be attractive. This includes straight women, who have only had partners of the opposite sex. I don\u2019t find that very surprising though given that women are already sexually exploited practically everywhere. We have stopped making such a fuss about it too and seemed to embrace it. No matter our body type. The day finally came when super skinny was no longer the only \u201csexy\u201d look on women. Actually, I think now the \u201csuper-skinny look\u201d is the more undesirable look. Which gives more women the confidence to show off their bodies. Personally, I think women are beautiful. I would much rather look at a woman\u2019s naked body than a man\u2019s. I think most women would agree with that. For the simple fact that we are more beautiful. I don\u2019t think it has anything to do with sexual desire or preference. I do however think the older women get the more they love themselves and their bodies and are willing to experience more things in life. When women go through life changes they begin to open up to more freedom with themselves. I also think there is a fantasy of being with whom you're attracted. Lot\u2019s of women appreciate the female body. For the way it looks, and the things it is capable of. Women are amazing creatures. Since the stigma of looking like a starving victoria secret model is out, and plus size women are now found very sexy. That has opened up a gate for more women to love and appreciate their own bodies, as well as other women. ",

            "answer_text": "Me, I am straighter than a stripper pole, but I can answer this. Straight women don\u2019t secretly like other women. We don\u2019t. If we say, something about how pretty another woman is, that still means nothing. The only women that secretly like other women are women ashamed of how they feel, maybe a closeted lesbian, or maybe this woman is bisexual. I have had friends of all different sexualities, sometimes they feel like they don\u2019t know who to tell, if they should tell anybody, some even think it is just their mind, and they can change the way they feel. It\u2019s different for every person. One thing is for sure though, if we say we are straight\u2026trust us. ",
