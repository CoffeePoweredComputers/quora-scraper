            "answer_text": "Marketing. I\u2019ve always considered computers to be dumber than a box of rocks. I formed that opinion back in the 1970s and see no reason to change it. They are called smart because they can react to input with programmed responses. Huh. Well. that\u2019s about as smart as a motor turning it\u2019s shaft because you turned it on. The computer is not smart at all. It cannot, on it\u2019s own, decide what an apt response is. It just responds to input as it was programmed regardless of the correctness of it\u2019s reply. See the 737 Max. That was a smart machine. ",

            "answer_text": "Calling a computer smart is just a marketing term used by business folks to sell stuff. Computers however are not smart at all. The people who engineered and programmed them are smart, and maybe those people put some sort of program in the computer that can assist other people with tasks (like communication via internet), but computers themselves are not smart. At least, not yet\u2026 ",
