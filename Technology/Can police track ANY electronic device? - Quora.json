            "answer_text": "Not any electronic device.They can track a device in the following ways: -a SIM card: any device using a SIM card sends out radio waves at specific intervals to the nearest cellphone tower to maintain reception,and this is used to triangulate the position of the card. This is the method usually used to track stolen phones. -net usage: say you lose your phone and the guy who robs it uses your gmail account as you enabled autologin. Then the cops can track down the location from which the account was used from the IP address that was used to login. Basically if they have your IP at any given time they know exactly where you are. And the cops just have to ask the ISP(internet service provider) for your identification. -a device like a laptop cannot be tracked. Unless you're a CIA agent and you have installed a homing beacon fitted into it,i highly doubt it can be tracked electronically,except using the method above, ie they obtain an IP addess. -every device cannot be tracked.So if you lose something like a 5 year old ipod or a mp4 player,there is no way you can track it.period. Thanx for the A2A. ",

            "answer_text": "The police in general directly cannot track any mobile device. However, with orders from the Court, the police in pursuit of stolen property like mobile phones, laptops or computes devices like Tabs etc can order the Mobile company and the Internet service providers to provide tower logs or server logs for the specific device number, or SIM number. So, it is possible for an investigating officer to trace out the device be it mobile or laptop.  However, let it be noted that unlike our IT savvy brethren elsewhere in industry, the police officers have not given adequate training in IT and related areas, so for them to understand what can be traced and how much information is sufficient to trace is a bit time consuming. Further, the mobile companies and ISPs also dont have adequate monitoring facilities always, since they are too bent on cost cutting, so staff response from them is a bit slow.  Things are rapidly improving however. Most murder or rioting cases etc are being investigated with aid of mobile phone position tracking from towers to locate the person's locus during and after/before the time of offence. So is the case with call data records to analyse who called the victim/accused and vice versa.  Contrary to popular belief, A laptop can be easily tracked using its Device ID received from the makers of the laptop. However practically this hardly happens because of reasons mentioned above. ",
