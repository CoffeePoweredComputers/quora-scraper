            "answer_text": "YES. DroneGun is the new king of anti-drone weapons. This large gun, right out of old action movies, can shoot down drones at a distance of up to 2 kilometers. Dronegun uses the principle that most other military systems use to combat drones: that of directed radio waves, knocking the flight of the device off course. Radio waves interrupt the signal from the control panel. As a consequence, the drone returns to the place of its dispatch or begins to decrease gently, when encountering such an obstacle. There are many similar systems but Dronegun looks cooler and it is much easier to use. It\u2019s very similar to a weapon from a computer game or action movie.  Full-scale defense systems have a radius of 8 km, but Dronegun is not for large-scale military use. It\u2019s portable, perfect for instant use on a threat that is close. The weapon has the style of a gun like that of a laser tag or ghostbusters weapon; the user can hide it in a backpack, and if necessary, pull it out quickly. The owner of the real estate who happens to see a drone, can get a DroneGun, aim it at the drone, release electromagnetic waves, and knock it out of the way. Moreover, DroneGun can jam the GPS signal as well, thereby causing the light device to drop and stop.

            "answer_text": "Are we talking about military drones (like Predator and Reaper) or consumer drones? Nearly all current consumer drones are under direct radio/wifi/etc control (which is to say, they frequently do on-board stabilization and pathkeeping, but their instructions come from the ground) and in my experience, the way they are linked up with their control system rarely even reaches the bluetooth pairing level of security. A favorite project is SkyJack - autonomous drone hacking which is designed specifically to deal with the AR Drone 2.0. Building on top of that (once you've taken control) is another project - Maldrone the First Backdoor for drones. SkyJack disrupts the drone's connection to ground control and then steps in when the drone searches for connection again, while Maldrone insures that you can retain control of the drone even after hardware resets. Now if we're talking about military drones, you'd think those would be super-hardened and unhackable... unless you know that there's no such thing. Wondering how to hack a military drone? It's all on Google - most of that appears to deal with exploiting weaknesses in GPS which almost certainly has wider applications than just drone hacking. ",

This is good news, because generally hacking is illegal, and if you're not a very good hacker, you're more likely to be caught - which is bad.  So, the fact that you don't have the required skills is a good thing, because no one wants you to become a criminal.  Congratulations! That was a lucky escape and I am glad things worked out for you!

Hackers can gain access to drones, cutting them off from the base station(or the operator). Following are some videos that demonstrate the vulnerabilities in certain consumer drones:   ",

The UAV is only a platform that other computer equipment could be used on, but it would be very ineffective for anything you might want to do as most all wireless 'hacking' could be done much better on the ground and a UAV does not have the required battery life for anything worth while.   Combined with that it is very obvious and draws a lot of attention.    ",
