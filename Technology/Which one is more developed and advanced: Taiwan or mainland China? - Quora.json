            "answer_text": "Something you must understand, comparing Taiwan and China is a comparison of two different Chinese cultures under two different political systems, which are at diametric opposites. It comes down to more of a state-of-mind rather than whose skyscrapers are more plentiful. Allow me to provide a perspective; China \u2018s central government is by constitutional law run by the communist party. A multi-party system exists on a municipal or county level but the eight legal parties are part of a Socialist Democratic Consultancy which is overseen by the communist party. There is no corporate process for these entities which means there is literally no means to raise capital or increase funding to get on their own feet. The communist party is the state power and runs the Judiciary and Legislature and this means the ruling party can write law into effect that can target particular entities for crimes against the state. The role of the multiple party system under the Social Democratic Consultancy is to ensure wide spread political participation. In essence because the laws and policies of the land are not open to any democratic process the municipal political entities are there to ensure socialist unity, and a single minded political belief system that tightly controls the memory, media as well as the money. The lack of many freedoms means there is little transparency throughout. To those that have grown up under such a system, the concepts and sentiments towards Taiwan and other communist party goals are uniform and continuous throughout the PRC. In the global market, China \u2018s government has developed its position as an economic and manufacturing powerhouse through the flood of foreign investments and partnerships and it now ranks third largest foreign direct investment recipient behind the US and UK. By percentage, Taiwan ranks number 3 largest investing country behind HK, and Singapore and equal in direct investment funds to the United States, South Korea and Japan. Taiwan\u2019s political system is messy and vibrant, with direct elections for every office other than those ministries whose Ministers are appointed by the executive administration. The Judiciary is separate from the Legislature (run by the Premier) and the Executive Branch (run by the President) In my opinion, while Taiwan may be unwillingly influenced by the PRC, its democracy is of a less oligarchic nature than Japan or S. Korea and is more representative of its voters. This type of political freedom is reflected in its citizens, who are unafraid to voice opinions, criticize the government, and enjoy, freedoms far out-reaching those of China\u2019s citizens, such as freedom of the press, freedom to assembly, religion, free speech, rights to redress the government and directly elect the president. On Taiwan, there are political problems and crime, but demonstrations while full of emotion are not capitalized into violent crackdowns by Taiwan\u2019s police who are in general, patient, and disciplined. There is a standing understanding of non-escalation and the avoidance of chemical deterrents. China has a set of different serious political problems with internal issues being resolved by force rather than forum, and while the police force is also disciplined in China, the ground level local police officer is not as entitled but the the level of sophistication at the highest level for specialized tactics teams is quite erqual. The main cross straits issue on Taiwan is the dominance over Taiwan\u2019s international presence which is all but totally censored by China, who sees its position as the owners of Taiwan\u2019s future, by force or otherwise. Most travelers and business entities see Taiwan as its own national entity with proper political processes containing Taiwan\u2019s territorial lands. However. due to China\u2019s seat on the UN Security Council, Taiwan does not have a role in the UN and predominantly through use of economic enticements and political pressure from China there are only 17 countries and the Holy See that still have full diplomatic relations with Taiwan. The truth is if you stripped away all the pressure from China, there would be no issue. No one agrees with military force and no one thinks that Taiwan\u2019s democracy is inferior to China Communist rule. The Chinese communist party has taken China from post war poverty to its current level of economic prosperity which is a great source of national pride. The facts show that China has not fairly distributed its wealth, falling still behind Japan, Taiwan, Korea, Singapore by per capita of China which is at 16500 USD compared to Taiwan\u2019s 49,500 USD adjusted in 2017. For countries in Asia ranked by GDP by per Capita Taiwan is 8th behind the UAE, Bahrain, Hong Kong and Saudi Arabia and China is 24th just under Iraq, Azerbaijan, Turkmenistan and Thailand. Asian countries by GDP (PPP) per capita in 2017 This is a list of the top 31 Asian countries by GDP per capita based on purchasing power parity. All figures are given in international dollars and are the latest estimates from The World Factbook of the Central Intelligence Agency.  As far as which country is more developed and more advanced there are further aspects to consider. Taiwan is democratic and enjoys a higher standard of living, more freedom and yet in its passivity, there is a yearning for Taiwan to be granted more leeway, in having less coercive threat from the mainland and to share in commercial profits to be had from funds pouring into China. China is developing faster than any other country in the world and comfortable living available to a wide range of means, from modest to extravagant, but most folks I know would rather live in Taiwan due to its more progressive thinking and its contemporary mentality. If China can maintain its poise, strengthen its open-mindedness, and enrich its partnership with the world with a mutually beneficial sense of character, it will advance as fast as it is developing. If Taiwan is able to develop to its fullest potential it will be as developed as it is advanced. While Taiwan is more hygienic than China, both places need to pursue more aggressive sophistication with pollution control and care for the environment. On one hand Taiwan enjoys a higher level of developed society in general, but China is more advanced in many areas of heavy industry. Taiwan and China for all their differences are neither superior or inferior economically or in technology to each other with everything taken into consideration but on Taiwan the people seem to be somewhat at an advantage over the citizens of China. The real difference is found comparing the differences between approaches and effects of a communist system and a democracy. Comparing the might of China\u2019s military, nuclear bombs, number of cities with skyscrapers, the number of people, the total amount of money to Taiwan\u2019s smaller stature would put China's government as the stronger hand, but when it comes to people and way of life, it appears Taiwan has the upper hand.

            "answer_text": "Taiwan (an Island nation off the coast of China) has a more advanced society and even spread of wealth than China. It is democratic and its citizens are allowed to decide their own futures. China is more advanced in weaponry, state control of almost everything (fascism) and hi-tech surveillance and spy materials. The worry about this level of control is that it can be, and is, used to target anybody that the Chinese government disapproves of and not just ordinary criminals. The opaque and politically controlled legal system means that almost anybody can be declared a criminal without any fair chance of defence or redress. China appears to be building a dystopian society like that of Orwell\u2019s novel, \u201c1984\u201d and aiming for world domination under Xi Jinping. I deplored the comparison of President Xi with Winnie the Pooh. Winnie the Pooh would have every right to feel offended by it. ",
