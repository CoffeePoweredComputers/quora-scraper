            "answer_text": "It may be a better course to encourage your ten year old to play at being a robot. First, because he is \u201cacting\u201d which is an important knowledge skill. Second, because this specific role is the methodology through which he is filtering his knowledge and experience. Third, some children filter their experience through other role models, such as pretending to be a kitten or a dog, or a duck. When I saw this in my children and grandchildren, I began playing to be just another robot. (This has been a recorded message. I am only a robot. If you wish to speak to a person, press 1.

            "answer_text": "Well your child obviously sees robots as being powerful, magical and probably more than a mere \u2018human\u2019. What he is not seeing are the things humans have that robots do not. Humans can love, they care. Robots do not. This is not a trait any child would want to surrender. Even the meanest and most violent murderer loves their mother, they will never surrender this. A child being innocent generally and just trying things out. Well he is not aware of the nature of what a robots is, that it is not aware of itself or others. But when you show him them falling over on youtube and trying walk while face down. How \u2018unintelligent\u2019 they are. And how little compassion a machine has\u2026 less than none. And of course when they are dead\u2026 when they break irreparably\u2026 well they are thrown into a skip and sent to the breakers yard! The question. \u201cSo you are a robot, that means you don\u2019t love mommy? Robots cannot love!\u201d At that point I believe his mind might change for he will never depart from his biology for fantasy. Even so though unless its becoming a danger to him, or you, then this fantasy like invisible friends is not a major issue. He will grow out of it. This is my take from one mother to another anyway.
