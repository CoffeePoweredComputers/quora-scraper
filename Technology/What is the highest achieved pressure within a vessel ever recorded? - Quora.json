See Ref: \u201cRecord high pressure squeezes secrets out of osmium: X-ray experiments reveal peculiar behaviour of the most incompressible metal on Earth\u201d Note that his is the pressure in a specially deigned press, not strictly contained by a pressure vessel. For a pressure vessel to restrain such a pressure, the material stress itself would have to resist the pressure and materials that strong are not known. ",
