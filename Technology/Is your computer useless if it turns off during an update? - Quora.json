            "answer_text": "Doing a Windows Update and shutting the PC off during such will not ruin the OS. I\u2019ve had scenarios in Windows Server 2008 R2 where the update wouldn\u2019t complete where manual poweroff was required. The OS will restart itself after verifying the volume OS is clean or scanned. On Windows 10, I\u2019ve shutdown the PC in the middle of updates. Your computer will load just fine afterwards. You\u2019ll sometimes have the OS just continue the update after the manual shutdown or if it was unexpected. You wouldn\u2019t have any issues with your PC running the installed OS. On Linux OS like Lubuntu, the process is similar. Your machine would use fsck  if there was an unexpected shutdown, then check if the Volume OS is clean, then load as expected. You shouldn\u2019t worry, and you can always repair any OS by using the installation media repair option which most OS include just in case worst case scenario. The only time your PC is most likely \u201cbricked\u201d is if you FLASH YOUR BIOS and have a power shutdown during the upgrade. You would need to replace the CMOS Chip or use a USB/FLOPPY to revert to a prior BIOS in that case, which isn\u2019t always available. ",

            "answer_text": "Both those situations are the computer equivalent of Russian Roulette. You might get away with it, but just as likely you won\u2019t. I got sick of dealing with the consequences of power outages, and bought a small UPS (uninterruptible power supply), which keeps my machine going long enough to do a clean shutdown. This UPS only cost about $50, and has saved many times that amount in protecting my work and the hardware components of my PC. ",
