            "answer_text": "It was cell phone which are nowadays called \u201cfeature phones\u201d. Actually I think the former feature phones like my Nokia 5110 were better built, better looking and more functional than todays versions. I don\u2019t understand why, you would think that they would evolve whereas smart phones but they don\u2019t seem to do so. Nokia had 40% market share at its peak and the 5110 was probably the most popular phone among teens around millennium. Anyways, I got it in 1999 as a present when I was away from home for the first time for a longer period of time. I couldn\u2019t do much else with it than call and write text messages but at that time nobody expected more from a phone, not alone a kid. Though it had simple games like Snake and I could change the front cover. It was also popular to buy ringtones, either beeping instrumentals or real hit songs, as well as simple graphics to the screen. The battery lasted for days. Later on there was a thing called WAP (Wireless Application Protocol), an early version of mobile internet, but it probably didn\u2019t work on my first phone. When I eventually tried it, the connection was slow and screen too small for any real browsing. Those things didn\u2019t really change until the touch screens, first iPhone in 2007 and first Android phone in 2008. ",
