Because the blue surgical masks were designed to stop doctors from sneezing into a patient they have open on an operating table. Or the common cotton masks with graphics and logos, etc on them\u2026 like the \u201cSham-Wow\u201d TV commercial for their sham-wow washable masks they accurately claim \u201care 100% effective at stopping mold and bacteria and allergy causing pollens,\u201d But DO NOT claim they stop a single virus particle IE: SARS -CoV-2 Nothing but N95 or better stops covid.

The earth is flatBirds don't exist.Birds are all Robots.Birds are all spying on us for the government.Pepsi is controlled by Ents (yes tree people like in lord of the rings) with flying saucers.The moon isn't real.Australia doesn't exist.Band-Aids steal your DNA and send it to China.Obama covered up all the deaths from Covid-18.Microwaves remove all the nutrients from food and replace them with cancer.Cancer isn't real.Mark Zuckerberg is a lizard person. (Almost believable).If people can believe these ones they can certainly believe masks don't work. Also a lot of the masks in certain areas are required by law to state that they do not provide protection against microbial agents like viruses or bacteria. ",
