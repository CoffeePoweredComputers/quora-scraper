            "answer_text": "Like any other device it would depend on what you are doing with it. At idle, no it does not utilize any measurable bandwidth. These devices typically run a X number of second local audio buffer that only transmits to the internet when a hot word is detected in the buffer. During the period where a query is transmitted and a response is being received, there may be a small impact on bandwidth, but it should not be noticeable in most cases. If you are using an Alexa device to stream video, play music, video chat, etc., then yes, it will use some amount of bandwidth that could be seen as slowing an Internet connection. Your ability to notice the slowdown may depend on the amount of bandwidth available to you through your Internet Service Provider and the other activity that may be taking place on your network, but it would certainly be measurable using network monitoring software if you really wanted to observe an Alexa devices impact on network speeds. The short version is, for most people the impact of introducing an Alexa device to their network should be pretty marginal. It is little different than using Siri or Google Assistant on your phone.

            "answer_text": "When all the talk about assistant apps listening and/or storing your conversations I decided to trace the data to and from my Alexa's. I have an Echo, Amazon Tap and a Fire Tablet. The data exchange when idle wouldn't have slowed me down if I had a 300 baud network. It's certainly possible to use Alexa so it uses as much of your network as possible but it will still play fair with other network resources. If you use Alexa to listen to prime music or watch prime videos you'll use some bandwidth. The same is true if you spend time watching your video door bell or kids sleeping. So Alexa isn't going to slow your Internet connection but every device or skill will have it's own impact. BillP ",

            "answer_text": "It would a little but then it depends on how long you are using it. Alexa works on the simple principle of audio streaming and if you are familiar with the mp3 streaming apps like ITune, Amazon Music, etc, then it takes similar or even less bandwidth. Alexa awakes at the word \u201calexa\u201d or equivalent word you had configured in your Alexa companion app. Device uses technology called \u201cWake Word Recognition\u201d which process rest of what you say after the \u201cwake word\u201d alexa. The device then streams the content to Amazon server which then translates to English text using Speech to Text recognition, natural language processing and artificial intelligence. Since major part of this happening in their server the internet usage during the period is negligible. Content is then analyzed and the response is then sent to Alexa device which again takes or consumes your internet. This is precisely why I said that it would be using bandwidth similar to your music stream device or application. ",
