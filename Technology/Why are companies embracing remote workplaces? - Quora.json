            "answer_text": "It\u2019s expensive for employers to provide an office. If they can get the same financial performance out of a bunch of remote workers, that\u2019s what they want. In my industry, outside salesmen have worked from home for decades. There typically is a shared office for all of them to use. It\u2019s a problem if they all show up at work at once. The biggest issue I see is training. Currently, I don\u2019t think a lot of firms are recruiting because of the economic situation and just the general difficulty of bringing people in. I\u2019m not sure how easy it will be to bring new hires up to speed without a traditional workspace. ",
