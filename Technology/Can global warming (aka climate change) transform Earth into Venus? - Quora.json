            "answer_text": "RE: Can global warming (aka climate change) transform Earth into Venus? Can global warming (aka climate change) transform Earth into Venus? Like Venus? No. Let\u2019s stick with a worst case like one which has already happened on earth. About 250 million years ago there was a flood basalt eruption in what is now Siberia. See Siberian Traps - Wikipedia. Not only did CO2 come up with that magma, but a part of that magma came up through a huge coal bed and so altogether dumping a zillion tons of CO2 into the atmosphere. That caused massive Global Warming, including warming of the oceans. Once the oceans got warm enough the methyl hydrate on the ocean bottoms broke down releasing massive amounts of methane into the oceans, almost killing the oceans, and methane went into the air too. Methane is an even worse greenhouse gas than CO2, so the temperature rose even more. See: Clathrate gun hypothesis - Wikipedia (A weird name, I know.) This was Global Warming on steroids. It killed off almost all of the species in the oceans and a vast majority of land species. This whole episode in Earth\u2019s history is known as the Permian Extinction. It is also known as \u201cThe Great Dying\u201d. So, if you want to know how bad Global Warming could get (because it already has at least once before on this planet) then read this and watch the video: Permian\u2013Triassic extinction event - Wikipedia Catastrophe - Episode 3 - Planet of Fire ",

            "answer_text": "Short answer: No way. The worst case scenario is Global Cooling and a new ice age. In the context of earth\u2019s history, global temperatures have been remarkably stable for the last 10,000 years, coinciding with the period of human civilization. In fact, temps were actually slightly higher than today up until 4,000 years ago. There has been a gradual cooling trend since that time. Maybe the Industrial Revolution & anthropogenic global warming postponed the next ice age? In any event the proportion of non-CO2 gases in the atmosphere has decreased from 99.97% to 99.96% over a century or so. Not the perspective you emphasize if you're trying to worry people. ",

            "answer_text": "SSince CO2 was at several thousand ppm a few million year ago and is way less now, I don\u2019t see why we can\u2019t go back up to those levels and fry a few chillibabies in the process and then get back down again to 180 ppm of CO2 with massive glaciers over Texas, do you? For planets envious of Venus\u2019s copious warmth, it should be pointed out that Venus is closer to the Sun than all but one other planet. Mercury, that is. Unlike Venus\u2019s atmosphere, whose mass is almost 100 times that of Earth\u2019s, Mercury\u2019s atmosphere has been blasted into outer space by its proximity to the Sun. So I wouldn\u2019t worry too much about Earth\u2019s surface temperature ever reaching that of Venus. We have the carbon, we just don\u2019t have Venus\u2019s proximity to the Sun. We (or our grandkids) have a lot else to worry about on our/their plate by 2100. ",

            "answer_text": "No. See Jeff Barry's answer to Can global warming (aka climate change) transform Earth into Venus? for the worst-case scenario. There isn\u2019t enough carbon on the Earth to get the temperature so high that we would become like Venus; at least that\u2019s my understanding of things. The Sun has been getting gradually warmer (very gradually) since it formed, which is why the early Earth could get away with much higher CO2 levels than today. But the Sun would have to get a lot warmer for the oceans to evaporate, which is the precursor to a Venus-like runaway greenhouse. That\u2019s not projected to happen for another billion years or so, even if all the stored carbon on Earth were in the atmosphere. ",

It is hopefully a small possibility, but we know very little about the potential feedback loops that could release additional greenhouse gasses if it gets hotter, which then cause it to get even hotter, which then causes the release of more greenhouse gasses, which then\u2026 Hopefully such things are self-limiting at Earth's distance from the Sun - but shit happens.
