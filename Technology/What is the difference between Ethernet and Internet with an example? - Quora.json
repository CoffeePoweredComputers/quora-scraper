            "answer_text": "The two are not comparable. Ethernet is a physical wired connection that interconnects most local computer networks (wireless is the other). This is known as the physical (layers 1 and 2) level of networking. Outside of local computer networks you will have a varied combination of cable, DSL (phone lines), ethernet, microwave, , satellite, etc. that will connect local networks to the Internet via upper layers of networking protocol (TCP/IP). The Internet is a world wide communication conglomerate whose signals (packets) travel over many different types of physical layers, ethernet being one of them. ",

The Internet is a federation of networks that operate to the standard protocols k s defined by the IETF. There is no requirement that individual computers use any particular wire protocol. It is not possible to give an example of the Internet. ",
