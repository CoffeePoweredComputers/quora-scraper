            "answer_text": "Youtelecom is a company that provides broadband services. Now that it is very easy to get duped by the number of lucrative plans that the company provides, the worst comes after a customer buys it. The unlimited plans are a bit expensive as of in the current market, but the limited GB plans are like the hot cake of their dish. For a very limited money they provide high number of GBs ( example Rs. 4200 for 900 GBs at a speed of 15 MBPS) . My actual experience came in after I personally bought the same plan mentioned above. They also gave me 3 months additional free on the yearly pack and 225 GBs too. It was clearly mentioned the installation would be done in less than 5 working days but even after repeated complaints and calls to the executives of the company, the internet connection provided by them took more than 18 working days ( approx 22 days counting the weekend) . That was not finished, when the Internet worked great for 2 days and the problem started again with their internet going down for more than 6-8 hours a day due to technical issues, provided to me by sms. After again repeated complaints and asking for a refund, they mentioned that they put a duplicate battery for their server because of which the connection breaks down again and again. After this was resolved in a months time, the connection again started breaking due to usage of fibre + optical wires used instead of just fibre. This was the information got from one of the executives, who mentioned that this is how the company works and people who get tired could switch without a refund or stay with the internet the way it is. After multiple complaints and personal visits to the companys office, the technical guy accompanied personally to check and made it alright after 7 days of regular complaints. Now that the above issues were solved, the internet still goes down at 2-3 times a day or the speed becomes nill with showing 15 mbps speed on the http://speedtest.com. On the overall note I must say that the company has made such lucrative plans only to lure customers to pay for the entire year and get stuck with the package forever and the overall benefit goes to the company only and the customer is in deep vain. I am attaching a couple of screenshots of the proof of messages that have been sent number of times in a day and so on. Please stay away from this fraud company and make sure to buy a legitimate plan from a good company even if you need to pay a little more money. ",
