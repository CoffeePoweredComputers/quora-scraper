            "answer_text": "It\u2019s heading to the cloud. Actually it\u2019s already there. There\u2019s a small percentage of organizations (roughly 10%) that have adopted cloud based VoIP solutions. Which means the other 90% of premise based users worldwide will be migrating their VoIP environments to the cloud over the next few decades. If you\u2019ve experienced any other Software as a Service offering, you already understand how useful it is. Having the ability to access that app regardless of where you\u2019re at. The same has happened with VoIP which is apart of Unified Communications as a Service (UCaaS). In addition to having VoIP, UCaaS provides access to more communication tools like chat, video, meetings and messaging. One of the biggest benefits is being relieved from maintenance, responsibility and support of premise equipment and PSTN connectivity. Just like most organizations don\u2019t manage their own dedicated email servers, the same will happen with VoIP systems. Pay close attention to this movement. I know I am and it\u2019s pretty exciting to see what changes are taking place. That\u2019s where VoIP is heading. ",
