            "answer_text": "Being in the renewable energy game may bias me a bit\u2026which I admit upfront. Reading all the other answers has been so interesting! I am honest enough to admit the failings of individual renewable energy sources, but I have always said that the solution lies in the right mix of these technologies, along with traditional forms of grid power. To save the planet we don't need to shut down all power plants, just reduce our dependency on them. I also think in years to come we will realise (hopefully) that a shift in human behaviour is required. We need to stop trying to make renewables fit in with a fundamentally broken system of consumerism. No technology has a long term answer if the system it serves is flawed. Nuclear may seem relatively clean and safe and a good way forward, but take the economic considerations out of the equation for a moment\u2026it certainly changes the picture doesn't it? I do realise that we cannot avoid the economic implications, as money truly does make the world go around, but if we realise that by changing our behaviour we can benefit more fully from renewables then perhaps we will begin start down the road to a clean future. Why not make night time electricity more expensive? Incentivise factories to scale up production in day time hours instead of running night shifts. I have seen so many creative business owners change their behaviour to suite the shiny new rooftop PV system they just installed. They are reaping the full reward right now and I cannot believe that we must accept a future of 100% nuclear or coal power dependency, just because we are to lazy to make the sun/wind/water work for us. Just my 2 cents. ",

            "answer_text": "Hello Kendal, This is an interesting debate that is unlike anything we have had in the past. Who would have thought humans could have an impact on the planet. The idea is only a few decades old; people can be forgiven for questioning its validity as the idea is so outside of our normal frame of reference. Yet, here we are. There seems to be three camps: The solar and wind is the most popular. It\u2019s a good argument about the democratization of energy. We all need independent homes that provide reliable low cost electricity from self generated power - maybe even an electric car in the driveway. We could call this the new American dream.The nuclear folks have this crazy idea that the most dangerous and expensive form of electricity known to man could somehow be mainstream. This is the exact opposite of the independence we strive for. After all, nuclear demands a strong central government and centralized power system.We can rule out carbon generators such as coal and gas as they are not renewable. Also, the carbon emissions are undesirable and probably the reason you asked the question in the first place.Which form of renewable energy do you think is most viable and cost-effective for the future, and why? Many people are asking this question. Many communities have even taken proactive measures to do something about global warming. As with any endeavor, we see some ideas work, some ideas fail, and some people get very rich in the process. A few years ago, I would have fallen squarely in the solar and wind camp. Solar and wind were being installed quickly, especially in the areas with the most sun and wind. That was then\u2026 Today, solar and wind continues to be installed at a fast rate, but there are signs of trouble in the places with the most renewables. For instance, solar and wind have failed to reduce the carbon emissions as promised in places like Germany.[1] Things don\u2019t look too promising for California.[2]  Source: California plans to reduce greenhouse gas emissions 40% by 2030 The emerging economics of solar and wind are not pretty. As more solar and wind are installed, we are seeing negative energy prices. No kidding! In places like California and Germany the have been multiple times when they actually paid their neighbors to take the electricity. See for yourself, on those days where the popular press is celebrating the high levels of wind and solar, the plant operators are cursing as they are not making any money. Actually, everybody is losing money on those days. While you are searching, you may want to research the term curtailment. There is more to the money. I\u2019m sure you have heard that powerful fossil fuel interests are blocking poor solar and wind. If only we had a level playing field solar and wind would take care of themselves. This seems highly unlikely. Consider this, if I were a executive for coal of gas I would back solar and wind with as much enthusiasm and money as I could. Because I know that storage is unbelievably expensive - so expensive that it is almost nonexistent. By backing wind and solar, I have a sure market for decades to come. There is a fascinating article in Forbes that describes this situation. The opening picture says it all: https://www.forbes.com/sites/michaelshellenberger/2018/05/15/solar-and-wind-lock-in-fossil-fuels-that-makes-saving-the-climate-harder-slower-more-expensive/#46c94dd621d4  Which form of renewable energy do you think is most viable and cost-effective for the future, and why? What is the objective of renewable energy? I would argue it is: low cost reliable energylow CO2 emissionsnational sovereignty (energy independence)high standard of living e.g. all live to old agea sustainable path that will outlast us and our children to the end of humanitySolar and Wind are not going to get us where we need to be. We are just starting to understand the limitation of this costly experiment. There is a growing number of environmentalists who recognize this problem and have come to realize nuclear is the way forward. You can see the names here Pro-nuclear movement - Wikipedia. On a personal note, I\u2019d like to share my story and explain how I came to the conclusion that nuclear is the solution: Aaron Dahlen's answer to Is nuclear energy the hope of the future?
