            "answer_text": "As a long time political observer, I can definitely say that Fox News has repeatedly aired fake news almost since its inception. Their reputation for being bearers of fake news goes all the way back to the 1990\u2019s. Fox's founder and one-time chief architect and CEO, Rupert Murdoch, was already well known for his tabloid style, right-leaning programming. When the James Bond movie \u201cGolden Eye\u201d was released in the mid 1990\u2019s, the majority of the public immediately began speculating that the lead villain in the movie, Elliot Carver, was based on Rupert Murdoch. That's just how notorious he already was for his style of fire-brand, get-you-emotionally-involved programming. I think he was one of the early media pioneers that understood the concept of \u201cdrama\u201d and how it could snowball ratings. \u201cIf you keep your viewers emotional about something, they will keep coming back for more and more\u2026\u201d As I would analyze the media throughout the decades, one common pattern seemed to emerge: CNN was eager to release as-yet-unverified stories that supported their left-leaning views, or disregard news that might possibly cast a more favorable light on Right-leaning politics. And Fox News was eager to either put a misleading, right-leaning spin on any news coming out, or they were willing to just outright fabricate the entire story if need be. It seems that this is still the pattern of fake news that is being practiced today by both parties. You have CNN almost totally ignoring (unwilling to broadcast) any public protest or social concerns coming from the Right, and you have Fox News \u201ctrending\u201d fictitious talking points and stories to get people mad at the Left. It's an interesting dynamic, and with the rise and over-saturation of Right-wing social platforms (bot accounts that essentially hype and perpetuate fictitious scandals and conspiracy theories) across almost every social media in existence today, you are now beginning to see a re-emergence of Right-leaning views in the overall public. It is now their \u201cturn\u201d to carry the trophy and steal the glory. Regardless of the ethical implications of running fake news, I think it is a fascinating social experiment in how easily humans can become duped into believe certain things (no matter how silly), and it definitely shows that people seek emotional involvement over scientific inquiry and due diligence. It's revealed how simple it is to control millions of humans at once and how you can harness them in to lock-step configuration to get them to march towards your own (possibly nefarious) goals for you. Frighteningly, it also reveals how simple it would be to turn a country against itself and ignite a civil war\u2026 and that's why I think it's imperative that we continue to improve our own investigative practices when confronted with every day news.
