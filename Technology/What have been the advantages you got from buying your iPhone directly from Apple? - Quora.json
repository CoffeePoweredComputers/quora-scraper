            "answer_text": "I purchased a completely unlocked iPhone for cash with Apple\u2019s return privileges if I didn\u2019t like it. Additionally, the unlocked version had a better modem chipset (Qualcomm, not Intel) that was better performing on GSM/LTE networks and worked on all networks. I didn\u2019t need to commit to a contract that also locked me to the carrier for 18\u201324 months with early termination fees. If I travel (even in the US) I want to be able to switch the SIM, if necessary, to a carrier that works in the area I\u2019ll be visiting (without exorbitant charges.) My carrier\u2014AT&T in the US\u2014refused to sell me an unlocked Phone even if i paid cash upfront. Plus the AT&T version of the iPhone used the inferior Intel chipset. Not selling unlocked phones continues to be an AT&T issue. My daughter went to the AT&T store during the CoVID lockdown in April-May 2020 and the iPhone she got was not only locked to AT&T but they would not allow her to pay cash for it. Had to lock herself into a 2 year payment contract. ",

            "answer_text": "In the context of Singapore, buying an iPhone directly from Apple will free me from the telcos\u2019 contracts. Most of the telcos in Singapore will tie you down with a contract when you buy an iPhone from them. Another advantage is that I can start to do my pre-order at the time which Apple launches their pre-order. Some telcos can be slow in the pre-order process. ",
