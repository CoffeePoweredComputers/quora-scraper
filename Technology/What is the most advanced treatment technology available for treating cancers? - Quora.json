            "answer_text": "Advanced Cancer cannot be cured but still can be treated and symptoms can be managed for quality of life which becomes the goal. However, sometimes advance treatment outweighs the benefits at which point all treatment is stopped and only symptoms are managed. Now, when it comes to cancer that hasn't aggressively metastasized there are many treatment options and they depend on the type of cancer and how advanced it is. Also, one might receive one treatment or a combination of these. Broadly cancer treatments are the following types- Primary treatment- It\u2019s goal is to completely remove/ sell all the cancer cells.Adjuvant treatment- The goal of adjuvant therapy is to kill any cancer cells that remain or may remain after going through the primary treatment to reduce it\u2019s chances of recurring. Neoadjuvant therapy is similar but its given before the primary treatment to make it more effective.Palliative treatment- The main goal of palliative treatment is to help relieve the sign and symptoms caused by the cancer itself or side effects of the treatment. This approach is usually taken as an end of life treatment where comfort of the patient becomes a priority.Treatment options that are presently available and actively being used are as follows\u2014 Surgery- It\u2019s one of the main treatment options for many types of cancers where the surgeon removes all or part of the cancer. Robotic surgeries are modern way of carrying out some complex surgeries as they provide flexibility, more control and small incisions.Chemotherapy- Chemotherapy uses drugs to treat cancers. It\u2019s mainly given intravenously or in some cases subcutaneously but could also be in form of tablets and capsules.Radiation Therapy- Also known as Radiotherapy, uses high energy rays such as X-rays to treat cancer by destroying cancerous cells. It can be either external beam radiotherapy or internal radiotherapy(brachytherapy) where a radioactive material is placed inside the body.Hormone therapy- Hormone therapy works by altering the production or activity of a hormones in the body as some cancers depend on hormones to grow.Immunotherapy- We know about what our immune system does- protecting our body from infections etc. Immunotherapies use the immune system to find and attack cancer cells.Targeted Therapy- It uses drugs to attack or \u201ctarget\u201d specific cancer cells. For example, a monoclonal antibody (a type of targeted therapy) may also block cancer cell growth which is why it can also be called a cancer growth inhibitor. Since some target therapies also work through the immune system, there is some overlap between these and immunotherapies.Stem Cell (Bone Marrow Transplant)- Bone marrow is found inside our bones and is where the stem calls are made. Stem cells stay inside the bone marrow as blood cells before going into the bloodstream when they are fully developed. SCT is used to treat conditions in which the bone marrow is damaged and is no longer able to produce healthy blood cells. It can also be used to replace blood cells that are destroyed as a result of intensive cancer treatments.",

Vaccine for breast and cervical cancersgene therapy in advance stageImmunotherapy (boost immunity of patients)Nanomedicine is harnessing the power of nanotechnology to improve drug delivery, pharmaceutical properties, imaging, and diagnosis, establishing the area of theranostics. In cancer therapeutics, this has been to improve the pharmacokinetics and reduce the systemic toxicities of chemotherapies through the selective targeting and delivery of these anticancer drugs to tumor tissues.Image-Guided Radiation Therapy (IMGT), which also employs linear accelerators. IMGT allows for even more precise radiation treatment because it uses technology that can recognize the size and shape of the tumor within the body.Tissue processing and high-throughput fluorimetry underpins novel tools like BH3 profiling to predict cellular response to chemotherapeutic agentsThe concept of sensitizing cancer cells to radiotherapy has been investigated for close to 50 years but new advances are seeing more effective small molecule (oxygen/oxygen mimics), macromolecule (miRNA, siRNA, peptide), and engineered nanomaterial-based radiosensitizers emerge.Future belongs to these advance technology which will improve the prognosis of cancer patients and we are moving towards the \u201cCURE\u201d.I am confident that in the future, we will be able to cure cancer.",
