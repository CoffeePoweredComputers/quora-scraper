            "answer_text": "They do not store electric power. They convert light energy into electrical energy. You need a battery to store the power. Some solar installations push the electrical power back to the power grid powering neighbors homes and businesses during the day reducing the load on the power companies generators and lowering the amount fuel they must consume. Then at night the power company will provide power to your home. If you have a battery storage system then the power you generate during the day is stored locally and at night you use the power you generated during the day. The only power you draw from the power company is the power you need in excess of what you generate. Sending power back to the power company causes problems for the power company. The problems get worse the more solar systems you have doing this. Electricity on the grid has no storage capacity you must provide exactly the right amount of power just as the power is consumed. If more is consumed than provided you have a brown out where the line voltage drops below the specification and if you are generating too much you have a voltage spike. Both are bad for the consumers and things connected to the grid. It takes time for power plants to increase power output and time to decrease power output. Sudden load changes cause problems. The output from solar panels can change abruptly. Imagine a big cloud drifting over a solar panel array. As the shadow covers the array the power generated abruptly drops and then just as abruptly comes back again as the cloud moves away. This is very hard to compensate for in a power plant. Early solar systems did not cause big problems because they were such small parts of the generation capacity. As the number of installations have grown the problem has become bigger. Storage is the solution. By storing the power the power company can plan for the load on the system much more reliably. Some power companies are installing their own load leveling batteries. This also helps them be more efficient. They can operate the generators at a steady power output where they are most efficient and let the batteries store the minor excess and supply any minor deficit. Storing your own power also is starting to make financial sense as well. When solar was new power companies had to abide by net metering rules meaning any solar generated power you pumped back took off 1 for 1 from how much you consumed. Then the power companies got smart or greedy depending on how you look at it and asked for solar systems to have to use a two meter system. They measured the power they sold you and charged you the regular retail rate for that power and then paid you the wholesale price for any power you pump back into their system. If you put in a battery storage system you eliminate the possibility of wholesale/retail because you only buy the power you need in excess of what you produce. Batteries are great and are the only practical way for a homeowner to store electricity generated by solar panels. There are some other systems that can store power however they are more suitable for industrial scale systems. They are hydropower storage by pumping water up to a reservoir and using it to run generators when it flows back down. Compressed air storage. A system where air is compressed into underground storage chambers and let back out to drive turbine generators. Storage in these systems is not as compact or quickly useable as batteries. Grid level batteries and home battery storage systems are dropping in price and performing better and better. One day they may be considered standard equipment on new homes. And essential for the well operated power grid. ",

            "answer_text": "Solar energy can be stored in a seperate battery but generally excess goes back into the grid. Solar electricity runs through your net meter, makes itself comfortable in your home, and powers your appliances. It works just like your traditional electricity does now\u2014you don't have to change a thing. It might seem counterintuitive to be on the traditional power grid when you have a solar energy system, but being on the power grid has its advantages. It allows you to use as much electricity as you need before sending any excess power back to your power company to use. Solar panels generate electricity when the sun is up, but we use electricity at night too, when we're not producing solar power. That\u2019s why it\u2019s important to stay connected to the power grid. ",
