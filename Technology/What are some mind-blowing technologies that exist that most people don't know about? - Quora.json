            "answer_text": "The future technologies that are in progress and will be touching our lives in near future. Some of the technologies are used for the research purpose e.g. ventablack, virtual animal Gesture Control Device:  This gesture control device is called Reemo. It is a device that can control nearly everything you want. Instead of searching for light switches, walking to a radio to turn it on or even making coffee, with Reemo you can just point to what you want and control it. You can even lock the doors or arm the security system from a far distance. Reemo can also help seniors to go through the frustration of solving everyday technical problems. Since Reemo uses gestures that are intuitive and natural, it is very simple to use and you will have no trouble with remembering the commands. The Active Denial System:  This directed-energy weapon is designed for area denial, crowd control and perimeter security. The Active Denial system was developed by the U.S. military and is not a lethal weapon. Since it\u2019s only function is to heat the surface of targets, such as the human skin, it is often called a heat ray. In 2010, the weapon was deployed in Afganistan as the U.S. army wanted to test it, but it was soon withdrawn without seeing any combat. Currently, the ADS is only a weapon mounted to the vehicle, but both the police and the U.S. Marines are working on portable versions. Nuclear batteries: Imagine a battery that won't run out of charge. Nuclear batteries can produce a large amount of energy and can work \"at least\" for 20 years. The batteries contains heavy metals that could give out radiation. Nuclear batteries use the incredible amount of energy released naturally by tiny bits of radio active material without any fission or fusion taking place inside the battery. These devices use thin radioactive films that pack in energy at densities thousands of times greater than those of lithium-ion batteries. Because of the high energy density, nuclear batteries are extremely small in size. They can be used as energy source for our mobile devices, tablets, Laptops, UPS, Cars, Vehicle  The algorithm that can detect whether a person is gay or straight: Technology today is accelerating so fast it's hard to comprehend. In the latest step towards a future that's looking more AI controlled every second, a study at Stanford University found that a computer algorithm could correctly guess whether a person is straight or gay highly accurately. This machine intelligence can tell whether a man is straight or gay correctly 81% of the time, and 74% of the time for women. It can't work as a perfect determinant of sexual orientation as a whole, but it has made it more apparent, in case it wasn't already, that a person's sexual orientation is not a choice but something you're born with. It also worked a lot more accurately than with human judges, who only achieved 61% for men and 54% for women.  strange :- Virtual Animals with Digital Minds: Whole brain emulations of human minds are quite a ways off, and likely won't appear until the second half of the 21st Century. But in the stage leading up to this we'll be able to emulate the brains of much simpler organisms. Already today there's the OpenWorm project, an effort to digitize the brain of a nematode worm. Within the next two decades, we will most certainly be able to simulate the brains of other organisms, like ants and bees. And who knows, by this point we might even be able to start simulate the brains of simple mammals, like mice. But by virtue of doing so, we will have created virtual animals who essentially \"live\" inside a computer. And someday, perhaps even by the 2030s, these digital brains will be uploaded to robotic avatars.  Darkest material till known: It\u2019s called Vantablack and it\u2019s the blackest possible substance on the planet earth that absorbs 99.96% of light. It\u2019s made of carbon nano tubes aligned vertically. The piece of aluminum foil shown here is creased, wrinkled, in a random fashion before being coated with Vantablack on one side. But as we can see the surface appears as either a completely flat black surface or simply a void. The almost total lack of light reflected from the Vantablack surface prevents the eye detecting any surface detail.  \u200b Sonic weapon  Sonic and ultrasonic weapons (USW) are weapons of various types that use sound to injure, incapacitate, or kill an opponent. Some sonic weapons are currently in limited use or in research and development by military and police forces. Some of these weapons have been described as sonic bullets, sonic grenades, sonic mines, or sonic cannons. Some make a focused beam of sound or ultrasound; some make an area field of sound. Extremely high-power sound waves can disrupt or destroy the eardrums of a target and cause severe pain or disorientation. This is usually sufficient to incapacitate a person. Less powerful sound waves can cause humans to experience nausea or discomfort. The use of these frequencies to incapacitate persons has occurred both in anti-citizen special operation and crowd control settings. Which is Successfully deployed in Canada during G20 summit in 2010. (Thanks J Stevens for sharing about Sonic weapon) I will be adding new technologies .. Please suggest me to add any new technology. I will be keen to add ",

            "answer_text": "1. 3-D printed organs 3-D printing is going to be an increasingly big deal in the future. It's already being used to print prosthetics, guns, machine parts and food. One of the most exciting developments, however, is \"bio-printing.\" This uses 3-D printing technology to create human tissue and organs. A company named Organovo recently printed a slice of human liver that survived 40 days. This is great news for medical researchers looking for human tissue to test drugs. Other teams have printed kidney and heart tissue. As the technology gets even better, we could see full-fledged organs printed using cells from a patient's own body. Some researchers predict we could have bio-printed hearts this decade. The need for transplant donors and worries about organ rejection would be over! 2. Real bionics Earlier, I mentioned 3-D printed prosthetics. Researchers have made big strides in the prosthetics field recently. On the cost front, 3-D printing is starting to bring down prosthetic prices to a reasonable level. On the high-end side, new neural connections and software advances are allowing amputees to control prosthetic limbs with their mind - just like a real limb! They can even get feedback on sensations like heat, cold and pressure. Advances in motors and pneumatic mean prosthetics are more responsive and have smoother motion. Remember how they rebuilt Luke Skywalker's hand in the second \"Star Wars\" movie? That's not too far off. It isn't just limbs. New prosthetic eye technology, for example, is giving sight to the blind. 3. Graphene Moving away from the medical field, have you heard about graphene? This is one of the new wonder materials that has scientists and researchers abuzz. Graphene is a version of graphite - yes, the stuff in pencil lead. However, graphene is only a single atom thick and comes in sheets. In that form, it has more uses that I have space to mention. It conducts electricity like a superconductor and it's incredibly strong for its weight. It could replace silicon in computer chips. Graphene chips will run up to one hundred times faster than silicon models, but use less electricity and take up less space. Because it's only a single atom thick, graphene is transparent, making it perfect for electronic components in touch screens and electronic displays. Thanks to its thermal conductivity, it could be used in transparent solar cells. Imagine every window of your house generating electricity. At the other end of the electricity chain, it could make light, flexible batteries far more powerful than anything today. Graphene's structure allows water vapor to pass through, but no other substances. That makes it perfect for creating alternative fuels and distilling alcohol. In the medical field, this property could be used to diagnose diseases and sequence DNA. I could go on about puncture-proof tires, wearable electronics and so much more, but I think you get the idea. So, keep an eye out for this wonder material in the coming years. 4. Wearable computers I'm sure you've heard about Google Glass. If you haven't, this is basically a smartphone built into a pair of glasses. The display shows up right in front of your eyes, and you control it with your voice. Google Glass isn't a home-run success just yet. Thanks to its built-in camera, it's already banned from many establishments. Some techies disdain it. Plus, it's expensive and still a bit bulky. But even sleeker products are on the way. A company called Innovega has its iOptik system. This uses special contact lenses that let your eye focus on near and far objects at the same time. A pair of glasses with small projectors sends HD images right to your eyes via the contacts. The end result is like high-quality screens floating in front of you everywhere you look. Of course, you will need to tie the glasses to a smartphone to run everything. Still, in coming years, as smartphones get even smaller, it could be built right into the glasses. Of course, many companies are jumping on the wearable computer bandwagon. Right now, they're mostly just elaborate sensors, but eventually they'll get more features. Heapsylon is making socks that record how you run and give you feedback to improve and prevent injury. Microsoft is working on a \"smart\" bra that senses a woman's emotions. Apple is rumored to be working on an iRing that works as a motion control for Apple TV, and Google is working on a ring that replaces your passwords. OK, so they aren't all winners. Still, you never know what game-changing products might come out of these early steps. 5. Space travel China's recent successful landing of an unmanned rover on the Moon was big news. And it's always a treat to get images and video from the International Space Station. However, the days of government space agencies dominating the spotlight are coming to an end. NASA is already using rockets from a private company called SpaceX to send supplies to the ISS. Richard Branson's Virgin Galactic is well on the way to full-fledged space tourism. Ad Astra Rocket Co. could be testing its VASIMR engine at the ISS in a few years. This highly-efficient, plasma-based engine could cut the flight time to Mars from nine months to three months. The U.K. is moving forward with funding for Reaction Engine's SABRE engine. This novel engine could allow for passenger planes that travel up to Mach 5. Imagine flying halfway around the world in just four hours! It could also allow space planes that take off like normal aircraft, fly into space, and then return to earth with no hassle. ",
