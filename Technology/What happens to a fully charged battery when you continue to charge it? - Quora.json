            "answer_text": "It depends on the battery chemistry. Apparently NiCd and NiMH cells produce gas inside the cell when overcharged. If the overcharge is at a low rate, the gas recombines without damaging the cell. With lead-acid batteries, overcharge starts to break the water in the electrolyte into oxygen and hydrogen. The hydrogen gas departs via the cell vents (I don\u2019t know where the oxygen ends up). If you do this often, you will need to add water to the cells periodically to keep the plates covered. Lithium ion cells, when overcharged, have the terminal voltage rise above the safe charging voltage. This can cause overheating and internal mechanical damage. Enough overcharge can make a LiIon cell catch fire. ",

            "answer_text": "If it is connected to a proper charger intended for that battery it will simply throttle back the current to a trickle and all will be well. However if it is an uncontrolled charger or one for a different battery it will turn the excess energy into heat. First it will bulge and eventually will explode or catch fire or both. ",
