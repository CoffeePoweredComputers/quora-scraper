            "answer_text": "Understand the function of The original Adapter and the Data cable. Adapter will push a certain amps of current to the mobile. This pushed current will travel to the battery using data cable. Now does datacable make difference ? Yes. The type of The conducter wire used in datacable. Its thickness and purity matters. original one have very little resistance and can transfer almost 90-95% Current to the cell phone battery. Rest 5 or 10% is lost in transmission. Now what happens with cheap 30 rs cable is that the material used is Copper but it is very thin and low quality copper. Hence it cannot transfer whole current which is Pushed by the adapter. Hence it may transfer only 50-60% current depending upon quality. It can be more or less also. The worst effect it can have is the heating of the Adapter. It cannot do any permanent damage to the adapter. Moreover it might result in slow charging. There is an App on playstore to measure the input current. It is know as Ampere you can use that app. Inorder to check the quality of the cable. Measure the output shown with the one mentioned on the Adapter. If adapter is 2 Amps. And you recieve 1.8 or 1.9 its fine. ",

            "answer_text": "A data cable has four wires running through it. Two of them with red and black insulation are the power wires that transmit power from the charger or battery to the device being connected to it on the micro USB 2.0 end. The remaining two wires with green and blue insulation are only used to transfer data from phone to mobile and vice versa. These two wires are in no way responsible for damaging a cell phone battery or the adapter unless you happen to short circuit the red and black wires with either adapter or cell phone connected. This short circuit is actually a rarity. ",
