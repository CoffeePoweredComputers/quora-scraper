            "answer_text": "I\u2019ve been in strategic planning in business for a long time and the change that has accelerated over the last few years is the length of time that counts as strategic. (When I started out, it wuld have been considered tactical rather than strategic.) The first business plans I produced were quite happily five year plans, with a realistic understanding that the first year was solid, the second less so, with the fifth perhaps more speculative. Until recently I was still very occasionally being asked for five year plans, but I always just turned down that work if they wouldn\u2019t accept a shorter time scale. More usually the time scale is three years, but over the last five years I have always seriously discussed the value of such a document with clients and potential clients. Most clients actually understand this but the driving force is still potential investors, whether private equity or venture capital, who seem to carry on using procedures that may have served them well but which seem rather questionable today. (And I know the paradox that many private equity companies, once in charge, change the strategy at the drop of a hat - I\u2019ve worked with enough to know that this week\u2019s strategy does \u2019t raise any eyebrows. With the transfer of Agile techniques from project management and software development into some areas of mainstream business - for a really excellent and short introduction and guide to this see Robert Morley\u2019s Agile in Business - A Guide for Business Leaders, - I have seen the best approach to be a rolling twelve month strategic plan, by which I mean one that is at worst updated every quarter, but preferably every month. This means that as events, regulations, product and service applicability, markets and political changes occur, the plan can be adjusted on a regular basis. At the same time this preserves the more strategic elements. As I said, this would have been tactical in my earlier days - but as I have developed these ideas I realise that it is the right way to go. Contrast that with my experience nearly twenty years ago taking over as CEO of a multi-national\u2019s company in India, where we had to produce a five year plan and a definitive budget for the following calendar year by 30th September, so by the end of the budget period it was some fifteen months out of date. It was treated as written in stone as well - so any opportunities that were not foreseen were the subject of such intense scrutiny it was hardly worth even raising them. (You can imagine the reaction of my Indian senior management to this, if you know anything about Indian business - where tactical is this week, and strategic the following week. I exaggerate for effect, but this was so refreshing and so impossible to reconcile with HQ\u2019s approach back in Pennsylvania, that I became quite baffled at times.) ",

            "answer_text": "As a CEO, one developing shift I see is that the entire workforce will increasingly need to be aware of the strategic planning process. The CEO will always retain final responsibility for leading strategic planning. But increasingly, knowledge workers must be aware of their company\u2019s strategic plan if you expect them to make good decisions. That includes the frontline. Sadly, it\u2019s currently estimated that 95% of employees don\u2019t know what their company\u2019s strategy is. The wouldn\u2019t be a problem if your whole company was just an assembly line. But this is the knowledge economy, where employee create value through capturing opportunities on their own and exercising their creativity. Strategic planning of the future must account for this. A few guidelines that I think are important for executives to remember: Let everyone know what the strategy is\u2014everyone. Even if you don\u2019t think it\u2019s immediately relevant to their job. The CEO should communicate strategy to the whole company, and reinforce it regularly.Break down the strategic plan to quarterly chunks. Annual planning is fine, but it should be supplemented with concrete 90-day strategic goals at the company, department, and team levels. This is what I call the game plan. It should include the whole team, and show them how they\u2019re a part of the overall strategic plan.Pinpoint examples of employees who are executing the strategy. Look for cases where an employee at any level has made a decision or delivered an outcome that aligns with the strategic plan. Champion that person and their work. Show the workforce that you value actually living the plan. It needs to be more than just a piece of paper.Bottom line: If strategic planning is confined to the C-suite, you\u2019re following an old paradigm that keeps employees in the dark and won\u2019t create breakthrough performance. Here is a guide I created to setting and sharing company strategy that might help too. ",

            "answer_text": "A strategic plan for medium sized and large companies serves as a sort of building block. It\u00b4s necessary to have done your homework at least once in producing a strategic plan. However, plans get out of date as soon as they are published. Usually people say that the best made plans are the ones that you can execute up to 50%, the other 50% consists of work where you need to change and adapt your business because of dynamic changes in the company\u2019s environment. For all company sizes, there is a movement working more towards a LEAN methodology in updating and communicating your plans with 1-2 pages max. because of changes in the environment. For medium size and large companies blue sky work that results in a strategic plan becomes less important since much of the information is based on lagging financial statistics. Instead, you need to have a good performance measurement system in the company and be able to evaluate external market information on a daily, monthly and yearly basis updating your organisation on a strategic, tactical and operational level. Some argue that it is important to use a Strategic Plan as a \u201crudder\u201d in the organisation. By all means if it works for that particular organisation. However, what is more important is to feed-forward your actions in the company considering external and internal information that you receive at any given time, or you become a business where you from a strategic point of view get outmanoeuvred by your competitors. For the future, for some organisations strategic planning is important, for others its not if management has done their homework and know what they are doing. Usually, strategy plans are then just documents that collect dust in a corner. Source: adapted from my own blog ",

            "answer_text": "The biggest change I expect to see in Strategic Planning is improved use of technology. My experience is that most strategic planning is still done with MS-Word, MS-Powerpoint and MS-Excel. Almost every other aspect of business has been or is being transformed by technology. Think, ERP, CRM, marketing automation, etc. It is ironic that Strategic Planning has thus far clung to the past so effectively. Some of the benefits I think will come from better use of technology are: improved collaboration,improved integration and alignment of corporate, division, departmental, etc. plans,more dynamic plans which are updated and maintained in real time, rather than static document which collect dust on the shelf and are updated annually or at best quarterly,more auditable plans where the connection between data, insight, decision, execution and feedback is maintained,increasing recognition of strategic planning as a discipline in its own right, rather than something already stretched executives are expected to do \u2018off the side of their desks\u2019 and which frequently degenerates into a budget setting exercise,more integrated application of big data and AI in extracting insights from data, testing the internal consistency of plans, and tracking performance against expectations.(Disclosure: I am the founder of StratNavApp.com, the online collaborative tool for business strategy development and execution.)

It is obviously lead by the brain storming top level management but almost every employee is a part of it. It is like chess where even the pawns hold a high value. There are certain aspects of strategic planning that I would like to highlight which defines the future of it. The mindset of the CEO or head of the organization should be employee oriented. It should not have a selfish trait just to think about self. A strategy only works if every member of that committee is awarded equal importance.Involvement of even the minute employee post is required for maintaining a better future for strategic management. They should understand the company from their own point of view and take actions that are necessary for betterment of it.Follow various case studies to form and execute a fabulous strategy. strategic management case study help to organize the ideas in a linear manner and classify the process of execution of it.",
