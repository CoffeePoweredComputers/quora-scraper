            "answer_text": "Bluetooth is a standard wire-replacement communications protocol primarily designed for low power consumption, with a short-range based on low-cost transceiver microchips in each device. What is the standard? A standard is a repeatable, harmonized, agreed, and documented way of doing something. How does it work? It uses short-wavelength UHF radio waves, from 2.402 GHz to 2.480 GHz. That means 2.4 billion (2,400,000,000) waves/second. Bluetooth divides transmitted data into packets and transmits each packet on one of 79 designated Bluetooth channels. It usually performs 1600 hops per second Because the devices use a radio (broadcast) communications system, they do not have to be in a visual line of sight of each other. Range: Most Bluetooth devices have a range of 10-15 meters. Wireless technology standards require both a hardware and software component. The hardware is required to be able to send the necessary signal via radio frequency, and the software determines what\u2019s sent over that signal and how it\u2019s interpreted. This means that to use Bluetooth, a device must have a tiny computer chip with a Bluetooth radio. When Bluetooth devices connect to each other (for example, your phone and your wireless speaker), it\u2019s known as a master-slave relationship. One of the devices is the master and the other devices are slaves. The master transmits information to the slave and the slave listens for information from the master. A master can have up to 7 slaves, which is why your computer can be connected via Bluetooth to multiple devices at the same time (for example, a wireless keyboard, mouse, printer, speaker, etc.). When devices are connected together via Bluetooth, it\u2019s called a \u201cpiconet\u201d. Information is passed between the master of a piconet and one of its slaves at any given time. An interesting fact is that the master-slave relationship can also switch. When you put your device in pairing mode It\u2019s becoming the master so that it can establish a connection and then becomes the slave. History The development of the \"short-link\" radio technology, later named Bluetooth, was initiated in 1989. The first consumer Bluetooth device was launched in 1999 and It was a hands-free mobile headset. LOGO Bluetooth is named after a tenth-century Viking king Harald Bluetooth Harald Bluetooth was king of Denmark in the late 900s. He managed to unite Denmark and part of Norway into a single kingdom. The Bluetooth logo is a merge of the runic alphabet (\u16bc, Hagall) and (\u16d2, Bjarkan), Harald's initials. Harald Bluetooth was king of Denmark in the late 900s. He managed to unite Denmark and part of Norway into a single kingdom. check this  ",

            "answer_text": "How It Works Bluetooth is the foundation for transformative wireless connectivity Bluetooth 101 A Bluetooth\u00ae device uses radio waves instead of wires or cables to connect to a phone or computer. A Bluetooth product, like a headset or watch, contains a tiny computer chip with a Bluetooth radio and software that makes it easy to connect. When two Bluetooth devices want to talk to each other, they need to pair. Communication between Bluetooth devices happens over short-range, ad hoc networks known as piconets. A piconet is a network of devices connected using Bluetooth technology. When a network is established, one device takes the role of the master while all the other devices act as slaves. Piconets are established dynamically and automatically as Bluetooth devices enter and leave radio proximity. If you want a more technical explanation, you can read the core specification or visit the Wikipedia page on Bluetooth for a deeper technical dive. Bluetooth allows high quality streaming One of the most popular applications for Bluetooth historically has been wireless audio\u2014headsets and hands-free connectivity in cars to wireless speakers and headphones that stream music from your phone or tablet. This uses a version of Bluetooth called BR/EDR (basic rate/enhanced data rate) that is optimized for sending a steady stream of high quality data (i.e. music) in a power efficient way. Learn more about BR/EDR Bluetooth allows creation of smaller sensors With the advent of Bluetooth with low energy functionality (Bluetooth Smart or BLE), developers are now able to create small sensors that run off tiny coin-cell batteries for months, and in some cases, years. Many of these Bluetooth sensors use so little energy that developers are starting to find ways to use scavenged energy, like solar and kinetic, to power them\u2014a potentially unlimited life from a power perspective. This allows you to find Bluetooth technology in billions of devices today, everything from phones to headsets to basketballs and socks\u2014the use cases are limited only by a developer\u2019s imagination. BR/EDR and Bluetooth with low energy are fundamentally different. Bluetooth with the low energy functionality is built on an entirely new development framework using Generic Attributes, or GATT. GATT is extremely flexible from a developer\u2019s perspective and can be used for just about any scenario. As a result, Bluetooth not only connects devices together in an ultra-power efficient way, but also directly connects devices to applications on your smartphone, PC or tablet. It\u2019s the low energy and GATT features which are at the heart of the current IoT boom. They are also at the heart of Bluetooth, making it the perfect fit for the IoT. Learn more about Bluetooth Low Energy Bluetooth opens doors to a new generation of \u201cconnectionless\u201d devices On 6 December 2016, Bluetooth took a massive leap forward to deliver advanced beacon and location-based capabilities in home, enterprise and industrial environments. Bluetooth 5 quadruples the range, doubles the speed, and boosts broadcast messaging capacity by 800%\u2014the key to enabling robust, reliable Internet of Things (IoT) connections that make full-home and building and outdoor use cases a reality.
