Most of the edge computational implementations that i\u2019d come across are from the security & surveillance industry, where the confidentiality of the data and the ability to make time-sensitive decisions are ranked as the top priorities. Coming from an A.I. startup that builds edge computing devices, here are some of the industrial use-cases that we\u2019ve worked on: Industrial AutomationTraffic ControlConsumer ProfilingRoboticsPest DetectionBiomed",

From an infrastructure perspective, companies, like Dell, have \u201cgateway\u201d servers that sit at the edge and process data in real-time. The really interesting companies are those that provide the software layer and piping to make that data actionable. Here I would recommend you look into players like: Foghornflowthings.io - Agile Intelligence for all your thingsNebbiolo TechnologiesThe space is still pretty new, so use cases are being fleshed out everyday \u2014 that's why it's so exciting!

            "answer_text": "Self-driving cars are a prototypical implementation of edge computing. The autonomous vehicles being tested by Waymo need to make split-second decisions by analyzing huge amounts of data very quickly (these cars generate 1GB of data per second) to avoid pedestrians, curbs, and other cars. Thus, they have to analyze all this data as close as possible to where it\u2019s collected to minimize latency. Industrial Internet of Things (IoT) is another implementation of edge computing. You can hook up your manufacturing machinery with sensors so they can communicate with each other to control process flow. A lot of the data will be analyzed either by these sensors themselves or a gateway device very close to the sensors.

            "answer_text": "Edge analytics pushes the communication capabilities, processing power, and the intelligence of the edge gateways directly into devices such as programmable automation controllers (PACs). In edge computing, tools and assets are physically connected to a control system that automates these assets using PAC. Further, these PACs that are enabled with edge computing capabilities to analyze whether the data from the assets should be passed to the cloud or should be stored locally. Edge analytics is basically a way to optimize cloud computing systems by conducting analytics and data processing at the edge, i.e. near the source of data. And, in most of the scenarios, the edge is where the actions are to be taken based on the analyzed data in order to enhance the performance; moving the analytics to the edge will eliminate the extra steps involved with moving and processing the data in the centralized system and thus reducing network pressure.
