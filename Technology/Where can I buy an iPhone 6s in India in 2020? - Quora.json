            "answer_text": " I won't suggest iPhone 6s in 2020 because of the new iPhone SE. iPhone 6s is now ancient. So let's see why we shouldn't invest in an old iPhone. Launch of the new iPhone SE:- Before the launch of iPhone SE, Apple discounted a lot of their old phones and once they were out of stock, they stopped their production. This was done in order to make space in the market for the SE.Aging of these models:- I may suggest you an iPhone 7 which is found at \u20b931,000 to someone. Don't buy iPhones older than that. There are still people who want to buy an iPhone 6 because they want an iPhone. But the real luxury of an iPhone or any other flagship device cannot be extracted from that old models. Latest iOS have ruined the performance of these phones and they are slower than all mid-range Androids. Even the battery life would be extremely poor.I would highly suggest you to go with some mid-range Androids or try to get the price of SE (2020) as low as possible during sales. Don't buy an iPhone if its put of your budget. Also, don't buy phones on EMI and I would cover it someday else. iPhones I recommend are as follows. All three phones of iPhone 11 Series. (11 for those who want something cheaper, 11 Pro for those who want something compact and 11 Pro Max is for those who want to get the big screen iPhone)iPhone SE (2020) and iPhone XR (SE for those who want best gaming and XR for those who want a modern-looking phone and longer battery life)iPhone XS and XS Max are discontinued but if you find it brand-new at about \u20b970k, you can buy it instead of an iPhone 11. Both XS and XS Max have OLED Screens. iPhone XS is good for those who want a small phone. But XS and XS Max have A12 Bionic which is not as powerful as A13. But A12 has no problems even with heavy gaming.iPhone 7 is available at \u20b931,000 which is a good deal but try to apply as many offers you can. If you can get it down to \u20b925 thousand, it would be the best.Ignore the following phones even if you are an Apple Fan. Now many may feel bad because they might be using an iPhone from this list. But everything has its age and these phones are now old. If you own any of these, it's totally upon you if you want to upgrade or not. But don't buy these devices now. All iPhones before iPhone 7 (Seriously, they are dated)Ignore iPhone 8 because the iPhone SE is found at the same price.Ignore iPhone 7 Plus and get the iPhone SE instead. Also ignore iPhone 8 Plus and get an iPhone XR instead.Thanks for staying till the end. Be sure to upvote. Also tell me what I should write about in my next post. Goodbye for now. ",

            "answer_text": "No, buy SE instead. Battery backup of iPhone 6s is very pathetic. Getting around 2\u20133 hours of screen on time while browsing and using Instagram. On playing games battery drains a lot faster. 1\u20132 hours of screen on time max while playing games or while watching videos on YouTube. SE has way better battery backup (2 - 3 times the screen on time of 6s), performance & camera. Don\u2019t buy iPhones 6s. Camera is also very poor, dynamic range is pretty bad on 6s. I am using 6s and looking for upgrading. ",
