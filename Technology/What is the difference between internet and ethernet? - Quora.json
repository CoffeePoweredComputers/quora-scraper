            "answer_text": "Ethernet is a particular networking technology well adapted to the scale of one building, be it a single hours or a large office block. There are a number of versions of Ethernet which have developed over the years. And the fundamental thing that Ethernet does is transfer packets between computers.  The Internet is a world wide packet switching network. Since it is based on packets, and Ethernet delivers packets, the carrier for the Internet that most people encounter is Ethernet. Within one building , the Internet is often carried by Ethernet. But over longer distances, others technologies are used. The broadband connections used to connect homes to the Internet are not Ethernet; they may be a number of other technology's such as ADSL. Likewise, the trans-ocean fibre optic links that deliver Internet packets from one continent to another are not Ethernet. The Internet can be carried across many such links. But the one you encounter most often is Ethernet. ",

            "answer_text": "Ethernet is a very common, lower-level (sometimes called \u201clayer-2, or datalink-layer) data transmission protocol that only operates within a \u201clocal area network\u201d (LAN). Such transmissions are conducted \u201cmachine to machine\u201d using a given machine\u2019s hardware MAC (Media Access Control) address. A discovery protocol called ARP allows each machine in the LAN to respond to \u201cWhat MAC has this IP address\u201d with \u201cThis MAC\u201d, and so data gets routed to the right machine. In principle, machines whose network cards \u201csee\u201d layer-2 transmissions that are not addressed to their own MAC address are supposed to ignore that data. The Internet is the planet-scale network of millions of smaller networks. It operates \u201chop-by-hop\u201d using layer-2 data transmissions, but encapsulates higher-level protocols (TCP and UDP over IP), whereby billions of packets are routed by IP address across the globe, being bundled and unbundled at each hop (major Internet router) so the the \u201cbest path\u201d from source to a destination can be selected (which can change from moment to moment due to congestion issues.) These \u201cmajor Internet routers\u201d are operated by major telcos - they are sort of the ISP for your ISP, and \u201cpeer\u201d with one another to route traffic globally. When the TCP/IP (or UDP/IP) packets are delivered to their final router (such as your home or business router/gateway, the packets may again revert to layer-2 Ethernet protocol to be delivered to your specific machine.

            "answer_text": "The Ethernet protocol is a layer 2 network protocol in the Open Systems Interconnection model (OSI model). IP or Internet Protocol is a layer 3 network protocol. An Ethernet frame can contain an IP packet, so they work in concert. Ethernet is primarily a local area network (LAN) protocol. Device addresses are assigned by the hardware or software manufacturer so that each interface has a globally unique address, but these addresses are not hierarchical, so the overhead to use Ethernet to globally route traffic would involve very high resource overhead. IP address space is allocated globally by region. Regional Internet Registries (RIRs) are nonprofit corporations that administer and register Internet Protocol (IP) address space and Autonomous System (AS) numbers within a defined region, so that IP address routing information can be exchanged globally among the router devices in the default-free zone. Because addresses can be summarized and advertised via a routing protocol by Autonomous System, the overhead is low enough that provider routers can hold the entirety of the Internet\u2019s routing information, which allows it to function on a global scale.

Millions of private, public, academic, business, and government networks worldwide connect with each other over the internet to share massive amounts of information, resources and services. Internet is what we use to access web pages, send e-mails, listen to music or watch videos online. It hosts an extensive range of information, one that we generally take for granted today. Ethernet is basically a network that allows computers in a local area to connect to each other. It is a group of technologies that allow computers to transmit data between each other. The computers connected over the Ethernet are usually within the same building or within close proximity of each other. With modern technology and improvements in Ethernet cables, the range of an Ethernet network can be improved up to a maximum span of ten kilometers. However, since the computers use meters of cable to connect to each other, it is impractical to connect computers very far away from each other. ",

Some roads are concrete, some asphalt, some are dirt, some are public, some are private, some are behind gates; but they are all places for vehicles to drive (as opposed to say trains\u2026 we hope). TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol) is like the lane lines, road markers, the rules that govern how traffic flows, and what kinds of vehicles are allowed to be on the road. Finally, \u201cThe Internet,\u201d as you experience it, is like a certain kind of traffic that can only enter and exit the roadway at certain on/off ramps. This implies that there are other vehicles and kinds of traffic sharing the road and going other places; and there are.

The other layer is the datalink layer which has signaling standards for transfer of data on Ethernet. Internet on the other hand is a collection of all the world networks connected together using different technologies and are able to communicate through each other. Its just like a giant web of nodes (PCs,servers etc) connected with each other all over the world. ",

Ethernet is a broad family of standards (technologies) that govern the way communication takes place at a physical level and the most primitive layer of hardware-software interactions. If we look at the OSI model this is Layer 1 and part of Layer 2. Two primitives are defined by ethernet: the frame and the packet. [StartPacket][StartFrame][Data][EndFrame][EndPacket] The internet is much more abstract concept where some folks like to say: A publicly accessible network of networks. I hope this sheds at least a little light. I can add details or make clarifications. ",
