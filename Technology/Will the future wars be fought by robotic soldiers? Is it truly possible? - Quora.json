            "answer_text": "This will not happen for quite a while, if and when it does they computer will still be controlled by humans. Computers are set up to react to a written code. In time of war, most things will be unpredictable. Bad guys will need to be interrogated. Distinguishing civilians from \u201cbad guys\u201d would be almost impossible in 3rd world countries with no uniforms. So it won't completely take humans away from the battlefield. IMO ",
