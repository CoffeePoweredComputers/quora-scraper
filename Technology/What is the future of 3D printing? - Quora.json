            "answer_text": "3D printing is the buzzword ever since the start of the 21st century and even in 2020, you can still say that this amazing technology is still in its initial stage. It has made a lot of progress in just a couple of decades and had revolutionized some of the major industries and sectors around the world. However, is it still even half at the projected stage for it? I think we have not been able to achieve even 30 percent of the output that 3D printers are actually capable of offering. Yes, 3D printers are a part of the homes, the food industries, the construction industries and the manufacturing units of several other industries but the scope of output out of 3D printers is so huge that we cannot even imagine getting 100 percent of it even in the next few decades. So as far as I suppose, 3D printing has a great future and here are some of the aspects that this technology would certainly turn better in the long run. Bioprinting: You would already have an idea about 3D printers that take human cells as their ink and are capable of printing organs which get damaged in the body in due course of life. Such damaged organs can be replaced with the 3D printed organs and this is a life saving factor.  However, even when the researchers have been able to print 3D organs for the human body, they are still not acceptable in the body and probably require some good reconsideration and better changes to turn compatible for the human body. Perhaps, in the near future, we could see 3D printers offering better bio-printed 3D organs for the human body which are compatible too. We have seen 3D printers offering absolutely compatible skin covers for the wounded people and it is not long that we get such amazing organs which would save innumerable lives that get lost every year due to failure of organs. 3D Printed Medicines: While medicines such as pills etc. can be easily manufactured at less cost and less wastage out of the 3D printers, I think even this one of the technologies is still in its initial stage. 3D printed medicines may also reduce the manufacturing cost and lessen the overall cost of the final product too.  And in the near future, we can expect good 3D printed medicines that are consumable by humans. 3D Printed Food: This one is probably the favourite part of most of the human beings out of the 3D printing technology. Yes, there are specific food 3D printers used by restaurants around the world and there are many consumable products like readymade chocolates quite possible out of these 3D printers.  However, it is important to note that these 3D printers are capable of only designing the food, as of now, and perhaps the 3D printed food surely needs some post processing or cooking before it gets served. No doubt, there is a bit of extra effort involved even when the technology steps up to help the human beings. But I am sure that in near future, the people would have very less to do in the food department as food 3D printers could easily print all-cooked foo which would be ready to be presented before the customers. Such sophisticated food 3D printers might be a good choice for the domestic uses as well. 3D Printed House: I think the best use of 3D printers would surely be 3D printed houses. There are huge 3D printers that can manufacture livable houses within a day and these are quite good too. However, a house is just not a concrete structure and it needs all the amenities to be called a proper house.  And I am fully sure that the researchers would have something about this aspect too. They may be able to deliver good 3D printed or rather 3D constructed houses which would be better than caravans. 3D Printed Apparel and Shoes: This is again not a new concept and several fashion shows around the world have already displayed their best in terms of 3D printed clothing and shoes etc. However, the future of this concept certainly holds the mass production such daily use products for human beings which would be quite affordable too.  So these are some of the aspects that I think have a great future with 3D printing. However, I would still say that 3D printing is in its initial stage and there is a lot more to be derived out of 3D printers. Make sure you know about the technology and stay updated with all that is coming around in the world due to 3D printers. ",

            "answer_text": "I was the guy who did the initial original market research for the technology that was licensed by Sandia National Laboratories to become 3D printing. This research was done in 1995.  The original plan was to locate one or more of these devices - they were much larger then - on aircraft carriers. The printers worked with metallic powders then, plastics were an eventuality. But the immediate application was to make jet replacement parts so carriers didn't have to carry a hundred of every possible part. Also, to make turbine blades which would have otherwise required entire turbine assemblies to be kept in stock - and they aren't small. The next phase was to identify high value low volume part manufacturers to make the production cost efficient for one off or just a few a year parts to reduce inventory costs. A follow-up to that is the phase we are in now, where designers can quickly model prototypes at a cost effective back to the drawing board rate. We are moving into the business service model where very small production and artistic affordability will experiment with possible applications. Technologically the speeds are increasing as are the materials that can be printed. Also, the tolerances of items are becoming very precise with fewer surface anomalies that require post production processing. We are getting closer to make and immediately use parts. Eventually the cost effectiveness and mass production of recyclable materials could have a corner kiosk service to create replacement parts for whatever a trades worker needs. Order up a standard part and have it printed at the local kiosk.  The shipping costs for companies can be eliminated as the only product a kiosk business would need is raw material and energy. Manufacturing could eventually be local - like down the block for everyone. Of course this eliminates manufacturing jobs and creates McDonalds like local print and assemble parts jobs - though much of this can be automated. There will be an increase in local delivery jobs to deliver these products to customers. And there will be improved recycling procedures and policies for materials when used up. If you want to get into this emerging industry, find a way to create the corner kiosk production center - probably initially located near industrial parks and small manufacturers with limited funds who would like fast prototyping without having to invest in the knowledge to operate these machines and pay costs to maintain and operate a machine they don't use all the time. Perhaps a technology incubation center, or small business support facility. It will take a lot of understanding what kinds of small parts people could benefit from your production of them locally. Then franchise the operation. ",

            "answer_text": "During the next 10 years, 3D printing is well positioned to begin to revolutionize manufacturing processes and methodologies worldwide. The word \u2018revolutionise\u2019 is used because until now most plastic and metal parts relied on older, and in some cases ancient, molding technologies for shaping parts and products into the required design. 3-D printing technology has come a long way in recent years, and it's really started to mature in terms of its capabilities and real-world applications. It's no longer just theoretical -- it's practical in a wide variety of instances, and that's good news for 3-D printing innovators and early adopters, as well as for the rest of the world. It is still at the beginning of the true 3-D printing revolution, and it's likely that as the technology improves and comes down in price, we'll continue to see innovative ways of putting 3-D printing technology to good use. Nevertheless, there are some pretty cool uses of the technology on the market already and a strong indication of further disruption to come. 3D printing, promises to create such parts and products by simply printing the shape in a standalone process. Furthermore, 3D printing has the capability of not only printing very complex parts, but also printing completely integrated part combinations as a single finished product, and in many cases being able to print more complex designed parts than could ever be done by traditional molding processes. Four key factors will define the future growth of 3D printing, namely: Improving printer capabilitiesBroadening applicationsNew print toolsRaw materials advance.All 3D printing technology is based on a relatively simple principle that if enough 2D cross-sectional layers can be \u2018built\u2019 on top of each other in the proper design sequence, then a 3D shape and model can be created. Therefore, a 3D model or design is simply the successive layering of 2D cross-sectional patterns of the intended 3D design. Technologies differ in the way the 2D layers are created and what types of materials constitute the layers. Expected improvements will come from a variety of important performance changes, including: New designs for CAD programs and improved STL file interface, or replacement of standard STL files by new 3D programming instruction codesMore accurate and precise digital control of 3D equipmentFaster printing speed (use of multiple printing heads) and material application designsNew materials and chemistry to meet improved printing speed, enabling multi-materialsImprovements to allow greater use of metal and ceramicsTo get more about the future of 3D printing, visit 6 Must-See ISA Sign Expo Sessions To Catch and Why | Massivit 3D.

            "answer_text": "Speaking of the future of 3D printing, I want to say the 3D printing application in our daily life first, especially during the Corona-virus pandemic. In order to solve the problem of the shortage of emergency supplies in epidemic prevention and control, a lot of countries start using 3D printers to produce ventilator accessories, personal protective masks. 3D printing plays an important role in global epidemic prevention and control. More importantly, 3D printing does not require mould opening, integrated moulding, and has a short production cycle. It is very suitable for the production and rapid delivery of products with complex structures and small batches. So based on the above, it is widely used in prototyping, custom production, and complex parts of manufacturing. Last but not least, with economic development and the improvement of living standards, consumers are more pursuing more personalized needs. 3D printing will be integrated with robots, artificial intelligence and other technologies to increase the flexibility of manufacturing production lines. 3D printing can produce customized products at very low costs. The production model is transformed from mass production to individual customization. At the same time, with the advantages of saving warehousing and logistics costs and quickly responding to the local market, 3D printing will promote the development of manufacturing to a local manufacturing model. I have no doubts that along with the in-depth promotion of 3D printing education and the rise of the maker movement. Home printers and small 3D printing shops will become more and more popular, and people will be able to make products of their own design. In the future, with the development of 3D printers, materials and post-processing technologies, the application fields of 3D printing will continue to expand.. ",

Taking into account the great interest of scientists in the method of 3D bioprinting, which is one of the most promising technologies of 3D printing, the production of artificial organs on a 3D printer is not far off. It is also safe to say that the future of 3D printing will bring us radical changes in such areas as: Construction. 3D printing of houses, or contour construction, attracts many with its futuristic and simplicity. The first steps in this direction have already been taken. Pioneers in 3D home printing were the Chinese, followed by the Dubai government's discovery of contour construction. The city of the future has already built its first 3D printed office building, and a whole block is planned to be printed in the near future. And just recently, the first printing house in Europe was built on a 3D printer; Electronics. Listing the prospects of 3D printing, this item should be given special attention. Scientists believe that 3D printing of electronics will be the future of digital devices, and it is not without reason. At present, research on the properties of graphene and its application in additive production is being actively conducted. A huge breakthrough in this field is the creation of a graphene battery with an unlimited service life on a 3D printer; Automotive and aerospace industries. The future of 3D printing is largely based on its ability to reproduce almost any element of varying complexity. In this connection, already now the 3D press is widely applied at working out of planes, cars and satellites. ISS even has its own 3D printer, not to mention a number of successful results of 3D-printing of cars. Pharmaceutical industry. Yes, yes, you can imagine. The future of 3D printing is in the manufacture of pills and other medicines. The confirmation of it are the tablets legalized in the USA from epilepsy, made on a special technique. The essence of this perspective of 3D printing is the gradual release of active substances, so that instead of many pills you can take just one. Food industry. 3D food printers are gradually taking up space in cafes and restaurants. While this is probably one of the most dampest 3D printing technologies, it also has potential. 3D food printers are particularly interesting for the possibility of making food for astronauts, as well as the freedom of culinary talent. This is confirmed by the amazing 3D printed desserts of our compatriot. ",

            "answer_text": "A lot of people ask, is 3D printing hype? And I'm really a strong believer that not only is it a big revolution, but we haven't seen most of it yet. We've only seen the tip of the iceberg. Part of it is this expansion in materials. Right now, most 3D printers print in relatively passive materials. You have plastic, some print in metal. Maybe ceramics. But these are sort of single materials, they're fairly passive materials. But as the technology expands to printing in active materials, materials that conduct electricity, materials that can sense, can move, can compute, can store power. If you can print in a dozen base materials simultaneously the combinations of those materials, you can use to create objects in 3D, what we call metamaterials, is far greater than just 12. It's a power of 12. That's just, in the exponential nature of this technology. The design space, the things that we can make expand so dramatically that anything we make today from these passive materials will pale in comparison. And so that's why I think that we really are just at the beginning of what is a long journey in this ability to create objects with multiple materials with active materials really. Moving from passive parts to active systems and that's, I know the design space is vast and unexplored. For everyone: There's one type of printer that everybody would need in their home because they'll need to use it right away. And that's a food printer. I think it's one of these, beyond plastic, metal, and ceramics there's bio-printing, which is very interesting for biology and medicine. But food printing is this idea that basically a printer assembles food for you and cooks it in line, in a data-driven way. So based on your biometrics, on your needs, you can get the food that has the right level of calcium, sugar, protein, vitamins, whatever you need that day, in a data-driven way. So again it's not a, it's not about to replace your entire kitchen but I think it's something that many people will want in their kitchen very much the same way they have an espresso machine. Thank you. Reference: \u201cFabricated\u201d A book by Hod lipson. ",

            "answer_text": "At this point, in terms of the equipment, we\u2019ve more or less reached a point where we\u2019re up against the laws of physics. A printer can only work so fast against its own inertia and while some steps have been taken to calculate the velocities and deceleration of movements, there\u2019s only so much number crunching you can do on this front before you realize you\u2019ve dug yourself a hole rather than looking for another means of solving the same problem. Granted, I may well be proven wrong, but I\u2019ve yet to see anything for FDM (fused deposition modeling) printing that indicates some unlocked potential, hence companies like Stratasys investing in polyjet printing. From my perspective, the real innovations are going to be in the materials employed. SLA, or resin printing, right now really emphasizes the \u201cprototyping\u201d aspect of printing; the materials simply aren\u2019t strong enough to make practical objects. At best, they\u2019re used to make positives in lost wax or sand casting or some other molding means. This is changing, fortunately. We\u2019re also seeing advances in metal printing processes apart from SLS (Selective Laser Sintering) though a lot of this is still behind trade secrets and non-disclosure agreements. There\u2019s also a process called 4D printing, which is a bit of a misleading term (especially if you\u2019ve an extremely active imagination). NASA is particularly invested in this for the manufacture of satellites and other structures while in orbit. The various bioprinting firms have also experimented with these materials. The idea is that once you print out the desired shape, the piece continues to form itself after the fact. For example, say your build volume is a 20cm cube, but you need a part that\u2019s 50cm in length and it has to be one piece. You could print the piece \u201ccoiled up\u201d and have it expand to its full length when exposed to light or heat or a chemical agent. That\u2019s one of many proposed processes, but you get the idea. The mechanical engineering will continue to grow, but may hit a wall sooner than later. The chemical engineering, on the other hand, is just getting started. ",

This is a brand new technology which is under the roof of research and has potential application in the field of bio-medical and logistics. 4D printing is not a physical 4th dimension the 4th 'D' corresponds to the time dependent transformation of a shape memory material in response to some stimuli. The stimuli can be anything like temperature,pH, force etc., This technology is actually a bio-mimetic (resembling nature) from the movement of sunflower with respect to sun movement. One notable and potential application of this 4D printing is tissue printing. There are special type of 3D printers called bio - printers which uses bio-inks to print tissues. These bio inks has droplets with DNA reinforced in them thus they can synthesis protein and resembling real muscle!!. To understand this concept in a better way avenger VISION from the movie age of ultron is the first bio printed avenger. Organs like kidney ear can be printed. Even small tissues like bronchioles can be printed and it has been proved functional (tested with 3 patients) . Many other technology such as tracheobronchial split is based on this 4D printing.

This world isn\u2019t yet a reality, but it\u2019s getting closer every day thanks to advancements in the field of rapid prototyping and 3-dimensional printing. The new cancer application also involves 3D molds that can be filled with liquid, allowing experts to see in detail the flow of radiopharmaceuticals. Radiopharmaceuticals are drugs containing radioactive material that may be injected into a vein, taken by mouth or placed in a body cavity. They are used to treat a number of different tumors, including thyroid cancer, cancers of nerves cells in children and certain tumors that have spread to the bones. Often, the difficulty in this procedure is calculating a dose that is high enough to kill the cancer cells without causing too much damage to healthy tissue. In the future, accurate modeling could allow doctors to fine-tune dosing. Using duplicates in reconstructive surgery As part of reconstructive surgery, plastic surgeons have begun using 3D printers to help create duplicates made from polymers. Models from 3-D printers serve as templates and help surgeons carve out bone replicas as well. Experts believe that the use of digital planning in prosthesis development produces superior results by reproducing the exact shape from CAT-scan data. This makes the replacement bones a good match to the patient\u2019s natural bone. Engineers and physicians print entire prosthetic limbs, which helps to create a more exact fit for patients. Here are the best 3d printers listed here. Children with prosthetics also can benefit as the children grow and need replacements. Digital blueprints can be kept in their files for reference, and because the process requires less labor, the price is more affordable. 3D printing also has been used in making tablets and sensors for post-operative care, which can be implanted in a patient\u2019s body, prosthetic parts, tissues with blood vessels, cardiovascular models, bones, ear cartilage, heart valves, and replacements for cranium and synthetic skin. New applications of 3D printing are being used in the medical field every day. Researchers are developing printers that can print out human tissue or even pills.

            "answer_text": "We find ourselves on the cusp of another industrial revolution. 3D printing has reached a tipping point, and it\u2019s about to become mainstream in a big way. While many engineers and hobbyists have used this innovative manufacturing technology in their daily work, much of the general public is still unaware of this powerful new tool. However, this is about to change as 3D printing continues to become more accessible. At its core, 3D printing is a process that allows for the creation of solid objects from digital files. Also known as additive manufacturing, this technique is unique from other manufacturing techniques. Traditionally, manufacturing has relied on subtractive techniques, which require huge machines that cost tens of thousands of dollars. On the other hand, 3D printing can be accomplished on desktop-friendly machines. Using affordable materials like plastics, these printers can create everything from novelty figurines to hard-to-find automotive parts. Believe it or not, NASA even uses a 3D printer on the International Space Station to print custom tools! Affordability, accessibility, and a shallow learning curve combine to drive the impact of 3D printing on businesses, workforces, and societies. Impact on Businesses In 2019, 51% of enterprises actively used 3D printing in production, largely for proof of concept and prototype testing. When over half of businesses adopt a technology, it\u2019s no longer a fad. Instead, it\u2019s the future, and additive manufacturing is poised to transform the way organizations around the world approach manufacturing, supply chains, and beyond. Some of the key impacts that 3D printing will have on businesses include: Rapid Prototyping: 3D printing allows for small batches of parts to be created in only a few hours. This has given rise to the art of rapid prototyping, which enables businesses to test a new concept or idea in days instead of weeks. Popular toymaker Hasbro leverages this approach when designing new products, which allows them to get to market faster than their competitors.Lower Manufacturing Costs: Transitioning early-stage manufacturing processes from traditional methods to 3D printing leads to lower manufacturing costs. In most cases, it\u2019s much cheaper to create prototypes, jigs, tooling, and fixtures using additive manufacturing. However, processes like injection molding are still more affordable at scale, so shifting all manufacturing to 3D printing is not yet practical.Fewer Supply Chain Woes: 3D printing files can be viewed as the storage of spare parts in the cloud. It\u2019s the perfect solution for low volume parts that are only needed on occasion. Parts can be designed in Europe or Asia and then manufactured in North America over the course of a single day, which completely redefines the supply chain. When leveraged effectively, additive manufacturing can eliminate the cost and time of shipping for certain components.As we have seen, the future of 3D printing will offer key benefits to countless businesses. Similarly, the widespread adoption of additive manufacturing is sure to positively impact workforces around the world. Impact on Workforces It\u2019s no secret that the workforce for industries like manufacturing has been in flux for the past few decades. The rise of globalization has driven an increasing number of jobs to wherever the cheapest labor can be found. This trend, combined with a steady rise in automation, has made well-paid manufacturing jobs more difficult to find. However, there\u2019s good news to be had. 3D printing is poised to positively impact workforces in several ways, including: New Job Growth: While job growth in traditional manufacturing sectors is floundering, additive manufacturing is driving job growth in key areas. From 3D computer-aided design (CAD) to equipment technicians, there are an exciting number of new job openings driven by this innovation. Better yet, initiatives are in the works to retrain displaced blue-collar manufacturing workers for white-collar jobs in 3D printing.Freelance Manufacturing: The widespread availability of affordable 3D printers is leading to the creation of freelance manufacturing opportunities. For example, websites like Shapeways allow anyone to open their own 3D print shop online. This presents a fantastic opportunity for entrepreneurial individuals who want to pursue modern manufacturing opportunities.Educational Opportunities: While today\u2019s workforce is working to adapt to a world with 3D printing, future generations will benefit from more educational opportunities. Additive manufacturing is already becoming a key component of high school, with a number of post-secondary offerings also under development. Look for the next generation of workforce professionals to be well-versed in additive manufacturing fundamentals.This is a truly exciting time for workforce professionals interested in additive manufacturing. Nevertheless, one could argue that the greatest impacts of 3D printing will be on society as a whole. Impact on Societies Amazon and other digital retailers have driven the rise of throw-away culture. After all, why should you spend the time to repair something if a replacement is just a few clicks away? While this is a reasonable argument, it\u2019s impossible to maintain in a world grappling with the early effects of climate change. Thankfully, the growing popularity of 3D printing is revitalizing the practicality of repair, which could have massive impacts on our world: Maker Culture: Consumer-grade 3D printers are a direct result of maker culture, a movement using modern technology to redefine DIY repairs. The maker movement encourages individuals to leverage additive manufacturing to make the most out of what they already have, which is key to sustainability. From household repairs to unique designs, there are 3D printing ideas for everyone.A New Generation of Innovators: In the 1980s, the growth of computers led to a generation of innovators. In many ways, the development of 3D printing is mirroring this trend. Dozens of innovators and business leaders are already leading the way with this new technology.3D printing is already having a profound impact on businesses, workforces, and societies. Believe it or not, this is just the beginning of an exciting trend. As 3D printers continue to improve and become more affordable, look for innovation to become the new normal in the world of additive manufacturing. ",

            "answer_text": "3-D printing is an unstoppable force. Not too long ago, the printing speed and limited output of 3-D printers made them suitable only for rapid prototyping. But in the coming years, 3-D printers will be at the heart of full-scale production capabilities in several industries, from aerospace to automotive to health care to fashion. Manufacturing as we know it will never be the same. The stage for this change wasn\u2019t set overnight. Decades of innovation have led us to the precipice of the 3-D printing industrial revolution. But recent advancements in speed, printing technology and material capabilities are now aligned, and together they will push the entire industry forward. Along with growing competition and investment in the 3-D printing industry, these new capabilities will reshape custom manufacturing. The 3-D printing industry is on the verge of another tipping point, and here are the reasons why. Innovations In Direct-Metal Printing Direct-metal printing is getting faster and more capable, and many new technologies are now coming into play. The number of metal alloys that can be 3-D printed is on the rise, and they have exceptional performance characteristics. You can get high-performance lightweighting and complexity that is impossible with traditional design and manufacturing processes. With these changes, imagine the possibilities: Complex and highly detailed products critical for the aerospace, automative and mechatronic industries will soon be available for production at a fraction of the cost. If your car needs a repair, you\u2019ll soon be able to purchase a shift knob or fuel-door hinge pin that was quickly and inexpensively printed. Aerospace engineers will use the same technology to produce jigs and fixtures for spacecrafts. The implications are staggering. What\u2019s more, there are fully automated, multistation direct-metal printers that are essentially an entire factory in a box. With automated parts changes and material replenishment, they can literally operate around the clock. GE is a major player in the direct-metal printing field, and the company predicts that its metal business alone will surpass $1 billion in annual revenue in the next couple years. And early-stage companies such as Desktop Metal and Markforged have received several hundred million dollars in funding to deliver entry-level direct-metal systems that print from a metal-plastic filament. So on one hand, entry-level grassroots companies will disrupt conventional CNC machining and local machine-shop businesses. And on the other, you see high-complexity precision aeroframe manufacturing solutions from GE and many other 3-D companies. Innovations In Printing Speed For decades, 3-D printing has been capable in terms of geometric precision and accuracy, but printing speeds remained very slow. But this too is changing. The CLIP technology from Carbon 3D and similar technologies from companies like one of mine, Nexa 3D, are capable of continuously printing photo-curable polymers at very high speeds -- 40 or 50 times the speed of a conventional stereolithography 3-D printing system. With the ability to print a centimeter every minute, these systems will no doubt play a major role in the design-to-manufacturing cycle. While a similar job used to take days, now you can get parts in your hand in five, 10 or 15 minutes. It will also unleash work with completely new chemistries, particularly within several variants of urethane. You can make the output rigid, semi-rigid or flexible, and these kinds of variations in chemistry open up a lot of end-use applications, from athletic shoes to vehicle interiors to apparel. ",

            "answer_text": "Well, 3D printing is too expensive for manufacturing of parts, unless we\u2019re talking about extremely small parts. The reason for this is because the voxel size will matter and smaller voxels will create more details, but will require more energy to get the voxels in the right location. So for making some 3D model in large quantities, you would basically just print a single object and use that to make a mold. You can then use the mold to make as many copies of this object as you like. But the big advantage for 3D printing is prototyping, especially when combined with electronics. Right now, 3D printing is mostly used for decorative purposes and jewelry and occasionally to make new parts that broke down and need to be repaired but their biggest advantage is when you combine 3D printing with the production of electronic devices, especially prototypes. For example, a lot of people are messing around with Arduino boards and there are models for cases for these kinds of boards. Something like this, for example:  And this is where the biggest innovation for 3D printing lies, combined with consumer electronic toolkits like the Arduino. People can now create their own robots, radios and lots of other electronic tools, connect them to the Internet or with Bluetooth to a mobile device and create all kinds of neat things. And this electronics needs to look neat when people actually want to use it. For companies, it also becomes interesting at a slightly more advanced level as they can use 3D printing for their own prototypes. A car manufacturer, for example, could make small versions of their cars as models showing what the result would look like. Most of it would be designed on the computer but before they make it at the original size, they could make on at a 1:12 scale as sample. Same for an architect, who can use the computer to design a complete house and then print it scaled in 3D for the customer to evaluate. He would have a real 3D model that their customers could hold and look at from all directions. Mostly, they would need some handwork and proper craft skills to make it but this way, the computer will just make it for them. So, the future for 3D printing will mostly be prototyping so models can be made before they continue to work on the product and make it final. The 3D printer could also be used to make molds that would later be used for mass production. But 3D printing requires a lot of energy and a lot of time since a small print like the Arduino box above will easily take 12 hours or more\u2026 ",

            "answer_text": "3D printing -- also known as additive manufacturing -- turns digital 3D models into solid objects by building them up in layers. The technology was first invented in the 1980s, and since that time has been used for rapid prototyping (RP). However, in the last few years, 3D printing has additionally started to evolve into a next-generation manufacturing technology that has the potential to allow the local, on-demand production of final products or parts thereof. Already it is possible to 3D print in a wide range of materials that include thermoplastics, thermoplastic composites, pure metals, metal alloys, ceramics and various forms of food. Right now, 3D printing as an end-use manufacturing technology is still in its infancy. But in the coming decades, and in combination with synthetic biology and nanotechnology, it has the potential to radically transform many design, production and logistics processes. 3D printers may also be used to make future buildings. Demonstrating the potential, over in China an amazing company called WinSun Decoration Design Engineering has already 3D printed a number of houses. Produced using a vast material extrusion 3D printer, these include a 1,100 square meter mansion and a five storey apartment block. Another future application is the use of 3D printers to create replacement organs, and even to directly repair the human body in situ. This is known as bioprinting, and is an area of rapid development. You can learn more on the bioprinting page, or see more in my bioprinting video or the Future Visions gallery. ",

            "answer_text": "The technology for 3-D printing, also known as additive manufacturing, has existed in some form since the 1980s. However, the technology has not been capable enough or cost-effective for most end-product or high-volume commercial manufacturing. Expectations are running high that these shortcomings are about to change. Several technology trends are feeding these expectations. An emerging class of mid-level 3-D printers is starting to offer many highend system features in a desktop form factor at lower price points. Printer speeds are increasing across the product spectrum; at least one high-end system under development could print up to 500 times faster than today\u2019s top machines. And key patents are about to expire, a development likely to hasten the pace of innovation.  A wide range of commercial 3D printers for industrial application are now available from a range of manufactuers, the two largest of whom are 3D Systems (which works with most technologies and is rapidly acquiring many smaller manufacturers) and Stratasys (which offers FDM and polyjet matrix harware, as well as special 'drop on demand' wax 3D printers for dental work). Both of these companies had a market capitalization at the end of 2012 of over $3 billion. Other large 3D printer manufactuers that are publically traded are Archam (which produces electron beam melting (EMB) machines), the aforementioned ExOne with their metal and sand binder jetting 3D printers, and Organovo, who specialize in bioprinting. Other large but private 3D printer manufacturers of note include EnvisionTEC (who specialize in DLP projection hardware but also make a 'bioplotter' for tissue engineering), EOS (who make selective laser sintering devices for producing objects in metals or sand), Voxeljet (who make really large printers for binder jetting in sand or plastic powders), SLM Solutions (who specialize in selective laser melting), and Optomec (who produce directed energy deposition printers using their own 'laser engineered net shaping' (LENS) technology). You can find information on these and other industrial 3D printing manufactuers in my 3D Printing Directory. Prices for most commercial/industrial 3D printers tend to start in the ten-to-twenty thousand dollar bracket and spiral upwards into the hundreds of thousands of dollars for very-high-end machines that can build fully-dense metal parts. Although some desktop models are on the market, most commercial 3D printers are usually fairly bulky and often floor-standing. The above prices noted, it is already possible for lone designers and private individuals to obtain quality 3D printouts from high-end 3D printing hardware by using an online bureau. For example, Shapeways, iMaterialize and Sculpteo allow anybody to upload their 3D computers models to have their designs 3D printed and marketed online. More information on a wider range of 3D printing services can also be obtained from my 3D Printing Directory. ",

            "answer_text": "3D printing is still in its infancy. The MaketBot is one of the most popular desktop printers on the market. At the same time, commercial printers are more capable but much more expensive. This situation is similar to the late 1970\u2019s and early 80\u2019s when personal computers first came on the scene. The Apple II could be purchased for a few thousand dollars (in 1980 terms), had a monochrome green and black screen that only displayed capital letters. Shortly after that the public was wowed with the arrival of Flight Simulator software, in monochrome green. At that time, no one could imagine, much less predict the computer based technology of today. The Internet, Amazon, you tube, Pandora, kickstarter, Bitcoin encryption, and more have been developed as a result of computer technology. 3D printing, or additive manufacturing as it is known by engineers, is poised to change things drastically. One of the main differences between the growth of computer technology and the growth of 3D printing is that 3D printing has the added benefit of the Internet to fuel its growth, so things will be happening more quickly. That's a long way of saying that no one really knows what will happen. It is plausible that someone out there right now in a lab or a garage is working on an idea that others may have missed and that may move the whole thing ahead. It will most likely be an iterative process of trial and error. It will be fun to watch. ",

            "answer_text": "3D Printing: A New Approach To Building Design Plan Scientists, these days, are adopting 3D printing approach and robots to design, plan and build a house. The latest example of 3D printing and robots is the DFAB House. Eight scientists from one of the known Switzerland university are planning to build a three storey house at the Empa and Eawag Nest building in D\u00fcbendorf. It is claimed that the DFAB house is the first house in the world to use digital process not only for designing and planning but also building. It is a live \tproof of the first generation robots building a 200 sq foot house.The \tproject is said to use bleeding edge technologies like 3D printing \tand robots for building design plan and construction. Unlike other construction projects that use only a \tsingle digital process, this project will bring in a range of such processes together for building construction.Earlier, this technology was not so popular as it was complicated and expensive. However, use of 3D printers is increasing these days and it is gaining popularity in industrial practices. 3D printing can be used for creating anything from prototypes to highly technical final products such as airplane parts, medical implants, automobile and even artificial organs using layers of cells. Application of 3D printing in building design plan: 3D printing is termed as \u2018additive manufacturing\u2019 when referring to its use within a manufacturing setting. This additive manufacturing provides convenience to build models. In the field of architecture, it is used for creating first renderings of the project. . It is also possible to create a number of design iterations for just one project using 3D printing which is not possible using traditional methods. This allows for Custom House Plan to be made easily. With 3D printing, it is easy to design any kind of structure freely which also includes creating Building Architectural Drawing. It offers a lot of freedom while creating the designs which is really a good advantage to architects. One can 3D print a variety of projects with different designs like offices, hotels, tiny homes, real villas or homes. We can say that 3D printing is the next generation of building design plan. A 3D printed house in just 24 Hours: A Russian company has built a 400 square foot house from scratch within just 24 hours! Standing still in Moscow, this Apis Cor house was built using nothing but 3D printer to give impressive results. It is indeed a matter of fact to built such a house on site within a short duration at low cost. This house is a live example to explain how technology and 3D printing will revolutionize the construction industry in near future.

            "answer_text": "As Kyle says 3D printing is best suited to small volume production and customisation. So stuff to really fit people. It is already used in dental implants, hearing aids, and to make prosthetic sockets etc that fit perfectly to the wearer. But down the line, making less obvious things like bicycle saddles that are based on a scan of the riders body offers the potential for real comfort improvements. As the technology matures we may well see things like shoes custom printed to fit the individuals feet, glasses to fit noses and ears, helmets to fit heads, etc become commonplace. Another advantage 3d printing has is the ability to make geometry that cant be made other ways. This is often over-hyped with hollow metal parts shown that could actually be made by say investment casting. However as designers come to terms with designing for the technique, parts will be made that can only really be made this way. For example we could print very squishy \u201crubber\u201d parts from a relatively hard elastomer by adding voids to the inside. These would combine light weight properties, with softness, but still have the abrasion resistance of a harder material. On something like an off road tyre this might allow for huge weight savings from inside knobbles, the knobble would be soft enough to conform to the ground for grip but hard enough to have a long service life. Combine this with the ability to print mixed materials and you could put softer grippier rubber where needed too without compromising the strength of the knobbles and making them likely to shear off. As the technology improves designers will get used to making the most of these features and eventually making parts from solid sections of a single material will seem like a ridiculous restriction.

The reality is that we are still in a sort of trial period and many companies are testing the water to see how the technology can be leveraged for their specific purposes. This year we\u2019ve seen many companies take the plunge and reach out to us about metal 3D printing. This has exposed a knowledge gap when it comes to design-for-manufacturing practices about the process. To help combat this issue, Star Rapid launched online tutorial videos and in-person training at our factory, and other companies have launched various educational initiatives as well. Many companies that know how to design for metal 3D printing have found suitable applications and have ordered parts. But these applications are still in their infancy. Companies are testing small batches of parts to ensure that they successfully operate under real-world conditions with the intended performance. Once this is completed and doubts are erased, the industry will explode with demand. This likely won\u2019t begin to happen until the latter part of 2018. Are there emerging applications for 3D printing? The automotive space is an interesting one to watch unfold. Europe seems to be in an electric car race. Emission limits and electric car incentives are becoming commonplace in this region. Even China has gotten in on the action with electric car mandates. For gas and diesel vehicles, manufacturers continue to seek ways to reduce weight to increase miles per gallon and reduce emissions. Have you noticed that many new cars don\u2019t have a spare tire? That not only reduces weight, but lighter vehicles also have fewer flat tires! 3D printing\u2019s ability to reduce weight, without sacrificing safety or the driver\u2019s experience makes it attractive. The same logic can be applied to electric vehicles. The battery technology is extremely dense and heavy. Lowering weight increases the range a car can get on a single charge \u2013 which is very attractive to vehicle manufacturers. In China and globally, we\u2019re seeing renewed interest in additive manufacturing for medical use. In addition to prosthetics that have become quite popular over the last year, we\u2019re also seeing interest in creating medical models and cranium replacements. There is also a growth in micromolding. Micromolding can provide an excellent alternative to designing and manufacturing medical devices used in minimally invasive surgery (MIS). With micomolding, MIS designers don\u2019t have to deal with limitations placed on size or the complexity of material selection for production yields. Medical equipment can be quite expensive so parts created using additive manufacturing present cost-effective, functional alternatives. ",

Some of the most promising areas include medical applications, custom parts replacement, and customized consumer products. As materials improve and costs go down, other applications we can barely imagine today will become possible.3D printing is yet to find a strong foothold in Indian markets, it is still in nascent stage. Few of the well-known 3D printers and printing service providers in India include Altem Technologies Pvt. Ltd (Indian resellers of the Stratasys Inc.), Chandigarh based LBD Makers, Bangalore-based Brahma3 and Cycloid System, and Mumbai-based Divide By Zero, SharkBots and Kcbots.According to most Indian 3D printers, \u201csmall-scale companies are buying them to verify industrial designs and not for mass production\u201d.However, things are looking up for 3D printing, especially in India due to declining costs and wider availability. Basic 3D printers, particularly DIY printing assembly kits seem to be the preferred choice of more and more small-scale companies and hobbyists.The reach of this technology is quite literally boundless as it continues to develop. 3D printing will undoubtedly create more and more opportunities in almost every industry.",

            "answer_text": "3d printing technology was already being used by the big industrial companies for the sole purpose of prototyping. This technology has slowly been growing and now more materials can be printed other than just plastic. As you can see the technology that has come out more recently is way more expensive than the ones whose patents are over and hence only the large corporate's can use it.  This tech is obviously going to grow as its advantages over weigh its cons ( complexity,cost,scrap reduction). It also has the power to make manufacturing localized, soon people can make their own stuff instead of going to a shop.  Apart from that the printers are going to get cheaper cause the patents will fall off and a lot of companies will jump into it, just like what happened when the FDM patent came off. I think once desktop FDM metal printers come out, the 3d printer will become an household item. Every one will soon be a \" Maker \". Better jump into the maker movement now !! ",

The ability to do so arises from the near infinite configurations at a micrometer resolution, creating solids with engineered molecular spatial distributions[2] and thus allowing unprecedented multifunctional performance.  Cell Traction Force Cell Traction Force (CTF) is a technique wherein living cells fold and move microstructures into their designed shape. This is possible through the contraction that occurs from actin polymerization and actomyosin interactions within the cell. In natural processes, CTF regulates wound healing, angiogenesis, metastasis, and inflammation. Takeuchi et al. seeded cells across two microplates, and when the glass structure was removed the cells would bridge the gap across the microplate and thus initiate self-folding. The team was able to create vessel-like geometries and even high throughput dodecahedrons with this method. There is speculation that utilizing this technique of cell origami will lead to designing and printing a cell-laden structure that can mimic their non-synthetic counterparts after the printing process has completed.

He described the interior of the ship as one piece. Ceiling, walls, floor, table, monitors. No seams at all, all monolithic. Bob Lazar is another famous case, he described the same but they supposedly cut one up, took it apart. And they found no wires, no components, no circuit board. It was all one monolithic process. No distinction between structure, conduits or electrical function. Like if you made a craft with a microchip wafer process. One big 3D chip with control over every single atom, perfectly arranged.

I say its a fantastic tool because it is. Its future is in enabling people to prototype and experiment more with physical objects. Before it was so cheap, it was difficult for the average person to engineer new inventions/prototypes or everyday items. People were pretty much limited to creating software products. Now, all of the advantages of software development (cheap, easy, ect.) are coming to the physical world.  So, like the explosion of software creation we saw recently enabled by cheap computers, cheap manufacturing (3d printers) will enable an explosion of engineered physical products (including hardware/software integration, network connectivity, ect.) Thats the future. ",

The material research has to catch-up withthe rapid developments in the 3D printing industry. The development of Metamaterials will drive future growth of 3D printing. Development of Active materials (those which can conduct & store electricity) so that objects like batteries and devices can be directly 3D printed in a 3D printer rather than just printing the outer shells. This is the future possibility and research area of 3D printing. Another area is the artificial tissue printing which will lead to In-Situ Bioprinting and other related applications.
