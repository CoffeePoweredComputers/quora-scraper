            "answer_text": " Yes, and no. You see, anything online (or more precisely put: anything which can be accessed from a location other than where it is physically present) is vulnerable to attacks. No need to be indignant- your very physical non-smart locks are also equally vulnerable to attack by lockpickers and the like. The only difference is in the definition- the lockpicker would have to be physically present at your door but a hacker could be halfway across the world from you. In the case of smart homes (which have smart locks, automated garage doors, front door locks, sensors, cameras- the whole friggin\u2019 9 yards), it\u2019s usually the Wi-Fi that is the weakest link in the chain. See, your devices themselves will be encrypted, and will only activate/deactivate (lock/unlock) depending on a signal from a particular source. But if the source itself is compromised, it may spell danger. The most obvious response is to rush towards encrypting your network, using a secure app to control your devices and to run diagnostic tests and system reboots on a regular basis. What if I told you even that may not be enough to guarantee the security of your place? Recently, there have been advancements in technology which allow certain frequencies of sound to be created at a distance using- wait for it- lasers. Light of a specific wavelength and frequency is emitted from a laser, which is powerful enough to physically manipulate the material it falls on, effectively turning that material into a crude \u2018speaker\u2019 of sorts. This sounds cool until you realise lasers can be used to voice-control your home automation system into opening the garage door.. Destin from SmarterEveryday made a fantastic and rather well-researched video about this very phenomenon, and practically demonstrated how this could be a fatal flaw in home security even if you take all precautions to encrypt your Wi-Fi network! Here\u2019s the video:  Thanks for reading! ",

            "answer_text": "The answer is Yes and No, you must be wondering what I am saying but it is true that if the system is vulnerable then only the system can be hacked / bypass otherwise, not every system can be hacked, every system is not Vulnerable. Remember there is no security is BIG and no vulnerability is SMALL. We have to make sure that the system is also secure. If you are a master, the coding in which that security application is made, then it increases the chance that you will break something. I hope you have got an answer if you have any doubt feel free to ask me. Thank You . ",

Many \u201cdirect to wifi\u201d surveillance cameras or video doorbells have these problems, for instance. Also, the number of gadgets will make the house a more interesting target for thieves. ",
