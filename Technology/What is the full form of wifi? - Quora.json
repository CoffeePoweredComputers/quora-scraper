            "answer_text": "The Wi-Fi Alliance, the organization that owns the Wi-Fi registered trademark term specifically defines Wi-Fi as \"wireless local area network (WLAN) products that are based on the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers' (IEEE) 802.11 standards.\" Wi-Fi works with no physical wired connection between sender and receiver by using radio frequency (RF) technology, a frequency within the electromagnetic spectrum associated with radio wave propagation. When an RF current is supplied to an antenna, an electromagnetic field is created that then is able to propagate through space. It's abbreviated form evolved later on as Wireless Fidelity because of the fact that many tech giants, researchers and even organizations related to WiFi Alliance refer this as full form of WiFi in their journals and publications. Also, majority of computer science academic text books mentioned this as full form, we can take it without getting confused but the fact is different and is not actually the full form introduced by WiFi Alliance officially. In fact: A number of the Wi-Fi Alliance squad even were confused by this gibberish term and tried to make sense of it so consumers wouldn't be quite so confused. They decided to add the tagline \"The Standard for Wireless Fidelity\" along with the name Wi-Fi in marketing communications but that was not used later on in other publications. So result, WiFi doesn\u2019t stands for anything officially ! According to webopedia, The false notion that the brand name \"Wi-Fi\" is short for \"wireless fidelity\" has spread to such an extent that even industry leaders have included the phrase wireless fidelity in a press release. You'll also find references to Wi-Fi being short for wireless fidelity on a number of well-known and respected technology-focused publications and websites. The truth is, Wi-Fi isn't short for anything \u2014 and it never was.

            "answer_text": "What is the full form of WiFi? This question will no doubt get merged into similar questions on Quora asking what the \u201cWiFi\u201d name is short for. But whilst it\u2019s separate I\u2019ll add my take. Phil Belanger, the person within the IEEE 802.11 network standards working group that define the WIFi standards and chose the name, has made it very clear that the name \u201cWiFi\u201d was presented to the group amongst a selection of options for the brand name without any further meaning. It was not short for anything. Once it had been chosen however, a tag line \u201cThe standard for wireless fidelity\u201d was subsequently added and used for a while, effectively excusing and explaining the otherwise meaningless choice of brand name, after the fact. The tag line was later dropped as a mistake, as it diluted the brand name. So the correct answer is that \u201cWiFi\u201d is itself the full form of \u201cWiFi\u201d. This said, it\u2019s interesting to speculate on the thoughts of the marketing people who dreamt up the brand name. These thoughts appear not to have been published, but it\u2019s very tempting to imagine that it arose from a play on words: An abbreviation of wireless physical layer, or \u201cwireless phy\u201d, phy itself being a recognised abbreviation for \u201cphysical layer\u201dA convenient synergy with the well known term \u201cHi-Fi\u201d, meaning high fidelity in terms of audio reproductionBut to be clear, this is no more than speculation, and as with many brand names the original derivation was intentionally not carried forward to be a part of the brand. The whole point was to leave this to the imagination of the public, encouragement of this imagination in itself helping to establish the brand. In fact nowadays the WiFi brand has become a lot more than was originally intended. For very many people \u201cWiFi\u201d is now synonymous with internet, as its most common usage is in allowing devices to access the internet. To just about anybody, phrases such as \u201cDo you have WiFi?\u201d or \u201cI have a problem with my WiFi\u201d actually refer to (wireless) access to the internet. ",

Most WiFi routers allow connection between devices connected to its network. However some do not, for security reasons. WiFi uses radio frequencies 2.4 GHz (there are three types that use this: 802.11 B,G and N) and 5.0 GHz (802.11 e) (not so sure about this, edits welcome) Sometimes ADSL and cable (rarely) modems are integrated in wireless routers. There are some devices which use mobile networks for internet access and create a WiFi network around them for clients.  Nowadays there are phones which can do the above and computer applications which can share the wired internet connection they have. Usually domestic use of WiFi is mainly to access internet, and sometimes for device to device connection. ",

            "answer_text": "Wi-Fi isn\u2019t short-form for Wireless Fidelity! It\u2019a pun on hi-fi. From WiFi isn't short for \"Wireless Fidelity\" Phil Belanger, a founding member of the Wi-Fi Alliance who presided over the selection of the name \"Wi-Fi\" writes: Wi-Fi doesn't stand for anything. It is not an acronym. There is no meaning. Wi-Fi and the ying yang style logo were invented by Interbrand. We (the founding members of the Wireless Ethernet Compatibility Alliance, now called the Wi-Fi Alliance) hired Interbrand to come up with the name and logo that we could use for our interoperability seal and marketing efforts. We needed something that was a little catchier than \"IEEE 802.11b Direct Sequence\". Interbrand created \"Prozac\", \"Compaq\" \"oneworld\", \"Imation\" and many other brand names that you have heard of. They even created the company name \"Vivato\". The only reason that you hear anything about \"Wireless Fidelity\" is some of my colleagues in the group were afraid. They didn't understand branding or marketing. They could not imagine using the name \"Wi-Fi\" without having some sort of literal explanation. So we compromised and agreed to include the tag line \"The Standard for Wireless Fidelity\" along with the name. This was a mistake and only served to confuse people and dilute the brand. For the first year or so( circa 2000) , this would appear in all of our communications. I still have a hat and a couple of golf shirts with the tag line. Later, when Wi-Fi was becoming more successful and we got some marketing and business people from larger companies on the board, the alliance dropped the tag-line. This tag line was invented after the fact. After we chose the name Wi-Fi from a list of 10 names that Interbrand proposed. The tag line was invented by the initial six member board and it does not mean anything either. If you decompose the tag line, it falls apart very quickly. \"The Standard\"? The Wi-Fi Alliance has always been very careful to stay out of inventing standards. The standard of interest is IEEE 802.11. The Wi-Fi Alliance focuses on interoperability certification and branding. It does not invent standards. It does not compete with IEEE. It complements their efforts. So Wi-Fi could never be a standard. And \"Wireless Fidelity\" - what does that mean? Nothing. It was a clumsy attempt to come up with two words that matched Wi and Fi. That's it. So we were smart to hire Interbrand to come up with the name and logo. We were dumb to confuse and water down their efforts by adding the meaningless tag line. Please help reinforce the good work that we did and forget the tag line. ",

Wi-Fi is the trademark of the Wi-Fi alliance and used as a brand name for products using the IEEE 802.11 standards. Wi-Fi can be used on several types of devices like personal computers, video game console, smart phones, digital camera, tablet computers etc. You can use Wi-Fi to create a hotspot within the range of 20 meters (66 feet).

A common misconception is that the term Wi-Fi is short for \"wireless fidelity,\" however this is not the case. Wi-Fi is simply a trademarked phrase that means IEEE 802.11x.  How Wi-Fi Networks Works Wi-Fi networks have no physical wired connection between sender and receiver by using radio frequency (RF) technology -- a frequency within the electromagnetic spectrum associated with radio wave propagation. When an RF current is supplied to an antenna, an electromagnetic field is created that then is able to propagate through space. The cornerstone of any wireless network is an access point (AP). The primary job of an access point is to broadcast a wireless signal that computers can detect and \"tune\" into. In order to connect to an access point and join a wireless network, computers and devices must be equipped with wireless network adapters. ",

It\u2019s what makes it possible for your computer to access the internet without cables. How is WiFi different from Internet? The internet is a giant network made up of tons of smaller, local networks. And a router gives your devices access to this network. Even without a router, you can still have a local network - whether cabled or wireless, via WiFi - that connects your devices without access to the internet. A local network, for example, could include your router, your computer, and your wireless printer. Your computer can send a PDF to the printer via a WiFi connection. And all without internet!

Wi-Fi is merely a registered trademark that represents the wireless networking technology. It makes use of radio waves in order to provide high speed internet connections to users. The term was coined as a trademark by its parent organization Wi-Fi Alliance, nothing more. It is based on the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers' (IEEE) 802.11 standards.

However, Fidelity means \u2018the degree of exactness with which something is copied or reproduced\u2019.

The Wi-Fi Alliance had hired Interbrand to determine a name that was \"a little catchier than 'IEEE 802.11b Direct Sequence'\". Phil Belanger also stated that Interbrand invented Wi-Fi as a play on words with Hi-Fi (high fidelity), and also created the Wi-Fi logo. The Wi-Fi Alliance initially used the advertising slogan, \"The Standard for Wireless Fidelity\", for Wi-Fi but later removed the phrase from their marketing. Despite this, some documents from the Wi-Fi Alliance dated 2003 and 2004 still contain the term Wireless Fidelity. There was no official statement related to the dropping of the term. The yin-yang Wi-Fi logo indicates the certification of a product for interoperability. Source: Wi-Fi wikipedia page ",

Wi-Fi is just a trademark used for IEEE 802.11 (wireless LAN ) standards. Rest fellow qourans Kumarsambhav pandey and Vijay Bhaskar answered correctly. That is a misconception that Wi-Fi stands for wireless fidelity, though this term is not used anywhere technically, and does not even mean anything in technical terms. The term fidelity is just a receiver performance matrix, and defines how faithfully the receiver reproduce the actual audio quality. Thus the term hi-fi is valid term that define a audio system's quality. But that is not the case with Wi-Fi (802.11 wireless LAN ) it's just a communication standard. ",
