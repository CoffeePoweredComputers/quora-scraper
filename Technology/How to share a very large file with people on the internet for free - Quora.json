            "answer_text": "Anything up to a few gigabytes can be hosted on share sites like mega or mediafire, if you want to distribute a file to a very large number of recipients Bittorrent is a good option, especially if a lot of users are download at the same time. If we talk about 1 TB it is above the limit of share hosters, they usually go up to 1\u20132 GB. In this case Bittorrent would be the easiest solution I think ",
