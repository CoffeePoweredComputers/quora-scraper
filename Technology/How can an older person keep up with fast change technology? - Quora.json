            "answer_text": "\u201cHow can an older person keep up with fast change technology?\u201d Try and break it. This memo has some practical advice, but I\u2019m going to start with a quote from Douglas Adams, excerpted from the Salmon of Doubt: I've come up with a set of rules that describe our reactions to technology: 1. Anything that is in the world when you're born is normal and ordinary and is just a natural part of the way the world works. 2. Anything that's invented between when you're 15 and 35 is new and exciting and revolutionary and you can probably get a career in it. 3. Anything invented after you're 35 is against the natural order of things. The take-away here is that technology evolves, but people age. Their sense of exploration fades (or more technically, it\u2019s beaten out of them). You might be 15 now, but you\u2019ll sneeze, open your eyes and find you\u2019re 35 and suddenly facing the sad truth that late-night commercials are now strangely compelling. So here is how to keep up with \u201cfast change technology\u201d: After purchasing the doohickey, try and break it. Not just within the 30-second warranty, but before you ever get it out of the store. Share the unboxing experience with the employees and fellow customers. Let them review how the titanium-alloy case was strangely cracked during shipping. Then break it. No, not the easy rage-fling that will come impulsively after it stops doing the thing you rely on because the latest patch broke that function, but go through the process of everything you\u2019re going to use that thingamajig for while you\u2019re still next to the fool who sold you that shiny piece of [gear]. They\u2019re on the hook for walking you through the basic functions. Pretend your thumbs are fatter than normal.Push the Big Red Button \u201cby mistake.\u201dSee if you can get the blender to connect to the printer, like the 11th bullet point on the box says that it can. Who cares if you\u2019ll ever use it, you just want to see if it\u2019ll actually do what it was advertised to do. That\u2019s going to tell you all about the disconnect between the company\u2019s engineering group, the manufacturing division, the marketing department and their customer service section. The relationship will likely graph out like a ball of moldy spaghetti, and this will help in the next step:Lower your expectations. Sliced bread is still the greatest thing, and despite releasing several models of bread since then, none of them actually taste like divine ambrosia while burning body fat and curing cancer. Such a disappointment. Sell the bread stock immediately.Don\u2019t read the comments section.Realize the same frothy idiots who criticize the lemmings buying into the technology of Company A have a death grip on what is actually the best-selling gadget in the world\u2026 made by Company S. Realize that critique goes both ways\u2026 and that not all opinions are created equal. Then sit back and consider that these tribal collections are simply an evolution of the same imbeciles that put a sticker of Calvin whizzing on the logo of Company F while they\u2019re driving a vehicle made by Company C. Be especially aware of those who adorn their vehicle with a corresponding Calvin sticker instead: they either have a self-aware sense of irony and should be embraced, or they\u2019re Darwin Award Candidates and you should immediately seek minimum safe distance. To all my fellows who are past their warranty date, I salute you and wish you luck. ",

            "answer_text": "I started on mainframe computers in 1973 and even played with the Altair 8800, one of the first microcomputers. I witnessed, first-hand all the changes in technology playing with the early versions of the Internet (we had to guess at the URL), programmed in FORTRAN, COBOL, GW-BASIC, using DOS and CP/M based computers as well as working in machine language on some of the earlier chips such as the Intel 80286 chip. One of the first word processors called, WordStar, worked off of a 360 Kb floppy disk and back then, tight coding was critical, unlike the bloatware we see today. My email address was one of the first beta testers for Gmail, where one had to be invited to join. I\u2019ve kept up with technology quite well over the years, including robotics, CAD/CAM and electronic keyboards. But, we also know how to take care of the \u2018analog\u2019 world as well as the digital world. As Mr. Nest discussed, part of our training when we were younger included basic home repair. I don\u2019t need to call a plumber or electrician if I need most work done, as I do it on my own. I was hanging doors and windows, roofing, soldering copper pipes, painting, putting up drywall, etc. when I was 12 years of age. We did not have time for video games which did not exist anyway but were motivated to make our summer jobs as students count to buy that 10-speed bicycle we had our eye on or the latest hockey equipment. No, I did not have computers in high school. We used slide rules for complex maths problems. We never worried about them getting hacked or the batteries running down. Up until recently, slide rules were still being used for calculating artillery shots.  ",

            "answer_text": "If an older person wants to keep up with the changing technological world, then they do it the same way a younger person does - by continuing interest in, and learning about, everything they can. As someone who started typing in the early days of electric typewriters, then electronic ones, then computers (early 80s), I\u2019ve always been up to date with what is going on there and can still sort out most problems; I have had a smart phone for years and use a tablet almost daily. But, without an interest in technology - or the necessity to use it - what would be the point of spending time keeping up with what is going on? I have a contemporary friend who doesn\u2019t own a computer; I have others who are a whizz with all things technological. I have friends with smart phones and others who still use the basic models and do no more than send texts. We are all different - I have always been interested in knowing how things work, many are not. So, we oldies can usually find a way to keep up if we want to - or accept technology that others use. Speaking personally, I would hate to have a driverless car - there are others who would love it; the technology is nearly there - but I wouldn\u2019t want to be involved. So it\u2019s horses for courses - those that are interested will keep up - those that are not, will stay at whatever stage they decided enough was enough! And good luck to them! ",

Those that refuse or who can\u2019t for psychological reasons, learn to accept, adapt, and use the new technological advances, will be left on the outside. and in the past 40 years, I have met many like that.

            "answer_text": "Boy, this should make question of the day if Quora had such a thing. The answer, I think, is no one does. Children are given technology very early these days. I gave my grandchildren computers almost before they could talk and told my daughters to let the kids destroy them. That started 30 years ago. These kids now have absolutely no fear of computer technology. On the other hand, they know very little history. They know almost nothing about how hard our ancestors worked and how much they sacrificed for this good life we now can enjoy if we set our minds to it. We use two buttons on a device that has 20, the TV remote. Why do they put so many knobs on a window? Samsung sold me a lovely TV 10 years ago. I surf with the multibutton device to do what I do most with the TV; a small round object the size of an ashtray (whatever that is) with two buttons: on-off, I use change stations and it looks lovely on the coffee table. What sort of genius thought that up? What do you as an older person want to do? What are your goals in this age of magic manifest? Can you align those goals with any of this modern stuff. Your kids can give you a good overview and it will be worth a lot if you pay attention. You can actually take classes in most adult schools (and meet other cool people at the same time). You have to be able to look into the mirror and see a hero instead of a coward. That is important. ",

So age doesn't mean much anymore. Gone are the days when you hit 50 you might as well buy a rocking chair and rock your days away. All that is needed to teach someone is to talk with them at their level of understanding. I taught little old ladies how to set up their first computer when they were in their 60s. Several wrote books, got online, and became active online for the first time in their lives. Those \u201colder\u201d people are the ones who made that technology today's generation enjoys possible in the first place. They laid the foundations of all that. They/we understand more than you think. ",

No one can do that. There is no magic shift that happens to someone with age alone, that causes them to regress in ability to deal with change. What can cause it to appear that way, is that lots of people who have been around longer than you, and who aren\u2019t insanely rich, have and use older still working technologies, because they do still work. Only the very rich can afford to update everything as soon as a new device comes out. Therefore lots of people older than you use old tech, because they have no need to use what you are using. At least not as soon as you think they should. ",

We don\u2019t need to have our lives directed by technology, all we need to do is to ensure that we understand from a usability stand point, those areas of technology that are complementary to our way of life whatever we choose that life to be. For instance - using the telephone for communication and not necessarily all the other functions that often force themselves on you. That is easy enough to manage for anyone.using the computer for those things which add to your way of life - online shopping , email, bill payment, basic banking \u2026using services like Amazon to facilitate your life eg self-publishingetc\u2026These are the technology services that I use and I do so quite efficiently. I think that if seniors apply the kind of attitude to technology as I do i.e. use what you need for a more efficient living and ignore the rest - do not let your life be driven by every new and hot tekky device - then no problem. I do watch technology shows, I find them intriguing but my life is not driven by them. Doreen ",

I am an inventor with new ideas but what everyone wants is a product you can put online for sale and make a bunch of money. Business today reminds me of a farmer who keeps growing the crop that produces the most money with no thought to maintaining his ground for the future. The people who evaluate my ideas do not really understand the technology and their company or organization does not want to spend the time required to build the marketing mechanism. The computer is a wonderful tool but, once everyone has one and knows how to use it, you no longer need the experts.
