            "answer_text": "The value of publicly traded companies is basically based on how much someone is willing to pay for shares in that company, it\u2019s got very little, if anything, to do with profit. Take Twitter, they lost money for 10 years straight, but the company was still worth something because people were willing to buy shares in Twitter. Apple is worth more than Samsung because the stock market says it is, and they say it is, because shares in Apple will sell at a certain value, and shares in Samsung will sell at a certain value. Think about it this way, say I own a company making computers, I offer to sell you 10% of the company for $10. You\u2019ll probably accept because the risk of losing $10 probably doesn\u2019t mean much to you. OK, say I offer to sell that 10% to you for $10,000, you\u2019ll probably decline because the risk is too great. That\u2019s basically what share prices are, somewhere between $10 and $10,000 we\u2019ll find a number which you\u2019re willing to pay, but not a cent more. However, let\u2019s say the number is $500, but another person comes along and offers $501, then you\u2019d need to raise your offer to $501 to compete with the new offer. The value of Apple, and the value of Samsung is based purely on what people are willing to pay for stock in each company. What people are willing to pay basically depends on your optimism for the future increase in price of a share. Say in six months, do you think Apple will be worth more than it is now? Or less? That will dictate how much you\u2019re willing to pay for a share. Going back to my fictional computer company, maybe you\u2019re willing to pay $510 for that 10%, not because you think it\u2019s worth it, but because you reckon you\u2019ll be able to sell it for $520 in 6 months time. So back to Apple and Samsung, Apple is worth more because people think the price will go up, more so than they think Samsung will go up. Or at least prefer the risk of buying Apple stock to the risk of buying Samsung stock. ",

            "answer_text": " Photo credit: istockphoto.com Samsung has been raking in the money with their mobile phones, while the sales for Apple iPhone is doing just fine. Based on this premise, it can be said that Apple is running second to the Korean tech company. However, in terms of market share and profitability, Apple has left its competition behind. Apple had its fair share of ups and downs when it comes to their mobile phones, but this did not stop people from lining up in Apple Stores for hours just to grab the latest model. There are a few reasons why Apple is deemed more valuable and these are: It has been a trusted brand by many smartphone users who are looking for a secure device to use.It has overtaken Samsung in terms of mobile phones sold.The company is more stable with its continuous rise in the market evident with its year end financial reports.Constant release of innovative products leads to more demand for their products.Apple\u2019s increasing cash flow lets them return capital to stakeholders.Smartphone shares of Apple is going up even amidst the pandemic.The company announced that they will be investing in the US to create more jobs.These are just a few reasons why many stakeholders are leaning towards investing on Apple because they are consistently producing innovations that the world needs. And because of the loyal fan base that they have created with their Apple iPhone as well as Macbook, they still have a hold on the market even if Samsung has been reported to ship out more phones that its competitor. The competition between the two will not die down anytime soon, but it appears that Apple has made a huge gap between it and the rest of its competition out there in terms of value based on what experts have been saying. Time will only tell if Apple will be able to continue this climb and whether they will be able to retain the interests of their customers and stakeholders in the long run. ",
