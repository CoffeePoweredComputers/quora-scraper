            "answer_text": "Instagram is an amazing platform to share photos and videos with friends, family, and the rest of the world, also you can share your work or make your personal brand. It is a wonderful way to discover great contents from around the world. But it could also cause privacy and security risks.   Here we are going to mention some essential steps to achieve Instagram security and avoid getting hacked or privacy issues: 1. Go private It lets you share your photos and videos with a selected group of people and hides your content from the rest of Instagram users. So the only people who can see your page, are people that you care about them. Once you activate this option, new contacts have to send you a follow request if they want to follow you. 2. Turn on Two-Factor authentication   Are you always worried about someone logging to your account and reaches your content? If yes, follow my lead. Two-factor authentication sends you a text message with an authentication code every time you or someone else logs in to Instagram on a new device. 3.Report suspicious accounts If someone is irritating you or posting inappropriate content, report it to Instagram. Just tap the three-dot icon on the top right of an Instagram post or bottom right of a story, or swipe left on a comment and tap the exclamation point icon. If Instagram finds that account violating term, it will turn the account down. 4. Don\u2019t let third-party apps to access your account Be careful about using third-party apps. But it doesn\u2019t mean to avoid using all of them, so it provides to do a lot of research before using them. For security and privacy matters, you should only allow access to trustworthy apps.   Doing all that mentioned will highly help you to keep your account safe and secure. Good luck! Source: How to secure your Instagram account? ",

            "answer_text": "Of course yes!!  Sitting in a coffee shop, I and my co-workers were discussing about some social media platforms. All of a sudden, the waiter serving us said- Yes, Instagram is one of the safest platforms than any other. Going with the flow, he added- \" Instagram is much better than Facebook in terms of security, because if your account is private then except your followers, no one can visit your profile, unlike Facebook. What I mean by telling this incidence is- Instagram is such a safest platform, that even if you are not a pro in this field, you can feel the safety. Let us check the list of features, this social app has introduced to secure your account: Two-Factor Authentication: By including this security feature, you need a second form of authentication to access your account. Hence a hacker can't access your account without physical access to your connected device, even if they have your password.Instagram checkpoint: This normally occurs when you access your account from any unusual geographical location or allow any third party or bot to access your account for likes, comments, etc.Account privacy: This security setting was provided by Instagram to help their users for keeping their accounts private if they wish to interact only with the people they actually know.Block, Restrict, or Report Accounts: By this security setting, you can block or even report those who are harassing you or posting inappropriate content.",
