            "answer_text": "I agree that it has sped up the pace of communicating globally, but it is not actually doing a lot to speed up globalization as such. The red tape involved in operating a business across global borders is still there, and in some ways, not a lot easier than 10 years ago. For instance, if you want to trade real physical products across borders (not software based that can be spread easily over the internet) the same barriers to entry exist with customs, tariffs (which are not getting any easier with Trump in power in US) etc. In each country the importer of record still needs to carry liability insurances etc, and then there are the taxes involved across borders and navigating double tax agreements etc. In a lot of ways, technology has helped, but I don\u2019t think it has made it much easier - you still have governments to deal with who are hell bent on protecting the businesses running withing their borders and their respective tax bases (arguably rightly so). The only thing that I can see that would overcome this is a one world currency and one world government to open up these artificial borders (which I am sure will happen, but maybe not in my lifetime).
