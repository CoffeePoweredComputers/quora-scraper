Personality of any person does not mean the clothing, that most people thought to be. But there are many aspects of personality. Again here, I am not talking about the bookish things that you will read. The real things that would get noticed in one\u2019s personality. I will one by one judge those factors Appearance. Yes the fist thing that get noticed in anyone and judged is the cloths we wear, how we look, shape of the body, cleanliness. As clear as it seems, You get dressed well in party, bride suppose to be the most beautiful. Thus, appearance matters a lot to get one\u2019s attention. Communication. The way one speak is the second most important thing that gets noticed. Communication means how you say something, how you greet someone, how you affirm someone and you express your feelings. The moment you open your mouth, the listener starts noticing you. Yes, what you speak might be the next thing that gets noticed in someone, before it how you deliver what you want to say is that matters. Thoughts. The other major thing that may get you rejected or accepted by any group is what you thought about a particular topic. So, this will help you build an image in front of others and can also make a distance between you and others. So pay attention what you think. These are some of the things that needs attention with respect to your personality that must be paid attention to. These will definitely help you out to reach somewhere in your career and also in the personal and professional life. ",

That would be more of a question to ask a therapist or someone who knows you very well.  Although personality is very well established by about 7 years old, I believe that we can change and grow our personalities over the course of our lifetimes if we are honest, open-minded and willing.  What is helpful to doing this is being self aware about our issues and short-comings and then actively working on them.  For instance, if you know that you are not a naturally giving person, make the commitment to do some volunteer work for 3 months.  New experiences open doors and promote change!  In large part, we are what we do.  And when we step out of our \"comfort zone\", we can grow and change.   ",

When you start exploring that, authentically and congruently, you will start to change.  The question of whether you need to is not something that another person can answer - and it is a transfer of accountability to expect others to tell you whether you should. I encourage you to find the answer to this by asking yourself whether you are happy in life and/or want to be happier. ",
