            "answer_text": "INTRODUCTION The media plays a very constructive role in today\u2019s society. Media play an important role in increasing of public awareness and collect the views, information and attitudes toward certain issue. Media is the most powerful tool of communication in emerging world and increased the awareness and presents the realstage of society. In this decade of Knowledge and awareness there is a huge and grand role of media, it isall around us when we watch on Television, listen to on the radio, read to the books, magazines, and newspapers, every where we want to collect some knowledge and information and a part of this media hasto present a very responsible role for our society. Without the media, people in societies would beisolated, not only from the rest of the world, but also for the total formation of creditable world. WHAT IS MEDIA Media is one of the most powerful instruments of communication. It can help to promote the right thingson right time and gives a real as well as strong aspects of the world about what is right or wrong also italso express that how can we store and distributes the views. The world is moving towards progress inevery step of life. But we cannot refuse the real fact that we all are bounded directly or indirectly with theloads of social problems and issues, which are affected by the people of the people and for the people.Social issues or matters include so many types such as poverty, violence, corruption, bribery, suppressionof human rights, rape, discrimination, and crime, killing in the name of honor. Today News Channels, Newspapers, radio, internet etc. help us to estimate the realities of live and focused on the every socialmatters with the pure and free effect, it has a chance to explore the issues of society more openly.Media refers so many links such as mass media broadcast media, print media and the web media. Weknow that television and radio are considered broadcast media while newspapers, magazines and journalsare formatted as print media and internet news are called as the web media. The media is an importantsource of information through its news segments, entertainment and allows for exchange of our ideas,suggestions and views for related matters. There is huge variety of media. The media is not only animportant source of news and opinions but also entertainment. Most young people usually turn on thetelevision for movies, educational programs other entertainment programs. However, although most of usget our news through the media as many of us have little time to read books or journals, the news             International Journal of Humanities & Social SciencesVol 1 (01) August 2013, [ISBN 978-93-83006-16-8] page http://67-70www.giapjournals.com/ijhss 68 presented to us can be biased and one sided because news reported on websites appears most reliable and transparent though one has to be careful about the accuracy of the facts reported. However, there is still adegree of freedom in these countries' press compared to other more conservative countries. we haveaccess to news from all around the world and readers are invited to send their views and contributions to be published in the media. The term media is derived from Medium, which means carrier. Media denotesa links specifically designed to reach large viewers. The term was first used with the advent of newspapers and magazines. However, with the passage of time, the term broadened by the inventions of radio, TV, cinemas and Internet. In the world of today, media has become almost as necessary as food and clothing. It is true that media is playing an outstanding role in strengthening the society. Its responsibilityis to inform, educate and entertain the people. It helps to know current situation around the world. Themedia has a strong social and cultural impact upon society. Because of its inherent ability to reach largenumber of public, it is widely used to convey message to build public opinion and awareness, it can beused to educate people with very little cost. Imagine a classroom in every city with thousands of students being taught by just one teacher. But unfortunately, because of money-making approach of media and lack of interest by government, very less work is done in spreading the education. IMPORTANCE OF MEDIA IN SOCIAL AWARENESS The media has got a vital role in molding a good society to develop our lifestyle and move it on the right path, because it always try to side with the truth and relevant factor. It is the best tool to spread awareness in the modern society either it be political, social or economic and giving us latest fight about what is happening in our world, making us aware about our rights, creating awareness against evils in our society, what new happening around us, exposing corrupt politicians and hardcore criminals by sting operations. There is correlation between media and society to share them self about the past, present and future event on need base method of the society. We know that a long time ago we see allnews, views events all these things through Radio, Banner and Cinema slide show. But now a day we have a power to see everything of the society and to share it among the people only the good approach of media. So Media and their function have been changed as because there is a competition among the Media also. Therefore apart from the service to the society they have to earn also. From this point of view several media are taking different steps to expand their business and sometimes they are deviated from the principles for which they are functioning. What society will decide for their existences and functioning is mainly depend upon the Govt. rules and regulations by limiting their scope of works in a particular .In my opinion several sensitive international issues should not be published through Media for whichtension among them increased. Otherwise media should come in front of the society with all truth.   The main purpose of this studies to explain the real feature of growing techniques of information and used it to spread the social awareness. Its limitless connectivity and potential has open social order and system of interaction and communication which have been made a possible way to develop the communication technology and define the social situation of awareness. We can feel the impact of social networking in every step of life. Everyone wants information timely and to the point which can be possible through the help of social media. There is various types of social networking under the connectivity of media. Here We explore the FACEBOOK a social networking site, people can assess information easily through the help of this site and user can utilize these information to their personal and professional work and behaviour social networking service which can be focused and reflecting of social network or social relations among people who share interests and activities Most social network services are web based and provide means for users to interact over the internet. They interact, share and exchangeresources by social networks. It promotes free flow of information and sharing of resources beyond http://boundaries.My point is not any of it said above. We had a nation with so much of events happening around, which but is escalated only on the whims and fancy of the people who rules us. Few of the examples are RamMandir issue, Lokpal Bill, 2G scam, CWG scam, Mining scam, Land Acquisition scam, Coal Gate, DelhiRape Case, Godhra Riots, Mumbai Riots, 26/11 Mumbai Attack, Aarushi murder case, LPG subsidy, Fuel price hike etc. All of the above issues had its on relevance in political arena and accordingly had thecoverage and importance across the media and discussed upon the nation till then until when it is to befumed and exploited. Unfortunately none of the news had a chance to be there in limelight or discussionseven until its natural closure of which many are due pending. Shattering fact is that even many of theabove stated issues out of the many left out without mentioning are yet to have a judicial closure and the culprits yet to be booked and penalized. But at the brim of its flash we had all of the print and visual media, administration, intellects, social media and even stupid common man were there on the front to protest, outrage and even ready for a national cessation. Post shelf life of the issue hardly was there any movement on the same until either there is a reference by any for personal gain (other than the relative of the person involved) or on the occasion of anniversary reminder by the media who had to fill in the primetime slot. It is time for us, to do something better for our society. Any means the realism of a fact lies with the complete closure with justice delivered not only to the victim but to the society too. Until unless the limited time outrage and mongering of issue is protracted despite of what we are forced to think and react.May this sound a bit weird as we being responsible-sensible citizens, it is our bona fide birth right to react on anything and everything comes across. But will make a difference if it is made to prolong it despite of the shelf life tag come along with the issue.    ",
