            "answer_text": "Not so bright as of now, but Google never intended to make it mainstream unlike other phone networks. The things holding it back are Lack of family plans with good data usage and low cost. Other carriers have cost-effective plans with high data limits for 4 or more lines.Corporate plans - They have no plans for corporates. If they do, it becomes a double bonanza with increased Pixel phone sales + fi sales. I do know if some companies which offer Pixel instead of iPhones for their employeesCost effective data plans for those who want higher data usage.Ability to use other phones on Fi. It would have been more popular if other unlocked Android phones, say from Motorola & OnePlus could sign up for Fi. I know they would have problems switching between GSM & CDMA networks.I really hope Google comes up with some plans to make it more popular. ",

            "answer_text": "What is the future of Google's Project FI MVNO carrier service? Hopefully it's something like the following: Lower data costs. Currently each gigabyte of mobile data costs $10, or $1 per 100mb. I'd like to see it closer to $5 per GB.The addition of Verizon to it\u2019s umbrella of networks.More precise control over family plans use of data, text, voice.More realistically I believe no large changes will happen soon. Project Fi is basically Google voice with more modern features and carrier network support. Google has done a good job listening to its community of loyal users and has added many useful features. They will continue a slow progression of these additional features until it eventually grows into it's own entity or fizzles out completely. Either way, Project Fi has helped reshape the carrier community and hopefully will continue to do so. If Verizon was part of Fi, you'd see a very large migration to the project. Fingers crossed. ",
