            "answer_text": "There isn\u2019t an easy answer to this question. Something that is popular today, may not be popular tomorrow.  The best advice I can offer you is to learn how to properly source products. A product sourcing tool like Algopix is great for this at it will show you a product\u2019s demand level, competition, profit and expenses, how established your competition is, and other important metrics.  This data will help you weed out bad products and determine which ones are actually worth pursuing.  As a general rule of thumb, any products you sell should be:  - High quality to minimize returns - Consumable if you want return customers (think body products, creams, etc.) - Year long products. Avoid anything overly seasonal unless you want to sit on dead stock - Small and light if you want to reduce shipping costs - Easy to source from suppliers. Product shortages can lead to you losing your competitive edge.  Product sourcing is one of the most important steps an eCommerce store can master. If you can source profitable products for cheap, you can make a lot of profit and grow your store. ",
