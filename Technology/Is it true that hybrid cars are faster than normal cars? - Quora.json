            "answer_text": "I\u2019m Sorry, but I have to laugh at this question: Faster in what way? Acceleration? Top Speed? Socially? Lol Some Background Information: A Hybrid uses an Electric motor, in conjunction with a small internal combustion engine (ICE). The braking forces are transferred back through the electric motor and it generates electricity to charge the batteries. It is referred to as \u2018regenerative braking\u2019! Only a hybrid with an AC electric motor is capable of doing this. So, the Hybrid has a battery, but it doesn\u2019t need to be charged. Although, there are \u2018Plug-In\u2019 hybrids available. Under Normal driving and operating conditions the hybrid automatically maintains the charge in the battery. Most Hybrids are not the plug-in variety. The idea behind a Hybrid is that it is a very efficient Automobile, and the average Miles Per gallon ratings are usually very high, with some as high as 60 miles per gallon. That is a vast improvement over normal ICE Autos of the same size and class. Now, As far as Speed is concerned; You, or Anyone, should Not expect a Hybrid to be Any \u201cfaster\u201d than any other Auto of the same Size and Class. A Hybrid is very frugal with Petro(gas). If you\u2019re looking for an Auto with quick acceleration and high speed capabilities, a Hybrid will Not fit those requirements! If you have, \u201cthe need for Speed\u201d, You might want to look into a Sports Car, from Any number of regular, ICE Auto manufacturers. Or, You could go with an All Electric EV, from a company such as Tesla Motors. They have EVs with very quick acceleration and top speeds equivalent to, or in many cases, faster than ICE sports cars. A Tesla Roadster can do 0\u201360 in under 4 seconds. That is \u201cneck throwing\u201d, \u201cg-force\u201d throttling speed. In fact, All Teslas Autos are capable of \u201cInsane\u201d and \u201cLudicrous\u201d modes via the built-in software, in the central computer. These modes give the driver the fastest possible acceleration, but it does take a toll on the components. I.e. After each, Insane or Ludicrous mode, period of driving, the Car warns that it must \u201crest\u201d in order for the batteries and other components to Cool down! If you fail to give the car the \u201crest\u201d it requires it automatically switches to the slowest acceleration, and slowest speed modes, and that cannot be bipassed, by the driver. The Auto has built-in safety and prevention measures which are not able to overriden by the driver/ user! The car will protect itself and the driver automatically, without intervention by the driver. Cool, Right?? ",

            "answer_text": "As the number of problems facing the environment grows bigger, many car manufacturers started to shift to electric and hybrid cars. Does a hybrid power train make a car faster? It depends There are many types of hybrid power trains the one that many cars use is having a normal internal combustion engine with a small electric motor working together like in a Toyota PriusIn other cars, you can find that it is only powered by electric motors but it has a gasoline engine as a rage extender to only recharge the batteries and not to drive the wheels like in the Fisker karma The main reason why manufacturers started to use hybrid power trains is because they provide more power without the need for a big fuel-drinking engine. For speed, many people confuse being fast with being quick. Most hybrid cars are quick because the electric motors help in filling the power gaps that the normal engine would have during gearshifts for example. There are many fast hybrid cars out there but they are not fast because they are hybrid but because they have a huge amount of power like the Ferrari LaFerrari.  So, no, having a hybrid power train doesn\u2019t necessarily make a car faster than a equivalent car with a normal power train ",
