            "answer_text": "No. It's not 'constable on patrol'. Like many such words it comes from eighteenth century thieves cant. It is short for 'copper'. In this case not the metal, but one who 'cops' thieves. 'Cop' is a variant of 'cap' - probably a Scottish pronunciation in the same way as Scots say 'mon' for 'man'. In the same way as you shut the contents of a bottle in by capping it, if you 'cap' a thief you lock him up. So a 'copper' caught thieves and locked them up. This is long before the modern police force was invented. ",

            "answer_text": "Always, always, be skeptical of popular explanations for words which involve acronyms. S\u2014t, f\u2014k, and cop are very probably not based on acronyms, because until the modern age most of the public didn\u2019t read or write, and so they wouldn\u2019t know how letters formed them into words. There are few acronyms which are pronounced as such until the early 20th century. It was always my assumption that because police wear shiny copper badges, cop is a short form of the word. Though it\u2019s possible as well that the verb cop, to grab or seize, is an alternate or additional origin. ",
