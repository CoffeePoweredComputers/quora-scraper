            "answer_text": "This is a really good question, and one that I really wish school managers and teachers considered before investing in modern technology. As a Schools Inspector, I have visited many classrooms where demonstrably this question had never been asked. Several schools had invested significantly in interactive whiteboards, wireless networks, sometimes suites of notebooks or laptops. However, the way they were used (or not) in observed lessons often showed that little thought had been given to integration. Too often interactive whiteboards were simply used as projectors. The word \u201cinteractive\u201d appeared to have been ignored. In one lesson I think the IWB was switched on just to prove the teacher had one: in an English lesson, the IWB displayed a page from a History site - which was then left on until the end of the lesson. So, how do I integrate modern technology? It has to fit a purpose. I do a lot of student presentations: we use Prezi ( in my experience it's easier to follow \u201ccontent is king\u201d using Prezi as a platform rather than PowerPoint: students tend to spend too much time working on appearance and design of using PPT as a presentation tool.) President allows the students to embrace the \u201cinteractive\u201d nature of the IWB. I operate a \u201cphones out\u201d classroom, and we have a class Twitter account that is permanently on display during my lessons. Students are free to tweet questions and comments during the lesson, which allows us as a class to address concerns. I also use Twitter for classroom debate and hot-seats. Using a lesson-specific hashtag, students can tweet challenges and questions to speakers: this enables especially those who are nervous about speaking out to have a voice. I publish the list of tweets at the end of each debate - it serves as a useful summary. The above section on Twitter comes back to the HOW in the question. Many teachers would be nervous about a \u201cphones out\u201d policy and my Twitter use: what if the students abuse this facility? How do I know that students are not accessing other sites? What if a student posts inappropriate material or teeets? If technology is carefully integrated, and its integration planned, these cease to be problems and become teaching opportunities. A phones policy needs to be clear, and students need to know what is appropriate. Any breach of the code must be immediately acted on - usually through revocation of phone privileges, and inflammatory postings or inappropriate internet access dealt with as a whole-school issue through existing procedures. I\u2019ve only had to apply sanctions a handful of times, and only in the first weeks. Another way is through the use of Edmodo - Edmodo - (other virtual classrooms are available.) I started by using Moodle, but found it non-student friendly (although very well-featured.) Edmodo is simpler, and more intuitive. It is also free. All my classes have an Edmodo classroom, where I post homework assignments but also interesting articles and issues for later class discussion. Students are also able to post; in my English Language A-Level classes this is a requirement. Before each lesson, one student is nominated to find an example of language use that we will discuss as a starter in the lesson. Sometimes this takes up the lesson itself! As teacher, I have complete editorial control, and can delete comments and block users for inappropriate behaviour. Again, this has rarely been necessary. Edmodo also has my mark book (I\u2019ve not used a paper mark book for 20 years, moving from PDAs to web-based.) The great thing about Edmodo is that students have access to their and only their) record of marks - and I can give parental (non-posting) access to this too, as well as to my homework posts and comments on their child\u2019s work. This post is becoming TL: apologies. I could write about Ted-Ed, Google Scholar, Fakebook (sic: Fakebook) - but I\u2019ve moved from \u201chow?\u201d to \u201cwhat?\u201d, and therefore from the question. The answer is - carefully and with careful planning, not by trying to bolt it on or thinking that throwing money at it will help. It won\u2019t. The most successful school (in this area) that I have inspected had just fully rolled out a whole-school modern technology initiative which had taken a well-planned 2 years to implement. The major focus was on staff and student training - and, as important, \u201cbuy-in\u201d from all the school\u2019s publics. By the end of the process, all staff were comfortable with using ICT as a classroom tool on a day-to-day basis; parents knew how to access and integrate with the intranet, and students took on board the BYOD policy with enthusiasm. Modern technology is a tool, not a panacea. Integration is vital if ICT is to be used effectively. As so often, the \u201c5Ps\u201d are essential! ",

            "answer_text": "Very unfortunately, the public community college where I teach has tended to invest limited resources in equipping a few classrooms with a lot of bells and whistles that most people don\u2019t know how to use, rather than just simple laptop projection with internet connection for every single classroom. I now feel very frustrated when assigned to a classroom that doesn\u2019t have a projector. In the past two years, I have come to accept and even encourage students to use their smart phones to access the internet in class, and I\u2019m gradually coming to rely on this. I can now sometimes offer students the choice of using an online version of the textbook as an alternative to the more expensive options of buying or renting, as long as they have a digital device with which to access it in class. I\u2019m looking forward to a time when I can count on everybody having a digital device to use, which will mean a de facto computer classroom. However, not all my students can afford these items, and the school can\u2019t afford to provide them. ",
