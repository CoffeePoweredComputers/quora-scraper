            "answer_text": "I could be wrong, but I don\u2019t think laptop screens are standardized enough in their electrical and logical interfaces that you can just hook anything up to them. There might be some other level of electronics that can be used to interface with your Pi to produce output on the laptop screen. I doubt whether you\u2019ll find much info that documents the internals of a laptop that allows for replacing or extracting much beyond disk drives and memory. ",
