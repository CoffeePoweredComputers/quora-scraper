            "answer_text": "Cloud Computing. Cloud computing is a type of computing that relies on sharing computing resources rather than having local servers or personal devices to handle applications. In cloud computing, the word cloud is used as a metaphor for \"the Internet,\" so the phrase cloud computing means \"a type of Internet-based computing,\" where different services \u2014 such as servers, storage and applications \u2014 are delivered to an organization's computers and devices through the Internet. In its most simple description, cloud computing is taking services (\"cloud services\") and moving them outside an organizations firewall on shared systems. Applications and services are accessed via the Web, instead of your hard drive. The services are delivered and used over the Internet and are paid for by cloud customer (your business), typically on an \"as-needed, pay-per-use\" business model. The cloud infrastructure is maintained by the cloud provider, not the individual cloud customer. Cloud computing has started to obtain mass appeal in corporate data centers as it enables the data center to operate like the Internet through the process of enabling computing resources to be accessed and shared as virtual resources in a secure and scalable manner. For a small and medium size business (SMB), the benefits of cloud computing is currently driving adoption. In the SMB sector there is often a lack of time and financial resources to purchase, deploy and maintain an infrastructure (e.g. the software, server and storage). In cloud computing, small businesses can access these resources and expand or shrink services as business needs change. The common pay-as-you-go subscription model is designed to let SMBs easily add or remove services and you typically will only pay for what you do use. ",

            "answer_text": "Here's a look at several of the \"emerging\" trends in information technology: 1. Blockchain Gains Traction in different sectors 2. Artificial Intelligence spreads a conversational UI. 3. Progressive web apps development 4. Low Code Development accelerates time-to-market. 5. Cloud Computing expanding its models 1. Blockchain Gains Traction in different sectors: In the current era, Blockchain technology exists on the new one. The blockchain is a type of shared record, all network shares share the same documentation as opposed to individual copies. Across global block chains, financial services, medical, government and many other industries, innovators are exploring ways to use the blockchain to disrupt and transform into an established business. 2. Artificial Intelligence spreads a conversational UI: As per research Artificial intelligence, AI and machine learning are advanced technology. This technology uses that a user can interact with via a messaging platform. They handle requests that would normally require a phone call, web search, or mobile app. 3. Progressive web apps: Progressive web apps are an enhancement of existing web technology. These apps are a great website that can behave just like native apps. Its work on any devices and enhancement, progressive with new web technology. 4. Low Code Development accelerates time-to-market: In Application development, Coding part is very time consuming and changing custom-built apps. Low-code development simplifies the process of building software with its drag and drop pre-built features. 5. Cloud Computing expanding its models: Cloud computing evolving in technology every year. Enterprises contain the hybrid and server less cloud structures to support different applications and to lower operational prices. So, who knows what lies ahead? These latest trends will carry through into 2019 and beyond, and they may even generate additional technology advancements that could benefit your business in the future.  ",
