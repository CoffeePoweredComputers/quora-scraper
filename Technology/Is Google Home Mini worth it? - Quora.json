            "answer_text": " This world is moving towards the AI system Hence, from traditional sound system or bluetooth speaker, we are moving towards the smart speakers.. While there are two options currently in the market more specifically for Indian market \u2013 first the Amazon echo and Amazon echo dot and the contrary offer from Google is Google home or Google Home Mini. So here is my review of Google Home Mini after a month of use. Let\u2019s divide this in below points : 1. Build quality : If you compare this with Amazon echo dot then Google is more ahead in terms of build quality. That product is extremely tiny and cute. It has two touch sensitive button to increase or decrease volume and also have motion sensor which will detect your vertical movement of the device and will increase increase, decrease or pause the music. Though there is no audio jack but this device is compatible with bluetooth 4.1 and you can connect your external speakers with bluetooth or even Chromecast works flawlessly with this device. 2. Sound Quality : You just can\u2019t imagine how clear and loud this little speaker is. I mostly use this at 50% volume and that is more than sufficient for a mid size of room. If you are buying this product for media consumption then it will surve purpose. 3. AI System : When is come to AI system Google is the market leader. Starting from playing song ,checking weather, checking the live traffic, booking a cab, order food and even managing your daily to do list, calendars, managing meetings, everything works fine with this Google offering. Now come to the verdict. If you are looking for a smart speaker then this Google Mini is a better choice over Amazon Eco dot and same goes for Google home which is better offer over Amazon Eco. Also for Google home you can choose from 3 classic colours \u2013 white , grey and red one. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes. Whether you buy it on discount or at full price for $49, the price-to-value ratio is extremely high. Many users notice that they start using the devices for unexpected tasks beyond what they expected. The number one value is convenience: It is faster to do little tasks like convert measurements for cooking, setting a timer or adding an item to a list.It provides rapid access to information such as weather, traffic and general knowledge. In many instances this means you have no need to open your smartphone.It can connect to entertainment and smart home devices.You can listen to audio content and get better audio quality by connecting to another speaker if necessary.You can play games individually or as a group. My daughter enjoys playing lucky trivia with me. Whereas smartphones are solo use devices, smart speakers get everyone involved and become social devices in the home.The devices save time and enabled access to computing eyes free, hands free. It is hard to understand how useful this becomes until you have the opportunity to live with the capability for awhile. And, the capabilities are expanding on a monthly basis. This week, routines were added for example and last week notifications and new media control capabilities. Is it worth it? To me, it is worth it for the time savings alone. However, I value it for the other things you can do with Google Assistant even more. ",
