            "answer_text": "Hello Humans (we) have done some great things for our planet. Here are just a few examples: There are more trees today than there have ever been in the history of the planet. How so? Because we plants trees, lots of them. If we cut them down, we replant them.We fight forest fires. Before humans had the ability to fight them, millions of acres would burn, sometimes entire areas the size of states would burn - unrestricted. By clearing old, dry underbrush we prevent fires that would otherwise burn naturally and destroy millions of acres of land.We convert unliveable areas to areas beneficial for wildlife. An oceanic example would be sinking old train cars to create artificial reefs for sea life. This creates an environment where sea life can thrive more than if we hadn\u2019t done it.We have saved hundreds of animal species from dying out completely due to natural factors. The merits of this can be debated as some believe we should let natural selection happen as its supposed to, others argue we have a duty to save these species.Now of course one can easily bring up things like pollution or mining but have we really impacted the planet in any meaningful way or moreso than what it has experienced by means of natural phenomena during its nearly 5 billion year history? Nope. Think of what this planet has gone through in its history long before humans ever appeared: Mountain ranges thrusting up, eroding away, cometary impacts, worldwide fires, worldwide floods, volcano eruptions, the shifting of the magnetic poles, oceans rising and falling, whole continents moving, colliding, buckling to make mountains over millions of years. Do you think a plastic straw has any influence on the planet as a whole? C\u2019mon. We influence human civilization more than we impact THE PLANET. Our Earth barely even knows we\u2019re here; it continues to do what it has done for hundred of millions of years whether we are here or not - whether we drive to work or ride a bicycle - whether we burn coal or not. Oh about that - \u201cfossil fuel\u201d. Ever think of what that term means? It means that it came from the ground (fossil). Meaning it is 100% organic. Petroleum is made from the compression of land and baking from solar radiation of old vegetation and animal life (not just dinosaurs as we heard as kids). Again - 100% organic. CO2 - 100% organic and the #1 substance responsible for ALL on this planet. We humans are \u201ccarbon based\u201d life forms. To think C02 somehow harms the planet is ridiculous. Our planet thrives on CO2 - it actually LOVES it. Now, can humans pollute our air and water? You betcha. But affect the climate? Uh, no. Worry about cleaning up that local river or lake, or using less waste and recycling. But don\u2019t give a second thought to your \u201ccarbon footprint\u201d. The planet loves the stuff. ",

            "answer_text": "That's a very different question to answer, because it depends on.positive for whom, and within what timespan and space. For example, if you switch on. your air conditioner, you're improving the environment for you, in that room, at that time. Other creatures or plants in the room might have preferred it hotter (or damper). You're also heating up the air outside, which might not be so great for people and things close to the extraction unit. Your air con demands energy, which probably leads to carbon emissions, which make the environment worse for you and for most other species. The most \u201cpositive\u201d thing any species can do in a functioning, balanced ecosystem, is to eat what it wants, reproduce as much as it wants. At some point in prehistory, when we were running around the African plains picking berries, hunting antelope and catching diseases, before we discovered so many ways to radically alter our environment, this was true of humans. Today, though, very few ecosystems, from local up to global, are in a state of equilibrium. Because of changes created by humans, they are in the process of changing, usually in ways that are negative for most of the species in them and for humans (because, much as we might like to ignore the fact, these ecosystems are what keeps the planet liveable for humans. Most of the \u201cpositive\" modifications we do to nature that aren't directly self-serving are attempts to rebalance ecosystems that have been unbalanced by human activity (e.g. by culling invasive species that are crowding out indigenous species). This maybe helps to slow the global environment's rapid trajectory towards being unliveable for humans. So keep protecting biodiversity and the climate, and care how the things you do to make your life temporarily better affect other people and species, even far away. ",
