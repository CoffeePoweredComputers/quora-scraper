            "answer_text": "The idea of natural selection is that changes occur somewhat randomly in any species and those that provide significant survival or reproductive value tend to become more common in that species, ultimately resulting in a variant of the species that is better suited to its environment (and, potentially, resulting in a new species). Note that Darwin\u2019s famous book was titled \u201cThe Origin of Species.\u201d If those changes don\u2019t provide a survival value they may remain or may die out if they provide a survival disadvantage. Such random changes occur naturally during the gestation of a new offspring. They can occur for many different reasons, some of which are just random (which offspring ends up with the father\u2019s red hair and which one ends up with the mother\u2019s brown hair, for example). These changes can also occur because of what the mother happened to be eating or doing at a key point in the offspring\u2019s gestation or even a random strike by a cosmic ray at a particular moment in the offspring\u2019s gestation. This is why individuals born of the same mother are usually not identical. Occasionally an albino tiger is born, or occasionally a human is born with an extra finger on each hand, or some other variation (some minor, some more notable). This great and ongoing diversity is what enables a species to adapt to new conditions and, over a long period of time (50000 years or more, typically) a new species may evolve out of the process. A note on species. There are typically many variants of any species of living animal or plant. They are only said to be of different species when they are different enough that they cannot produce fertile offspring. More on this, below. Let\u2019s consider that albino tiger. It is white in color due to some slight difference in its DNA, when compared with its non-albino siblings. When that tiger mates, it might pass on that DNA difference and, thus, produce albino offspring, especially if it mates with another albino, which it might be more inclined to do if it can find one. If that albino characteristic has no particular survival advantage, then perhaps the albino strain dies out because the other tigers don\u2019t particularly want to mate with it. Or perhaps, if the tigers live in a relatively warm area such as Vietnam, the white albinos stand out more starkly and are, thus, more likely to be attacked by predators. Or it is harder for them to sneak up on prey, so they don\u2019t tend to get as much food and thus tend to be weaker. On the other hand, suppose that albino tiger lives in Siberia and that albino characteristic means the tiger is safer from predators in winter because its white coat enables it to hide more effectively in the snow. Or perhaps the white coat simply enables it to sneak up on prey more effectively, thus it is more likely to survive a harsh winter. Either way, the albino tiger has a survival advantage over other tigers and over time you end up with a lot of albino tigers in Siberia. Now albino tigers are not a different species of tiger, they are just a different variant or, if you will, a different race (different color but few other significant differences). Biologically speaking, two individual living creatures are of the same species if they can mate, produce offspring, and those offspring are fertile. Thus, for example, humans of any race can mate and reproduce and produce fertile offspring, so we are all members of the same species. But each variant (race, if you will) has a few different characteristics. Black people, for example, are of a variant that is better suited to survival in Africa due to the intense sunshine and the presence of malaria (which certain genetic features may help them to survive). They tend to have thinner and more nimble body structures, which are good for expelling the excessive heat they encounter. Caucasian people are better suited to the colder, northern climates. They tend to be more thick and compact in build and to have white skin that absorbs vitamin D more effectively. This helps them survive in the cold weather and the weaker amount of sunlight. A note on race as a variant characteristic. There are many characteristics other than race that can be used to distinguish variants of humans. Among them are hair color, height, eye color, skill at mathematics, ability to sing well, skill at some athletic activity, and on and on and on. Biologists and anthropologists do not consider any of these (including race) to be a significant factor for differentiating humans because they are all determined by very slight differences in genetic makeup. A new species represents the result of a long chain of variations that slowly but surely results in significant differences. A new species occurs when this long sequence of variations results in differences that are so significant that the two varieties can no longer produce fertile offspring. Biologically speaking, they are members of the same genus but no longer of the same species. When examined at the DNA level, the DNA differences are significant enough that either no offspring can be produced or the offspring that are produced cannot reproduce. Note that this process takes a very long time. A good example is the Equidae family (horses). This includes zebras, donkeys, mules and the many varieties of horses we are familiar with, along with many other species (most of which are now extinct). Consider the mule. It is produced by mating a female horse with a male donkey. Because horses and donkeys are different species (although both in the same genus) (horses and donkeys have different numbers of chromosomes in their DNA, for example), mules cannot reproduce (there are certain rare instances of a female mule reproducing, but this is highly unusual). Natural selection explains the diversity of species on this Earth and the development of new species as conditions change. An example we encounter frequently is the development of new variants and species of bacteria that are not as susceptible to antibiotics. How do these new bacteria develop? There are millions of \u201cconventional\u201d bacteria in the environment and a few variants that are a little different. For centuries, those variants had little or no survival advantage. But then man invented antibiotics and used them to kill off \u201cconventional\u201d bacteria. A few of those that were a little different happened to have a characteristic that enables them to survive the attack by the antibiotics. They are better adapted to the new environment (for example a hospital that uses antibiotics to kill off all the bacteria). With less competition from conventional bacteria (after all, the antibiotics killed them all) the new strain of bacteria reproduces quickly and the next thing you know we have a \u201csuperbug\u201d running rampant in the hospital - a type of bacteria that the antibiotics cannot kill. We humans have helped the evolutionary process by providing the bacteria with a new environment that the conventional bacteria could not survive. Note that many of the modern advances in medicine and biology are based on the concept of evolution by natural selection. It is a theory that is so strongly supported by the scientific evidence that few biologists question it except perhaps to debate some of the arcane details of exactly how it works. ",

            "answer_text": "Dale Thomas' answer sums this up well, I think, but perhaps to help one visualize this process a bit easier, I'd like to share an example that I saw on a documentary. Polar bears have evolved from black bears. Imagine a portion of the black bears' habitat becoming more arctic, like during an ice age. Hunting for food on this now white landscape is more difficult, as the black bears are more conspicuous. One day, a cub is born with the genetic mutation for white fur. This mutation just so happens to make it easier for this cub to catch food, since she blends in with the landscape. This puts her at an advantage since she's more likely to healthier, more robust, than others and when food resources are low, she'd be most likely to survive. When the cub matures and has babies of her own, this mutated gene gets passed on to her cubs, which makes it easier for them to hunt and so on and so forth. This, over time, makes it difficult for the other black bears to compete and eventually as the white bear numbers get higher and dominate the resources, the black bears in that area either die off or migrate to where resources are more plentiful. This now isolates the two populations, and the white bears will continue their divergence to becoming polar bears, while the black bears will continue to thrive in more suitable habitats. The prey in the arctic is very different, with few land animals, and the most plentiful food source comes from the sea. So again, one day a white bear cub is born with a mutation that makes it easier to swim, which then makes it easier to hunt and gives him an advantage over the others, an advantage that he passes on to his offspring and so on. Several mutations like these occur over time until one day those white black bears fully diverge into polar bears and are completely distinct from their black bear cousins. ",
