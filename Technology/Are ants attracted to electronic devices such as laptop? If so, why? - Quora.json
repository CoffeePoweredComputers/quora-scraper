            "answer_text": "Ants are attracted mainly by the food they like. Lots of this food is on people's sticky fingers when they use the laptop. Bits of food are spat out by people using the laptop, and it lands on the keyboard. Keyboards are very difficult to clean due to the gaps between the keys, but ants can fit down them. Ants wonder everywhere looking for food and will eventually stumble upon the laptop. When one ant finds some food, it goes back to the nest with it, laying a trail of feremone as it goes. This attracts other ants to the laptop, each laying its own feremone trail, and before you know it loads of the little things are crawling all over it. In short, I don't think there's any scientific evidence that ants are attracted to electronic devices because of the electromagnetic properties of them. If they are it's only because humans have been handling and covering them in tasty food stuffs. ",

            "answer_text": "I have heard of and seen them build mounds up into ground mounted electrical transformers. The power company line men told me this was a common occurrence, that the ants apparently likes the warmth and maybe the micro vibrations given off by the transformers. The line men weren't too fond of it. made a mess and hazardous to clean out a mound of fireants but the mound could cause overheating and failure. But I've never heard of a laptop attracting ants (unless perhaps you eat a  lot of candy and donuts while working on it.) ",

Certainly no sugar or other easily available food was on the surface of this transformer. There may well be an attraction to either electric or magnetic fields or to micro-vibrations as indicated by some of the other respondents. This might actually hold some potential in controlling ant pests (like the invasion of fire ants in Australia). ",
