            "answer_text": "\"Rust\" is a term that usually applies specifically to the oxidation of iron. Of course, the first requirement is available free oxygen. (Though it should be noted that professional chemists use the phrase \"oxidation reaction\" to mean any chemical reaction that takes electrons away from an atom or molecule and gives them to an electron-deficient component which, like free oxygen, is inclined to receive them. Thus, corrosion of iron by chlorine is also, to chemists, an example of an \"oxidation\" reaction, even though the \"oxidizer\" is chlorine, rather than oxygen.)  However, there is more to chemical reactions than just \"thermodynamics\"... the study of energy balances and \"which way Nature would like to go\" in her journey toward \"equilibrium\". \"Mass transfer\" is the ability of reactants to get together on a bulk large-scale level. Basically, \"mixing\".  And \"kinetics\" is the ability of atoms and molecules to do their little dance and thus split off from, and pair up with, each other on an atomic level. That is where things lke \"ignition\" come in. Paper, wood, and gunpowder all sit there, doing nothing, until someone strikes a match. Also where things like \"catalysts\" come in. There are many chemical reactions that might be able to proceed, chemically, fairly well but, when you first mix them together, nothing much happens. That may often be because the \"kinetics\" (the ability of the reactants to get together on an atomic level and \"do their thing\") are not always favorable. Sometimes what's needed is \"activation energy\" (like a lit match). Other times, there are things like \"catalysts\" that have a way of changing the rules... making reactions far more easy to occur than they would be without them. Enzymes in your body are good at that.  Take iron rusting, for example. People often think that \"water makes iron rust\". So it would seem. But if you take a nail made of plain-carbon steel (very subject to oxidation) and you plunk it in a jar of distilled (ultra-pure) water, it will sit there for days, staring back at you, with no notable rust. What actually causes the red stuff is oxygen. Rust is iron oxide. But this reaction is, at room temperature and atmospheric conditions, incredibly slow. The initial oxide that forms coats the outer layer of iron, and slows down the rate at which the rest of the iron reacts. In a cool, dry environment, an iron implement (say, like that fancy dagger made of meteoric iron, found in King Tut's artifacts in Egypt), can sit for thousands of years with very little rust occurring.  Why does water help rust? Because natural water sources usually contain salts and other chemicals, at least traces of them (even in the freshest natural sources) that react with iron atoms at the surface, permitting the oxidation reaction to get started and keep going. A wee little bit of sodium chloride in water (far less than you'd ever taste... a few ppm, instead of the 35,000 ppm that's in sea water), will be enough to turn a nail rusty in a few days. And the thing about red iron oxide is, unlike many other metal oxides, it flakes off. The oxidized iron takes up less space than the original iron metal. This permits more metal to oxidize and flake off, which in turn keeps the rusting going. Aluminum, magnesium, zinc and even \"stainless steel\" all \"oxidize\", just like ordinary steel does. But they form an \"adhering oxide\" layer that then blocks atmospheric oxygen from getting to the metal underneath it.  Upswing is... for rust to occur, there must be iron (of course) and free oxygen (which we've got... 20% of the atmosphere). But for it to happen in any reasonable time frame, there should also be electrolytes (like salt) in the water, or some other reactants present, that will make the reactions go at a reasonable rate. Otherwise, like a chunk of wood in the fireplace without a match or kindling (that, given a chance, would burn, but can't get started), it will just sit there for a long, long time... doing nothing.

            "answer_text": "Rust is also known as hydrated iron (I I I) oxide. For rust to form we need specific conditions which are water and oxygen. When iron metal is exposed in an environment with constant supply of oxygen and water rusting occurs. There are other factors which increases the rate of rusting. One of them is salt, that why as a scientist I could avoid washing my vehicle using sea water due to the presence of sodium chloride in the waters . Rusting could be prevented by use of various methods including galvanising , sacrificial layer protection, alloying iron metal with another metal, electroplating e.t.c. Some tend to confuse rusting with corrosion but what you should know is that corrosion involves an electrochemical process and it has some advantages too i.e corrosion prevents further corrosion. Once a metal part is corroded, a layer of protection on the surface of the metal is formed which prevents the inner part of the metal from being exposed to the electrochemical process leading to corrosion.
