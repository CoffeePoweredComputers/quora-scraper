            "answer_text": "Spyware on Android: Well, 99% of spywares installed on phones don\u2019t have root-level access to your system, which means that a simple factory reset or your phone erases all that crap. Just don\u2019t leave it unlocked and unattended anymore, avoiding the same situation again. If you\u2019re afraid that the spyware may have root access and may survive a factory reset, go to your settings and search all your apps for some called \u201cSuperSU\u201d, \u201cMagisk\u201d, \u201dKingoROOT\u201d, \u201cSuperuser\u201d or any other app with \u201cROOT\u201d in it. If you find it, your phone is probably rooted and you can\u2019t trust this installation anymore. Give it to someone who knows how to factoy reset it using a PC, downloading a fresh version of Android altogether. Spyware on iOS: On iOS it\u2019s a lot harder because you can\u2019t simply install third-party apps, but if you suspect that you have a spyware on it, simply factory reset it and you should be good to go. Who was it? This is a good question. Even if you manage to track down the exact app doing the spying, it may be locked with a code, and even if you have a code (or it hasn\u2019t a code), the only thing you\u2019ll probably see is that it\u2019s linked to some unknown account/server. The only thing you can do is to do some social engineering and placing some fake baits to slowly discover who it was, using the spyware against \u201chim\u201d. ",

            "answer_text": "See it depends on you if your phone discharge soon and data consumption is getting aggressively more than you must check the task manager which app is doing this. Go and see what permission you have been granted to this app. If it looks suspicious than just uninstall it. And also a good antivirus don't install app from untrusted party if you wanna to install just go and check the file on NoDistribution.com is for sale or VirusTotal they will show if file contains and milicious thing. But some time they can't tackle it so while installing just see if it is asking for any unusual permission. ",
