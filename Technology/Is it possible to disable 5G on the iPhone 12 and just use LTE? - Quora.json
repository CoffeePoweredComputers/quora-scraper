If you do change your plan and pay the extra fees, why you would want to turn off the feature is beyond me. The iPhone will only use 5G when it can find it (good luck with that) and even then, it still won\u2019t use it unless it needs to, saving on battery. If you must, you can turn off 5G if you really need to save more battery. Check out this article. How to Change 5G Settings on iPhone 12 to Save Data and Battery ",

A: Yes Your cell plan is limited to 4G (LTE) unless you pay extra for 5G, so you don't have 5G unless you elected to get itIf by some unusual quirk, your cell phone carrier did upgrade you to 5G, then just as them to downgrade you to 4G (LTE)Done",
