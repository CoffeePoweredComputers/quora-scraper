            "answer_text": "The story of genetic engineering and the augments in Star Trek has always been one of warning because we all know that humans will eventually have the technology to directly artificially \u201cimprove\u201d both the mental and physical aspects of humans. The ear ing being that when you enhace positive human capabilities you can also may enhance negative human aspects like aggression, arrogance, and greed. It has been shown that strength and intellect are strongly influenced by genetics, so as we gain more control over our genetics there is no doubt we will have the capability to engineer people that are generally superior to most humans. Now will these genetically engineered people have special abilities? Abilities beyond what we have seen? Maybe. This is uncertain. Certainly we have many exceptional people in the world now. There are people who are incredible athletes with genius level intelligence. These people are rare but they exist. Improved genetics technology will make people like those more common. But super geniuses with super strength? Well I don't think it is impossible that genetics could improve strength and intellect beyond the extremes now, but probably not much more than the strongest and smartest people today. Now if we merge cybernetics with genetic enhancements then things get interesting. ",

            "answer_text": "I think so. Genetics isn\u2019t as clear-cut as it was thought to be when Star Trek first came out, as environment and epigenetics play factors as well. But as we become more knowledgeable of biology, the temptation to use it as such will be there. After all, who wouldn\u2019t want a platoon of super-soldiers to fight for them? The question is how do we approach the temptation? Do we try and prohibit it, like we tried with alcohol? Do we embrace it? Or do we try to use it with wisdom and moderation? Most likely we\u2019ll do all three depending on a host of factors I can\u2019t predict. Hopefully we\u2019ll learn to use it wisely. ",
