            "answer_text": "As someone who uses both PC and Mac, I've only used a few of them (iBook G3, iBook G4, PowerBook G4, MacBook, MacBook Pro) but have found them to be pretty well-built. Actually, their build quality has gone up in the decade or so I've laid hands on any of them, with the current \"hewn from blocks of aluminum in the sacred forge of Jony Ive\" breed being closer to indestructible than the previous generations. In general, they use a lot of the same components as other brands of laptops, but things feel better-integrated.  In particular, I've found PC trackpads lacking in comparison to Apple's.  I'm not sure why this is. But I'm just one user; perhaps you'd be better off reading reviews or comparisons from experts in technology journalism?  Here are a few: PC magazine's The 10 Best Laptops (June 12, 2014)\u2022 15\" MacBook Pro (Retina) highest-rated laptop (5 stars)\u2022 13\" MacBook Pro (Retina) rated 4.5 stars LaptopMag's The Best Laptops of 2014 (May 16, 2014)\u2022 13\" MacBook Pro (Retina) named \"Best Laptop Overall\"\u2022 13\" MacBook Air named \"Best Ultraportable\"\u2022 15\" MacBook Pro (Retina) named \"Best Workstation Laptop\" PCWorld Laptops\u2022 4 of 5 top-rated models are MacBooks (3 Airs, and the 13\" Pro Retina) c|net Best laptops of 2014 (June 30, 2014)\u2022 15\" MacBook Pro (Retina) named \"Best Power Laptop\"\u2022 13\" MacBook Air named \"Best Battery Life\" Unfortunately, Consumer Reports requires a subscription to see their Ratings & Reviews of laptops, but I believe Apple has fared well in their rankings in the past, on the strength of its technical support operation.

            "answer_text": "I used Window pretty much my whole life and always made fun of the Mac when someone talked about it. Until last year, when I decided to get the Macbook Pro for school (I am a computer science major), I changed my opinion about the Mac and I will tell you this IT IS AWESOME. Here are the reasons: The build quality is top notch and the design is one of the best in the industry.The retina display is sharp, accurate, and provide great experience.The Battery life on Apple Macs are the best in the market. I can program for 7\u20138 hours straight with single charge so if you use the laptop for school or media, it will be even longer.All of the current Macs have SSD so the speed of app opening and boot up are ridiculously fast.Not only you get a great laptop, you also get top notch support from Apple.It is expensive but if you can find a Window machine that matches the specs of the Mac, the price will be the same or even more expensive.The resale value of Apple products is great.",
