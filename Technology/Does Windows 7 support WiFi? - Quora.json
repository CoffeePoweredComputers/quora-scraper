            "answer_text": "Absolutely, it does. But remember, in order to use WiFi in your system it must have a WiFi card. If you have a Desktop then you need to buy a WiFi card separately and install it in your system\u2019s motherboard PCI slot or you can also buy a USB Wifi adapter. And if you have a laptop then you don\u2019t need to do anything, Laptops come by default with a WiFi card.  I hope this might help you :) Feel free to ask! Thanks for asking! ",
