            "answer_text": "Here's a bit of unknown history that may have provided context to any antagonism between Tesla and Einstein. Einstein's first wife, Mileva Maric, was, like Tesla, a Krajina Serb.  The Krajina Serbs were the minority Serbs living in the areas that had formed the border between Europe and the Middle East during the Ottoman Empire. The word Krajina means \"frontier.\" Basically they were runaways from the 500-year peonage slavery of Serbia, colonized by the Ottomans. The Austrian Crown basically gave these Serbs the equivalent of 40 acres and a mule, plus weapons, training and spoils for holding that no-man's-land, the border. Free rent in a war zone. Who could pass that up? Anyway, they did it. They held that border. Some say they are the reason Europe is full of church steeples instead of minarets. Mileva met Albert in school, studying physics. As a young wife/helpmate she'd help him with his math. There's testimony that both their names were on the first draft of the Theory of Relativity. He gave all the prize money for the Nobel prize to her. There's a lot of testimony that he did not treat her very well. He reneged on marrying her when she became pregnant. She had to return home knocked up. It looks like she gave the baby up for adoption, or it died. Later they did marry, one kid suffered with mental illness and her life revolved around his care. Albert\u2019s circle never accepted her. There are some quotes that sound pretty racist. (These were people sometimes characterized as primates by other Europeans. Somebody cracked that she looked like a monkey) Albert left her.  He later failed to acknowledge her contributions. They are referred to only in their love letters. There were some disparaging comments he made about her. I use the past tense describing the Krajina Serbs because they no longer exist as a result of Operation Storm, the only group actually genocided in that war regardless of media coverage at the time. The culture that produced Tesla and Mrs. Einstein no longer exists. In fact, the village, Smiljans, that Tesla was born in was leveled in WWII and all inhabitants exterminated by Croatian fascists. His gene pool has been eradicated. ",

            "answer_text": "On Tesla's 75th birthday in 1931 he was featured on the cover of Time magazine. The magazine requested comments from his peers and Einstein politely responded with, \"As an eminent pioneer in the realm of high frequency currents\u2026 I congratulate you on the great successes of your life\u2019s work.\u201d It was a very short and to the point birthday message from a gracious Einstein. In the poem \"Fragments of Olympian Gossip\" that Nikola Tesla composed for his friend, George Sylvester Viereck, Tesla was very critical of the scientists of his day. Tesla specifically calls out Einstein: \"Now a long haired crank, Einstein by name,Puts on your high teaching all the blame.\" In 1935 in comments to The New York Times, Tesla was critical of Einstein stating that his theory of relativity was \"like a beggar clothed in purple, whom ignorant people take for a king.\" There was no love lost between Tesla and Einstein. The story is often told that when Einstein was asked how it felt to be the smartest man on Earth, Einstein replied, \"I wouldn't know. Ask Nikola Tesla\". I have seen the quote often, and have searched for its origin, and have yet to find it. Put in the context of the relationship between Einstein and Tesla, if Einstein did utter those words, it would make sense that it was done sarcastically, rather than as a compliment.

If it was not for Tesla\u2019s schizophrenia causing him to think Einstein, like Edison, stole his ideas, resulting in what is best summed up as repulsion or disgust concerning Einstein, I believe Einstein would gladly have worked with a Tesla who was actually willing to cooperate, so that both could have furthered their contributions to science. Tesla was brilliant and I believe both men saw things that the rest of us couldn't. However there's entire sub-fields dedicated to understanding how Einstein was able to maintain his mental state while possessing the intelligence he did. Self actualization? That's based upon Einstein's demeanor. Tesla needed everyone to view him as the smartest because he cared about that more then finding the truth. He isolated himself because everyone was against him. Einsteins mind is only exceeded by one I've found. Some ancient Greek with a name starting with a D. I can never remember it. But he ran around Greece trying to convince everyone of the tiny invisible objects that everything was made of. That's before Aristotle even started on form. Now explain to me, how, before an argument for form has even been brought forth, someone tries to get people to understand the concept of molecular structure or atoms or anything like that. Can you comprehend that? Tesla couldn't. It's why he's a tier below Einstein, despite his savant like contributions. ",

What is not disputed is Einstein worked for other\u2019s and Tesla himself - considering their respective legacies directly proportional to their ambitions I doubt their is much happiness up in that great laboratory on the sky, but more than likely a little more solidarity and certainly empathy now. On another note given none of us really have the footwear to be taking academic nor cerebral position son these two astounding pioneers, how inspired was the casting of David Bowie as Tesla? Ye Gods \u2026 in my opinion on another pioneer talented beyond my limited means - some of his finest work, including his music. Great men all three, who left more than they took.  ",

            "answer_text": "Tesla never accepted Einstein's theories, particularly his theory of Relativity, so his opinion probably wasn't very high. Tesla was more like Einstein than Einstein was, which was probably another reason he didn't like him. Einstein was different from most other physicists because he said most of his ideas came out of his imagination, but unlike Tesla, he had a thorough grounding in science and mathematics. Tesla's ideas came entirely out of his imagination, and whatever other sources he might have had, whether from this world or not. Tesla wasn't a theoretical physicist like Einstein; he was more of an inventor, and most of his inventions didn't come to fruition, whether because of his naivity and lack of business sense or because of the opposition of others like Edison, so it's difficult to make a comparison of the two.

Hm... Batshit insane. Like, dangerously insane. Like, these days, we wouldn't give him a lab, we'd give him an antipsychotic and a straight jacket. He talked to pigeons. One source suggests he may have fallen in love with a pigeon. He suffered from vivid hallucinations. It only makes sense that they butted heads. And as has been pointed out, they did. ",

The Forgotten Life of Einstein's First Wife I do not think Einstein was sarcastic when asked ,,How does it feel to be smartest man on Earth?\u2019\u2019 and replied ,,I do not know, ask Tesla\u2019\u2019 , but only honest. Also, theory of relativity was not the Magnum Opus of Einstein, he won the Nobel prize for his services to Theoretical Physics, and especially for his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect in 1921 But Tesla was the one who patented it (US 685,957 - Apparatus for the Utilization of Radiant Energy in 1901, whole 20 years before Einstein\u2019s Nobel prize. With no doubt Tesla is maybe the most influential scientist whose inventions made the world we live in today. ",
