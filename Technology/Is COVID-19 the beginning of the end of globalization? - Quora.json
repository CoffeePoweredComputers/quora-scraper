            "answer_text": "Numerous countries are rethinking their relationships with China. At the beginning of the pandemic China stopped exports of masks. Since then Iran received a shipment of masks made from men\u2019s underwear. Many shipments of masks have been faulty and had to be discarded. Some countries bought Chinese virus test kits that turned out to be poor quality. The joke going around Spain in March was, \u201cI took the test for the virus. It\u2019s a girl.\u201d Japan has already promised millions to help Japanese companies move their production away from China. Similarly President Trump has signed an executive order against outsourcing some critical medical supplies to other countries and requiring companies to move the manufacture back to the US. The pandemic has stressed the European Union, also. The EU as an organization was slow to react to the virus. When member-countries were hit and asked for help in the form of masks and ventilators, none were given. The other countries kept their supplies in case they needed them for their own population. This may sound like common sense but it is in violation of the EU treaties. When the pandemic ends some countries, particularly Italy and Spain, will be reevaluating their memberships in the EU. Both countries have had problems because the EU sets economic policies that most benefit Germany. Their reason for staying was that the advantages of mutual aid overrode the economic disadvantages. Now that they\u2019ve been abandoned during a crisis they might decide the disadvantages of membership outweigh the advantages. ",

            "answer_text": "It will kill about 1\u20132 million people and hopefully anger people so much that they will stop all outsourcing of manufacturing to China and other countries who lie, cheat, spread their killer virus and then threaten weaker countries. Our whore companies will continue to give up tech and sign deals that hurt the West to make profit for access to the Chinese market. There would not even be a Chinese market had it not be fed by $$$ from the West to make cheap plastic crap. I consider this Chinese virus and the CCPs knowing spread to be a bioweapons attack and the rest of the world needs to make them pay. Personally I would cut off all trade with China and recognize Taiwan as a separate country. Stop feeding the dragon! ",
