            "answer_text": "To a large extent this depends on the school. Most of them, though, are meant to support the school\u2019s curriculum and, possibly more importantly, to foster a love of reading. The librarians in charge of children\u2019s libraries, whether public or school, usually have at least some background in education, and choose material appropriate to the age range using it. In both types of children\u2019s libraries, it\u2019s important to know the general outline of the state curriculum, to support students doing reports or other research, and also to act as an important resource to home-schooled students. Children\u2019s libraries also usually have some kind of open space for gathering children to read aloud, perform puppet shows, and do other enrichment activities. There is often a chair (even a rocking chair in some libraries) for the adult who reads, and small chairs or cushions for the kids who listen. They may even go so far as to have arts & crafts supplies and other equipment useful for activities with children. The whole idea, though, is to make the library a safe, happy place for kids, who will hopefully remember it as they go through their lives, both during and after their formal schooling. Thanks for the A-to-A! ",
