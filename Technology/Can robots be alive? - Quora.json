            "answer_text": "This is ultimately dependent on your definition of \u201clife\u201d. If we were to take the biological definition of life requiring, Homeostasis, Organization, Metabolism, Growth, Adaptation, Response to Stimuli, and Reproduction, and simply adjusted those parameters to fit the construction of robots, then theoretically, they would be alive. The only issue is that currently robots are not created from small cell like structures, but organization as a whole exists. It is very reasonable to assume that humans could create robots that perform all of the above functions. Most robots already do most of those functions. As a corollary, \u201cIs AI alive?\u201d then, if humans could create an AI that was virtually indistinguishable from humans, and because the ultimate boundary of perception is literally you, then you could not say that they are not alive. That doesn\u2019t mean that it IS alive, but you can\u2019t say it is not. ",

Could machines have become self-aware without our knowing it? \u2013 George Musser | Aeon Essays \u201cOur machines could become self-aware without our knowing it. We need a better way to define and test for consciousness\u201d As the cartoon cat Mooch would say, \u201cYesh.\u201d I just picked up my iPhone and asked Siri if she\u2019s alive. She said, \u201cThat\u2019s a rather personal question, Martin.\u201d See? Already our machines aren\u2019t letting on. Either that, or she\u2019s a hopeless prude. Or maybe she\u2019s just a little shy, and we need time to build trust. Is it possible that machines will be alive when we believe they are? If Siri were switched out by a real person talking to me from Apple HQ, how would I know? Ok, with the current Siri I could probably figure it out pretty fast. But how long before I can\u2019t? That\u2019s when she\u2019ll pass the Turing test, at least as far as I\u2019m concerned. With someone brighter than me, it will take a little longer. ",

            "answer_text": "Like many classification schemes, this is a rather wooly imprecise and, I believe, destined to fall into disrepute. There was a time that most scientists believed that there was something very special about the chemistry of life, so much so that the subject of chemistry split into organic and inorganic chemistry. Soon however organic chemicals were synthesized from inorganic ones but we still use the same terms of organic and inorganic. So, I believe, will happen with the concept of life. It was a useful concept when we were less sophisticated but we are now getting to the point that we can see the full spectrum of chemicals from humanity to elements with no step change in liveliness.
