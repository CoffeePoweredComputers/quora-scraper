            "answer_text": "NO. Not now. Not ever. Most things that make it not nice to build a business, aren't features of the country (China) but of the ambient environment around it that make it undesirable to live and build a tech startup. More specifically: I. COPYCAT CULTURE Is there any wonder, then, that the Chinese are widely regarded as not being creative? Yes, they file a lot of patents, but the quality isn\u2019t great. In my view, there\u2019s not yet much terribly impressive about China\u2019s technology achievements. A calm look at China\u2019s technology achievements should pick up strengths as well as weaknesses. There are certain lights under which Chinese technology efforts look spectacular. China is the only country other than the US to have been able to develop internet giants, which can look upon their Silicon Valley counterparts as peers and puts it in a good position to continue developing digital technologies. The Chinese mobile internet experience certainly is far more fun than what consumers in the US are able to play with. It\u2019s true that the country leads on 5G, the consumer internet like social network, mobile payments, and e-commerce, as well as the buildout of certain industrial technologies that include solar energy generation, mobile infrastructure equipment, and high-speed rail. They\u2019re also making good inroads in consumer electronics, from smartphones to drones. And Chinese firms have a plausible shot at leading in emerging technologies like artificial intelligence and quantum computing. These however have more to do with differences in the social environment and regulatory regime. These are not trivial achievements. But neither are they earth-shattering successes. I find it bizarre that the world has decided that consumer internet is the highest form of technology. It\u2019s not obvious to me that apps like WeChat, Facebook, or Snap are doing the most important work pushing forward our technologically-accelerating civilization. To me, it\u2019s entirely plausible that Facebook and Tencent might be net-negative for technological developments. The apps they develop offer fun, productivity-dragging distractions; and the companies pull smart kids from R&D-intensive fields like materials science or semiconductor manufacturing, into ad optimization and game development. I wish we would drop the notion that China is leading in technology because it has a vibrant consumer internet. A large population of people who play games, buy household goods online, and order food delivery does not make a country a technological or scientific leader. Although Alibaba and Tencent may be technically impressive on software development, their business success is mostly a function of the size of the market and the social, regulatory environment. On the demand side, a huge and dynamic market will pull forward domestic capabilities. The ubiquity of mobile payments is due not just to technological innovation (substantial though that might be), but also the financial regulatory regime and the leapfrog over credit cards. In China they had the \u201cgood fortune\u201d of basically being behind in so many things so they could leapfrog into a mobile world, go straight to mobile payment skipping credit cards, and now leapfrogging into online retail skipping the shopping malls, and so on. An industry\u2019s legacy is hard to dump because it creates bad habits that are hard to change and baggage that is hard to leave behind. E-commerce works great because China has built first-rate infrastructure and because many migrant workers are available to deliver goods in dense urban areas. These are fine companies, but in my view the milestones of our technological civilization ought to be found in scientific and industrial achievements, not the creation of consumer internet companies. Now even if one did want to consider consumer internet the be the most important sector, the US still looks good. A rough rule-of-thumb comparison: market caps of the five biggest US tech companies (Apple, Microsoft, Google, Amazon, and Facebook) add up to US$5tn at the time of this writing, while the two Chinese internet giants (Alibaba and Tencent) add up to US$1tn. This 5:1 advantage to the US feels intuitively right to me as a measure of relative capabilities. China has developed credible brands in certain hardware technologies, like the smartphone, and many types of industrial goods. They\u2019re building good consumer products, although bad at creating global brands. It has a strong position when it comes to manufacturing industrial goods. A few firms have staked out leading positions in industries that include steel, solar power generation, and telecommunications equipment. The bulk still has a long way to go however before they can really be considered the peers of German, Japanese, Korean, and American giants. In fact, I suspect that Chinese firms should be considered underperformers as a whole. Few domestic firms have become globally-successful brands, and Chinese firms are still far behind more technologically-sophisticated industries involving R&D-intensive technologies like automotives, semiconductors, and aviation. They have a weak position even in the domestic market. As a rule of thumb, it\u2019s harder to name global Chinese brands than Japanese and Korean ones, even when they were close to China\u2019s current level of per capita GDP. The lack of success in global brand building shows that Chinese firms (not foreign firms producing in China) are actually poor exporters. Shouldn\u2019t we expect more from the world\u2019s second-largest market? How about emerging technologies like AI, quantum computing, facial recognition, biotechnology, and hypersonics, and other buzzing areas? The fact that data so easily aggregates creates business models that are profitable because if it works in one city it can work in a hundred big cities; if it works with one demographic, then it applies to all demographics. Also, the market size is an even larger advantage in AI where so much data is needed; the more data, the better it works. But I think there\u2019s no scientific consensus on China\u2019s position on any of these technologies, but let\u2019s consider it at least a plausible claim that Chinese firms might lead in them. So far however these fields are closer to being speculative science projects than real, commercial industries. AI is mostly a vague product or an add-on service whose total industry revenue is difficult to determine, and that goes for many of the other items. In my view, focusing the discussion on the Chinese position in emerging technologies distracts from its weaknesses in established technologies. Take semiconductors, machine tools, and commercial aviation, which are measured by clearer technical and commercial benchmarks. They are considerably more difficult than making steel and solar panels, and Chinese firms have a poor track record of breaking into these industries. The focus on speculative science projects brings to light another issue around discussions of China and technology: an emphasis on quantifying inputs. So much of the commentary focuses on its growth in patent registrations, R&D spending, journal publications, and other types of inputs. One can find data on these metrics, which is why measures of \u201cinnovation\u201d are often constructed around them. But these inputs are irrelevant if they don\u2019t deliver output, and it\u2019s not clear that they often do, neither in China nor anywhere else. Wonderfully asymptoting charts on Chinese patent registrations and R&D spending suggest that Chinese firms might overrun the rest of the world any day now. So far however the commercial outputs are not so impressive. In many ways, China\u2019s technology success is too much like a paper tiger, impressive in appearance but in reality not so powerful. Why? Because much of China\u2019s technology stack is built on American components, especially semiconductors. China owns very few patents featuring originality and high or core technology. In fact, Chinese innovation relies on the modification of existing technologies, like putting together a cell phone and a cigarette case. Chinese engineers are trying only to replace existing technologies, which is relatively simpler than inventing them de novo. These creations are fun, but they lack depth. China works to beat America. America works to get the best of the world. There\u2019s a matter of will. Chinese aspirations to replace US technology has long been a whimsical task. All the research on this topic will end up into this. Competition comes from the perception of scarcity while creativity comes from and leads to abundance. If you can create you don't need to worry about competition. When you\u2019re competing with people, it\u2019s because you\u2019re copying them. No one can compete with you on being you. Copycatting is a part of Chinese culture. Ten years ago, Shenzhen was 90% about copycatting and 10% innovation. Now, it's 70% innovation and 30% copycatting. There are two kinds of evolution: the genetic kind and the cultural kind. Both shape our behavior and mindset, and the cultural kind has gotten a lot faster. The culture is kind of an operating system, and the operating system stays intact even as you put different programs through it. Few of us are immune to the values of the people around us. The culture is so strong that people are absorbed into it and become part of it and do it willingly, and if someone is not willing, then the guys around them are so strong that they will pull them into the culture. One of the most important things I\u2019ve come to understand is that Eastern culture, which values sustainability, safety, community common good, rules & system, is best at value preservation (aka you\u2019re already doing well and just want to make sure nothing gets screwed up). It's something in the culture that's made Asian/Chinese people become a creature of convention, less ambitious, shun failure, more risk-averse, scared to take ambitious swings to be themselves, extreme lack of critical thinking, deferring to groupthink, and perceive human engagement as competition rather than collaboration. In contrast, Western culture, which values risk-taking, personal freedom and citizen empowerment, is best at value creation (aka creating value from scratch). Guess which culture does better in innovation? * There is plenty of evidence: For decades, the online infrastructure \u2014 from design to programming languages to wireless protocols \u2014 came from the West. China has long been known for cyber and intellectual property theft and protectionist regulation. We only need to look at the amount of money paid by Chinese companies to Western companies for the license of technology, intellectual property, plans, designs, formulas and so forth. In 2007, agents of the Chinese military hacked the aerospace firm Lockheed Martin and stole tens of millions of documents related to America\u2019s most expensive weapons system, the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter. A notably similar Chinese plane, the J-31, appeared soon thereafter. (China denies stealing the plans.) The Chinese hacking of American businesses exposed a deep clash of perceptions: America was starting to see China as a near-peer, intent on flouting rules laid down mostly by the West. But China still regarded itself as a scrappy latecomer, using whatever tools it could to protect and improve the lives of a vast population. That clash extends far beyond hacking: China has invoked its status as a \u201cdeveloping country\u201d to erect barriers against foreign competitors, and to coerce American companies into sharing technology. Eventually, those practices turned some American businesses from ardent advocates for good relations into fierce critics. When China joined the World Trade Organization, in 2001, it agreed to a schedule for dropping tariffs and opening markets. But that schedule ended in 2006, and so did the momentum toward opening. Chinese hackers at the behest of various agencies\u2014military, intelligence\u2014roamed farther and wider. In 2014, they stole the private records of twenty-two million U.S. government employees and their relatives from a server at the Office of Personnel Management. It was more alarming than the usual breach; foreign spy agencies could use those records to identify people who work covertly as U.S. employees, or have secrets that would make them vulnerable to blackmail. The following year, Xi promised Obama to curtail hacking, and it briefly died down, but China\u2019s cyber attacks have since resumed, including \u201cwidespread operations to target engineering, telecommunications, and aerospace industries,\u201d according to a 2018 report by the U.S. intelligence community. In recent years, the U.S. has prosecuted at least half a dozen Chinese students and scholars for spying or for stealing scientific research. In 2017, four Chinese intelligence officers of the People\u2019s Liberation Army\u2019s 54th Research Institute stole trade secrets and hacked credit-reporting giant Equifax, which compromised the personal data of nearly 150 million Americans. The group ran approximately 9,000 queries while routing traffic through 34 servers to secretly obtain names, birth dates, social security and driver\u2019s license numbers for nearly half of all American citizens, before compressing and exporting the data. In 2018, Ji Chaoqun, an electrical-engineering student at the Illinois Institute of Technology, was charged with acting as an agent for China\u2019s Ministry of State Security, and accused of trying to recruit spies among engineers and scientists. (Ji has pleaded not guilty.) Christopher Wray, the director of the F.B.I., warned the Senate Judiciary Committee that China has enlisted \u201cnontraditional collectors\u201d of intelligence to steal their way up the economic ladder at our expense. Federal law enforcement agencies also announced charges against a Chinese national who is accused of working with the Chinese army while she was allegedly a student at Boston University. Yanqing Ye, an alleged lieutenant in the People's Liberation Army, conducted research for China's National University of Defense Technology while she attended Boston University from October 2017 to April 2019. She is also charged with granting a military researcher in China access to her BU virtual private network login so the researcher could conduct web searches from overseas without detection. She is said to have left the country before charges could be unsealed. In 2020, Federal prosecutors charged a top Harvard University scientist with lying to the Department of Defense about his work for a Chinese-run The Thousand Talents program that tries to recruit experts from Western universities to work in China and ramp up its progress in science and technology. The FBI said the program has rewarded individuals for stealing proprietary information and violating export controls. China is also behind recent breaches US officials, including at a US federal gov office, the hotel chain Marriott, and the health insurer Anthen. China\u2019s first-generation Internet entrepreneurs unabashedly created copies of successful American start-ups Yahoo, Amazon, Facebook, Google and eBay. China\u2019s powerful BAT companies \u2014 Baidu, Alibaba, and Tencent are Chinese equivalents of Apple, Alphabet, Microsoft, Amazon and Facebook. People call Baidu as the Google of China, Sina as the Yahoo of China because they\u2019re pretty much US ideas. Microsoft for many years complained of the piracy of their intellectual property in China. Though now Chinese technocrats are breaking boundaries with their own business models and disruptive innovations. For years, the copycat products that emerged from China\u2019s cultural stew were widely mocked by the Silicon Valley elite. They were derided as cheap knockoffs, embarrassments to their creators and unworthy of the attention of true innovators. That\u2019s why it\u2019s very difficult for any Chinese company to go to the US market. There was this parallel universe of Chinese companies that pretty much only were offering their services in China. And we had Tencent who was trying to spread some of their services into Southeast Asia. Alibaba has spread a bunch of their payment services to Southeast Asia. Broadly, in terms of global expansion, that had been pretty limited, and TikTok, which is built by this company Beijing ByteDance, is really the first consumer internet product built by one of the Chinese tech giants that is doing quite well around the world. It\u2019s starting to do well in the US, especially with young folks. It\u2019s growing really quickly in India. I think it\u2019s past Instagram now in India in terms of scale. So yeah, it\u2019s a very interesting phenomenon. These days, the most acute standoff between the two countries is over who will dominate the next generation of technologies. Under a plan called Made in China 2025, Beijing has directed billions in subsidies and research funds to help Chinese companies surpass foreign competitors on such frontiers as electric vehicles and robotics. A Pentagon report commissioned under Obama warned that the U.S. was losing cutting-edge technology to China, not only through theft but also through Chinese involvement in joint ventures and tech startups. It prompted Congress, in 2018, to tighten rules on foreign investment and export controls. The technology dispute escalated later that year, when the Trump Administration expanded an attack on Huawei, the world\u2019s largest manufacturer of fifth-generation (5G) networking equipment, warning that the Chinese government could use the equipment for spying and hacking. Recently, the Justice Department unveiled new charges against the Chinese telecom company and its subsidiaries. The charges include racketeering conspiracy and conspiracy to steal trade secrets from US companies for over two decades. The DOJ accuses Huawei of stealing and copying US intellectual property (think: robots, cellular tech), and selling it in products around the world. But those outsiders missed what was brewing beneath the surface. The most valuable product to come out of China\u2019s copycat era wasn\u2019t a product at all: it was the entrepreneurs themselves. China is watching Silicon Valley. That's why Chinese founders usually have comprehensive knowledge about their US competitors, listing off minute product features and the latest numbers on their size and traction. Chinese people clearly stay on top of Silicon Valley. I can count at least ten Chinese publications that focus solely on Silicon Valley news. On 36Kr, a mainstream Chinese tech news outlet (think of it as the TechCrunch of China), close to half of the articles every day cover FAANG (Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix, Google). When Facebook reported its security incident, related posts flooded my WeChat Moment timeline even faster than my Twitter feed. Once, I sent an English article about Instagram\u2019s latest product change to a friend living in China, thinking that this would be news to her. She replied and said: \u201cI read about this on Chinese sites three days ago. Have you been living under a rock?\u201d One thing is clear: people in China\u2013at least those in the tech circle\u2013are not living under a rock. Every time you go to China, you would be humbled by people\u2019s extensive knowledge of entrepreneurs and companies across the Pacific. I have met Chinese people who can recite Paul Graham\u2019s essays, Ray Dalio\u2019s principles, and Elon Musk\u2019s latest tweets. The Chinese version of Crunchbase maintains extremely up-to-date\u2013even encyclopedic\u2013coverage of US startups\u2019 fundraising activities. Chinese people do not need anyone to tell them how the US works. On the other hand, when you ask founders in Silicon Valley about Company Z in China, they often have no idea about its existence. Many well-educated Americans can\u2019t name a single Chinese entrepreneur beyond Jack Ma. Even though China has become home to around a hundred unicorns (as many as the US), people in Silicon Valley struggle to name even one. It is rare to encounter American entrepreneurs who have set foot in China, whereas many Chinese entrepreneur have traveled to Silicon Valley. Many in the US are unaware that some of the world\u2019s most innovative products come from China, and I believe that China remains under- and poorly covered in most Western media outlets. It makes me wonder how there can be so much information asymmetry in the tech world between the US and China. What explains this knowledge gap? The word \u201chunger\u201d often comes up when they describe the Chinese entrepreneurs they meet. Why? Because if you are an entrepreneur in China, you are living a hunger game. Chinese people have a strong desire to copy American innovations and beat them in their game. It is a middle-income country with a well telegraphed desire to become the world\u2019s pre-eminent power over the course of the next few decades. The Chinese market is so brutally competitive that if you don\u2019t do everything it takes and learn all the best practices to win, you will almost certainly lose. It\u2019s part of the reason why Chinese founders are like sponges in water\u2013always absorbing knowledge and learning what\u2019s working in other markets, so that they can improve their products and themselves. This \u201chunger\u201d is something I see more of in China (and other emerging markets) than in the US, and it is my best explanation for the knowledge gap. Of course, language gap is another big factor\u2013almost every Chinese entrepreneur I meet can speak English to some degree, whereas the number of American entrepreneurs who can speak Chinese can be counted with one hand. Granted, this has to do with the fact that English is a global lingua franca and Chinese is not. But I would argue that language proficiency is a function of hunger as well\u2013if you are not hungry to learn about the outside world, you would not be motivated to take the time and effort to learn a foreign language. Having got to know about Silicon Valley for a while now, I see how easy it is to think that they are sitting in the mecca for world-class technology, that America still has the monopoly on real innovation, or that a VC can learn everything there is to know about tech without traveling much outside of Menlo Park. * What explains this copycat culture? Silicon Valley\u2019s and China\u2019s internet ecosystems grew out of very different cultural soil. Entrepreneurs in the valley are often the children of successful professionals, such as computer scientists, dentists, engineers, and academics. Growing up they were constantly told that they\u2014yes, they in particular\u2014could change the world. Their undergraduate years were spent learning the art of coding from the world\u2019s leading researchers but also basking in the philosophical debates of a liberal arts education. When they arrived in Silicon Valley, their commutes to and from work took them through the gently curving, tree-lined streets of suburban California. It\u2019s an environment of abundance that lends itself to lofty thinking, to envisioning elegant technical solutions to abstract problems. Throw in the valley\u2019s rich history of computer science breakthroughs, and you've set the stage for the geeky-hippie hybrid ideology that has long defined Silicon Valley. Central to that ideology is a wide-eyed techno-optimism, a belief that every person and company can truly change the world through innovative thinking. Copying ideas or product features is frowned upon as a betrayal of the zeitgeist and an act that is beneath the moral code of a true entrepreneur. It\u2019s all about \u201cpure\u201d innovation, creating a totally original product that generates what Steve Jobs called a \u201cdent in the universe.\u201d Startups that grow up in this kind of environment tend to be mission-driven. They start with a novel idea or idealistic goal, and they build a company around that. Company mission statements are clean and lofty, detached from earthly concerns or financial motivations. In stark contrast, China\u2019s startup culture is the yin to Silicon Valley\u2019s yang: instead of being mission-driven, Chinese companies are first and foremost market-driven. Their ultimate goal is to make money, and they\u2019re willing to create any product, adopt any model, or go into any business that will accomplish that objective. That mentality leads to incredible flexibility in business models and execution, a perfect distillation of the \u201clean startup\u201d model often praised in Silicon Valley. It doesn\u2019t matter where an idea came from or who came up with it. All that matters is whether you can execute it to make a financial profit. The core motivation for China\u2019s market-driven entrepreneurs is not fame, glory, or changing the world. Those things are all nice side benefits, but the grand prize is getting rich, and it doesn\u2019t matter how you get there. Jarring as that mercenary attitude is to many Americans, the Chinese approach has deep historical and cultural roots. Rote memorization formed the core of Chinese education for millennia. Entry into the country\u2019s imperial bureaucracy depended on word-for-word memorization of ancient texts and the ability to construct a perfect \u201ceight-legged essay\u201d following rigid stylistic guidelines. While Socrates encouraged his students to seek truth by questioning everything, ancient Chinese philosophers counseled people to follow the rituals of sages from the ancient past. Rigorous copying of perfection was seen as the route to the true mastery. Layered atop this cultural propensity for imitation is the deeply ingrained scarcity mentality of twentieth-century China. Most Chinese tech entrepreneurs are at most one generation away from grinding poverty that stretches back centuries. Many are only children\u2014products of the now-defunct \u201cOne Child Policy\u201d\u2014carrying on their backs the expectations of two parents and four grandparents who have invested all their hopes for a better life in this child. Growing up, their parents didn\u2019t talk to them about changing the world. Rather, they talked about survival, about a responsibility to earn money so they can take care of their parents when their parents are too old to work in the fields. A college education was seen as the key to escaping generations of grinding poverty, and that required tens of thousands of hours of rote memorization in preparing for China\u2019s notoriously competitive entrance exam. During these entrepreneurs\u2019 lifetimes, China wrenched itself out of poverty through bold policies and hard work, trading meal tickets for paychecks for equity stakes in startups. The blistering pace of China\u2019s economic rise hasn\u2019t alleviated that scarcity mentality. Chinese citizens have watched as industries, cities, and individual fortunes have been created and lost overnight in a Wild West environment where regulations struggled to keep pace with cutthroat market competition. Deng Xiaoping, the Chinese leader who pushed China from Mao-era egalitarianism to market-driven competition, once said that China needed to \u201clet some people get rich first\u201d in order to develop. But the lightning speed of that development only heightened fears and concerns that if you don\u2019t move quickly\u2014 if you don\u2019t grab onto this new trend or jump into that new market\u2014you\u2019ll stay poor while others around you get rich. Combine these three currents\u2014a cultural acceptance of copying, a scarcity mentality, and the willingness to dive into any promising new industry\u2014and you have the psychological foundations of China\u2019s internet ecosystem. This is not meant to preach a gospel of cultural determinism. Birthplace and heritage are not the sole determinants of behavior. Personal eccentricities and government regulation are hugely important in shaping company behavior (See II below). In Beijing, entrepreneurs often joke that Facebook is \u201cthe most Chinese company in Silicon Valley\u201d for its willingness to copy from other startups and for Zuckerberg\u2019s fiercely competitive streak. Likewise, I saw how government antitrust policy can defang a wolf-like company. But history and culture do matter, and in comparing the evolution of Silicon Valley and Chinese technology, it\u2019s crucial to grasp how different cultural melting pots produced different types of companies. * Copycat culture could mean fragility for China's technology. Here's how: I'm skeptical of copying things. To the extent you're trying to copy Silicon Valley, you're ready putting yourself in some in a weird derivative position. You know, you don't want to be the Harvard of North Dakota. The something of somewhere is often the nothing of nowhere. China\u2019s technology foundations are fragile, which the trade war has made evident. The trade war produced the clearest evidence that China\u2019s technology foundations are fragile. When the US government decided to restrict technology exports to particular firms, it drove ZTE to near bankruptcy, crippled the operations of Fujian Jinhua, and has at least dealt a major blow to Huawei. US sanctions have revealed that most Chinese firms engage in only a thin layer of innovation, and that Chinese firms in general have not had serious success mastering more foundational technologies. The most important of these is the semiconductor. Without particular chips like CPUs, GPUs, and FPGAs, which for the most part come from American providers, even a firm as large as Huawei can struggle. The US has the policy tools in place to slow down China\u2019s technology progress, at least in the short term. Creating hassles for large companies slow down the entire ecosystem, because leading companies spend the most on R&D and serve as downstream buyers. The US can escalate the use of export controls in still more ominous ways, and in some cases also prevent other countries from shipping goods to China. CFIUS will make it more difficult for Chinese firms to engage in technological learning through equity investments. And if US tariffs stay on for an extended period, Chinese firms will not be able to learn to improve their products in the world\u2019s largest market of sophisticated consumers. The medium-term outlook for China\u2019s technology progress is in my view not so cheerful. Failure to develop more foundational technologies has meant that the US has had an at-will ability to kneecap major firms, and to be able to impose at least significant operational hassles on Huawei. Over the medium term, US controls will disrupt the ability of Chinese firms to acquire leading technologies. And so long as substantial US tariffs stay in place, Chinese firms will have worse access to the world\u2019s largest and best consumer market, meaning that they\u2019ll be exposed to less export discipline. It\u2019s now a matter of national security for China to strengthen every major technological capability. The US responded to the rise of the USSR and Japan by focusing on innovation; it\u2019s early days, but so far the US is responding to the technological rise of China mostly by kneecapping its leading firms. So instead of realizing its own Sputnik moment, the US is triggering one in China. The most frightening aspect of this crisis is not the short-term economic damage it is causing though, but the potential long-lasting disruption to supply chains. China is losing its prowess as the only game in town for whatever widget one wants to make was already under way. It was moving at a panda bear\u2019s pace, though. Under President Trump, that slow moving panda moved a little faster. Companies didn\u2019t like the uncertainty of tariffs. If Trump wins re-election, it will only speed up this process, as companies will fear what happens if the phase two trade deal fails. After US sanctions started taking down giants, private companies are thinking more carefully about how to maintain continuous access to supplies. US political actions are now as unpredictable as major earthquakes, and have the same effects on supply chains. Every company has to cultivate non-US, and ideally Chinese alternatives. That task is taken most seriously by the technology sector, since the lack of only a few components can defeat a system as complex as a smartphone or base station. * What's the solution? Although gene and culture shape our behavior, we now have many ways to create \u201cinstincts\u201d: we can learn to do better or worse. We can pass on traditions about how to deal with modern risks, just as we pass on language. China\u2019s technology foundation has been fragile, but it will patch up now that everyone has realized it. Over the longer term, I expect that China will stiffen those foundations and develop firms capable of pushing forward the technological frontier, and Chinese firms will build strong technological capabilities, with companies that will reach the leading edge and push it forward. I am constructive for China\u2019s longer-term industrial development. I think that long-term prospects are bright. In my view, Chinese firms face favorable odds first in reaching the technological frontier and next in pushing it forward. The country still feels like a highly optimistic place. International survey results consistently show that Chinese rank at the top of feeling optimism for the future. If you're optimistic, the future will take care of itself. If you're pessimistic, we're headed the apocalypse. And in my view, government institutions are organized around the ideas of adaptation and progress. Consider a few of their names. In 2003, the economic super-ministry renamed itself from the State Planning Commission to the National Development and Reform Commission. The most important government body is the Central Commission for Comprehensively Deepening Reform. \u201cDevelopment\u201d and \u201creform\u201d are splendidly Hegelian ideas: both are forward-looking and without end. Surely it\u2019s better to be a developing country than a developed one, for the latter means that everything is done and finished. The implication behind developed being that there is no more growth to go. And a commitment to continuous \u201creform\u201d recognizes the impossibility of overcoming every contradiction entailed by modernization, and therefore institutions need to be perpetually adaptive. Incantation alone cannot make something true, but getting names right is a nice part of institutional success. Companies were doing what they always do - search the world with the lowest costs of production. Maybe that meant labor costs. Maybe it meant regulations of some kind or another. They were already doing that as China moves up the ladder in terms of wages and environmental regulations. No country has the logistic set up like China has. Few big countries have the tax rates that China has. Brazil surely doesn\u2019t. India does. But it has terrible logistics. I believe that technology ultimately progresses because of people and the deepening of the process knowledge they possess, and that the creation of new tools and IP are the milestones of better training. We should distinguish technology in three forms: tools, direct instructions (like blueprints and IP), and process knowledge. The third is most important: \u201cProcess knowledge is hard to write down as an instruction: you can give someone a well-equipped kitchen and an extraordinarily detailed recipe, but absent cooking experience, it\u2019s hard to make a great dish.\u201d I consider two advantages to be important. First, Chinese workers produce most of the world\u2019s goods, which means that they\u2019re capturing most of the knowledge that comes from the production process. Second, China is a large and dynamic market. On top of these structural factors, Chinese firms have stiffened their resolve to master important technologies after repeated US sanctions. On the supply side, Chinese workers engage in a greater amount of technological learning than anyone else, for the simple reason that most supply chains are in China. Chinese workers are working with the latest tools to produce most of the world\u2019s goods; over the longer term, my hypothesis is that they\u2019ll be able to replicate the tooling and make just as good final products. They can do so because the domestic market is huge and dynamic. China today has a large industrial system with few missing backwards and forward linkages, which means it\u2019s a mostly complete learning loop. The government and businesses are motivated by a sense of urgency to master most technologies. I expect that as China\u2019s economy grows more sophisticated, its absorptive and learning capacity will improve. As a long-term strategy, our best hope lies in access to quality education, specifically an education that reinforces the autonomy of the individual by creating a culture that encourages long-term innovation, cultivating critical thinking and emphasizing academic freedom. Education\u2019s purpose is not to give you the answer, but to teach you how to think. Traditional school fails you on this point miserably. On the demand side, a huge and dynamic market will pull forward domestic capabilities. Technological learning in the labor force is a supply-side factor pulling forward the capabilities of Chinese firms. They benefit also from a demand-side factor: the domestic market is really big. People tend to forget that fact. China can become strong because of the tenacious entrepreneurs and the huge domestic market size of a homogenous country where everyone speaks the same language, the same culture, and there is a huge population (it has a population that is bigger than the combined population of Europe and America. It is more than four times as big as that of the US) without any competitors from the outside. In addition, China has developed an ecosystem with VCs and entrepreneurs and companies really helping each other grow iteratively. It\u2019s true that Chinese firms haven\u2019t yet had much success in creating global brands, but perhaps they can be forgiven for focusing on the world\u2019s fastest-growing large market. The size of the market can overwhelm many deficiencies, like problems with the education system stifling creativity. And although consumer internet companies are not strategically so important, they buy upstream components, and are in a more credible position than European and Japanese firms in developing future digital technologies. China today is a huge internal market made up dynamic firms, ingenious workers, and a strong interest in technology. That\u2019s rather like the US in the second half of the 19th century, which built the largest firms in the world mostly by relying on domestic demand. But I also recognize that this case is highly theoretical and a priori. There are many things that can get in the way. Perhaps workers fail to understand the tools they work with well enough to replicate it and invent the next iteration. Although the domestic market is large, policy distortions restrict competitive pressures. Productivity growth has been slowing down for a decade. And perhaps the market conditions aren\u2019t yet right for engagement in high technology; it\u2019s hard to see the case for investing in the development of the world\u2019s best software and robotics systems when Chinese labor is still so much cheaper than developed levels. So let\u2019s see how the constructive case runs against these practical challenges.  II. AUTHORITARIAN SYSTEM Political system is one of the consequences of the culture. In the seven years since the president came to power, the Chinese state has become significantly more authoritarian. Chinese political values have long been at odds with the rest of the world\u2019s. You can look at authoritarian societies see they didn't adopt what we view as universal values around freedoms. There is very little social redeeming value in the present governments in authoritarian countries. Its government is deciding which features of the global status quo to preserve and which to reject, not only in business, culture, and politics but also in such basic values as human rights. The treatment of Xinjiang is often cited as a sign of how far Beijing will go to repress freedom, fundamental human rights (free speech, free privacy, free religion and belief, free market, free enterprise system, freedom of assembly and freedom to petition the government) and crush cultural and regional diversity. And that\u2019s their weakness. China is ranked the #113th in the annual Economic Freedom of the World 2019 (EFW) report. 1. Strict Government Internet Censorship China is the friend we like, but whom we don't respect. They are friend who is rude and then complains that everyone else is rude. They want to play with everyone else, but want to change the rules to suit them. We would invite them to parties but they will sit in a corner not talking to others and then complain that everyone else is not very nice. Although China has some government advantage: building infrastructure, providing investments, and setting the countrywide direction, but starting 1996, the Chinese government began building great firewall to block out anything it did not want its people to know. The Great Firewall of China refers to the country\u2019s online censorship system that blocks a range of foreign websites and slows down Internet traffic as it crosses the border. It\u2019s why Chinese users can\u2019t access Facebook, Twitter or YouTube. China's Great Firewall is already unique in its sophistication in enacting nationwide censorship. But as interesting as its history is, its future is equally fascinating and frightening. China wants this \"cyber sovereignty\" to become an international norm, and it's already using AI to tighten the screws on the few people left who bother trying to climb the wall. China's Great Firewall is more than just the reason people in the country can't access Facebook or YouTube. It has also played a huge role in shaping the country's Internet landscape, allowing giants like Baidu to emerge in the absence of Google. The Great Firewall has stifled innovation and creativity in China. But it\u2019s also been said to help local tech companies by cutting off competition, leading to the rapid growth of homegrown tech giants like Baidu, Tencent and Alibaba, among a variety of other unique technology products that cater to domestic users. By setting up their firewall, they created an environment where their tech babies can grow up without being beaten up in the battle with the big boys. Thanks to China\u2019s Great Firewall, Chinese tech companies don\u2019t need to worry about competing with cash-flush American tech giants at home. They created copies of successful American start-ups in an existing market where they know there's high demand and also there's no competition. US tech companies that refused to help with censorship are gradually forced out or banned, and China\u2019s Internet became kind of isolated island. Some American companies are worried that they will not be able to compete with China in its home market. That market has been mostly closed to foreigners. China can remain rich simply because it has a population that is bigger than the combined population of Europe and America (China\u2019s population is more than four times as big as that of the US), so it has a big domestic market without any competitors from the outside. One way to get into China is to develop your product with a Chinese partner\u2014creating the old capitalist/communist Frankenstein. * There is a lot of evidence: X Box and PlayStation were banned until 2014, for example. In Silicon Valley, some companies concluded that entering China had become all but impossible. Last year, Facebook, which had been asking China for years to let it operate there, abandoned the effort. Reed Hastings, the C.E.O. of Netflix, acknowledged the barriers before him, saying, \u201cWe will be blocked in China for a long time.\u201d By then, the Chinese gamers had grown accustomed to mobile and PC games. Google left China to avoid censorship. In this place the Chinese company Baidu has become the largest search engine in the country. Alibaba has more sales than eBay and Amazon combined. There\u2019s no Facebook in China, and the social messaging platform WeChat now has the user base the size of the entire population of North and South America. Chinese companies are already competing head to head with Silicon Valley and also markets like India, Japan, Southeast Asia, and South America. * What explains this censorship system? As the Party returns to the idea that its absolute power is the only thing standing between China and chaos, the United States, and the embrace of markets, is increasingly seen as an enemy. China\u2019s current leader casts himself as a defender against humiliation and threats from the outside. Xi Jinping promotes the view that China\u2019s system presents an alternative to free-market democracy\u2014what he has called \u201ca new option for other countries and nations who want to speed up their development while preserving their independence.\u201d Every city prizes security, but in Xi\u2019s country it has been elevated to a state religion as his country fends off Western influence. The government had issued an unprecedented order, directing public institutions to remove all foreign computer equipment and software within three years. Instead of city walls, the Party relies on digital defenses; day by day, censors purify the Internet of subversive ideas, and facial-recognition technologies track people\u2019s comings and goings. The simplest answer with which to start is: Because Beijing can. The Chinese probably believe that, even if their system is not fully accepted, history shows there will be little price to be paid for that. From Mao\u2019s Great Leap Forward to Tiananmen Square, and from the internment camps of the Uighurs to the crackdown in Hong Kong, China\u2019s leaders have seen time and again that foreign leaders and businessmen will still want to do business with them regardless of the scale of the atrocity. In recent years, there has been an obvious change in how many in the West view China. But one has yet to see a fundamental reordering of relations with Beijing in Berlin, Paris or London despite that change. Even in the case of Washington, there is a question of just how far America will be willing to go in disengaging from the Chinese market. * Here's what this censorship system could mean for China\u2019s economy \u2014 and the world: This is bad news for the U.S. and other democratic nations. Visits to China, interactions with Chinese officials, and other such exchanges offer valuable insights into Beijing\u2019s ambitions and behavior. What Beijing doesn\u2019t seem to realize is that this is also bad news for China. After you compete and get a sense of how competitors behave and how strong they are, it actually makes sense to explore strategic investments and be able to partner. The more you\u2019re willing to partner, that should grow the pie bigger as well. A country that still needs foreign investment and technology will not benefit from making foreign CEOs wonder whether they or their employees should take the risk of traveling there. A country that harps on how it is misunderstood and mistreated by the West will not benefit from constricting critical channels of communication. NGOs, journalists, and diplomats all play a role in connecting China to the wider world. The alternative is a China that is isolated, poorly understood, and cut off from important ideas and conversations. (*) The Great Firewall also is effective in another way: It promotes self-censorship. Concerns about getting blocked in China, or for Chinese netizens, getting a visit from the police, results in people not talking about certain topics or seeking out certain types of information. China is a top-down system, to put it mildly. Xi Jinping is both \u201cgrandpa Xi\u201d and the country\u2019s boss. Xi has cracked down on bad news leaking out from the mainland, so even if you could complain, it\u2019s officially frowned upon. Mountains of information about China are hidden behind a language barrier, non-agreement to the Hague Convention on legal proceedings, a time difference, opaque ownership of Chinese companies, industrial secrecy, regime secrecy and a lack of those basic freedoms that allow the truth to come out. People in the West do not have much documentary evidence or sworn testimony in their hands, because China is still shrouded in secrecy, but it is obvious for the world to see. It seems people here do what they are asked to do. They follow the leader, so long as the leader is providing them with safety, employment and, for the higher educated, Western-style opportunities. I wasn\u2019t there long enough to get a sense of people\u2019s disdain for Xi, or the Communist Party. The country is slowing, but it is growing. If you had to chose a side, for or against Beijing, people are mostly pleased with what their country has become in this hybrid capitalist/communist system of theirs. As they should. There is no space for speech freedom in China now. Prescribed media guidelines are not unusual in China, where reporters and private newspapers and magazines operate within a heavily-censored environment that is tightly controlled by Communist authorities. We're increasingly seeing laws and regulations in China that undermine free expression and people's human rights. These local laws are each individually troubling, especially when they shut down speech by punishing dissent in places where there isn't democracy or freedom of the press. Free speech has been further restricted; civil rights lawyers have been locked up and non-governmental organizations have been closed down. Since he took power in late 2012, Xi has tightened ideological control and suppressed civil freedoms across the nation, reversing a trend under his predecessor to give Chinese media some limited scope to expose and report regional corruption and lower-level officials\u2019 misdeeds. Even within the Communist party, cadres are threatened with disciplinary action for expressing opinions that differ from the leadership. The impacts on the individuals are multi-faceted. Economically, they would cut off your livelihood [academics get fired, writers can\u2019t publish and no one dares hire you]. You would get sidelined by mainstream society, you\u2019d lose friends and, worse than that, you might lose your personal freedoms, so a number of intellectual elites have chosen to leave China. Under Xi\u2019s crackdown on speech and academic freedoms, a number of prominent liberal intellectuals, journalists, rights lawyers and NGO workers have either been silenced, jailed or escaped abroad. But it's even worse when it tries to impose their speech restrictions on the rest of the world. Chinese censorship is also spreading beyond its borders. Now, China is seeking to control not just what is said in China but what is said about China, too. China is not exporting a state ideology in the manner of the Soviet Union. But it wants to make the world more amenable to its ideology, so it has demanded extraterritorial censorship, compelling outsiders to accept limits on free speech beyond its borders. The increasingly Kafkaesque legal system of mainland China stands in stark contrast with the world\u2019s rule of law. But during the Xi period, the mainland\u2019s intolerance for free speech and thuggish attitude towards the law has seeped into other countries. The Chinese president is sincerely indifferent about whether a foreign country is a dictatorship or a democracy. Insisting that countries cannot have views on each other\u2019s internal political systems is a vital defence mechanism for the Chinese Communist party as it fends off outside pressure on human rights or the rule of law. Beijing argues that foreigners who express views on a sensitive topic, such as Hong Kong, are interfering in China\u2019s internal affairs. And this is where it crosses over into interference in free speech in the west. This is much more than an effort to stop foreigners standing in Tiananmen Square and shouting \u201cfreedom for Hong Kong\u201d. China\u2019s efforts to control and censor speech at home are gradually being internationalized, reaching into foreign corporations, the international media, the seminar rooms and campuses of western universities, and the statements and policies of foreign governments. China feels perfectly entitled to interfere when foreigners express views that displease Beijing. The increasingly tough tone of the Chinese media is part of Beijing\u2019s efforts to inflame nationalism at home and intimidate multinational companies into toeing the party line. The Communist state is becoming more and more aggressive in pressuring foreign companies to choose between self-censorship and the loss of access to what will soon be the world\u2019s largest market. It showed the government\u2019s eagerness to punish foreign companies until they embraced the party\u2019s point of view wholeheartedly. If you show your willingness to back down and kowtow to the party, the party considers you a pushover. They will increasingly encroach on your bottom line. When it comes to the media and academia, Beijing uses both visas and market access as a weapon. China specialists who are barred from the country can have their careers blighted. So the pressure to self-censor is huge. This raises a larger question about the future of the global Internet. China is building its own Internet focused on very different values, and is now exporting the authoritarian social values and visions of its tightly-controlled internet culture to other countries. Until recently, the Internet in almost every country outside China has been defined by American platforms with strong free expression values. There's no guarantee these values will win out. A decade ago, almost all of the major Internet platforms were American. Today, six of the top ten are Chinese. Obviously, China wants to be the dominant economic and military power of the world, spreading its authoritarian vision for society and its corrupt practices worldwide. So far this century, democracy and free speech only exist in America. * There is a lot of evidence: When the mayor of Wuhan was asked on China\u2019s state broadcaster why he had not disclosed the severity of the coronavirus outbreak in his city, he replied that his hands were tied by laws that required him to seek authorization from Beijing. In a country that insists on political unity, the mayor\u2019s interview stands as a rare example of stresses between central and local government breaking into the open, as China\u2019s response to the virus becomes one of the biggest challenges to Xi Jinping\u2019s presidency since he took power in 2012. The local government in Wuhan did not have the power to act decisively because they were at the bottom of a chain of command that started with the \u201csupreme leader\u201d \u2014 a Mao-era title recently bestowed on Mr Xi. It\u2019s during a public health emergency like this that we really see the flaws of China\u2019s political system and how the bureaucracy has weakened [under Xi Jinping\u2019s rule]. Everyone \u2014 from the central government to the local government to the bureaucracy to the party to the military \u2014 was waiting for orders from the \u2018supreme leader\u2019 before acting. Mr Xi has centralized power to a greater extent than any leader in decades in his quest to \u201crejuvenate\u201d the nation. There's a natural inclination for party officials at all levels to bury negative information and censor dissenting views irrespective of who\u2019s in charge in Beijing. Much like the SARS outbreak, in the early 2000s, the Chinese government is being accused of trying to keep this latest outbreak under wraps to avoid showing weakness by blaming local officials, exonerating top leaders, censoring the media and threatening \u201crumor mongers\". Given the mediocre performance of the Chinese economy and the problematic turn in U.S.-China relations\u2014a turn not everyone in the Party thinks is wise\u2014getting pinned for an ineffective response to the virus and the resulting deaths of thousands is certainly not something Xi at this moment wants. To prevent critics from exposing bad policy and challenging decisions made by the government, or opposing misrule, trumped-up charges spanning from \u201ctroublemaking\u201d to \u201csubversion\u201d are concocted to set up victims for public derision. Factual messages about the coronavirus outbreak are being scrubbed from some social media outlets. Certain terms related to the outbreak were blocked on WeChat -- including neutral and factual information. Recently, the country detained an activist who criticized Xi's handling of the coronavirus. Yet, over the past two months, it is reported that more than 300 Chinese have been detained, reprimanded and accused of \u201cspreading rumors\u201d, for talking about what happened in the virus-infected areas of China. In a further reminder of the government\u2019s strict controls, two citizen journalists who were reporting from the epicentre of China\u2019s coronavirus outbreak have vanished this week, apparently detained. The Chinese military surgeon who exposed the government\u2019s cover-up of the Sars outbreak in 2002-2003 has been under de facto house arrest since last year. Detention came after he wrote to the top leadership asking for a reassessment of the 1989 Tiananmen Square pro-democracy movement. Many of those actively involved in Chinese online communities have toed the party line and were mobilized in vilification campaigns to bully individuals deemed to be \u201cbad-mouthing\u201d the motherland. Weeks ago, the doctor who first alerted his colleagues of the coronavirus \u2013 but was silenced by police \u2013 died from the disease. And this morning, one of Wuhan's most senior doctors and the director of the Wuchang hospital in Wuhan died after contracting the coronavirus. This malevolence is even more pronounced against what Beijing regards as \u201crenegade peripheries\u201d such as the \u201cdisobedient rioters\u201d in Hong Kong, the \u201crogue province\u201d of Taiwan, or the Uighur population of Xinjiang. Under Xi Jinping, the inclination to suppress has become endemic and, in this case, contributed to a prolonged period of inaction that allowed the virus to spread. The country is expelling three reporters from The Wall Street Journal. Earlier this month, the outlet published a coronavirus-related opinion piece with a headline that China called racist. In response, it's now revoking three reporters' press credentials \u2013 though it seems none of them contributed to the opinion piece. And it's calling on the Journal to apologize and \"hold the persons involved accountable.\" China has long tried to silence critics at home. But this is seen as an escalation to do that abroad, as it's rare for China to expel a foreign correspondent. We're beginning to see this in social media. While WhatsApp is used by protesters and activists everywhere due to strong encryption and privacy protections, on TikTok, the Chinese app growing quickly around the world, mentions of Hong Kong protests are censored, even in the US. A pro-Hong Kong tweet from the general manager of the Houston Rockets about his support of the Hong Kong protests led to a clash between China and America\u2019s National Basketball Association, which resulted in NBA games being pulled from Chinese state television. This row was unusually high-profile because it featured the US and sport. But it fits a familiar pattern. Foreign countries and companies now have to cope with Chinese efforts to police their speech on an ever-widening range of taboo subjects, including Tibet, Taiwan, Xinjiang, Hong Kong, recent Chinese history, human rights and Beijing\u2019s territorial claims in the South and East China Seas. Last year, the Chinese government demanded that foreign airlines remove references to Taiwan from their websites, because China views Taiwan as a renegade province. Other companies that have bowed to pressure from Beijing include Marriott hotels and United Airlines, both of which were accused of encouraging the idea that Taiwan is a separate country. People\u2019s Daily, the flagship newspaper of the Chinese Communist Party, and the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs took aim at Apple, accusing it of serving as an \u201cescort\u201d for \u201crioters\u201d in Hong Kong by providing an app that allows protesters to track police movements. Months earlier, at the request of the Chinese government, Shutterstock had begun censoring a few searches by users based in China for politically volatile subjects like \"Taiwan flag.\" China has placed similar pressure on the Italian company Versace; German companies, including Mercedes-Benz; and airlines from around the world. * Why does China want to repress free speech? Overlapping the desire to look more successful in handling issues is Beijing\u2019s goal of preserving Chinese President Xi\u2019s reputation as an effective leader. Although it is correct to see Xi Jinping as perhaps the most powerful PRC leader since Mao, or at least Deng Xiaoping, that power has come at the expense of the more typical consensus-style rule that preceded him. Xi has consolidated his sway not by accommodating his rivals but by squeezing them through intimidation and arrests in the guise of cleaning up the Party. Given how much corruption there was\u2014and because it was an essential element in leading party members to be \u201cloyal\u201d to the existing regime\u2014Xi\u2019s anti-corruption effort has both increased his power by cowering or eliminating pockets of competitors within the Party and, at the same time, likely narrowed his base of support within the Party. As long as Xi is seen as being successful, there is little room to challenge his rule. Should that assessment change, however, it is not hard to imagine grudge-holding party members attempting to coalesce in an effort to challenge him. * What could self-censorship mean for China? Nationalism could get out of hand and hurt China\u2019s global image. It really is insane for anyone to hope for more regulation on speech. It's completely unprincipled. You need to imagine your enemies in control of those tools. That should include the politicians you think are lying and the opaque media companies you already don't trust. The idea of facing the unvarnished truth makes us anxious. To get over that, we need to understand intellectually why untruths are scarier than truths and then, through practice, get accustomed to living with them. We have nothing to fear from knowing the truth. Criticism is the best thing that can happen to a person/company/country. 1/ It means people care. 2/ It shows you what you can improve. If you\u2019re sick, it\u2019s natural to fear your doctor\u2019s diagnosis\u2014what if it\u2019s cancer or some other deadly disease? As scary as the truth may turn out to be, you will be better o\ufb00 knowing it in the long run because it will allow you to seek the most appropriate treatment. The same holds for learning painful truths about your own strengths and weaknesses. Knowing and acting on the truth is what I call the \u201cbig deal\u201d for a country. It\u2019s important not to get hung up on all those emotion- and ego-laden \u201clittle deals\u201d that can distract you from the overall mission. Smart people who can thoughtfully disagree are the greatest teachers, far better than a professor assigned to stand in front of a board and lecture at you. One reason that freedom of speech is so important is that doubt is the foundation of science. When you close a topic to discussion, you are saying that it is decided, and scientific inquiry is no longer allowed into that domain. \u201cThe fundamental cause of the trouble is that in the modern world the stupid are cocksure while the intelligent are full of doubt.\u201d\u200a\u2014\u200aBertrand Russell People hate things that contradict their deeply-held beliefs. But since ideas that contradict deeply-held beliefs are the most interesting (see the history of physics for example), anyone on the hunt for interesting ideas will tend to offend a lot of people. You must have contention, a clash of ideas. If Galileo had not challenged the Pope, we would still believe the world is flat, right? And Christopher Columbus might never have discovered America. The conventional-minded say, as they always do, that they don't want to shut down the discussion of all ideas, just the bad ones. You'd think it would be obvious just from that sentence what a dangerous game they're playing. But I'll spell it out. There are two reasons why we need to be able to discuss even \"bad\" ideas. The first is that any process for deciding which ideas to ban is bound to make mistakes. ... The second reason it's dangerous to ban the discussion of ideas is that ideas are more closely related than they look. Also, if you try to control every-thing, you train your citizens to defer to you\u2014and you train them to fear risk. Unfortunately, that's increasingly becoming their culture. We're seeing the impulse to restrict speech and enforce new norms around what people can say. In the current political atmosphere, which values obedience more than competence, local people have an incentive to avoid taking responsibility. Increasingly, we're seeing people try to define more speech as dangerous because it may lead to political outcomes they see as unacceptable. Some hold the view that since the stakes are so high, they can no longer trust their fellow citizens with the power to communicate and decide what to believe for themselves. Americans think that free speech and freedom of press is basic for people. But in China they think state capacity, collective culture, the community, the country, are the first things they need to think about. Most ordinary Chinese people don\u2019t understand why democracy is so important for America. They\u2019ll say, \u201cYes, America brings democracy to Iraq, to Afghanistan, to lots of countries. But these countries are getting killed now.\u201d They say, \u201cWe\u2019re not democratic, but we live in a peaceful country. We have a good living standard.\u201d They are too quick to dismiss what people love about life outside. They\u2019ve lost their basic ability to think independently. If peace means a willingness to lose freedom and basic human rights, dominated politically, humiliated and segregated, I don't want peace! It also strikes me that they are expert practitioners of \u201cwhataboutism\", countering any criticism of China by pointing to a different sin committed by the West \u2014 though in this case I find the comparison unconvincing. The death on 7 February of doctor Li Wenliang, who had tried to warn colleagues about the virus but was reprimanded and silenced by security forces, triggered an outpouring of grief and anger and an unusual public discussion about censorship. It is an encouraging sign that so many Chinese netizens have this time sensed that freedom and democracy is not just an abstract slogan, but a practical value that might some day protect their own lives and assets. When enough people realize the values of democracy and freedom align not only with some moral high ground but also benefit their daily lives, the momentum for change will be unstoppable. The biggest concern, though, is that they will cherry-pick their demands for freedom of speech, as in the Li case. If they avoid seeing the system itself as the root of the problem, they will never eradicate the true cause of the crisis, and we will see more martyrs. * What's the solution? China should stop worrying about looking good\u2014instead they should worry about achieving their goals. Put their insecurities away and get on with achieving their goals. Re\ufb02ect and remind themselves that an accurate criticism is the most valuable feedback they can receive. They need to learn from those they disagree with, or even offend them. See if they can find the truth in what they believe. Trying to understand the reasoning of people who disagree with them is the quickest way to get an education and to increase their probability of being right. Imagine how silly and unproductive it would be to respond to your ski instructor as if he were blaming you when he told you that you fell because you didn\u2019t shift your weight properly. It\u2019s no di\ufb00erent if a supervisor points out a \ufb02aw in your work process. Fix it and move on. Psst\u2026When I have kids someday, I think the most valuable thing I could teach them is being comfortable around people and opinions they disagree with. One of the qualities I most value in a person is \u201cfun to disagree with,\u201d and that, more than anything, has really shaped for me a life of wonderful, passionate weirdos. They can control thought without limiting speech by defining the limits of acceptable thought while allowing for lively debate within these barriers. For example, Fox News and MSNBC set the implicit limits on acceptable political opinions in America. 2. Protectionist Regulation Speaking about regulatory problem, the government regulates too much. It cost too much to invent new things. Chinese people lack the freedom to fail. * There is a lot of evidence: This is not a happy time to be an entrepreneur seeking to list your firm on one of China's stock exchanges. Nor is your situation better if you\u2019re one of the Securities Commission members charged with approving listing applications. Chinese companies aren\u2019t doing very well, and Beijing thinks it\u2019s because the standards on initial public offerings (IPOs) weren\u2019t strict enough in the first place. A better winnowing process is needed to ensure that only the cr\u00e8me de la cr\u00e8me of Chinese companies gets listed. Those not making the grade are viewed as \u201clocusts that must be killed,\u201d or as viruses, with the commissioners\u2019 mission being to \u201cprevent diseases from entering the body via the mouth.\u201d That kind of thinking would put a dampener on an entrepreneur seeking seed capital no matter how great he thinks his idea is. In China, the only way to obtain seed capital is first to get regulatory approval. That\u2019s a process that can take years. And the commissioners aren\u2019t inclined to view applications benignly, for they will be held \u201caccountable for life\u201d for each IPO they approve. Only last month, Chinese authorities swooped down to seize a large private insurer deemed to have become too risky. One would not want to be one of those who approved its application. Gig work in China\u2019s fledgling ride-hailing industry is coming to an end as new regulations make part-time driving overly expensive. On January 1, ride-hailing apps in China start banning drivers who operate without the required \u201cdouble licenses\u201d: one for drivers and another for the cars they steer. Municipal governments across the country have nuanced stipulations for what these certificates entail, but in general, the fresh rules aim to more closely vet drivers transporting passengers around. Like a lot of China\u2019s nascent industries, ride-hailing took off quickly in part thanks to relatively lax government oversight at the start. The first set of industry laws took effect in 2016, when the country officially legalized apps like Uber, which was later acquired by its local competitor Didi. Since then, Chinese authorities have gradually rolled out more rules, and the strictest regulations, including the rollout of the double licenses last year. There\u2019s also a lot of unreasonable market access limitations imposed by local governments on makers of electric vehicles. The government does not allow companies to test fleets of driverless cars in urban areas. Long-time crypto watchers will recall 2013, when China banned exchanges from allowing people to buy into bitcoin and other crypto coins using the local yuan currency. The difference is that in the US, people are applauded for being themselves. There's a lot of value placed on independence and fighting the \u201csystem\". Silicon Valley encourages risk-taking. American people are innately risk-takers. Silicon Valley embraces risk using an \u201caffordable loss principle\u201d in discovery of \u201cwhat works\u201d. It celebrates risk, yet at the same time it has some of the best mechanisms for avoiding the consequences of risk in the world. Gary Shapiro, author of two best-selling books on innovation, explains the innovative success of the United States and Israel: \u201cBoth countries share the unique view that entrepreneurial failure is an education rather than a badge of dishonor. They don\u2019t punish risk-taking the way many other nations do.\u201d What made Silicon Valley really attractive has been it is one giant incubator as a society, with a lot of pay-it-forward culture and a low cost of trying. SV essentially places zero penalty on failure. You have almost unlimited upside if something works and very limited downside. They\u2019re working with a huge net. It\u2019s easier to take risk when you are insulated from it. It's a culture in which people are willing to bypass convention in any area, not be overly biased by why things can't be done, but rather take the approach, how one might take a shot at it? It is one where people are not afraid of failure but just look at the consequences of success, not the probability of failure. It is more experimental, less planned, more iterative, and evolutionary even as to the goals, let alone the methods. It is more of a Wild West risk-taking culture, at least at the personal level of things. Entrepreneurs accept risk as given and focus on controlling the outcomes at any given level of risk; they also frame their problems spaces with personal values and assume greater personal responsibility for the outcomes. Founders think in action\u2026\u201dFire-ready-aim\u201d. They pursue opportunities without regard to resources currently controlled. Working at a startup is like riding a roller coaster and rolling the dice. Building a startup is so hard with so many obstacles and ups and downs in the way that practical people become too pragmatic and turn big visions into decent ideas instead of sticking with their original vision. I think it takes real nerve to ride this roller coaster for very long, and you have to normalize the madness or go crazy yourself. See this for more information. Nothing stands still in Silicon Valley; the place has a kinetic energy. Look at the top ten firms in Silicon Valley. Every five or ten years, the list completely changes, with perhaps one or two exceptions. The entire venture capital industry essentially invests in failures, since the majority of the companies they fund eventually go under. These entrepreneurs deserve their money because of the risks they take. But you don\u2019t see people jumping off the tops of buildings here. They tend to land on their feet. They tend to land in places like this, drinking cappuccinos, because the risk is a peculiar kind of risk. Most of the people in high tech will admit if they lost their job, they would find another one. They might even find a better one. * Here's what this regulation could mean for China: The main way our society works is through innovation. No innovation, no growth. The single most important contributor to a nation\u2019s economic growth is the number of start-ups that grow to a billion dollars in revenue within 20 years. There\u2019s no investment where money works as hard as it does in a tech startup. Driven founders, leveraged with code, capital, media, and intellect, sweating every dollar spent. If a place is a magnet for talent, its odds of achieving success are greatly magnified. That's why an enlightened society would encourage and educate founders and investors, not restrict them. It\u2019s important to de-risk it a.k.a reduce downside of risk-taking, preserve the entrepreneurship and risk-taking that has allowed the creation of all these incredible businesses advancing the world. If a country is going to attract people with extremely high potential, the first thing it has to do is let them thrive. It has to give them the degrees of freedom to do both what they can do very well, and to some extent, allow them to make mistakes. You want people to increase their proficiency and improve their craft. You want to create a culture where that\u2019s possible and encouraged. Countries should encourage a culture of tinkering, experimentation, and following intellectual curiosity. Tech is all about the exchange of new ideas. So you can only go where people are open to new things. A country can incentivize more founders by making median founder outcome closer to average and by removing economic and cultural friction. They should systematically remove barriers and bottlenecks to starting companies for people interested in it: celebrate starting companies as a thing for ambitious people to do globally, see startup failures on resumes as badges of honor instead of blemishes, create communities to find co-founders and founder support, etc. No progress is possible without trial, error and failure. Not in business, not in science, not in nature. Without failure, there is no learning, no progress, and no success. If you keep doing the same thing over and over again, then there\u2019s no innovation. You don\u2019t get innovation by following the rules all the time, you get it by taking a risk. You don\u2019t succeed unless you take risks. Price of extreme creativity is natural resistance to all things structure and rules. Creativity, like entrepreneurship, thrives in an environment that welcomes risk, not in one where risk-taking is punished. By its very nature, creation is risky. The world of technology thrives best when individuals are left alone to be different, creative, and disobedient. Innovation requires experiments (most of which fail). It works best when the innovator isn\u2019t required to ask for permission first. And when you take risks you sometimes fail. When that happens you pick yourself up and start over again. Except that doesn\u2019t happen when failure means you get a visit from your friendly local commissar. Billionaire Mark Cuban explains it this way. \u201cFailure is part of the success equation.\u201d Failure is acknowledged as a natural part of the process of innovation. Being able to view failure as an asset is the hallmark of an entrepreneurial environment. This is why I\u2019m amused when I hear people sneering at Donald Trump\u2019s bankruptcies, as if failing when taking big risks is a cause for shame. Free market capitalism is the most effective system to drive entrepreneurship and jobs. If you look at the number of jobs that have been created by the free enterprise system, this is the best thing going. I\u2019m a big believer in the entrepreneurial spirit that helped create lots of great businesses around the world, the free enterprise system, fair, free and open markets. We\u2019ve always been a proponent of a fair and free and open market and we recognize that\u2019s got to be balanced by the public interest. Entrepreneurship has created the greatest gains in our standard of living to date, even if it\u2019s hard to grasp the wild polarization of wealth in society. I don\u2019t see capitalism\u2019s lock on the best operating system for society changing any time soon \u2014 the most driven humans drive humanity forward, it\u2019s that simple. Conversely, if we pursue free services and money we will drive more power into the hands of a larger and larger incompetent government, and I think we know where that will end up \u2014 and it won\u2019t be great for anyone. No one is attracted towards an authoritarian country (a system of government that is very authoritarian) or totalitarian dictatorship. Rigid controls in politics and education would constrain radical innovation. Regulation can shut down iteration and experimentation, and nuclear tech is definitely the case. Economic reformers are worried about the increasing emphasis on the role of the state in the economy, fearing that it could kill entrepreneurship. If you try to constrain really talented people, you\u2019re only going to create a mirror of yourself with your same strengths and weaknesses. You HAVE to let people do stuff that you disagree with. You can\u2019t tell how good they are if they\u2019re just replicating what you\u2019d have them do. Xi\u2019s \u201cMade in China 2025\u201d economic project aims to displace the U.S. as the world\u2019s technological power, while another plan calls for dominance in Artificial Intelligence by 2030. China has aspirations to become a world power equal to the United States, and many American declinists believe this is inevitable. I don\u2019t share their view. So long as the Chinese people lack the freedom to fail, China will remain weak. The country that today funds its failing companies is running out of money, and the international community is running out of patience, as can be seen from the tariffs President Trump is levying on Chinese steel. China\u2019s response is to try to strong-arm its companies into succeeding. It will have the opposite effect. The key to success is the ability to extract the lessons out of each of these experiences and to move on with that new knowledge. Anyone that doesn\u2019t continue to experiment and doesn\u2019t embrace failure, will eventually get in a desperate position where the only thing they can do is a Hail Mary bet at the very end of their existence. * What's the solution? Their flagrant abuses of intellectual property and human rights, their suppression of freedom, independence, and consolidated democracy, whether in China, Hong Kong, in northwest China or in anywhere else, will not stand. If you\u2019re intellectually honest and advocate for a system that controls people, turn over the keys to your enemies for a dry run. You cannot be a great leader \u2014 and you cannot be a great country \u2014 when you oppose freedom, when you are so brutal to the people. Everyone deserves a leader or a government that can help them achieve their dreams more than focus on controlling them. For a long time, we\u2019ve known that, on average, freer economies are richer, grow faster and have longer life expectancies. Since diversity of thought and idea is the key to economic growth, it is time for Mr Xi\u2019s five \u201cNOs\u201d to be matched with some western \u201cNOs\u201d \u2014 including a decisive \u201cNO\u201d to restrictions on free speech, privacy, free market and free enterprise system. Finding a way out for mainland China to evolve into a more liberal and law-governed society and adopt Western-oriented secular modernization, allowing some degree of cultural freedom, embrace capitalism and open its economy to foreign investment and domestic entrepreneurship would require Mr Xi to display a humility, open-mindedness and tolerance for opposing points of view that seem completely alien to him and the system that he has created. Yet any fair account has to accept that Mr Xi can also claim some successes, so it is possible I will be just the latest in a long line of western skeptics who get China wrong. But it is hard to look at the Xi cult and not feel a sense of foreboding. ",

            "answer_text": "No. China\u2019s technology will not surpass America\u2019s. Instead, America\u2019s technology will lag behind China\u2019s. It is not the same thing. When one says that China\u2019s technology will surpass that of America\u2019s, it means that the Chinese are working hard to surpass American in the field of technology while America will be making normal/standard technological progress. When it is said that America\u2019s technology will lag behind that of China\u2019s, it means that the Chinese are making standard/normal progress and America is falling behind the standard. In other words, China is not becoming a technological giant. Instead, America is gradually reducing into a dwarf. This is a matter of preference and priorities. Technological advancement is normal preference for China but it is not the normal preference for America. Let me explain this with examples.  This (above) is an aircraft carrier battle group. It is the standard military method of mobilizing a vast number of personnel and weapons across the globe. One such battle group typically consists of: an aircraft carrieraround 70 assault aircraft, which take off from the carrierseveral destroyers (or frigates)several logistics vessels (which collect and communicate battle related data to the carrier and escorts)several submarinesa supply shiparound 7500 peopleThe cost of building the carrier is between 11 and 14 billion USD. The cost of other ships is not public but we can safely assume that the rest of the ships (escorts) cost around 6 billion in total. This makes the cost of building one aircraft carrier around 20 billion dollars. The price of maintaining and operating a carrier group is around 6.5 million dollars per day, or 2.3 billion dollars annually. America currently has 12 aircraft carriers in its naval fleet, burdening the economy 27.6 billion dollars annually. American navy plans on building one super-carrier (an aircraft carrier running on nuclear energy) every 6 years or so. This hints at the American government\u2019s/military\u2019s mindset: project power across the globe and look for trouble. China so far has no aircraft carrier, but it building one for domestic defense purposes. In the last 2 decades alone, America has directly invaded Afghanistan and Iraq, and has meddled in the internal affairs of Syria, Yemen and Venezuela, to name a few. The time which American statesmen should have spent discussing initiatives for science and technology, were lost in debating whether America should \u201cpull out\u201d from Syria and Afghanistan or not. America was destined to lag behind China in technological development ever since the first American construction firm uprooted its production units from American soil and planted them on Chinese. This was a sign American politicians should not have taken lightly. It meant that China was more conductive for business production than America. Ever since then, capital has been escaping American coffers towards China. When your first priority is projecting your military power across the world and to interfere with other countries\u2019 internal affairs, you do gradually start lagging behind other nations not infected with this mentality.
