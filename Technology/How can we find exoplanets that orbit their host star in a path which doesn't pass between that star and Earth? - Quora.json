            "answer_text": "Exoplanets that pass between Earth and their host stars cause a miniscule dip in the \u2018light curve\u2019 of the star, but they are a special case, and surely are a small subset of exoplanets that may be orbiting in different orientations. Now to address the question: How do we detect the others? Let's think about a familiar game played by parents with their toddlers - holding the arms and swinging a child in a circle. Think about it OR better still, grab your 3-year old by both wrists and swing the giggling girl / boy around in a circle. You represent the massive star, the child represents an orbiting exoplanet. What do you observe? Watch the parent (star) ! The child orbits the parent following a relatively simple curve, but the parent in the centre will be wobbling around their barycentre ie their common centre of gravity. The heavier the child, the more the parent will wobble. The child's orbit also follows a wavy line but this is barely noticeable. Actual exoplanets are invisible. Now let's think about an exoplanet orbiting a distant star. The planet is invisible. The light reflecting off such a distant planet is completely lost in the glare of the parent star, and if its orbit is not on a plane that matches our line of sight, it is invisible BUT not undetectable - how??? Remember, the parent star will be wobbling around the common barycentre of the pair, and its presence is obvious. What is less obvious is the presence of other exoplanets in that system. Large planets close close to the parent star will make the star wobble the most and these close-in [HOT], large Jupiter-sized exoplanets were the first to be discovered, and are called \u2026 \u201cHot Jupiters.\u201d ",

            "answer_text": "One could find exoplanets by measuring changes in the star\u2019s velocity by observing a shift in the star\u2019s spectrum that is due to the Doppler effect. From this, astronomers can deduce that there\u2019s something else that is causing the star to move. This is called the radial velocity method. A variant of this method involves measuring changes in the star\u2019s proper motion, in this case, it\u2019s called the astrometric method. Another method that astronomers use is called direct imaging and it is what it sounds like, taking a picture of the planet. This only works for exoplanets that are far enough away from their star that they can actually see the exoplanet. A third method that astronomers use is called microlensing. Microlensing works like this. When an exoplanet passes in front of its host star, it\u2019ll bend the light of the star. This is a consequence of Einstein\u2019s theory of general relativity. the problem with this method is that it requires a very precise alignment of the host star, planet, and us. It also doesn\u2019t tell too much information about the host star, and doesn\u2019t say much about the planet itself except for the planet\u2019s mass. ",

            "answer_text": "There are two main ways to find ExoPlanets - one (as you expect) is that the light from the star is somewhat dimmed as the planet passes in front of it. But the other is to detect the wobble in the star\u2019s position due to the planet\u2019s gravity tugging on it as it\u2019s orbiting around it. This manifests as a slight change in the frequency of the light coming from the star (the Doppler Shift) as the star wobbles relative to us. The second technique can spot planets that don\u2019t pass between us and the star - so long as the plane of the planetary orbit isn\u2019t too close to being at right angles to our line of sight. Using both techniques together is very useful because the light diminution let\u2019s us estimate the diameter of the planet - and the doppler shift lets us estimate it\u2019s gravitational field - and therefore it\u2019s mass. From that we can arrive at it\u2019s density - which is invaluable to determine what is a rocky planet and what a gaseous one. ",

Around half of orbits won\u2019t have \u2018crossings\u2019, so they must be detected via gravitational effects, or reflected EM radiation (\u2018light\u2019). The new JWST should help with the latter. The former works because gravity works both ways of course, i.e. the moon has effects on our own motion, and would also affect any other moons. Such effects demand great precision to detect, but of course we have no idea how many we\u2019re missing. ",
