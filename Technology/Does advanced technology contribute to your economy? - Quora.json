            "answer_text": "Technology is something to resist. Whether it foments antisocial behavior, cultural polarization, or wide-scale labor disruptions, technological change is a frustrating and perennial struggle facing society. The benefits largely accrue to a few oligarchs. More existentially, digital technologies rob us of our humanity, as automation and machine learning become a dangerous master we must serve. At least, that\u2019s the woeful impression you may get from some critics. Given this bleak view of affairs, it\u2019s a wonder that anyone tolerates modern technology at all. Why allow such traumatic social shifts if nothing worthwhile comes of it? It is true that antipathy to technological change animates many proposals for limitations or outright bans on certain applications of technology. Yet apart from a few odd countries, no governments prohibit technological innovation altogether. Why? The truth is that many people realize that technological innovation, economic growth, and overall human wellbeing are intricately linked and that stemming our innovative capacity means handicapping our potential to progress. If we don\u2019t allow some disruption today, then our overall quality of life will be much lower tomorrow. Economists have tried to better understand the relationship between innovation and growth for decades. A new paper by Mercatus scholars James Broughel and Adam Thierer assembles the literature on growth theory and accounting to paint a picture of just how important technology is to long-term growth.
