            "answer_text": "I mean technology helps in many ways. But I think one way it reduces lifespans is that a lot of people are addicted to it. So, people get in vehicular accidents because they are texting, don\u2019t take care of their bodies because they game too much (I have gamed a fair amount, so I really mean like you aren\u2019t doing anything other than that), and there is some evidence that cellphone use could be reducing sperm counts and potentially damaging DNA passed onto kids. In addition, technology has made it easier to compare ourselves to one another on social media, so it\u2019s important to recognize that it kind of spreads feelings of depression quickly which may lead people to end their lives. These are ways technology is reducing lifespans. Ironically though, technology has also made certain surgeries possible, give people hope when they felt isolated, and saved many lives. So while it does reduce the human lifespan, it also extends the human lifespan. It\u2019s just that using technology needs to be done in a critically evaluating way. ",
