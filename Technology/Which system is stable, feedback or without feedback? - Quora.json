            "answer_text": "A system without feedback is a leaf blown on the wind, unable to counteract the force upon it except by a fixed resistance to forces, good or bad. Instead of having steering, imagine a car made heavy to be impervious to the wind on a straight road. A system with negative feedback doesn\u2019t just resist forces upon it, it actively counteracts forces upon it, a reaction that subsides when the force subsides. You steer against the wind to stay on the road. A system with positive feedback reinforces a force upon it and is inherently unstable \u2014 the system will reinforce whatever force acts upon it. If you steer the same way the gust of wind pushes you, you quickly drive off the road into the ditch. As an animal, you are made of hundreds of subsystems with negative feedback that counteract forces from the environment in order to steer where you wish, and not where the wind forces you. In control theory we call these \u201cerror amplifiers\u201d whereby forces of the world are sensed and subtracted from what you command, thus creating an error signal that drives your motors. Your home thermostat is the simplest of these. The error is the difference between the actual temperature and the command temperature you set the dial to \u2014 the error makes the furnace bring the actual temperature rise or fall to the commanded temperature. The negative feedback seeks to keep the error zero. When the command changes or the force of the world on the system changes, the error becomes non-zero, and the furnace or motors are driven to act. A fancy closed loop control system is a baseball batter judging the trajectory of the ball and aiming the bat to hit it. \u201cEye-Hand Coordination\u201d is an error amp, a closed loop feedback control system. Closed loop systems are how we build robots and other industrial machinery. Best examples of open loop systems are religions. \u201cFaith despite what you see.\u201d Best examples of positive feedback systems are politics. \u201cplease sir may I have another smack.\u201d (\u2018Sure Sport, thanks for your vote.\u2019) A drug addiction is a positive feedback system. The sicker it makes you, the more you need it to momentarily feel unsick, so the more desperately you use it. Until it kills you. (See, like politics.) Negative feedback stays centered on the road by equally opposing gusts of hot air from the left and from the right because if you go in the ditch, it doesn\u2019t matter if it was the left or right lies you actually steered along with, the ditch is the ditch.

            "answer_text": "Which system is stable, feedback or without feedback? Stable is an interesting word and you might not be asking the correct question. When you turn on separate hot and cold water taps to take a shower, the flow is probably going to be constant, but the mixed temperature will probably change over time. First the temperature will be cold because the water sitting in the hot pipes has cooled down, then the water gets hot, and after you use up all the hot water in the water tank the flow becomes cold again. The temperature is not constant or stable, the flow is constant and stable assuming an unlimited water supply, both valve positions are stable. Is it stable? Yes. it is predictable and given the same conditions every morning will do the same thing. Are you going to enjoy that shower, probably not. Lets change from an open loop control system to a closed loop control system. Let\u2019s install feedback, you. You turn on the hot full blast to remove all the cold sitting water from the hot water pipes. When the water is hot, you sense that and lessen the hot water flow and now turn on the cold to mix them into a flow and temperature that you enjoy. Over time you might reduce the flow to prolong having a warm shower. As the hot water tank takes in cold water and gets colder, you might increase the ratio of hot to cold to maintain a constant temperature. Because of the feedback controller in this closed loop system, you, the temperature and flow are relatively constant. Is it stable? Depends upon how good you are at twirling the knobs. Temperature and flow can be stable but the valve positions will not be stable. Control stability is mostly concerned with \u201chow much does the output vary over time\u201d. With an unlimited water supply, with no feedback from you, your shower flow will be highly stable in the open loop no messing with the knobs situation. The temperature will be unstable. By adding feedback and caring about temperature, and not flow, the temperature feedback controller, you, is going to be constantly adjusting the flows to maintain a temperature. Whether the temperature swings from icy to scalding depends upon the water pressures being the same, the valve sizes being the same, no other users of water while you\u2019re taking a shower (a toilet flush could drop the cold water flow temporarily and scald you), and how good you are at twiddling the knobs. Imagine your shower water valves are either full on or full off and there is no inbetween. The shower temperature could be controlled to be constant but my guess is unless you are a wickedly fast feedback controller, the temperature will be wildly unstable. If those streams go into a large tank to mix and then flow out the shower nozzle, with on off valves you could probably have a fairly stable shower temperature. Long story short, \u201cstable\u201d is probably not the word you wanted to use in your question. Lived in a condo where the water pressure varied as people in other units flushed their wall hanging commercial toilets. We installed a temperature controller shower valve system to keep the temperature stable. The flow might vary wildly during the shower but at least we had stable temperature. Well worth the expense.
