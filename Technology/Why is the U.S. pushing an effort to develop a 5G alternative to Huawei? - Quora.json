            "answer_text": "Because it doesn\u2019t want Huawei to be the biggest and the best! The US wants to be in the lead and they also, as we all know, want to slow down or even stop Chinese progress if they can. I\u2019m not sure that China can be stopped from ending up with the worlds largest economy in 4 - 6 years - they are simply growing too fast to be overtaken in 5G. They have also been developing 6G and it has been suggested that they control most 6G patents because they started so early. Either way Huawei will make an obscene amount of money from 5G and 6G patents and sales. I don\u2019t imagine that the media attacks pushed by the American administration will slow or stop Huawei. - This is what the US has been doing to convince Americans that they already have 5G. AT&T\u2019s 5GE Explained: What It Is, And What It Isn\u2019t \u201cSince this piece was published at the end of December 2018, AT&T has gone ahead and rolled out its rebranded network. Just as we predicted, 5G E is not good. A study by OpenSignal published on March 22, 2019 found that AT&T\u2019s 5G E was actually slower than the 4G LTE service from Verizon and T-Mobile, although it\u2019s pretty close. Twitter is now full of tweets showing 5G E running at slower speeds than competing 4G LTE networks in the real world, too. That\u2019s because it\u2019s not real 5G. At best, it\u2019s just the same 4G LTE other carriers are offering.\u201d They don\u2019t have the decency to be honest about the crap they are peddling to uninformed citizens. ",

            "answer_text": "This applies to both the USA and the UK. Both are trying to create their OWN 5G infrastructure, instead of relying on China and outsourcing jobs to China. For the US and UK to create their own infrastructure, not only will it help generate revenue for their country, it also creates jobs. Sure, China may be a little furry ahead in 5G, but there are many other companies working on 5G.. such as Samsung and Qualcomm. The US is already too reliant on China, everything we buy basically is made in China\u2026 maybe it's time to stop outsourcing jobs and technology and create our own infrastructure. There's also the fact that Huawei helps create facial recognition security systems and the whole social credit score thing in China.. both the US and UK are democratic countries and they do not want to support this kind of behavior from the Chinese government. So if the US and UK keeps on giving money to Huawei for 5G, then they will just further strengthens China's communism technologies. The security camera system basically scans everyone's faces and it monitors their behaviors and movement, and the government gives everyone a social credit score. So this is not really something the US and UK want to further strengthen. UK bans Huawei from 5G networks, with total removal by 2027 UK follows US in banning Huawei from 5G network https://amp.scmp.com/news/china/society/article/2157883/drones-facial-recognition-and-social-credit-system-10-ways-china ",
