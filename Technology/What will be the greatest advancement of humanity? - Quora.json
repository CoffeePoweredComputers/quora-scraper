When we can digitize our consciousness, move out of our bodies into electronic form, we gain the possibility of immortality, the elimination of the need for vast amounts of resources, the ability to create anything, live in any world, experience anything we want. We gain the ability to populate the solar system, without the need to terraform it. We gain the ability to travel to the stars at the blink of an eye, or the slow way on board a tiny craft which carries the receiver that will allow others to join us when we get there, or even just partway along the way. Want a human body again? No reason we can\u2019t reverse the process and put you in one, made to order\u2026 but we need the transfer ability first. We will be able to expand our consciousness if we like, because we won\u2019t be limited to brain based intelligence or body based sensory apparatus. There are a billion other steps to come, but as I see it, this one is the culmination of all we have done thus far and the spawn of all we can become in the future. ",

I believe the greatest single thing that will be done for the advancement of humanity will be the abandonment of religion in all its forms. Then we will not fight over whose god is the true god or whose method of worship of a particular God is the true way, we will not persecute religious minorities, nor will we support religious institutions that have been the cause of much misery over the centuries. If God exists, he will have to relent and let us into heaven because we have led good lives, not because we have worshipped him. ",

The essence of it has been captured probably most notably in Buddhism, but key ideas also appear in Christianity and almost every religion has worthy notions and goals. But we haven\u2019t quite got it yet; the ideas of acceptance, kindness, compassion. Non-exclusive generosity. Love. The greatest risk to humanity is the belief that technology can solve our enduring greatest problems: greed and hate. We will have enough energy, if we choose well how to use it. We can co-exist with general AI and general-ability robots, if our value system is not exclusively based on the economic or productivity dimension, but recognises the fundamental worth of human beings, and ultimately of all life on our rather unique little world.

Star Trek may inform our imaginations with replicators and the corollary material comfort, but baring major setbacks, the solutions to material needs are at hand. As I type, the industrial revolution and the post-industrial revolutions are being driven into the farthest reaches of civilization. Already, solutions to hunger and disease are at hand: the remaining obstacles are primarily political. It is not a matter of if we can get there but when. And when \u201cwhen\u201d is now, we will enter a new epoch where life is no longer about subsistence, but rather self improvement and mutual cooperation. Granted, there seems a bit idealistic. But when I examine the progress of the last century and extrapolate forward, great hope seems warranted. I will not live to see it, but he can dream for my children and grandchildren. It will be a beautiful thing when we turn that corner. It will be the best thing ever. Personally, Earl Grey, hot, is not top of my list, but, but I think first steps in that are nigh. What is happening in 3D printing is very exciting. Frankly, I am surprised this answer has not already been posted because it is so obvious. ",
