            "answer_text": "Nuclear Weapons are not important. The reasons why we have them is because they use the one argument, \u201cNuclear weapons prevent conventional warfare and stops all wars\u201d. Well in fact it doesn\u2019t. People are too scared to use nuclear weapons. You see if a country was to invade an unarmed country, the only response would be nuclear explosions. The fallout would create deadly atmosphere, oxygen would decrease and the radiation would kill everything in its path. We might of had history of wars. But it does less damage than killing off everyone including the animals that live in the Earth. I am doing my best to support Obama who gave the word that nuclear weapons should be put to an end. The nuclear proliferation pact ends all nukes. Nuclear weapons are important to the people who want them for money and power. As long as they have power and control, they believe they can win over war. That\u2019s bs. No one can win a nuclear war. If 2 sides have these weapons, all those that set them off will only cause deadly fallout and intense heat. Not only will the country have been destroyed, but the fallout would kill everyone on the Earth including the animals. It would also contaminate the oceans, killing off every living creature in the oceans. We also dominate the ocean now. And the ocean is full of deadly nuclear weapons inside submarines and on ships. We at each other really. If you want this to stop then make sure to get Obama involved and tell him that we need a nuclear prevention movement. We could save millions of lives by just doing that. Because when it becomes too late, there will be hell on Earth. But, even if you survived the fallout after being inside a bunker, there\u2019s no food! No rain! No home! No shelter and no safety! All that would see is smashed up buildings on the ground and possibly a big hole in the ground. There would be a wasteland! Now think about it. Would you want to live in a wasteland? No! I certainly wouldn\u2019t! All those nuclear survivors would eventually starve to death and have no car to drive in. They would have to walk miles to get to the sea. And even if they got there, the water would be seen as contaminated and dangerous to drink. No one could survive! All the survivors would die! Now you people who think this is good, I hate you! If you don\u2019t want to end Armageddon, then sacrifice me! I am willing to make a sacrifice to save the world from Armageddon.  But if you don\u2019t want this to happen, then put a vote in for no nuclear weapons. ",

            "answer_text": "Politicians and military officers will tell you that we have to keep them because other nations that might attack us also have them: in short, deterrence. And when they tell you that they're not actually being entirely dishonest. Since the beginning of the modern era, and even more so since the first industrial revolution, the number of people killed by war every year increased until 1945 when America became so far the only nation in history to use nuclear weapons in anger. After WW2, the number of people killed in war every year dropped to under 2 million and, despite the best efforts of American politicians and arms merchants, has stayed down for over 70 years. In fact the period between the surrender is the Empire of Japan and the self destruction of the Soviet Union was the longest period of relative peace since the rise of a terrible warlike religion about 1700 years earlier (christianity). And although the period since the self destruction of the Soviet Union hasn't been quite as peaceful as the Cold War years, with America starting proxy wars of choice for profit on every other continent, we're still living in the most peaceful and safest period so far in recorded human history. And ut would be a lot more peaceful if America wasn't constantly trading the lives of our soldiers and foreign civilians for arms merchant profits. This shift would not have happened if the invention of nuclear weapons hadn't made the prospect of full scale war between nation-states a no win situation. Actually I was thinking about this a few weeks ago, about how most of the wars in the last 2000 years were over which family of wealthy parasites would rule over us proles, and something rather disturbing occurred to me that made me question my belief in total nuclear disarmament. The wealthy parasites who rule over most of the world today don't care about anyone who isn't part of their \u201celite\u201d class or their water carriers in the ruling class anymore than they predecessors did in centuries past. To them the bottom 95% of the population are just another resource to exploit to make themselves more wealthy. If they could get away with it they'd steal our organs to sell on the black market; and they never think twice about sending our family members to die in wars to secure more resources for them to exploit. But in 1945 the game changed, and since then they have not been able to fully indulge their bloodlust because a full scale nuclear war would not only kill the proletariat they steal wealth from, but also themselves. So they've had to restrain themselves to pushing proxy wars against innocent nations that can't defend themselves. Nuclear weapons have saved millions or billions of human lives from the avarice of the super rich, and now i'm not entirely sure we should get rid of the weapons. There are a few other uses for nuclear weapons that we should explore. The busi important to the right of the human race is space travel. Although currently illegal because of several arms control treaties, a method of space travel called nuclear pulse propulsion represents the most efficient, cost effective, and practical method of fast interplanetary space travel currently available; and the US military invented it before NASA was even chartered under the original Project Orion. By detonating small sub-kiloton nuclear shaped charges behind a massive spacecraft with a huge steel plate or hemisphere at its tail end, humans and cargo could be propelled to Mars in under a month. And scaled up versions could carry humans to the closest stars in single human lifetimes. Other \u201cpeaceful\" uses of nuclear weapons include but are not limited to mining, geoengineering, extinguishing forest fires, containing contagious disease outbreaks (by nuking infected areas), and deep space flares. But under the current regiment of international treaty and law these are all illegal. ",
