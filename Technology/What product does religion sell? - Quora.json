            "answer_text": "HOPE.Hope is the best addiction of all. It is what keeps us up and make us do what we do. Religion effectively sells hope. Hope that our life will be free from troubles. Hope that our diseases will get cured soon. Hope that one day we will be rich. Hope that we will end up in heaven. Hope Hope and more Hope!PLACEBO.Religion beautifully sells a remedy similar to a placebo effect. It is merely psychological and has strictly no direct influence in any other aspect. Surrendering in front of God and cribbing about our problems may not give any real solutions but generally gives a peace of mind and also a placebo effect that the problems are solved as God has listened to them.Every benign religion, every religion that\u2019s actually helping somebody sometimes could be functioning like a placebo. It could be totally barren of content and still useful in certain circumstances.                                                       - SAM HARRIS  FEAR.Fear is one of the most effective control as well as motivation factor. Fear of punishment by God actually keeps things in order. Several people merely pretend to be good as they are God fearing. Religion is one major fear factor to keep things in order and control for people without self-conscience. Fear that they might go to hell, instance justice concept like karma, etc are also things which religion sells. PSEUDO-SCIENCE (ANSWER FOR EVERYTHING).There are several spheres where science is yet to explore. That does not mean science is incapable. But religion pulls out one book for every religion and simply answers with one single word - \"GOD\". It is an easy escape from reality and people generally being herd followers accepts this and religion effectively survives and markets this. Fairy tales for children and Religious fantasy for adults - selling mantra of religion. Religion beautifully sells irrationality or pseudo-science.The God excuse, the last resort of a man with no answers and no arguments.                                         - George CarlinINDOCTRINATION (UNQUESTIONABLE FAITH).Indoctrination is the basis on which religion survives. Religion is indoctrinated into children at a very very young age. Religion simply does not allow any question that will shake the roots of religion. That is the level of brain-washing which religion does. One prime reason why religion is effective and easy to sell. If marketers find a way to emulate this type of indoctrination, their product is all-round success.",

            "answer_text": "This is easy. Religion sells mental/emotional crutches. Everything about it is a salve for the \u201cspirit\u201d which doesn't exist but is represented by the mental and emotional state of people. They need help with fears, doubts, uncertainty, and seemingly impossible questions to answer. \u201cWhat happens when I die?\u201d \u201cWhy are children suffering?\u201d \u201cSomething bad has happened, save me!\u201d All they want in exchange is blind, uncritical, trust that their answers are true, and 10% of everything you earn. Which is just a way for priests to make a living without needing to do work other than religious, which is a sort of work created by their order so they wouldn't have to work other jobs. For every 10 followers who tithe the. 10% it's like they held one full time job paying the average of the paychecks divided by 10. So a flock of 100 followers is like holding 10 jobs, with the pay, and without the work, in theory. Nice cushy job if you can get it. Private practice priests, unlike Catholic priests, get to keep all this for themselves. Buying nice cars and building fancy churches, always larger so more paying customers can come in and contribute. False hope and placebo promises, for the low price of 10% of everything you make. What could go wrong? ",
