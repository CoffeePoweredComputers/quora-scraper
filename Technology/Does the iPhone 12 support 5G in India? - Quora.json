            "answer_text": "All the four variants in the iPhone 12 support 5G globally, but Apple is not touting 5G on iPhone 12 page for India. Although the phones come with the Apple A14 Bionic chip which is 5G enabled - \u201cIndia, the world\u2019s second-largest and fastest-growing smartphone market, is still at least a year away from having a 5G network\u201d.  Apple is aware that 5G makes no difference to consumers in India at the moment and this is why the company seems to be focusing on the features that will help sell the iPhone 12 lineup. Apple iPhone 12 series will not support 5G on dual SIM at the launch, but by the time India brings in 5G, chances are Apple will enable the network in dual SIM mode with a software update. ",

Instead, Apple says its flagship delivers \u201c4G LTE at up to 2Gbps\u201d. So the \u2018speed\u2019 aspect of the new phones will have to wait till India rolls out the next generation telecom technology in the country.
