            "answer_text": "Technology is not something that has a defined or a particular single future, innovations took place sometimes by the century but now it's a common event that happens every 10 seconds. Same is the answer to your question, Smartphones were not even in the mind of man until it came into being then the introduction to the camera it self was considered a massive breakthrough in the world of technology. So due to the rapid rate of new inventions and creative ideas it is very useless to even think that anything in this world will have a precise future. But the only future we know right now is the set of features that is now on the horizon, and on the verge on being put into the camera very very soon. Augmented Reality is a very anticipated feature that is rumored to be in the upcoming Sony Xperia Honami. the interface of the Camera of the Moto X is also a way to show that how taking a picture can be simplified without compromising the quality or quantity.  The iPhone's iSight technology has also baffled many minds and shown that it is not the Mega Pixels that matters it's what the camera holds within. The Lumia 1020 is also a way of showing how a complicated and sophisticated the camera in a phone can be integrated without trading the superiority of the camera with any other features in the phone. The usage of UltraPixel (HTC One) and the ClearPixel (Moto X) technologies also show that more 'x'Pixel technologies should be upcoming in the near future that will take the power of camera to a new level itself.  So finally all we do is sit and wait to see what new \"Camera Revolution\" is up next. ",
