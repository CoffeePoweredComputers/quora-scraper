            "answer_text": "Artificial Intelligence Technology moves at breakneck speed, and we now have more power in our pockets than we had in our homes in the 1990s. Artificial intelligence (AI) has been a fascinating concept of science fiction for decades, but many researchers think we\u2019re finally getting close to making AI a reality. NPR notes that in the last few years, scientists have made breakthroughs in \u201cmachine learning,\u201d using neural networks, which mimic the processes of real neurons. This is a type of \u201cdeep learning\u201d that allows machines to process information for themselves on a very sophisticated level, allowing them to perform complex functions like facial recognition. Big data is speeding up the AI development process, and we may be seeing more integration of AI technology in our everyday lives relatively soon. While much of this technology is still fairly rudimentary at the moment, we can expect sophisticated AI to one day significantly impact our everyday lives. Here are 6 ways AI might affect us in the future. 1. Automated Transportation We\u2019re already seeing the beginnings of self-driving cars, though the vehicles are currently required to have a driver present at the wheel for safety. Despite these exciting developments, the technology isn\u2019t perfect yet, and it will take a while for public acceptance to bring automated cars into widespread use. Google began testing a self-driving car in 2012, and since then, the U.S. Department of Transportation has released definitions of different levels of automation, with Google\u2019s car classified as the first level down from full automation. Other transportation methods are closer to full automation, such as buses and trains. 2. Cyborg Technology One of the main limitations of being human is simply our own bodies\u2014and brains. Researcher Shimon Whiteson thinks that in the future, we will be able to augment ourselves with computers and enhance many of our own natural abilities. Though many of these possible cyborg enhancements would be added for convenience, others might serve a more practical purpose. Yoky Matsuka of Nest believes that AI will become useful for people with amputated limbs, as the brain will be able to communicate with a robotic limb to give the patient more control. This kind of cyborg technology would significantly reduce the limitations that amputees deal with on a daily basis.  3. Taking over dangerous jobs Robots are already taking over some of the most hazardous jobs available, including bomb defusing. These robots aren\u2019t quite robots yet, according to the BBC. They are technically drones, being used as the physical counterpart for defusing bombs, but requiring a human to control them, rather than using AI. Whatever their classification, they have saved thousands of lives by taking over one of the most dangerous jobs in the world. As technology improves, we will likely see more AI integration to help these machines function. Other jobs are also being reconsidered for robot integration. Welding, well known for producing toxic substances, intense heat, and earsplitting noise, can now be outsourced to robots in most cases. Robot Worx explains that robotic welding cells are already in use, and have safety features in place to help prevent human workers from fumes and other bodily harm. 4. Solving climate change Solving climate change might seem like a tall order from a robot, but as Stuart Russell explains, machines have more access to data than one person ever could\u2014storing a mind-boggling number of statistics. Using big data, AI could one day identify trends and use that information to come up with solutions to the world\u2019s biggest problems. 5. Robot as friends Who wouldn\u2019t want a friend like C-3PO? At this stage, most robots are still emotionless and it\u2019s hard to picture a robot you could relate to. However, a company in Japan has made the first big steps toward a robot companion\u2014one who can understand and feel emotions. Introduced in 2014, \u201cPepper\u201d the companion robot went on sale in 2015, with all 1,000 initial units selling out within a minute. The robot was programmed to read human emotions, develop its own emotions, and help its human friends stay happy. Pepper goes on sale in the U.S. in 2016, and more sophisticated friendly robots are sure to follow.  6. Improved elder care For many seniors, everyday life is a struggle, and many have to hire outside help to manage their care, or rely on family members. AI is at a stage where replacing this need isn\u2019t too far off, says Matthew Taylor, computer scientist at Washington State University. \u201cHome\u201d robots could help seniors with everyday tasks and allow them to stay independent and in their homes for as long as possible, which improves their overall well-being. Although we don\u2019t know the exact future, it is quite evident that interacting with AI will soon become an everyday activity. These interactions will clearly help our society evolve, particularly in regards to automated transportation, cyborgs, handling dangerous duties, solving climate change, friendships and improving the care of our elders. Beyond these six impacts, there are even more ways that AI technology can influence our future, and this very fact has professionals across multiple industries extremely excited for the ever-burgeoning future of artificial intelligence.

            "answer_text": "According to my research the future of technology it\u2019s really interesting because technology is revolutionizing many different types of businesses. Internet of Things (IoT) The Internet of Things enables the next stage of the Internet whereby smart devices and other endpoints get connected via Internet technology. Internet of Things is a web of hardware devices, home appliances, vehicles, and other products embedded with electronics, sensors, connectivity, etc. which empowers these things to connect and exchange information. All the companies are following this technology trends for the business that will change the whole concept of running a business in the future. The impact ratio will totally depend on your industry. For example, for those who work in marketing, advertising, media or business management, IoT could provide a wealth of information on how consumers engage with products by tracking their interactions with digital devices. In turn, this data could be used to optimize marketing campaigns and user experiences. Web 3.0 Web 3.0 will be based on the semantic web. This is a technology, where information and data are stored in such a way that the computer systems understand them. It may give birth to a next-gen artificial intelligence. Web 3.0 is slated to be the new paradigm in web interaction and will mark a fundamental change in how developers create websites, but more importantly, how people interact with those websites. Computer scientists and Internet experts believe that this new paradigm in web interaction will further make people\u2019s online lives easier and more intuitive as smarter applications such as better search functions give users exactly what they are looking for, since it will be akin to an artificial intelligence which understands context rather than simply comparing keywords, as is currently the case.  Artificial Intelligence  Artificial intelligence, which once may have seemed like something out of a Sci-Fi novel, is seeing the light and applications of the technology are already being worked on. In particular, with the rise of the Internet of Things, Information Technology and Cybersecurity firms have begun to adopt artificial neural networks in order to monitor and prevent DDoS attacks. Virtual reality Virtual reality is an emerging technology that could provide the answer to this tech world. Together with one of his best partner technology \u201cAugmented Reality\u201d has the potential to reshape the world of retail, and almost a third of customers believe that more should be invested in these technologies to ensure that they play a more important role in their shopping experience. With the application of VR technology e-commerce companies can develop an immersive customer experience that at the end of the day it\u2019s going to be inevitable for other retail companies to use. Surprisingly, 77.24% of buyers abandon their cars before completing a purchase. This indicates that retailers must do much more to convince customers to go ahead with their choice and buy items online. According to CCS Insight, by 2019 it is estimated that 24 million virtual reality devices will be sold worldwide. From this same research, the market for smart augmented reality glasses is expected to be worth $ 1.2 billion by the end of this year.  The U.S. military is already using VR to train its soldiers for certain applications. For example, hand-to-hand combat is an important part of certain fighting disciplines and training. Imagine using VR to fight in an almost-realistic situation, while never actually getting bruised or hurt yourself. The military can also use this in training for sharpshooting, parachuting, diving, and many other situations. It can also be used as a virtual classroom for surgical students, without ever having to cut into a cadaver itself. It can be used to learn the intricacies of machines such as automobiles, by allowing an instantaneous virtual deconstruction to see just how all the parts come together and their varying significances.   In the healthcare field, virtual reality has some benefits that I think most people could be shocked when they realize how can they implement this technology for medical treatments, surgery training, behavioral treatments, phobia treatments, etc. There are a few great examples of how VR is been used in the medical fields. Osso VR is a medical training platform that offers training for medical staff of all skill levels, from surgeons to any member of the medical staff. It allows professionals to practice with sensitive surgery procedures with very precise hand-based interactions in an immersive training environment.  Psious, a Spanish and American behavioral health technology company, offers unique treatment for psychological conditions such as fear of flying, needles, various animals, public speaking, general anxiety or agoraphobia. With the help of VR, patients are put in situations which causes a rush of fear and anxiety, of course under the supervision of a professional. Their task is to face their fears and gradually let them go, while their imagination is helped by VR. By offering psychologist a \u2018therapist\u2019s control panel\u2019 a shared scene to view what the patient is viewing, a Biofeedback measurement and sensors to analyze what the patient is feeling. This is particularly helpful in identifying what are the stimuli and triggers for that person.  Another great example of how VR could be used to improve our health is VR fitness apps like for example VirZOOM The idea behind VirZOOM is: the speed of peddling on the bike determines the speed with which you move in the VR world. There are sensors on the bike that connect the speed of peddling with the speed of movement in the VR game. Along with other controls like a trigger and action buttons, there is a heart rate sensor, through which you can keep tabs on your health progress.  The technology of virtual reality has been incorporating in the classrooms over the years has truly helped add a few new techniques to teaching that can help teachers provide a better learning experience to their students. Virtual reality has played a very important role in this as well.  Virtual field trips There are many ways in which virtual reality can make learning a lot more interesting, and one of those is virtual field trips. In a very short amount of time, these have managed to become of the best applications of VR learning, as they can travel the students to any place in the world without them having to move from their seats. Imagine being in a geography or even a history class, and learning about a certain place and its importance, while being able to actually see everything that you are being taught. This is truly one of the best ways to teach students of any age about the wonders of the world, where they can explore everything they wish on the planet, and actually, make learning a lot more fun and interesting. Improving various skills A great way in which virtual reality techniques are contributing to enhancing and improving the current education system is by offering students the chance to apply the skills they are being taught from their classroom in a more possible, everyday scenario. Law students are already benefiting from VR representations of real trials and other fields of studies are starting to follow their lead. Various companies and even some great writing services like Flash Essay like to focus on their own blogs about how important VR can be when it comes to helping a student work on their own skills, whether they have to do with writing or even being presented with real-life situations of what they\u2019re studying. Distance learning One of the best things about virtual reality is that it can truly help everyone attend a class, no matter where they\u2019re at. There are many people who might not have the privilege to actually attend a classroom, like many postgraduate students who follow their master\u2019s online. One of the best examples is Stanford School of Business, which is already offering a certificate program which can be fully delivered through VR. Being able to watch a lecture online while not being able to attend, is already helping break a lot of barriers in education and is a very promising field with many more universities and schools joining in in the future. Game-based learning techniques It is commonly known that the best way to teach something to a child is through a game. Virtual reality can give teachers the opportunity to approach learning games from a different perspective. There are many ways in which games can be improved through VR. First and foremost, VR games are a lot more interactive than regular games used in the classrooms. The children can interact a lot better and share their experiences without being judged on their abilities. Not only that, but interactive and kinesthetic games are known to help players memorize the things they come across in the virtual games. This can truly help students better memorize things and increase their ability to learn. Better cooperation between students and teachers When you think of incorporating virtual reality in a classroom, you might probably believe that it completely takes away the opportunity for the teacher to focus solely on each and every student. In reality, though, VR actually helps in one-on-one learning and this is actually necessary for some students. Using technology, such as VR, the teacher actually has the chance to communicate solely with one student and help provide them with the needed materials to improve and better themselves. The student won\u2019t have to feel ashamed to ask something in front of the entire classroom as this whole experience is a lot more personal and it can improve the cooperation and the relationship between a student and a teacher. Virtual reality can change the way we approach education While virtual reality still has a long way to go until it can fully be incorporated into the classrooms, it has already started to show some positive changes. The educational system can truly become a lot easier for the students and they can finally have a chance to work on their own personal skills without feeling left out. Virtual reality can help build a stronger relationship between teachers and students and it can help make students a lot more interested in what they\u2019re learning. VR games and practical examples of what they\u2019re studying can help students memorize what they\u2019re learning a lot faster and better understand how to use it in their everyday lives. Also, VR is changing the way we can enjoy live sports events and the whole entertainment industry including the music industry. Some companies are bringing spectators closer to the court, field, or ring through the use of VR technology. Produced by a company called m ss ng p eces , Strength in Numbers lets people watch their favorite sports through VR. For football fans, Strength in Numbers has developed technology that is being used by Europe\u2019s biggest teams to offer a completely new viewing experience. Juventus VR And Aston Villa football teams allow fans to experience football from the point of view of their favorite heroes. The VR gives fans access to the stadium\u2019s pitch, inside the dressing rooms, and behind the scenes at their stadiums. Check it out! Aston Villa VR 360 goal cam: Hourihane\u2019s sensational Blues strike Juventus VR  And as I said earlier Virtual reality it\u2019s also taking over the music industry to improve the music festival experience in 2017 Coachella presented its attendees with a psychedelic experience situated in a 60-feet-high dome, where Chrysalis, an 8-minute virtual reality film that San Francisco-based studio Obscura Digital spent 3 months developing, was screened. Instead of donning VR goggles, attendees look around on the walls of the 120-feet-diameter rotunda where images were projected. Looking into the entire music industry, 360 live-streaming performances sees an even bigger market. Currently, NextVR is leading said endeavor, where they teamed with Live Nation and Citi to broadcast dozens of concerts in VR in 2016. They\u2019ve produced VR experiences for Imagine Dragons and Lady Antebellum. In another partnership with Samsung in August, NextVR broadcasted Coldplay\u2019s \u201cA Head Full of Dreams Tour\u201d live from Chicago\u2019s Soldier Field, where fans from over 50 countries were able to watch with their Samsung Gear VR headset. Having a rich library of music content, VeeR VR is also making progress on supporting 360 live-streaming. Given these successful precedents and the increasing popularity of the VR technology, paired with the lowering thresholds of VR hardware, it\u2019s only a matter of time before virtual reality and 360 media are generally adopted for entertainment purposes. Do you like VR videos and immerse yourself in a VR World? Check out VeeR VR, feel free to follow and request me any 360 or/and VR relevant questions! :) ",
