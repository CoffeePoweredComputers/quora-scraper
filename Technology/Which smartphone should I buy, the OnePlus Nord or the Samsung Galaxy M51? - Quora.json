            "answer_text": "OnePlus Nord continues to be a very disruptive offering in the mid-range segment, but other OEMs have now started matching up with viable alternatives. Samsung\u2019s Galaxy M51 is a close contender that gained instant fame for its massive 7000mAh battery. So, how does the actual experience compare? Let\u2019s stack the Galaxy M51 against OnePlus Nord in a detailed comparison and find out. Design and Display Samsung Galaxy M51 is naturally bigger and bulkier compared to the Nord. That\u2019s because it houses a significantly bigger battery. Nevertheless, Samsung has done a remarkable job with the design. The Galaxy M51 doesn\u2019t feel outright bulky, has uniform bezels around the screen (even at the bottom), and feels distinct. The side-mounted fingerprint reader works great for us as well. Having said that, the OnePlus Nord is slimmer and more convenient to handle, especially when put in a case. None of these two phones have an actual glass back, but the Nord at least has a metal side frame. The Nord also has a newer Gorilla Glass version which should hopefully shield it better against drops (Gorilla Glass 5 vs Gorilla Glass 3). When it comes to the display quality, the basics are well covered on both of these phones. Galaxy M51 and OnePlus Nord, both have AMOLED screens and we are quite happy with the color tuning on these panels. The Nord additionally has HDR10 support and a 90Hz refresh rate. It must also be mentioned that the Galaxy M51 screen is bigger and has a relatively less intrusive notch. Performance and Software OnePlus Nord is one generation ahead when it comes to the chipset. To have the current generation chipset surely seems advantageous, but Yes, the practical usage difference between the two phones is not very noticeable. Both phones have UFS 2.1 storage and LPDDR4x RAM and can handle demanding loads with aplomb. The Nord is additionally available in a 12GB RAM and 256GB configuration. The Galaxy M51, on the other hand, has a dedicated microSD card slot. Which software you\u2019d prefer is a subjective matter. If you ask us, we are more inclined to side with Samsung\u2019s OneUI. Besides, the OxygenOS on OnePlus will evolve into an OneUI like interface with the next update. Since it\u2019s important to Indian consumers, we\u2019d like to highlight a minor difference in call recording on these two phones. The OnePlus Nord has Google\u2019s default dialer, and thus call recording works with a notification prompt that is audible to both caller and receiver. The Galaxy M51, on the other hand, has seamless call recording and auto-call recording options. We\u2019d be remiss not to mention that OnePlus phones enjoy remarkable community support and the Nord is likely to be updated to Android 11 faster. So, when it comes to performance and software. These two phones are well matched. Camera and Battery The primary camera on both phones can take great images in daylight. The Galaxy M51 has more pixels (64MP vs 48MP), but photography on phones these days is more about image processing software. The camera software on neither of the two phones isn\u2019t inclined to shoot natural images. We prefer the Galaxy M51 a tad more. When it comes to other cameras \u2013 Macro, depth sensor (portrait mode), and a wide-angle camera, the Galaxy 51 performs better. Thus out of these two, the Galaxy M51 has a more versatile camera. And about the battery. Yeah. The Galaxy M51 wins hands down. The Nord has relatively faster charging (30W vs 25W), but that really doesn\u2019t gain it much leverage. If the battery is your priority, the Galaxy M51 is the way to go. The 7000mAh battery can easily last for 2 days or more, which is significantly better mileage than what you\u2019d get on OnePlus. Which one is better? Both the OnePlus Nord and Galaxy M51 are great mid-range phones with their distinct strengths and limitations. The Nord should be a better buy for consumers who prioritize slim design and the Galaxy M51 should be the obvious choice for consumers who value battery convenience and Samsung branding.

            "answer_text": "The Samsung Galaxy M51 is a midrange smartphone from Samsung that is meant to compete with phones like the Oneplus Nord.  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^That is the Samsung Galaxy M51 ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^This is the Oneplus Nord^^^^^^^^^^^^ In terms of size, the M51 is slightly bigger than the Nord, as it has a 6.7 inch AMOLED display, whereas the Nord only has a 6.44 inch AMOLED display. However, where the Nord \u201cwins\u201d is the fact that it has 5G but that is useless as currently, there is no 5G networks in India and given the slow rollout of networks in India, 5G would come in 3\u20134 years, by which time the Nord would already be sluggish. If it were me, I would stick with the M51 as it has a similar processor ( 765G is essentially the 730G with a 5G modem) and expandable storage which the Nord does not have. Also, the base model of the M51 comes with 128gb storage, which is double the non expandable storage on the base model Nord. The M51 also has a bigger battery than the Nord (7000 mAH vs 4115 mAH) and thus would be an excellent phone for long, and heavy use as the sd 730G uses very little battery while the Nord would be a battery hog due to the energy demanding 5G modem, which is absolutely useless in the current scenario. The Cameras on both phones seem to be top notch when it comes to specs on paper, but, as the M51 has not been released yet, the image quality of its system cannot be determined. Oneplus phones have lower quality cameras that give shit images irrespective of their specs on paper - Dont go by the opinions of the paid reviewers who orgasm over Oneplus\u2019s so called \u201cflagship killer\u201d crap. Also, when it comes to overall build quality, Samsungs tend to have fewer issues and defects (not saying that they dont pop up, nothing is perfect :D ) but Oneplus phones simply tend to have shoddy quality and lots of defects (green tinting on displays, crackling microphones, laggy phones etc), which ruins the experience. On top of that, Oneplus also has extremely rude and bad customer service, and they are too proud to admit any fault in their product ( I know as I experienced it first hand with my defective Oneplus 6t (bad and corrupted storage, poor image quality from camera when compared to even a cheap 10k phone)).. I have a Samsung Galaxy Note 9 from the same time period, and it had some issues, and the Samsung customer care was polite, extremely helpful and they even provided me with a spare temp phone while my phone was being fixed ( it was something to do with the microphone not working). Therefore, I would recommend the Galaxy M51 over the Nord, due to the better pricing (24999 for a 128 gig model vs 24999 for a 64 gig Nord) and a better experience overall. Now, there may be people in the comments telling me that \u201clook Harsh Oneplus has best softwares \u201c, \u201cyou had a single experience bro Oneplus is better than the Samsung crap\u201d, well to them I say, they have not experienced Oneplus customer care yet. Also another reason why not to buy from Oneplus is the fact that they are a Chinese brand, and that Indians must reduce their dependence on Chinese products slowly, considering the high border tensions between India and China currently. Indians must support their country by not buying products from the enemy, in this case, Oneplus. Samsung is a South Korean brand and thus a much better option in this regard. ",
