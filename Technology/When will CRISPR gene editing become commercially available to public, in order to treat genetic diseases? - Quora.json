            "answer_text": "Moral arguments and ethical postulations aside, there is a demand to treat currently incurable genetic diseases. I don\u2019t need to pull up a statistic to tell you that there are many people in this world who have the money and reason to invest in technology that could save them or those they love from having to endure and suffer through diseases like cystic fibrosis, type I diabetes, cancers, etc. If there is a massive demand, and a low supply, that supply is going to cost a lot and money will flow in to make it meet the demand. As CRISPR technology becomes better over time, and by better I mean safer and more effective, there will be more policies developed to control its use. I imagine these policies will certainly consider how this kind of gene-editing technology will alter the course of human evolution, but life can be selfish when it comes to survival and we are no exception to this. Technically speaking, the biggest issues with CRISPR probably have to do with: its off-target effects (cause just one off-target can hurt/kill you if it\u2019s in the wrong place at the wrong time of your life)the patenting of the technology (cause a lot of it is owned by Feng Zhang/MIT)the delivery of this CRISPR therapeutic to the targeted cells (whether it\u2019s local/systemic delivery in adults, or introduction into live embryonic stem cells)and a lot more, like any biopharmaceutical.Given that clinical trials can take up to a decade and that we still need more time to make CRISPR a better human therapeutic for whatever genetic disease, I would personally estimate at least fifteen more years at the earliest. But you know, at the same time, I haven\u2019t even considered how fast China is using it as a human therapeutic (and they are relatively rampant in this endeavor). Honestly, check out this article from Nature[1]. Biotechnology, as it adopts more engineering practices (e.g. synthetic biology) as we speak, is most likely going to have huge waves of innovation in this century.

            "answer_text": "The three leading U.S. companies in this space (Editas, CRISPR Therapeutics and Intellia) are all hoping to launch clinical trials this year or next year. They have chosen diseases with simple genetics and clear outcomes - so these trials could go very quickly. With really stunning Phase II results, accelerated approval might be an option. So approval in 2\u20133 years, followed by rapid commercial launch, is not our-of-the-question. Conversely, some of these trials may fail. Severe adverse effects, such as patient deaths, could greatly slow progress. Any such stumbles could easily push the first approvals out to a decade or much longer. So pay attention to those clinical trials - and the patent mess. Also watch the progress of non-CRISPR gene therapies - successes there could both accelerate interest in CRISPR therapies (due to shared gene delivery technologies) but also point towards increased competition for many disease indications.
