            "answer_text": "Strategic decisions are those which set a policy or guidelines by which other decisions are made, but do not have a direct effect. It is a sliding scale, however. Imagine yourself moving to a new home, for example. Your strategic decision might be to live in the city or to live in a suburb. That decision would be based on a number of factors, and have far-reaching consequences. Have made that strategic decision, you would then choose a specific house or apartment, decide how you would get to work, what sort of car you might buy, and many more things. Those would all be decisions more tactical than strategic, but still with some strategic content. They tend to implement your strategy. Down to the nitty-gritty, you might choose the color to paint your front door, what to eat for breakfast, and what accessories you want on your car. Decisions such as these have very little strategic value. They implement your preferences, but aside from making you happy, are of little consequence beyond that. ",
