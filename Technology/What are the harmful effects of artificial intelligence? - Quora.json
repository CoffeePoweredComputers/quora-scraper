            "answer_text": "Properly managed, AI could significantly accelerate the evolution of humanity. But who gets to be the manager? Google, Facebook, Oracle? Governments? Taking a look back at history - how many times something good had been turned into a twisted and all-powerful belief system that causes the suffering of plentiful of individuals? The Roman Inquisition, Communism, and Fascism are the most extreme examples. Their representatives were 'unable to be wrong'. Because God, the State, and Natural Selection \u2018knew best\u2019. People who didn't comply with the rules of the system were definitely harmed. AI is taking on a similar path. A superior technology that will guide us into making the right decisions. So, what happens when the majority of humanity accepts that AI knows best and what happens with the rest? AI lives on data. What if someone doesn't want to share theirs? Would they stay behind, ignored by society and without access to essential services? We will probably find out the answers to those questions in the next 10 to 15 years. Let's be clear - I am a huge supporter of AI. This is a technology that has the potential to help us solve many of today's big problems. However, we should treat it very carefully and realize that its implications and perils go far beyond technology. We should make AI as decentralized as possible. We cannot afford to have an AI provider that dominates the market the same way Google dominates online searches/ advertising. ",

            "answer_text": "The only thing that I can think about is taking away jobs from people, automating their jobs. If you were expecting something out of the movies, like machines taking over the world or something like that\u2026 I believe AI is not even close and I believe it won\u2019t be. This would require a lot of outside information and a notion of self-consciousness that I don\u2019t believe AI will ever achieve. ",
