            "answer_text": "Yes, it does, at least in the case of my friend\u2019s Dodge Journey. The car is about a 2008. My friend is a retired electrician and a borderline brilliant guy. Making the transition from a truck to a car was a little difficult for him, but he adapted once he discovered the Journey would hold a lot. They stuck with the communications habits of an electrician\u2019s family, with hands-free cell conversations while driving, until eventually the habit dwindled and they settled into a fine home in the country and winters in Florida. Over the years the Journey developed an electrical glitch which frustrated my friend. Every now and then the battery would inexplicably go dead. This was doubly galling because the battery was buried in the left front fender, and it required the dealership mechanics to change it out each time. Eventually a booster kit took to riding in the back, he would use it to start the car about once every two weeks, and otherwise the car worked very well. This went on for a long time with the family never getting stranded, but also never really trusting the car. Nine years later during that part of the registration process where you dig the ownership out of the glove box and affix the stickers, a strange, forgotten artifact tumbled out with the papers. It was a small 110v inverter, wired directly into the car\u2019s 12V system, intended for use as a cell phone charger, but forgotten. He disconnected it. No more trouble with the Dodge Journey. So yes, a cell phone charger can potentially put a huge drain on a car\u2019s electrical system. ",

            "answer_text": "Greater current and higher voltages charge batteries faster, but there\u2019s a limit to what they can take. Smartphone batteries charge when a current passes through them. Greater current and higher voltages charge batteries faster, but there\u2019s a limit to what they can take. The charge controller (IC) protects against dangerous spikes in current. The controller chip regulates the overall flow of electricity into and out of the battery. Generally speaking, lithium-ion controllers define the current (in amps) at which the battery charges by measuring the battery\u2019s cell current and voltage and then adjusting the current flowing in. Some use a DC to DC converter to change the input voltage, and fancier integrated circuits adjust the resistance between the charger input and the battery terminal to ramp the current flow up or down. The amount of current the charge controller draws is generally dictated by the phone\u2019s software. Unless you\u2019re still rocking a Palm Pilot from the early \u201990s, chances are your smartphone recharges via USB cable. There\u2019s a really good reason: Besides the fact that USB cables are relatively easy to find these days, USB has a really robust, well-defined charging standard called the USB Power Delivery Specification. The USB Implementers Forum specifies four types in total, one for each corresponding USB specification: USB 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, and 3.1. A typical USB 1.0 and 2.0 plug can deliver up to 5V/0.5A (2.5W). That\u2019s the charging rate of a typical phone, and it doesn\u2019t amount to a lot of power. An iPhone charging at 2A over USB uses 5V x 2A = 10W. The average incandescent light bulb, by comparison, draws about 40W of power. By default, USB 3.0 ports push 5V/0.9A (4.5W). USB-C, the oval-shaped reversible plug on newer smartphones, is a different animal altogether. It\u2019s technically capable of carrying the USB 2.0 spec, but most manufacturers opt for USB 3.1, which can potentially deliver a much higher voltage. Many USB 3.1 devices take advantage of the USB Power Delivery (USB-PD) spec, which has a maximum power output of 20V/5A (100W). Smartphones don\u2019t usually draw that much power \u2014 manufacturers commonly stick with a lower amperage (like 3A), but it\u2019s a boon for USB-C laptops like mackbook pro and Google Chromebook Pixel. Slightly complicating things is the Battery Charging Specification, which deals specifically with power drawn from a USB port for charging. The most recent spec, Rev 1.2, defines three different sources of power: Standard downstream port (SDP), charging downstream port (CDP), and dedicated charging port (DCP). CDP, the spec in modern smartphones, laptops, and other hardware, can supply up to 1.5A. FAST CHARGING STANDARDS: WHAT\u2019S THE DIFFERENCE? USB Power Delivery The USB Power Delivery (USB-PD) standard was developed by the USB Implementers Forum (USB-IF) and it\u2019s a standard that any manufacturer can use on any device with a USB port. It\u2019s capable of delivering up to 100W, so it\u2019s suitable for use with all kinds of devices beyond smartphones including some laptops, provided they have a USB-C port. USB-PD brings other benefits, too. The direction of the power is not fixed, so you will find , for example, that have a USB-C port that can be used both to charge another device or to charge the battery pack itself. USB-PD also only provides the power the device needs, so the same USB-PD charger could charge a smartphone at top speed, but then also charge a laptop at its top speed. Different manufacturers employ the USB-PD standard differently. So there will be no worries all the batteries will never die faster due to this fast charging option. It is just a technical revolution of saving time giving what you need. ",
