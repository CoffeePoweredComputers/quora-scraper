            "answer_text": "The term \u201crenewable\u201d is generally applied to those energy resources and technologies whose common characteristic is that they are non-depletable or naturally replenishable. Renewable resources include solar energy, wind, falling water, the heat of the earth (geothermal), plant materials (biomass), waves, ocean currents, temperature differences in the oceans and the energy of the tides. Renewable energy technologies produce power, heat or mechanical energy by converting those resources either to electricity or to motive power. Commercial technologies include hydroelectric power, solar energy, fuels derived from biomass, wind energy and geothermal energy. Wave, ocean current, ocean thermal and other technologies are in the research or early commercial stage presently. The resources required for these are fundamentally different. Although any resource that relies on the heat or motion of the earth, the moon or the sun (or the sun\u2019s radiation) to produce power for human consumption is a renewable resource, the ways one harnesses the resources are sufficiently different . The International Renewable Energy Agency has revealed a new policy brief which shows that renewable energy has become the most cost-effective way to generate electricity for hundreds of millions of people worldwide who are not on the grid. Renewable energy is also the least-cost option for extending grid supply in areas with the necessary resources such as wind, sun, and appropriate tidal options.

ThoriumThorium is abundant and clean enough to supply global energy demand for centuries. According to experts there is more energy available from thorium than all coal, gas, oil and uranium combined. Considered by many as the future of nuclear energy generation, Thorium operates significantly cleaner than uranium-based power plants as the waste products are much easier to handle. A ton of Thorium produces the same energy as 200 tons of uranium, or 3.5 million tons of coal. To learn more about Thorium read: Is Fossil Fuel Dependence Over? or visit the International Thorium Energy Organisation (IThEO) at www.itheo.org/. 2. OTEC \u2013 Ocean Thermal Energy ConservationOcean Thermal Energy Conversion (OTEC) uses the temperature difference that exists between deep and shallow waters to run a heat engine. As with any heat engine, the greatest efficiency and power is produced with the largest temperature difference and up until now this was the biggest challenge for OTEC. But recent developments in efficiency of heat exchange assisted by modern designs performance can reach theoretical maximum efficiency making OTEC a viable and efficient renewable energy resource. A single 100 Mw floating plant can generate 800 million Kw of electrical energy, without the need of oil, gas or any other fossil fuel. OTEC only needs the temperature difference between the oceans hot surface water and cold deep water. 3. Wind PowerNeedless of detailed information and one of the biggest bets of the Coalition Government to help Britain meet its Climate Change Bill Agreements and prevent us from a possible energy crisis in the near future. Wind Power is one the cleanest but not so cost effective renewable energy generation resources there is. Despite accounting only for 2% of global energy generation, wind power electricity generation is growing rapidly and it has doubled over the past three years and in countries like Denmark it already accounts for 20% of stationary electricity production. 4. Solar EnergyAnother renewable energy generation resource that doesn\u2019t need detailed explanation. Solar energy generation is another clean and abundant renewable energy resource. Up until now the biggest challenges faced by solar energy has been the cost and efficiency of solar panels and solar cells. The ultimate challenge is to make solar panels convert the maximum energy from the sun into electricity. Actually only about 31% of solar energy is converted into electricity. The rest of the energy is not able to be harnessed as it becomes heat \u2013 as \u2018hot electrons\u2019 \u2013 which is lost very quickly because electrons cool down very fast. Capturing almost all solar energy and converting to electricity is the goal of the \u2018ultimate solar cell\u2019. 5. Geothermal EnergyGeothermal energy uses heat stored in the earth to generate electricity. This energy is originated from the radioactive decay of minerals, from volcanic activity and solar energy absorbed at the Earth\u2019s surface. Up until now geothermal energy generation was limited to areas near tectonic plate boundaries. Technological advancements in the field have expanded the range and size of viable geothermal resources. The only downside is that geothermal wells release greenhouse gases trapped within the earth surface and wells can run dry or lose steam.

            "answer_text": "There are plenty of options when it comes to renewable energy technologies that can be harvested to our benefit. All are pretty much cost effective which is why they are considered better than the use of fossil fuels and exhaustible resources. Take solar energy. Solar energy even though cheaper than simply utilization of electricity has for long had a bad reputation of being relatively unaffordable to invest in. However, if you actually get down to investing in a solar panel once, you will start reaping benefits right from the moment you set up your solar system and get it to work. In the long run, solar energy proves to be anything but expensive. However, it has been said that solar panels are only able to convert around 31% of solar energy into electricity. Consider OTEC. Ocean Thermal Energy Conservation that depends on the differences in temperatures between deep and shallow waters so as to be able to drive a heat engine is very cost efficient. In the past there were problems associated with making the heat engine cost effective owing to the lack of the desired levels of temperature differences in the sea water. However this problem has been tackled and it is now possible to achieve the theoretical maximum efficiency. ",
