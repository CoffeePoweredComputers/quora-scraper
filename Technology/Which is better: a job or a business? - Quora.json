            "answer_text": "A few years ago, when I started my career as a self-employed individual, my income for the first few months was close to none. On the other hand, my friends were already employed and were making INR 20\u201330k per month while the toppers were making somewhere around INR 60K-80K per month . After about a month or two, I started making the same amount of money as my friends were. Today I am at a point where I some days make in a day what my employed friends make in in a month. Slowly and steadily my income kept growing, because my earnings were not capped by someone, instead my income depended on how much work I put in. This is the beauty of being a self employed individual or starting up a business. However, I would like to point out that it is not as easy to to as it sounds. Starting a business/ being self employed is extremely challenging and stressful. However, if you put in the work and do the right thing then it can be extremely rewarding. If you want a stable and stress-free lifestyle then business is not for you. Why most people choose a job over business: The initial phase of getting hired at a company feels quite nice, you complete your graduation, there is already a company waiting for you to pay you a salary. It feels nice to start making some money right after college. Soon after we completed my graduation, most of my friends were enjoying vacations, travelling as they had already being placed and were waiting for their joining date. While on the other hand, I was running around the city in scorching heat to find clients. They had a guarantee that they will be paid for the work they do. On the other hand, I had no idea if I would be able to make any money this month. To sum it up in a single line: \u201cIt was damn hard\u201d. Stress and other aspects of life: Even though I make a ton more money than my classmates, I cant say that their life is shit. In-fact, many of my friends who work as an employee have much stress free and happier life than mine. They can relax when they get home, they can afford to have relationships, they don\u2019t have to stress about work when they go to sleep. But that doesn\u2019t imply that I have a dull and boring life, its just that I enjoy doing things which they wouldn\u2019t. I love working 14+ Hours a day, rather than relaxing. I love reading a ton of books rather than watching a TV series. I love to give up love/relationships for the sake of achieving my long term goals. I love staying awake, planing things instead of sleeping an extra hour. Over a period of time, I started to enjoy these things and they have now become a part of my lifestyle. Is money everything? No, its not. Even though I make decent money, that does not mean I do it solely for the purpose of making money. I would do all the things mentioned above, even though I was not getting paid for it. I would do that for free just because I like it. The money is just a byproduct / a measure of your performance which states how well you are doing. My final verdict: Which is better: a job or a business? It all depends upon what kind of lifestyle you would like. If you like being a workaholic and wouldn't mind working extra hours and making sacrifices then go for business. If you want a balanced and happy life and you aren\u2019t concerned about money, then by all means go for a job. ",

            "answer_text": "I've owned two corporations and I have an exciting career as a Software Engineer. It takes a LOT of resources, specifically work and money to get a business up and running. One might also note that it takes a lot of effort to get into a professional career. I will put things into perspective for you. I will assume by business you mean one that generates revenues. Anyone can file articles of incorporation and subsequently be the legal owner of a business. Therefore, owning a profitable business, or at least one that generates enough money to pay you is superior to a job. The cost of education has risen 400x over the past 40 years while wages have only risen a mere 40 times. The nominal return on your tuition dollars for the maximum salary you can earn after the fact is decreasing with the rise in cost of living. A job controls your destiny while a you control your company and ultimately your own destiny. The benefits of a job versus that of a business are only that you have a steady, and predictable income. You are a nothing more than a number to Corporate America so any concept of job security is madness because you can loose your job for actions you and/or your employer do. You don't need much money to get a just other than the clothes on your back and transportation to get there. Jobs give you just enough to get by, save, buy a house, buy a car and raise a family. Some jobs are more stable than others and give annual bonuses. The higher your rank the bigger your bonus. Business on the other hand requires an initial risk, a stellar execution of an idea to capitalize on an opportunity, talent and capital. Business is very hard. Businesses don't take off overnight. It takes more than just intelligence and talent to execute on an idea, it takes grit. The reward however, in some instances can make you richer than an entire country. Consider the net worth of Jeff Bezos at $127 Billion versus the GDP of Ecuador at $98 Billion. The rewards of a proper execution are far superior to any job. A job cannot be bequeathed to your descendants but a business can. An employee will never make enough with a job to take a sabbatical for 10 years but an entrepreneur would have that luxury with a successful business. An employee cannot simply live where, or how they want to live because the proximity of a desired residence in relation to a job dictates where one might live. Employees are also restricted financially, as salaries and wages require one to work within the confines of a budget. In regards to retirement planning, and investment purposes, those who own a business are much better off long term, as they will be able make greater contributions to 401 (K)'s and other investment products. Employment guarantees a steady stream of limited income, stability, certainty and surety of the ability pay bills. With a business you don't need surety to pay bills, you simply pay the balance. With a business one needed worry about stability because it comes with profit. In conclusion, being employed is merely a job. However, owning a business is a job and also a ticket to control one's destiny. Owning a profitable business is an insanely difficult position to get into. A business is superior to a job and an order of magnitude more lucrative than traditional employment. If you can get into a business do it yesterday. ",
