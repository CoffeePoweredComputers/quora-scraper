            "answer_text": "Wow, that is a broad question. We could answer in a couple paragraphs, or you could spend years getting a PhD in just one of the fields that are applicable. Your phone is very much like a set of these.  It is sending and receiving Radio. Radio waves are part of the EM spectrum. They are quite low on the range. When you are talking on a cell phone, radio waves are going both directions, sending and receiving, between your handset and the nearest cellular tower. This radio communications is taken at the tower down to land lines (most cases) that connect the tower back to switching equipment (fiber or copper). Once at switching, the your communications are routed to whatever destination (whom every you are talking with) back through copper, fiber, and possibly through the cell network again over the air, even if the person is sitting right next to you.
