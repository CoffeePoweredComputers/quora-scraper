            "answer_text": "Besides the ubiquitous VHS cassettes, there were a few disc-based video formats. It\u2019s probably also good to include Betamax, an excellent format with some marketing issues (Sony was more reluctant to license the format, compared to JVC) - Sony thought Beta HiFi would be technically irreproducible on VHS format machines, and that would clinch Sony\u2019s format dominance as people demanded movies with audio run through their stereos, and VHS only had linear audio with very limited performance, also strongly dependent on the tape speed, unlike the Beta version. After a few years of Dolby stereo on the linear stereo tracks, the VHS consortium managed to do virtually a magic trick involving recording audio information below the video layer on tapes, and Sony lost their ace in the hole and Beta never recovered. Sony began making VHS machines as well a few years later. S-VHS machines improved the format as far as was commercially possible, but DVD soon obsoleted the tape format with higher resolution for playback, and recordable DVDs came along only a few years after that (though with recording restrictions that allowed only composite analog video or sometimes FireWire camcorder inputs for sources in standalone recorders. Speaking of camcorders, tape was used for home video NTSC formats like VHS-C, Sony\u2019s 8mm and digital8, but these were almost always used for camcorders (though Sony made some home digital8 decks as well). OH, yeah, RCA\u2019s CED discs were video discs that used actual stylus contact and gradually wore out their discs and styli. LaserDisc was an optical laser-based and very high quality analog video and audio format (later with digital audio as well). They used 12\u2033 discs that looked like mirrored LPs and were read by a laser, as the name implies. The video quality was significantly better than VHS; good enough that companies like Criterion began to issue movies in their original theatrical aspect ratios, and the format allowed (eventually) two analog and two more digital soundtracks (good for multiple languages or a choice of dubbed vs. original voices), as well as clear freeze frames and the ability to jump to a specific frame (good for supplement materials like screenplays and photo galleries). These special features paved the way for the additional content that eventually showed up on many DVDs. Pioneer, Sony, Magnavox, Yamaha and more made laserdisc players for almost 15 years, and they were the best quality available until DVDs were introduced. ",

            "answer_text": "Thanks for A2A. Just as there has been a variety of competitors to DVD (like Panasonic\u2019s RAM Disc), there were a number of competitors to the bog-standard VHS cassette (most notably Sony\u2019s Betamax), and some other proprietary formats that didn\u2019t capture the market. There was also the period when LaserDisc was going to be the next big thing. 12\u2033 reflective discs with a large enough hole in the center to be handled without scratching had a certain appeal, but I never saw one demonstrated in a store that looked any better than VHS tape in the first place\u2014and each side only held 45 mins, so a standard 90 minute feature required turning the disc mid-movie. I think most of them were copied from VHS sources. In fact, I spent a fortune tracking down a DVD of Intimate Stranger to be disappointed that it was copied from VHS. By happenstance I then discovered a $2 DVD of the movie, and it was remastered! Officially, Betamax suffered because the cassette didn\u2019t hold enough tape, and Sony introduced a Long-Play version much sooner than VHS in order to cope with this. Most of those early models had a switch beside the power input to select between Beta 1 (SP) and Beta 2 (LP) and later models dumped Beta 1 completely. Unofficially, Sony refused to license Beta as a distribution format to Porn Producers. As word got around that porn was only available on VHS, you can imagine what an influence this had on consumers. (Yes! Women are just as guilty!) Sony also suffered \u201cApple Syndrome\u201d. By keeping the format proprietary and not allowing other manufacturers to use it, Beta ended up being a niche market like Apple is when it comes to computers\u2014exceedingly loyal customers, but low on percentages. So, despite some quirky attempts at competition the majority of the population ran VHS recorders and made an almost seemless transition to DVD. Archivists, like myself, are confronted with the problem of having so much rare material on VHS that needs to be transferred to a new medium while VHS players still survive, because there is a chance that it may become the only copy serviceable in the future.  Sony actually created the VCR in the first place, with the release of the Umatic 3/4\u2033 format. Previously all video machines had been manually threaded from reels. It was named Umatic because of the shape of the Tape Path around the spinning heads. This allowed the first commercially portable (luggable) VCR units, and because they were broadcast quality (at least with a brand new tape), they rapidly penetrated the Industrial and Education markets. The luggable version used a smaller cassette and generally only offered 15\u201330 minutes of record time. The larger bench models accepted a larger cassette that was capable of 90 minutes or so. Both used the same reel centers, so the smaller cassettes could be played in the larger machines. Beta was essentially a 1/2\u2033 version of Umatic, except that the Tape Path runs in exactly the opposite direction (!?). Sony then went on to develop the Betacam, which was fully contained in one shoulder-mounted unit, and these were often seen being wielded by News camera-men. But the Betacord/cam and Betamax formats were not cross-compatible. It was the introduction of field-capable video recording that revolutionised the way News was presented. Just as today when you can take you digital camera into a processing shop and have photos printed out immediately, the Umactic VCR enabled reporting today\u2019s news \u201ctoday\u201d, instead of waiting around to have telecine film processed.
