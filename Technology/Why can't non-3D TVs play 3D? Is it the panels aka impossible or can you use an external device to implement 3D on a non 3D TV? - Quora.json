            "answer_text": "It\u2019s a special kind of panel. Actually, there are a few different kinds of 3D panels, with two being most common. The first kind is a passive type (meaning it\u2019s not actively making changes to create the 3D), and works on polarized light filters. The panels project the picture for each eye with differently polarized light. You wear glasses with polarized lenses, and each eye filters out one direction of the polarized light, so that each eye sees only those pixels. The other kind is an active type. This kind works by showing one picture on the screen for one eye, and then showing the picture for the other eye. The glasses are synchronized to a signal from the panel, and blackout whichever eye shouldn\u2019t see the picture. A third kind you might find is a variation of the first. This kind displays each picture through angled filters, so that if you look at the right angle each eye gets its own picture. Have you ever seen one of those picture cards where the picture changes when you look at it from different angles? Same idea, except with a lcd screen instead of printing. This was most famously used by the Nintendo 3DS. The later \u201cNew 3DS\u201d used an upgraded version that could adjust the angle, and would track your eyes to follow them, fixing the problem that it only worked if you held the screen perfectly. Expect further work on this concept to rear its head again in the future on big TV panels, when the industry will try yet again to make 3D work. Several panel companies, and a few others, including Apple, filed patents on improvements to this concept that would make it useful for a wall TV. For example, Apple\u2019s patent improves the New 3DS screen type, with eye tracking for up to four sets of eyes. This means, if you had a 240 FPS panel, four people could watch at 60 FPS, in 3D, with no glasses. Now THAT might catch on. ",
