            "answer_text": "Computer Networks: \u2013A computer network is an interconnected collection of autonomous computers able to exchange information. \u2013A computer network usually require users to explicitly login onto one machine, explicitly submit jobs remotely, explicitly move files/data around the network. Computer networking is an engineering discipline that aims to study and analyze the communication process among various computing devices or computer systems that are linked, or networked, together to exchange information and share resources. Computer networking depends on the theoretical application and practical implementation of fields like computer engineering, computer sciences, information technology and telecommunication.",

            "answer_text": "I'd venture to say that this is an English question, rather than a computer or network question. My general answer would be, A Computer Network is a NOUN, denoting several computers being linked together for communication, usually over a switch. That's on the basic Local Area Network level. Computer Networks would be plural of said entity. Computer Networking (VERB) is the act of linking computers together for the said purpose. ",
