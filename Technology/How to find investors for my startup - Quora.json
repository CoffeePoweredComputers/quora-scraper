            "answer_text": " Entrepreneurs make a common mistake when it comes to raising money for their startup\u2014they don\u2019t start soon enough. They think they should put their heads down and develop their prototypes or set up their business, and then put some thought into getting funding. But it doesn\u2019t work like that. You can\u2019t spend six months building a prototype, then wake up one morning and decide it\u2019s time to fundraise and watch the money flow in. You have to network in the finance community as you build your business to secure the right funding. Start with these steps: 1. Know The Appropriate Investors It\u2019s important to understand who the appropriate investors are for your industry. Consider the size round you\u2019re trying to raise. Think about whether you\u2019re going to use an accelerator or not. Decide whether you\u2019re looking for angel investors or institutional investors. Before asking anyone for funding, you have to identify what the space you\u2019re operating in looks like. If you can\u2019t, then you need to research a lot and talk with as many people as possible to figure it out. 2. Have A Status File Once you\u2019ve figured out the appropriate investors for your company, you should create a document to keep track of them. I still have the Google Doc from every single round of funding we raised. It lists the investor, the point of contact, similar companies they\u2019ve funded, and any notes from our calls. You\u2019re going to have a lot of conversations and meetings, and you need a way to stay up-to-date on everything. A status file is an easy way to organize. You remember where you left off with a certain investor, who you need to follow up with, or what information you need to send someone. 3. Leverage Your Network It\u2019s much, much better to have a warm introduction to investors than a cold introduction. The way to get warm introductions is to leverage your network. Generally, your network centers around three things: The schools you\u2019ve attended, with networks like alum groups or business groups.Your professional career, which includes the people you\u2019ve met and worked with over the years.Your peers and friends. These people might work in the finance community or know someone who does.Create a list of people in these networks who are connected to the finance world. Then, think about how you\u2019re going to reach out. For example, if you want to reach someone at Sequoia Capital, check to see if you know anyone from college who works there. Look to see if someone in your circle knows someone who works there. It doesn\u2019t matter if your contact is exactly who you need to talk to, as long as you\u2019ve got a segue into the firm. 4. Create Your Quick Pitch Even if you do get a warm intro, people aren\u2019t going to spend a lot of time reading your pitch. Busy professionals don\u2019t even have time to answer their emails every day. So, if they\u2019re going to take the time to send an email on your behalf, they need a pitch they can literally cut, paste, send. Create something that\u2019s succinct, powerful, and easy to forward. No one has time to create your pitch for you, help you understand your value prop, or review your deck. Your job is to make it as easy as possible for someone to do you a favor and share your pitch. 5. Be Prepared For No Get ready to hear \u201cno\u201d a lot when trying to raise money. You can easily have 100 investor meetings and hear \u201cno\u201d 90 times. And the other ten will tell you \u201cmaybe.\u201d And from those ten, you might get a few people to say \u201cyes.\u201d It\u2019s tough, because your business is your baby. You\u2019ve put your blood, sweat, and tears into this. Then someone tells you your baby isn\u2019t that smart, or that cool, or that it will never amount to anything. You just have to block that out and keep persevering. 6. Take Time To Learn Even though you\u2019ll be hearing \u201cno\u201d a lot, you can learn something from each meeting. Something about yourself, about the investor, or even about your company. You\u2019ll learn how to answer difficult questions and how to sell your company like a pro. You\u2019ll meet people you love and respect, people that are awesome and incredibly smart. You\u2019ll also meet people that you don\u2019t like at all. But every time you have a meeting, you should walk out a little smarter than when you walked in. 7. Understand The Process Fundraising is usually not a quick process. It usually takes a few months, maybe even longer. You\u2019ll be dedicating a lot of time to it, and that\u2019s going to take time away from running your business. You have to set up meetings, go to them, follow up afterwards\u2014it\u2019s like having a second job on top of the difficult one you already have. But it gets easier. After you\u2019ve successfully fundraised once, you have a good idea of what the process entails. Each time, you become a little more educated and aware of what\u2019s required to succeed. ",

            "answer_text": "There are several primary strategies: Cold Call SubmissionsThere are lists of angel investor groups online and you research what firms do deals in what industries and then send your proposal to them for review. Your chances of even getting an answer is at best 1% and your chance of that answer being a yes is about that of getting hit by a car crossing the street while reading this answer. So, not good.Chance of getting funded: 1 in 10,000,000Using a Deal BrokerBack before the internet, when dinosaurs roamed the earth, if you wanted to get the attention of an angel investor, venture capital firm or private equity firms you had to go to a broker, pay $10,000 - $20,000 to have them develop a plan for you and then use their connections as a broker to introduce you to the deal makers. Most of these \u201cplan sharks\u201d are just con men looking to take $20,000 of your money and have no more chance of getting you funded than #1 above.Chance of getting funded: 1 in 1,000,000Online CommuniitiesI have an account on Gust, SeenInvest and Crunchbase. I like all 3 for different reasons and enjoy the offerings on there. Most of the platforms don\u2019t really provide a view of these opportunities consistent with what I look for, so I actually find them harder to evaluate deals on, but that is likely just me. I prefer reviewing deals directly. These sites have high profile investors that you can often see what they are investing in and invest along side of them. It is hard to go wrong with a strategy like that.Chance of getting funded: 1 in 100,000Crowd Fund ItAn old friend of mine from college reconnected with me and invited me to dinner. I thought he just wanted to catch up, but it turns out that he wanted to pitch me an idea he had. Hahaha. Pretty clever. He had been working on the idea for 2\u20133 years at that time and had multiple prototypes and needed $100,000 to manufacture his first run of product. I really didn\u2019t give the idea much chance of success, so I jokingly said \u201cYou don\u2019t need an investor, you should just put it on Kickstarter\u201d. He called 3\u20134 months later and said \u201cThank you so much, you were right\u201d. Always flattered when someone acknowledges that I know what I am talking about I asked him \u201cRight about what?\u201d He said \u201cI put it on Kickstarter with a goal of $100,000 and we hit that goal in less than 30 days and we closed out at $330,000.\u201d This news was followed by stunned silence. WTF? People actually liked it. Go figure. He has now gone on to do another round of $300,000 and likely another one. Total revenue is likely over $1M by now with $500,000 cash in his pocket. You are welcome.Chance of getting funded: 1 in 10,000Local Angel Investor NetworksI am a huge fan of investing locally. I have been a member of the New Dominion Angels, Denver Angel Network, 460 Angels, and VTIN. I am looking to finally join the DC Angel Network if I can find the time to get back and forth. Local investors have access to inside data on local business startups and can plug in you into a number of opportunities. Most Angel networks limit investment range from $100,000 to $500,000 with a typical investment being 10\u201320 people putting in $10,000 each or around $150,000-$200,000.Chance of getting funded: 1 in 1,000Retain a Business or Patent AttorneyI have found that the best way to get introduced to people who know people is to hire the best damn attorney that money can buy, pay the retainer, take him to lunch once a month and then have them introduce you to other clients of theirs that are in similar industries that can help you move your deal forward. Cost it less, chance of success is higher and lunch is always good.Chance of getting funded: 1 in 100Private InvestorsThe best chance of getting funded are private investors like myself who are actively seeking and building opportunities. While I have reviewed over 6,000 submissions off Quora, only 200 of those were well researched, properly formatted and clearly presented. Of those 200, I am moving forward with 20 of them over the next 2 years. That is much better odds if you have your act together. If you don\u2019t know if you are ready or you are not sure that you are ready, then you likely are not ready for someone to review it. If you have something that is ready, then it is the best chance of moving forward you will find.Chance of getting funded: 1 in 10",
