            "answer_text": "They seem to have no trouble accepting and using technology to kill non-Muslims on a massive scale(September 11, 2001, and many other subsequent terrorist incidents) but seem to fail in using technology to improve the quality of life for their own peoples. I suppose it all comes down to what you culturally consider important, as technology, when all is said and done, is only a tool, a skill-set, if you will, that can be used either to benefit people\u2026 or kill them.

During the greatest period of TURKISH EMPIRE printing technology was developing and entire European countries were taking fullest advantage of it,, BUT A TURKISH MUSLIM CRERIC DECLARED THAT PRINTING IS AGAINST ISLAM. SO FOR MORE THAN TWO CENTURIES TURKISH EMPIRE COULD NOT GET BENEFITTED REGARDING THIS NOVEL FORM OF SPREADING EDUCATION, IT IS MOST PROBABLY ONE OF THE REASONS OF WEAKNESS IN REJECTING NEWER TECHNOLOGY AND DECLINE OF TURKISH EMPIRE. Such fatwas are against \u2018 ISLAM\u2019 but practiced by \u201cMUSLIMS\u201d. ",
