She mentioned in some video that Google have given/sent her a Pixel. However, she sports an Apple watch, which might suggest she also uses or had used some iPhone in the past. As a Pixel user, I am confident that most pictures she shares these days are coming from the Pixel! Edit: adding this picture straight from her Instagram page. See, it's a Pixel 2!  ",
