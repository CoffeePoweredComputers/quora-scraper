            "answer_text": "You\u2019re going to be disappointed in this answer, I think. They\u2019re ubiquitous, concealable, very useful, flexible and deadly. And if you\u2019re like most people, you already own a pair. Behold the human hands  Think about it. The human hand can be used as a fist to strike, as a blade to chop at body points, to grab and choke, push, lift, twist, bend or break parts of another person\u2019s body. They are used to grasp objects to be used as weapons, from rocks to shoulder-fired guided missiles. Knives, bows, pikes, spears, swords, axes \u2014 all the melee weapons of the world evolved to be grasped and wielded by the human hand. Even nuclear weapons are detonated by the human hand pushing a button or starting some kind of timer. And to think, people conceal them every day in the pockets of their pants, jackets, robes, etc. This is why police officers, when making contact with a person, are told to watch their hands. Hands will kill you. ",

Individuals detonating these devices have killed and injured large numbers of people with a single blast. How about a container of gasoline and a length of tubing? An individual so equipped killed over 30 people in a crowded nightclub in New York some years ago. We had a local detective who used to carry a Thompson submachine gun under his overcoat\u2026Slung on a shoulder strap. (He was a large individual) Most people could rather easily conceal a few hand grenades under a loose coat\u2026. ",
