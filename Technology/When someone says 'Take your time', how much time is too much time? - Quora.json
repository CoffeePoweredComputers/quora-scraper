            "answer_text": "Since, every question must be answered. Let's begin it. First of all, let's break this concept upto its nucleus. Time is a relative property. Everybody have his unique timezone, the set of actions and the time allotted to perform those chores respectively. , So as long as my timezone isn't clashing with yours, when we have to work together, you can take your time. Didn't get it ? Let's understand it in layman terms. \u201cTake your time\u201d is mainly used, when either you are : Taking a decisionPerforming an actionSuppose, you are sitting in an interview and you are thrown a quiz to solve and the panel says, \u201cTake your time\u201d then the time you will take, purely depends on: Are you taking a enough chunk of their time zone? Because, time is relative and everyone has different priorities, set according to their timezone. If they feel, you are not worthy then, your time allotted would be very less.Are there some other people waiting to be interviewed after you? So, are you taking their time also. Clashing time zone spotted!Or say, you have to make some big life decision then, you will have to give it another thought as long as you are comfortable to reach a final conclusion. Since, this \u201cTake your time\" is clashing with your own time zone. So, you don't have to worry much and you can take as long time as you want to reach to a result. So, final outcome is, if you take your time while dealing with your life, it can be granted. But, if you mess with some other's timezone then, you are fucked. Got it, Don't worry if you can't. Just take your time! ",
