            "answer_text": "The straightforward way to connect RPI3 wireless is using WiFi. Rpi has an On board Wifi, even if you are using a older version of the PI you can use a Wifi Dongle. For connecting Sensor to WiFi, you can use a cheap WiFi micro controller like ESP8266 (ESP8266 - Wikipedia). If you are just starting with Electronics, and not that good with soldering, I would suggest, you buying the nodemcu variant of ESP8266 (ESP8266 NodeMcu WiFi Development Board). Now all you have to do is write a listener program in Raspberry PI and have the ESP8266 send data to the Pi. You can also write a listener in the ESP8266 module and have RPi check poll for sensor data. Or try a starndard IOT protocol like MQTT. The implementation is really up to you. This forum would help you get started.Pi + ESP8266 Communication If you have any more questions, you can contact me at my LinkedIn page (https://www.linkedin.com/in/easonline/). ",

            "answer_text": "To turn Raspberry Pi into a wireless sensor, start monitoring the performance of wireless home network. The procedure to do this as follows : Get dashboard : Initially, request a dashboard. Then, follow instructions to load the agent image on Raspberry Pi\u2019s SD card.Set up wireless card : Procure a wireless dongle that is supported by the Raspberry Pi and install the proper drivers.Install WPA supplicant client : Configure wpa_supplicant client.Turn the wired agent into a wireless : Change the interfaces parameter.Reboot the agent from the command line and disconnect the ethernet interface.This process connects the wireless sensor appear on the dashboard to Raspberry Pi.
