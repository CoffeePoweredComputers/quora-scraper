            "answer_text": "Right now, we are trying to break the physical limitations out of the iron grip of Moore's Law. The trend is in multi-core microprocessors. More microprocessors with higher numbers of on-chip computing power are coming out faster than we can leverage their core capability. In the next 5 or 10 years what to expect depends on what side of technology you are on. Of you are a user, you will bee able to run more powerful applications and compute-intensive tools increasingly faster. If you are a developer, you might have to quickly learn and Master a range of new programming languages that will allow you to more fully leverage the processing power at your disposal more effectively. Concurrency and massively parallel development Paradigms will rule the day. A more functional approach to programming will be wise. ",

            "answer_text": "To my knowledge, the most interesting attempt to answer the problems facing current CPU architectures is the Mill (Mill Computing, Inc). Instead of a register or stack, it uses a temporal queue structure called the belt.  The belt is easy to compile for and uses a fraction of the silicon required to implement a contemporary out-of-order core.  It attempts to hide memory latency and race conditions through various cunning means, including adopting a single address space model, which does away with the need for a TLB and allows for simpler, faster caches and very effective advance loading.  The instruction architecture is geared towards getting DSP levels of performance on general purpose code without the need for a (mythical) Sufficiently Advanced Compiler.  There is a host of other innovations in the Mill architecture -- I recommend the video presentations and slide shows to anybody who is interested. ",
