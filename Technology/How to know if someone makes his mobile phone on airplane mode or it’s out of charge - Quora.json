            "answer_text": "It is very easy to know is a person has put his/her phone on airplane mode, or when his/her phone is out of charge. First of all, when you try to reach him via both calls and messages, none will reach him. You will be told that the person you are trying to call is out of reach. Whereas, if you use message, it will not be delivered. This will automatically tell you that the person has put the phone in airplane mode or is out of charge. Some people use airplane mode wrongly, maybe if they have your debt, they put their phone on airplane mode to prevent you from reaching them. A friend of mine used to do such when loaded with debts.

            "answer_text": "I believe airplane mode is going to be the equivalent of having no power on a cellular device because in airplane mode the network connectivity is deactivated that means no data travels to the satellite no data travels from the satellite to your device when the power is off additionally there's no data transmissions to or from your device\u2026 off the top of my head the only way I would think to determine if the phone is off or in airplane mode would be a low energy frequency scan test AKA Bluetooth or if the device is in Wi-Fi mode airplane mode can still be activated and you can ping the device on Wi-Fi as long as you are on the same network and you have the appropriate equipment.
