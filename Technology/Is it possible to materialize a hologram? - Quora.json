            "answer_text": "Real holograms don\u2019t work like the ones you see in science fiction, where a projector shoots out a beam of light which causes a hologram to appear in thin air. Real holograms are of two types: transmission and reflection. In the first type, transparent film is used to make the hologram. Once you\u2019ve made it, you can shine light through it with the right setup, and it will re-create the pattern of light that was going through it when the hologram was made, creating a sort of \u201cwindow\u201d which you can look through, and see what you could have seen by looking through the film when the hologram was recorded. In a reflection hologram, light is shone onto the hologram with the right setup, and it then reflects light in a way that re-creates the patterns of light that were striking it when it was originally recorded, creating a \u201cmirror\u201d in which you can see what you would have seen by looking at a mirror in the position the hologram was in when it was recorded. In both of these types, though, you need a physical object there to scatter the light and create the appearance of something there. We do not know a way, even in theory, to make a hologram like the ones in science fiction. ",
