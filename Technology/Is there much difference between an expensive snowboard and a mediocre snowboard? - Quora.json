            "answer_text": "Compared to a mediocre snowboard, a high-end snowboard is the product of much more attention to the design factors that affect snowboard performance. These include: Materials -- these affect the board's weight and flexibilityArrangement of materials -- companies sometimes use layers of fiberglass arranged in different patterns in order to affect the way in which the board flexes under pressureThe curve of the board's edges (its \"sidecut\") -- this affects ease of turningThe curve of the board as seen from the side (\"camber\", \"reverse camber\", \"rocker\", etc) -- this affects the way in which force is distributed along the edges and base of the board in response to the rider's action. It can make a dramatic difference in the way a board \"feels\". In particular, a \"rocker\" board can be more forgiving to beginning riders, because you're less likely to catch an edge suddenly and get pitched onto your face. (But there are inexpensive rocker boards, now that the technology has become more popular.)I agree with Jack that much of the difference will not be immediately appreciated by a beginning rider. However, if you've got the money and you think you're going to make a regular habit of it, err on the side of better equipment. Also, take advantage of \"demo days\" at resorts, during which you can try out equipment and feel the difference for yourself. ",

            "answer_text": "I think that cost isn't really something that comes into play here as cost really just depends on the time of year you buy a board and the brand. For example LibTech's Magne Traction edge - which for a while was proprietary - is available on some Rossignol boards because of the parent company. Lib Tech is far more expensive than Rossi, but at least from my experience Rossi is equally as good (though I hear Lib Tech reverse camber boards are pretty sweet). Lib just has a much stronger brand recognition amongst snowboarders (with the opposite true for ski equipment funny enough).  Rather than make a blanket statement that the more expensive the board is the better it is, I think you really just need to figure out what features you want in a board and then match the board that offers those features with ones that have positive reviews and then wait till it goes on sale. Important considerations I feel: Your foot size - do you need a standard board width, mid-wide board or wide board. You don't want your toes dragging around. What mountains you are riding on and where you ride. If you are riding in the NE you don't need a board suited for powder much, no point. If you are out west a ton you might find yourself wanting a board that has more float. Also - park riding vs all mountain riding etc. This answer can also determine whether or not you buy a split board, stiff board, twin, directional, long, short, etc. REI has a pretty good guide available @Snowboards: How to Choose. Another piece of advice is to buy at the right time of year. Wait till the end of summer when most places are trying to get rid of last years models to make space for this years models. Sometimes you can get a $600 board for $200.  Lastly, if you can afford it, spend the extra dollar here and there to support a local shop. They are the heart of snowboarding and big shops like The House are hurting them. You'll feel better about it... ",
