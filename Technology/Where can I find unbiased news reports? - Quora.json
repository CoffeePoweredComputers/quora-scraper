            "answer_text": "I prefer the traditional news sources. I love NPR, PBS News Hour, BBC News America and TV news programs that don't yell or talk over each other or behave rudely. The snarky and mean comments on TV news really make me feel terrible all day and I just hate that. I get most of my news from print sources. I read New York Times, and Washington Post, and NY Newsday Long Island for local news. I read Newsweek, Reuters, Associated Press, Forbes, Vanity Fair and Bloomberg News, New Yorker and Time, and New York Magazine mostly. I prefer the proper peer reviewed medical and scientific journals for medical and science news. If an event happens in a specific town I will access the hometown news paper to get their report of the event. If there\u2019s a situation in Pittsburgh, I\u2019ll access the Post-Gazette, if it happens in Chicago I\u2019ll look it up in the Chicago Tribune, if it\u2019s in Miami I want to read the story in the Miami Herald! Reporters know their own towns the best! I don\u2019t necessarily believe that a news sources needs to be \u201cunbiased\u201d. They do have to be factual and they have have solid and confirmed sources for their information- I will demand that, but it\u2019s not their job to be totally unbiased. Every news organization has their own perspective and opinion and these are valuable things to know! It\u2019s their job to stay on top of the news and know the real story and to find out what actually happened and their opinion of an event is important. They know more than anyone else and I want to hear their opinion! It\u2019s MY job to read many different sources of news and read all the opinions of the most learned people and then to form my own opinion of that same event! It\u2019s the consumer\u2019s job to gather enough information from all possible perspectives and form their own unique opinion! Asking for all news sources to be totally unbiased is just the consumer\u2019s way of being lazy. ",
