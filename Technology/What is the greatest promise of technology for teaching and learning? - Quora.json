            "answer_text": "When teaching online a teacher is free to experiment by applying different learning techniques such as blended learning, flipped learning, social learning, rapid learning, storytelling, microlearning etc. Thereby they can decide on the technique to make learning as engaging and effective as possible. Schools are struggling to meet the needs of a wide range of skill levels in a single classroom. Using digital curriculum, adaptive software, and other online resources combined with diverse learning models provides an avenue to shift our traditional teacher-centered classrooms to student-centered classrooms. There are millions of examples how technology teachers individually to the students, personalizes learning, deepens instructions, broadens instructions. One thing that technology does not do though, is a promise that any of those changes will be a benefit to the student. This still falls on the shoulders of the teacher. Technology offers the potential to change things for the good, but the teachers have to see the potential in order to do the things that are impactful. ",

Lots of variety of technological educational websites, applications, tools, devices provide teachers to prepare themselves for teaching in class and also outside of the classroom. Lesson planning, generating worksheets, tests, exams, classroom activities take now less time with the help of technology.

The students are more active than previous times in an technology enhanced environment.
