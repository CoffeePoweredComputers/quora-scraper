            "answer_text": "I had been seriously wondering this too when I started to grow an interest for Russian culture and people! But no, a sober Russian is a perfectly normal human being. It\u2019s true that the internet is full of weird videos that are evidently filmed in Russia. My Russian contacts love to send me this stuff, saying \u201cLook! This is what my country is like!\u201d. They love to portray themselves like that, and it is easy to play along with it (if you leave out politics). I think that the key word for the Russian person is pessimism. It\u2019s obviously visible: windows of houses in Russia are oftenly shielded with steel bars like prisons to protect against burglars and intruders. Russians highly dislike letting unknown people into their house. Dashcams in cars are very popular as they can help to provide evidence if the driver is not to blame for an accident. One can obviously make up from these examples that Russians are very distrusting towards strangers, but perhaps more hidden is the fact that they are pessimistic in general. Videos of crazy young guys dangerously climbing high buildings are very popular in Russia. While many foreigners will be more like \u201cThey\u2019re crazy, I\u2019m not watching this shit\u201d, Russians are immediately struck by their pessimism and will keep watching as they fear the worst to happen. If you have a Russian friend, you will also notice the Russians\u2019 dedication to help friends in troublesome situations. The fact that Russians are pessimistic means that they really need their sober close friends to occationally soothe them (in all kinds of ways). I even notice that Russian friends even try to entertain me, at random, just to brighten my day. This pessimism is also used for many kinds of entertainment in Russia. We all probably know the high degree of depression and pessimism in famous Russian literature. And I guess that if the Orthodox church wasn\u2019t so skeptical about it, metal music would be HUGE in Russia. But also other kinds of art in Russia show pessimism very evidently. I think the most shocking example is the artist Pavlensky, who did things to himself that are too horrible to describe in Quora. Russian people don\u2019t actually like this kind of art, but still their attention gets attracted to the horror as they fear the same to happen to them (or at least imagine it). I stress again, this is perhaps the most extreme example of them all. Things like threatening other people with rifles in traffic isn\u2019t something that happens a lot in Russia. But when they happen, it gets oftenly caught on camera as, like I said earlier (and so did Nikita Ostrovskiy), because people oftenly have a dashcam in their car. Violence does happen, but they are mostly related to alcohol consumption and happen in the city. Yes, Russians drink a lot and oftenly go to the pub in an already depressed mood. With the mental experience of already having your life hanging on a thread, it happens a lot that Russian men turn into violent partypeoples who use their fists to enforce respect\u2014simply because they lost their actual meaning in life. Russians are a unique kind of people, but not as crazy as they seem. It just takes a while understanding them. I\u2019m not a Russian myself, so I\u2019d love to get corrected if a Russian Quoran thinks I\u2019m mistaken somewhere. ",

There are of course people here who take mad risks, endangering their own and other people\u2019s property, health and lives. But in the grand scheme of things, statistically, they are balanced off by other Russians who always tread very carefully and watch every step as they go. If you have read about recent Russian history, you understand they have plenty of reasons to do so. If you are a fan of statistics, as I am, our Gauss curve may be flatter, but it is not more skewed compared to the one you have for your own nation. But here\u2019s one disclaimer. The main national fear in Russia is not the fear of death, or old age, or wars, or bad spells, or diseases. It\u2019s the fear of being ignored. Americans tried to ignore Putin, see which sh1tstorm they got themselves into. You may have noticed that the temperature of online discussions where we Russians participate, is often much higher that normally. We also are more direct, blunt, and rarely stop before using capslock and expletives. This not because we enjoy being mean and nasty. No, that\u2019s because too many of us have had too many moments in life when people refused to listen to us, treated us as if we were nobody. It\u2019s not fun to be dismissed as nobody. That\u2019s why we usually go up an octave or two the very moment we suspect to be ignored. The same fear is behind the Russian craziness on Internet or on YouTube. It\u2019s an attention-grabbing trick. No way you can ignore us. Expect more.  The story behind the picture above ",

To what extent that is true of Russia, I am unsure, but I can explain why some of the evidence of craziness is a bit exaggerated. One aspect of Russian society that is not common on a global scale, and which gives an exaggerated impression of their craziness, is that go-pros and other personal video-cameras are ubiquitous in vehicles. It is my understanding that having these cameras is a deterrent against corrupt police or insurance fraud, but an important side effect is that whenever anything \u2018crazy\u2019 happens on a Russian road, you can be sure that it will be recorded, and possibly later uploaded to the internet. As a result, there are a number of completely hilarious and also terrifying \u2018Russian Dash-Cam videos\u2019. I encourage you to watch them on youtube. These videos might make you think that Russians are completely insane, but I don\u2019t think this conclusion is justified because we don\u2019t know whether or not dash-cam videos from other countries would produce a similarly hilarious series of incidents. My intuition is that we would see similar things here in the US if everyone had a dash-cam. The popularity of dash-cam videos has caused the genre of \u2018crazy videos from Russia\u2019 to become quite popular. As a result, Russian daredevils may feel greater encouragement to post their exploits online, further contributing to the stereotype. ",
