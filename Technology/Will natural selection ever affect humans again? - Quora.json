            "answer_text": "Probably in the future, it will be a mix of natural and artificial selection. By artificial selection I mean changes brought about by our actions on the environment, rather than the us adapting to our environment. Guy Thwaites has already pointed out the obesity problem. Another instance of selection can be found in your wrist. Most of us have the muscle palmaris longus, which ends in a tendon that connects to the wrist just below the palm. Thing is, this muscle is gradually disappearing. 14% of the population don\u2019t have it. As was pointed out in an answer to a separate question, use of cutlery (and chopsticks) changed people\u2019s dentition. People\u2019s teeth used to meet edge on (\u201csetting one\u2019s teeth on edge\u201d) but now almost every one has an overbite. This is because people began eating with utensils, negating the need to sheer the meat from the bone with your teeth. Pressures to change are always acting on us, mostly now as a result of what we want, and what we do. ",

            "answer_text": "It\u2019s still affecting us now. It\u2019s just that the pressures have changed. For example, with our modern high-fat diets, the tendency to gain weight - which would\u2019ve been an advantage to our ancestors - has become a disadvantage, and is unhealthy and unattractive. It\u2019s likely that - over the next few centuries - the \u201cobese gene\u201d will gradually be fazed out of the gene pool through natural and sexual selection. This is a single example. Natural selection is still affecting us in many, many ways. ",
