            "answer_text": "The LM35 temperature sensor outputs an analogue signal which is proportional to the instantaneous temperature. The output voltage can easily be interpreted to obtain a temperature reading in Celsius. The advantage of lm35 over thermistor is it does not require any external calibration.  ",
