            "answer_text": "For me, it has to be the graphic user interface. It was the GUI which led to the widespread use of computers by the public. And now, with everyone carrying GUI-based computers in their pockets at all times, we have to deal with the social consequences of a generation addicted to video games, porn, and brain-destroying social media. Even worse, it has enabled mass government surveillance, caused potentially cancer-causing or reproductively damaging waves to spread through the atmosphere, and led to the biggest and most predatory monopolies in history (Google, Microsoft, Apple, etc.) to spring up, making billions of dollars for psychopaths who have made us slaves to their Orwellian products by \u201cevolving\u201d our culture to the point where they are de facto necessities. Imagine a world with no GUI\u2019s, where anyone who wants to use a computer has to type commands into a shell. Not so fun for most of us, is it? Computers could have remained the domain of the real nerds, who would use them for productive purposes: research, computation, and good old tinkering. Because of how far-reaching the consequences have been in so many aspects of our lives, the dumbing down of computers so that any idiot can use them is likely the most profoundly disastrous thing that has even happened in the history of humanity.

            "answer_text": "Voicemail.  Before I get into it, let's get this straight. Voicemail needs to die. There is absolutely no reason on Earth that we need voicemail any longer. Voicemail may even WANT to die. Just call her and tell me you don't hear the quiet desperation. Maybe you're a voicemail victim, like me? It all started so innocently. Out of the blue, someone calls from an unknown number on your cell. There are two thoughts you're most likely going to have \u2026 \u201cWho the hell is calling me?\u201d OR\u201cThey better be on fire\u201d You then click \u201cignore\u201d and go back to your business. 20 seconds later that infamous little jingle on your phone goes off. Yippee \u2026 a voicemail!! You give it a couple minutes waiting for the little text message chime to save you from listening to it. Minutes pass \u2026 no chime. Somehow you believed that when you hit the ignore button, that this would initiate a reasonable human being\u2019s empathy using the proper cell phone etiquette which suggests switching to a much preferred current day form of communication, like texting \u2026 But no, not this guy. NOPE - not today. This guy wants you to go through all the prompts to find out for sure who they are and what their demands are. Yes, demands will be made -they never come without a price. Then you think it\u2019s probably one of those \u201cHey it's me, call me back\u201d messages - oh what a joy! Those sure do make my day. Or even better, since you didn't recognize the number, it's gotta be one of those automated phone spam calls that you get to hear the last part of. Press 1 to hear more! FUN!  Now of course nobody on Earth wants to check their voicemail, what we all REALLY want to do is to remove that evil red \u201c1\u201d notification. (Unless of course you're one of those non-OCD freaks that doesn't mind the red dots - how do you live with such chaos?!) There's only one way outta this mess You finally go and spend that torturous 2 minutes getting through the prompts - and listen to the sooooo-important-it-couldn't-be-a-text-message-voicemail \u2026  Oh it's mom, she's calling from a different phone and she was checking to see if I got her text message from yesterday. Thank God I didn't pick up Voicemail just won't die So it turns out voicemail is an archaic time-waster and nobody likes it. But it hangs on, undead, with bits and pieces falling off but still ready to bite your ear off and chew on the gristle. But this isn't what makes it a zombie \u2026  No joke, I had an epiphany on how to help the world stop being a victim of voicemail \u2026 I would go on to share this knowledge with all my loved ones who would put me up on their shoulders, thanking me for saving them so much time and heartache. My solution \u2026 just shut it off. But, how do you shut off voicemail? Oh how naive I was. When I had this realization, I quickly called my phone provider and explained my conundrum. \u201cPlease, just turn my voicemail off and make it go back to saying the person you are calling doesn\u2019t have a voice mailbox setup\u201d The rep then goes on to tell me that they\u2019re sorry but once voicemail is activated \u2026 there is literally no way to turn it off. I had to laugh\u2026 You mean I woke up a freaking voicemail ZOMBIE!!!???  You literally cannot kill voicemail. The best you can do is to try and imagine what voicemail looks like if it took the shape of a human body, and then attempt to stab it or shoot it \u2026 just know they will survive but you'll feel slightly better somehow. I thought about it for a bit and the only real way I think you can kill voicemail \u2026 is you just stop using it. Problem is that red dot has too much power over me - it's just not that simple. So I try telling everyone who leaves me voicemail to just stop leaving me voicemails, by text, but it doesn't work. A couple months later, after checking a whole bunch of voicemails, I'm still thinking about this and come up with a reasonable solution. I finally found a way for the voicemail zombie and me to live in harmony, and it's now become something I'm know for in my circles \u2026  Do what I did: Call your voicemail now, and set a new greeting. \"I no longer listen to voicemail. Please contact me by text or email.\" You\u2019re welcome  Only telemarketers or your mom will still leave voicemails \u2026 it's quite literally the perfect filter (I LOVE YOU MOM!) Oh and if you're one of the lucky ones who never set up your voicemail, I commend your lazy ass or your incredible foresight - either way you're winning. ",
