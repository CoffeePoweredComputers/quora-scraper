            "answer_text": "On the Apple website when you choose the various options to customize your new iPhone Apple offers this program called a \u201ctrade-in\u201d. What this is that if your current, presumably older iPhone is in good physical condition (example - screen has no cracks, all of the buttons work, camera lens is clean and it can take photos and videos, etc and the audio works too) then you can trade it in towards a purchase for a new iPhone. At the moment the iPhone XS Max has the highest trade in value at nearly $500. The iPhone 8 Plus, in good physical condition, has a trade in value of $220. Let\u2019s say if you want to buy the latest iPhone which is the 2020 version iPhone SE, which is relatively cheaper than the iPhone 11, what you do is you take your current iPhone to an Apple store, show an employee there it is in remarkable condition and then tell them you want to buy an, for example an iPhone SE through a trade in. iPhone SE is around $500 to $600 at the moment and with the trade in the store employees will deduct the trade in value from the original price. So If your current iPhone\u2019s trade in value is $300 or something $500 - $300 is $200 right? WALA~ You can buy it now with no worries. Hope my response helped. ",

            "answer_text": "I would buy iPhone XS as you can get most value for your money. iPhone XS has almost all the features as the newer iPhone 11 line up. If you don\u2019t mind, preown or used, you can buy it around that price on eBay or Amazon. I bought few from eBay to do review videos (check out my profile for links) and preown or used doesn\u2019t make much a difference from new condition. But if you are looking for new, Amazon and eBay has iPhone X new around that price you can buy. Good luck! ",
