            "answer_text": "I am like a kid in a candy store. With the exception of pay as you go scientific and other scholarly journals, it is great. Further, the advent of free online university classes make \"the candy store\" even more exciting. Overall, it is changing to course of all of humanity, take the \"Arab Spring\" for example. That would not have taken place without it. Also, combined with the smartphone, it places information instantly and literally at ones fingertips, which is powerful.  This, in turn, speeds up technological change geometrically. Consequently, that leads to a corresponding change in society, the two, feeding each other. Given the ever accelerating rate of change, our world will be surprisingly different in 10 years. With great and fundamental change causing the old order of things to shift in dramatic ways. Those who despise change, conservatives, will chafe like never before. Take, for instance, the shift in economic power from New York City to San Francisco. The center of wealth in the USA is in the process of moving due to all the newly minted billionaires on the West.Coast, Elon Musk, being the de facto leader and prototype. Notice the hate coming from those who feel the tide shifting and their world threatened. There is a desperation revealed by their vitriol.  The new economic titans make their home in the Bay Area. Consequently, their political ethos is shaped accordingly.  When we make the shift to \"Fixed Cost Energy\" then that will bring conservatism, as we now know it, to the dust bin of history. For, their economic base will be decimated. All the above, directly influenced by the Internet.  Therefore, as long as the Internet remains open and unconstrained by corporations and government, we will see democracy preserved and enhanced and the political pendulum will begin to swing less wide. The one thing that will be highly unsettling is further and continuous job destruction throughout the economy.  Whole industries will vanish. Just look at 3D printers. That, my friends, will be very disruptive. For they are the first machines with the ability to procreate. Factories as we know them, will eventually vanish. Thus, survival in the future will require continuous upgrading of ones education with Leonardo da Vinci being the prototype. One will need to be a Maker of Change, learn to Surf the Change or suffer being chum in the Waters of Change. Geeks, will literally rule. ",
