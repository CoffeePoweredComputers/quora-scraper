            "answer_text": "I have done a fair amount of research on this which revealed the following: For the iMac, the most important consideration is the three options for data storage: plain old hard drive, Fusion drive, and solid state drive. Of these, the plain hard drive should be avoided, as it will significantly affect the performance of the machine. It is actually surprising that Apple would offer such an option, as it is clearly the weak link in the performance of what is otherwise a remarkably good computer, but they were clearly trying to hit some price points. The Fusion drives are good, but I would recommend you get a solid state drive, even at a smaller size if necessary due to cost, over the Fusion drive. The performance of the Fusion drive is still well below that of the solid state drives. External hard drives connected by USB3 are inexpensive and nearly as fast as internally mounted drives, although the USB3 throughput speeds will not make much difference unless your external drive is itself solid state. RAM is an non-issue for most people, to be honest. Really, 8GB is more than enough for all but video professionals. Programming definitely doesn\u2019t require a lot of RAM, and even if you find that your photo editing work requires more than 8GB of RAM, it is actually easy to upgrade on the iMac (and is the only thing that is easy to upgrade on the iMac.) The different processor speeds will most probably be unnoticeable for all but the most demanding workflows, such as video processing. I would, however, recommend the trackpad as opposed to the Magic Mouse. The trackpad offers a number of capabilities that the old fashioned mouse just doesn't; even if you are accustomed to a mouse from years of habit, I would recommend that you try to make the transition. AppleCare is the only warranty service that Consumer Reports recommends, out of hundreds of different manufacturer-sponsored insurance programs. I personally have a philosophical problem with insurance, so I don\u2019t partake, and it has been financially beneficial to me to have not done so, but I\u2019ve got several friends who financially benefitted over the years from purchasing AppleCare. To be complete, AppleCare is more than just insurance, and can be very useful, especially to new users. The one issue that is you will find with the iMac is the dearth of opportunities to actually use the remarkable 5K monitor to its fullest extent. Maybe your photo work will require that resolution, but there are precious few other opportunities, as 5K content is nearly nonexistent, and even 4K is rare. Still, the monitor is easy to fall in love with besides its overachieving resolution, and it will be hard to revert to a lesser monitor in the future. Because the iMac only comes with four USB3 ports, I\u2019ve found an external hub to be required. I found this one on Amazon which matches the aesthetic of the iMac: Amazon.com: Sentey LS-6141 Aluminium 10 Ports - 7 port Usb Hub 3.0 and 3-charging Ports, Portable Hub for Mac or PC Desktop, Macbook Pro, Mac Mini or Any Notebook, Mini Hub with Free Transport Pouch Included.: Computers & Accessories And for all iMac owners, these shelves are a welcome and clever place to store all of those external hard drives: Amazon.com: Twelve South BackPack for Mac | Storage Shelf for iMac and Apple Displays: Computers & Accessories Besides that, you\u2019re good. However, MacRumours recommends that you wait to purchase an iMac as updates are expected soon. iPhone, iPad, Mac Buyer's Guide: Know When to Buy ",

            "answer_text": "If you can wait a bit longer (months), they are talking about new ones with a big upgrade in processor, etc\u2026 I\u2019d wait until fall (2017) and re-assess. If you need something now, with the specs you provided\u2026 I\u2019d suggest the lower end iMac 27 inch for 1799$ - add the memory upgrade to 16GB and add an SSD instead of the HD or Fusion Drive. The SSD is a HUGE increase in speed over either of the other, older technologies, and its quieter. If you really need a bigger drive for a photo/imaging/music/video library, get a Thunderbolt 2 Hard drive (external) for that and another for your Time Machine backup. Hope that helps and good luck!
