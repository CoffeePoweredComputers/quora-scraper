            "answer_text": " When thinking of companies that have staying power in the 21st Century, the mind immediately goes to the technology sector: Apple, Microsoft, Google, Facebook, and Amazon. The big giants. However, there are other not-so-popular industries that are ripe for people to make investments in that could pay off huge over the next decade \u2014 and beyond. While betting on specific industries could seem a bit limiting to portfolio diversification, it never hurts to target businesses \u2014 or funds \u2014 where not a lot of eyes (and dollars) are presently looking. In other words: bucking the public opinion comes with its inherent risks but the rewards are potentially huge if you get in on the ground floor of a stock, or at least before something takes off and becomes wildly expensive. Here are some areas where to look to affordably spend in 2018 that could pay dividends over the next decade. Athletic apparel Most guys don\u2019t make it a habit of spending their free time in shopping malls but if you have been to one in the last six months you will have noticed something strange: Price tags on items like sweatpants and sneakers continue to skyrocket (for example: lululemon jogger pants are $128) yet people keep buying them like they\u2019re going out of business. Hint: This industry is here to stay for the long-term. People will need new shoes until the end of time, and consumers will always flock to the familiar brand when making such a purchase. And price be damned, they will always pony up the extra buck or two to attain that sense of comfort. While online retail might be destroying traditional, commercial storefronts (like the aforementioned shopping malls), there\u2019s still a high demand for these products. And there always will be; unless, of course, our society regresses into a slothful utopia over the next decade. It\u2019s an unlikely forecast. Drones  Companies that make drones are a good investment. Companies that use drones, or want to use them even more in the future (see: Amazon), are a good investment. But the best place to spend money? The companies that make the parts that make the drones. Look those ones up and open up the checkbook because drone technology is just at its beginning stages. And privacy be damned, drones are here to stay. Barcode scanners Similar to drones, companies responsible for the technology that make tracing products easier hold the keys to where online shopping goes over the next quarter century. One stock that seems to be undervalued is Zebra Technologies Corp. (ZBRA), a company that plays an integral role in supply chain management with a bevy of resources poured into barcode scanners that track products for on-demand delivery. As late millennials age into adulthood around 2020, there will be an even greater emphasis on online shopping and an even larger need for companies like UPS and FedEx to track goods around the globe. To keep that system flowing at its current rate, more and more companies will see the opportunity to develop barcode scanning technology. It\u2019s an untapped market that\u2019s set to explode. Entertainment Distractions \u2014 books, movies, TV shows \u2014 are a priceless entity. They\u2019re a timeless one., too. So it makes sense that the stock market and the entertainment industry go hand-in-hand. From theme parks to 4D movies, people will always need a place to go to waste time \u2014 and money. While Netflix might have a negative cash flow and own no profitable franchises at the present moment, its streaming model has opened up Pandora\u2019s Box for companies such as Disney. Not only can these storytelling conglomerates control what we see on the big screen, they will forever be part of our day-to-day lives at home. And as the political world continues to spiral out of control at a more rapid rate than any previous decade, its sound to think that in 2020 and beyond there will be an even great need for diversion. And if you\u2019re wondering, \u201cIs it too late already to get in on this industry?\u201d The answer is clear: We\u2019ve only seen the tip of the iceberg of where this locomotive is heading. Chipmakers It\u2019s almost hard to believe that this industry has taken a dip recently but for some reason Micron\u2019s stock fell earlier this year . The good news: The opportunity presents good value for investors looking to buy low. It\u2019s perfectly reasonable logic to believe that the chip-making industry will continue to produce technology for servers and data centers around the world. The outlook may appear hazy in the present but once the clouds part there will be a big, blue beautiful sky that will pay dividends in cold hard (green) cash. Machine Vision  Robots have eyes, too, you know. Companies that are able to give them such vision are worth investing in for the long-term. They may not pay dividends in 2019 but as the world continues to hand itself over to automated systems it makes sense that the creators of this technology are poised to stick around. There are some American companies that seem interesting (Cognex Corp comes to mind) but there are plenty in China and from other emerging markets that will look to give such systems the ability to scan accurately \u2014 and quickly. While the international companies will be harder to invest in early on, it\u2019s an area that deserves attention over the next decade as robots are beginning to be used in industries such as healthcare (robot surgeons!) and consumer staples (food and beverage). While these sectors begin to be turned over to robots, there will be more and more emphasis on giving robots sight so they can adapt and expand their functions. ",

            "answer_text": "Asymmetric opportunities. By definition, asymmetric opportunities have low downside and tremendous upside. If you were to invest $10,000, instead of targeting a 10\u201315% gain, you\u2019d be targeting to multiply your capital with 5\u201310x+ returns. For example, Kyle Bass took $30M in during the financial crisis and turned it into $2B in a few years. He was able to do that never risking more than $0.06 to make a dollar, meaning he can be wrong 15 times and still make money. It sounds unrealistic, but let me explain the process for discovering these opportunities, as well as how you can minimize your downside. The first step is to find sectors that have bottomed in a prolonged bear market with good future fundamentals. Keyword here is \u201csectors!\u201d We\u2019re not trying to pick individual stocks here, but rather looking at sectors that have had a pessimistic outlook for the past 7+ years and doing research to determine the probability of the likelihood of a bull market. These sectors are usually very cheap because no one is buying and it\u2019s not covered in the media. And because you will be catching the sector near the bottom, it\u2019ll be hard NOT to multiply your capital. During this step, it\u2019s also important to identify what your thesis is for what you want to buy and why you believe a bull market is coming. The second step is to apply your view in those sectors by investing in a basket of 3-5 stocks within each one. It\u2019s important to do your research on the balance sheets and management teams of the companies you\u2019d like to allocate your capital in. You can have a mix of safer picks and more leveraged plays. The third step is perhaps the hardest part\u2026 patience. Because the sectors you\u2019ll be investing in usually have a pessimistic outlook, and markets often stay irrational for far longer than anyone can anticipate, your research is what will give you the conviction to hold and even add to your position. So how do you mitigate your risk? By investing in many of these sectors and in a basket of stocks in each. Size your positions accordingly so you won\u2019t lose sleep at night. The key here is\u2026 let\u2019s say you have 5 of these asymmetric sectors and 3 of them go to 0. Because your returns for just one of these investments is 5\u201310x+, you will still make a handsome profit. As an example, take a look at Paladin in the last uranium bull market\u2026  It was 0.01 AUD in 2002 and peaked at ~8 AUD in 2006. Now, I don\u2019t expect anyone to catch the bottom nor the top, but even if you had been a bit late and got in at 1 AUD and exited at 6 AUD, you\u2019d have 6x your capital. If you\u2019re interested in learning more about asymmetric investment ideas targeting 5\u201310x+ returns, I highly recommend Chris MacIntosh\u2019s weekly newsletter. Chris actually rode Paladin in the last uranium bull cycle from 0.80 AUD to roughly 7 AUD, and he has over 20+ years of experience in uncovering asymmetric opportunities for his macro-focused deep value hedge fund. There are currently many asymmetric opportunities, so if your end goal is to make life-changing returns, then I\u2019d check his work out. PS - If this has helped, feel free to upvote and share :) ",
