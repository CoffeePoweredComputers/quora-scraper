Now, if your real intent is to ask do 5G Phones support 4G and WiFi. Yes, they do, and they\u2019ll even do 3G and 2G. It\u2019s simple and easy to support the older modems in a fall back mode, should you be in remote areas where networks simply haven\u2019t been upgraded. Yes, I\u2019ve been on GSM Edge in places as recently as this year which is a 2G data network technology. ",
