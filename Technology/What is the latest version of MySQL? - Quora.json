            "answer_text": "Hello, The latest version of MySQL is the MySQL 8.0  Changes in MySQL 8.0 include: More ways to Handle blocked rows, through the SKIP LOCKED and NOWAIT keywords. SKIP LOCKED allows locked rows to be skipped during an operation; NOWAIT throws an error immediately after encountering a locked row. MySQL can automatically scale to the total amount of available memory, to make the best use of virtual machine deployments. Indexes can be manually excluded from the query optimizer by using the invisible Index feature. Support for Unicode 9.0, Windows functions, and recursive SQL syntax. Expanded support for native JSON data and document store functionality I hope this information was useful. ",
