            "answer_text": "Welcome to the Onionland, one of the most mysterious place in the internet (there are still some deeper levels - Dark Web and Mariana Web). Level 1 - Your usual Facebook, Google, YoutubeLevel 2 - Academic databases, Financial records - you need special privileges to access these stuffs.Level 3 - You need Tor to access this level. Said to be the home of illegal drugs, child porn, stolen credit card numbers, human trafficking, weapons, exotic animals, Taboo sex, Illegal sex. Although a lot of the activity that Tor is used for is evil, it is also used as a safe-haven for victims of cyberstalking, political dissidents, and can help just about anyone regain digital independence for example Wikileaks, which reveal government\u2019s unworthy policies and secret agendas.Level 4 - Marianas web : This level is speculative; no one knows whether it exists. It is said to contain a repository of all of the humanity\u2019s best-kept secrets, like - The location of Atlantis, Aliens are live among us etc. I have used Tor a lot of times and have viewed a lot of \u201c.onion\u201d domains. Here are the list of some of them that may get you started : Where Google Doesn\u2019t Go - DuckDuckGoLink - http://3g2upl4pq6kufc4m.onion/Your google for browsing the dark web. It gives you much more privacy as search activity isn\u2019t logged by design. It gives decent results without tracking your activities, which leads to question - Are Google\u2019s extensive surveillance techniques really necessary?Your Bank - Blockchain for BitcoinsLink - https://blockchainbdgpzk.onion/You will need to spend a bit of money to enjoy the dark web at it\u2019s peak (Beware all, it\u2019s a dangerous place). This wallet helps you keep bitcoins anonymously and is quite secure (even has HTTPS certification)The Geek World - Sci-HubLink - http://scihub22266oqcxt.onion/This website is heaven for all the science lovers and underfunded scientific institutions, as it provides free access to millions of research paper. This is the place which truly aims for Knowledge For All.The Wikipedia of Dark Web - Hidden WikiLink - http://zqktlwi4fecvo6ri.onion/wi... This is the place to start if you are new to dark web. This website indexes a wide variety of websites and sources running on the dark web. A lot of them are spams and also illegal, so beware.Yes Facebook is here - The real Facebook Link - https://www.facebookcorewwwi.onion/ I really don\u2019t know the reason behind the presence of facebook\u2019s onion URL. It\u2019s quite possible that facebook wants to be accessible to its users where it\u2019s censored. (Beware! This could be a phising site. Hackers use phising sites which look like familiar websites. Once you login with your id, you do get directed to facebook, but at the back your login id and password is mailed to the hacker, making you and your account vulnerable.)Our Own Mailing System - Tor MailLink - http://jhiwjjlqpyawmpjx.onion This is a secure email client used by a lot of people for asking questions, contacting others etc.The Address Book - TorLinksLink - http://torlinkbgs6aabns.onion TorLinks is the other robust and usually accessible collection of .onion addresses.Host Your Own onion Domain - Freedom HostingLink - http://xqz3u5drneuzhaeo.onion It supports a large part of onion-net, and you can use it to host anything in dark web anonymously. But you can\u2019t host stuffs that are illegal under American law.Dark web is a good place full of information and people having different ideas. What is great about it is that it really gives a chance to websites that are banned due to their free thinking - Wikileaks. But with great power comes great responsibility. Due to this freedom, dark web has become home of a lot of illegal activities - stuffs you can get easily, that can really lead to big troubles. We all know the story of Silkroad - the website that brought dark web to lime light. So beware and use it with caution! Upvote if you think that I have helped you. ",

            "answer_text": "Dark web is a very interesting place with lots of websites to explore. But as much as it is interesting, it\u2019s ten times more dangerous and you need to be careful while browsing it. While I was browsing the dark web I came across some pretty interesting and informative sites. Here are my favourite sites on dark web: The Hidden wikiThis is one of the best sites on dark web that you will ever encounter. I call this site a \u201cGateway\u201d to the dark web. This site offers a variety of links to go deeper into the dark web. Celebrity morgueYou can also reach this site via clearnet. It\u2019s the site showing pictures of dead famous people. Tabooless chatThis is one of the most fucked up websites I saw. It\u2019s simply a chatroom. What makes it disturbing is the people in it. If you want to see how humans are fucked up, go to this site and you won\u2019t be disappointed. ParaZite\u201cData itself isn\u2019t good or bad, it just represents surrounding reality\u201d is the motto of this site. Here, you will find lots of guides, tutorials, instructions about things. Bullying, zoophilia, necrophilia, murder, cannibalism. You will also find links to guide you deeper. Mein kampfA site with Hitler\u2019s book known as Mein Kampf. Nanjing massacreOne of the most sickening events in the human history. Nanjing massacre. While you can find pictures of this on the clearnet, there is an entire site dedicated to this. Loads of sickening and disturbing pictures. One of the few sites that managed to disturb me. Cannibal forumsWhile disgusting and sickening, for someone as me who came to dark web to find those things, it was very interesting. It\u2019s basically a forum where people share their experiences with cannibalism. It\u2019s really fucking disturbing considering that in the eyes of the society most of them are just ordinary people. Like your next door neighbour. CatfactsThis is the cutest site on the Dark web. Click on the picture of a cute kitty and you get a fact about kitties. surprisingly innocent site. Dancing JesusA site with a Simpson\u2019s version of Jesus looped into a gif. Dancing. Not very informative but hell, it\u2019s kinda fun. Pedora boxI love this site. It\u2019s run by a group of hackers that trace pedo\u2019s IP addresses and post them. Code:GreenThis site is too awesome to not include. It\u2019s a forum for ethical hacking. A bunch of lads that ddos disturbing and illegal sites. If you like my answers, consider following me.
