            "answer_text": "No While I admit I'm a super amazing guy, I'm still way too unimportant that anyone would want to be listening in on my conversations. There could only be 3 scenerios Either I have some large corporation listening in on my conversations. That isn't gonna happen, their is enough data being mined about me currently through the internet. It would not make economic sense to be trying to learn my consumer habits when they are already known. A government agency listening to me. I break laws, I do and often. But I don't do anything worth a damn to warrant government or police agencies to listen to me. And if they were listening to me, they would have already came and got me, I've talked on the phone about crimes I've committed many many times. Finally I have some stocker who has bugged my phone. Super unlikely that I ran into some one who knows how to do that, that I also left my phone around unattended so they could have the opportunity to install a spy app and my phone, who also has also is so interested in me that they felt the need to listen to my conversations. Just way too unlikely. ",

            "answer_text": "I think it is possible to turn on the camera and microphone on a device remotely without the owner knowing. There are enough incidences of people\u2019s phones being stolen and they turn on the camera and microphone of their stolen device and are able to see and hear the thief, or the person who bought the stolen phone. It would also not surprise me that Google and Amazon use AI to \u201clisten\u201d to conversations to train their AI algorithms and to listen out for keywords to improve their marketing results. As AI improves it would not surprise me if listening in becomes common place when it becomes possible to do early diagnosis based on keywords in conversations. When listening in to conversations for the good of people is approved the same AI could listen for criminal keywords as well. The study of facial proportions is also so advanced that it is possible to determine a lot of character traits from faces. It would not surprise me that this is used int eh future. In some respects it can be used for good and in other to discriminate against people. The possibilities are endless and it depends on how vigilant we and our polotical representatives are as to the extend that this becomes normal in our future. ",
