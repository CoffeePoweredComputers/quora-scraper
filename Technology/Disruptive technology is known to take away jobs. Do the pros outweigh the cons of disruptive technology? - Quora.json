            "answer_text": "Of course so. There\u2019s absolutely no question about it. If, for example, I invent some new technology that can replace all taxi drivers. That would reduce the cost of a taxi ride, and free up thousands of people to do other productive work. Sure, the transition may be tough, but long-term everyone benefits. Or look at it another way, what if we took away all the world\u2019s barcode scanners? The result would be a lot more people manually tracking inventory and prices on hundreds of thousands of items. Your checkout at any store would take much longer, and would cost businesses more. Technology increases efficiency, and enables our country to produce more goods and services with the same number of employees. ",

Even where the jobs matter, it\u2019s usually better to proceed with the technology and do something to support the affected people than to try to keep the old, inefficient ways going. ",
