            "answer_text": "Yea Face ID is safer than Touch ID , but i am not sure that how many app developers will update their apps to support face ID . Face ID is 2 times secure Than Touch ID in general but face id is usally not that convienent in lot of situations . SO In terms of security Its yes face ID is better but in terms of usability , Touch ID is still better ( until november 2017 we can\u2019t alot about this, So if the face ID works as demonstrated by apple it will be great ) ",

            "answer_text": "I should say yes coj apple company core business environment is perfection, touch id has 1 out of 50000 probability to unlock , face id has 1 out of 100000 to unlock so it is safer . They won\u2019t launch anything without testing and perfecting the products they are to afraid for that coj they don\u2019t want their goodwill and brand to lose its value . So it is safer. ",
