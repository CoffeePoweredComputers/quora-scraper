            "answer_text": "Thanks for A2A. Does removing dust from an old PC help on performance? Even if you have to pay a technician to do it for you, regular dust-removal will help maintain optimal performance. When dust accumulates on heat-sinks or cooling fins, it inhibits the transfer of heat out of the machine, and in extreme cases can lead to CPU/GPU overheating and failure. Long before that, the related fan(s) will be overworked and likely to fail sooner.   In both these situations, the CPU was being throttled in performance because of inadequate cooling. ",

            "answer_text": "Your PC will run quieter, as the fan(s) will be able to move sufficient cooling air at a lower speed. Laptops will have better battery life. In extreme conditions, computers will throttle themselves to avoid overheating. If cleaning the dust out can improve cooling to the point where it doesn\u2019t throttle, you will see higher performance. ",
