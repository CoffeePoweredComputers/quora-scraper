            "answer_text": "This is a question you have to answer with \u2018it depends\u2019. It depends on solar irradiation, used technology (fixed panels, or panels tracking the sun) and optimization for land usage for example. A quick look at the power generation of the largest photovoltaic power plants listed in List of photovoltaic power stations - Wikipedia gives roughly 40MWp/km\u00b2, for example 36MWp/km\u00b2 (1547MWp on 43km\u00b2) for the Tengger Desert Solar Park40MWp/km\u00b2 (1500MWp on 37km\u00b2) for the Benban Solar Park57MWp/km\u00b2 (747MWp on 13km\u00b2) for the Solar Star (I and II) park.That\u2019s roughly in line with the report of the National Renewable Energy Laboratory analysis:https://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy13osti/56290.pdfreporting about 5.8 acres per MWac (32 MWp/km\u00b2 assuming a performance ratio of 0.74) for large plants with fixed panels. Focusing on what really counts, that is energy production:As an example, Solar Star (I and II) park produces 1,664GWh per year on 13km\u00b2, that\u2019s 128GWh per and km\u00b2.Cestas Solar Park in France produces 152GWh (Wikipedia) or 140GWh (operator info) per year and km\u00b2.The NREL reports 3.1 acres per GWh and year, that\u2019s 80GWh per year and km\u00b2 for large plants with fixed panels. So it looks like the french park is particularly efficient in land use, getting 140GWh per year and km\u00b2, but since you could have sites with more sunlight, the value could be higher in other areas. That confirms Anton Carver\u2019s number in another posting.Where land is cheap, it might not be useful to optimize for land usage, so the number drops. And finally, it is not really useful to assign land usage to rooftop solar, where you don\u2019t need additional land to add solar energy production. ",

            "answer_text": "Nominal dimensions of a 250W panel are 1.63mx0.98 or 1.6m^2, which means 156W/m^2 1km^2 is 1000mx1000m or 1 000 000 m^2 or 1Mm^2 (156 W/m^2) x (1 Mm^2) = 156MW (Total instantaneous per km^2) Some room would be needed, between rows, for maintenance, and panel framing, using an arbitrary 20%, that would mean around 125MW peak production. Factors such as Latitude, season, panel type, tilt angle, and system efficiency, will alter the output. Colder temps at higher Latitudes can increase output, say, 10% - 20%. Conversely, the closer to the equator the more de-rating. A realistic range might be 100MW\u2013150MW peak. At 150MW x 365 =~55GW-days this means ~55GW/year total average entire year. (This is a \u201creverse\u201d calculation. Using 365 day fixed, whereas the hours/day vary.) This is peak. Now, assume year long average of 10 hours of sun daily, gives total output of ~550GW-Hrs yearly total production. For 12 sun hours daily, add 20%, then subtract something for non-peak hours. If 100MW rather than 150MW, subtract 33% For a 12 hour day at peak levels > 660GW-Hrs yearly, but all day peak is unrealistic.  In a cooler location, say, add 20%, gives ~800GW-Hrs yearly. This is problematic because at higher latitudes seasonal insolation will affect the averages, and peak cannot be at 100% of the time.  Suppose you start with 1TeraWatts per year.  To generate that much power in one square km, 100% of the ground would have to be covered in panels. No gaps, no walkways, and the angling would shade a portion of the panel above. With 12 hours/day at peak output, no rain, no cloudy days, you\u2019d need a panel that can produce 228 W/m^2, which means a standard panel rated at 365W. Realistically, 500GW-Hr/year, +/-10% might be reasonable. I suspect the minus more likely than the plus, but I don\u2019t know.  N.b.: Power is measured in Watts. Energy is Power x time, measured either in Joules, or Watts times Time. Watt-Hours usually indicate a daily total. That\u2019s (W times Hr) not (W per Hr). Yearly energy production/consumption is power times hours times days/year, averages tend to rule. For a given latitude, PV panel output varies by time of day, by moment, by season, and by \u201cdark days\u201d which is also affected by Longitude. The starting point must always be the instantaneous peak output, all else are estimates. Hours/day vary seasonally, and even 365 days cannot be used reliably since cloud cover, rain, etc. can vary drastically with seasons. The nearby Pmax curve shows about a 10% per 25C (45F) temperature difference. It shows 100 at 25C, ~110 at 0C, and ~90 at 50C, since the Pmax curve is a straight line, it says the temperature effect, on output, is about 1% per 2.5C (4.5F). That\u2019s -0.4%/C. The higher the temp the lower the output.  ",
