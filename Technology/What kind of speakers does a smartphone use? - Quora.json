            "answer_text": "Greetings! Smartphone audio depth and clarity are limited by coin-sized speakers. Low-power amplifiers produce tinny or hollow sound, while many techniques that compress files to make them easy to store and stream also compromise the audio quality. These are the mono or stereo speakers with the small pitch of sound clarity. Now, Dolby Atmos and Dolby Audio are coming in the phones to change the whole mobile experience. ",
