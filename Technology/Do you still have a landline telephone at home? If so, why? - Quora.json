            "answer_text": "I\u2019m a tiny bit amused that the person who knows the most reasons to still have a landline phone is the guy who spent 30 years working for the phone company, in sales\u2026 ;-) I read Matt Snavely\u2019s excellent list of reasons to formulate why I did, until recently, have one. Of course, I grew up in a house with a landline phone. Actually, two, one at each end of the house, but with the same number. After we got a modem, my parents eventually got a second line. They\u2019ve had the same phone number for probably 55 years now! I moved out before everybody had cell phones, and over the course of about six or seven years, lived in 5 apartments in 4 towns in 3 counties in 2 states. So every time I moved, I had to get a new landline number. While living in the last of those apartments, my employer decided they wanted me to be reachable \u201con call,\u201d so they got me my first mobile phone. Then I got an actual house in a different town in the state I was living in, so that was one more new landline number\u2026 which turned out to have been given up by a ball-bearing company so recently that it was still listed in the current yellow pages. Calls about ball-bearings early in the morning aren\u2019t my cup of tea, so I complained and got another new one\u2026 and I stayed in that house for about 14 years! But eventually, I think I got rid of the landline number and just had DSL internet and a mobile phone, since I wasn\u2019t really home very much\u2026 and didn\u2019t want to give people an easy way to deduce whether I was home or not. When I moved to where I now live and work, it was back to apartment living. The cable and phone companies all offered \u201ctriple plays\u201d so I opted for one with a fiber-optic connection and internet speeds that not so long ago I would\u2019ve thought of as the sole purview of large universities. Ooh, shiny. I went out and got a corded wall phone with line-powered speakerphone, which worked great. Of course, since it was fiber-based, power outages meant phone outages unless I sprung for a battery backup\u2026 but my cell phone would still work, so I didn\u2019t mind. I had this \u201ctriple play\u201d until late last year or early this year, then decided it just wasn\u2019t worth it. The only people I really wanted calls from on that line were my parents, but 99% of the calls that actually came in were scammers and caller-ID spoofers. Not cool, and it was a waste of my valuable time to even go through the voicemail and clean it out. So ultimately, I traded the triple-play for just internet, 10x faster. I could have kept my mobile number from where I used to live, but it was pretty far away and the time-zone difference could make for calls at awkward hours. So I got a new mobile number in a local area code here\u2026 with a prefix that geolocates to a rate center one county away from where I actually live and work, just in case the ninja assassins get hold of my number. (My work-issue mobile phone does the same in the other direction, and even my desk phone shows as a town about 20 miles from my desk.) So\u2026 no, no landline at home at present. Hoping to be able to afford a house again in the next several years, and will certainly entertain the idea again at that point\u2026 although exactly what form it will take remains to be seen. I now live in a world where an incoming call on my mobile might also ring on a laptop or tablet, and where all these devices also have video capabilities. My future \u201cwall phone\u201d might be a tablet or large-screened mobile phone with WiFi+LTE, mounted on the wall, with apps for \u201cphone,\u201d Skype, WhatsApp, Google Hangouts, FaceTime, or whatever else. And it might ring for a lot of the same things my mobile phone rings for. ",

            "answer_text": "I do, and here are a few reasons why. You can argue against each of my reasons (and so could I), and my kids are fine without having one, but for me the benefits still outweigh the cost. I\u2019ve had the number for more than twenty years and have used it as the required \u201creach\u201d number on hundreds of forms where I don\u2019t really want them to reach me.It is a phone number for people I don\u2019t really want to talk to.It has better quality for interactive conversations (business) and conference calls, plus on conference calls both hands are free, I can trust the mute function and I can still speak and hear clearly.It isn\u2019t really very expensive as part of a triple play bundle from my cable provider.My phone stores messages so they aren\u2019t out there somewhere \u201cin the cloud\u201d.I can call someone with the security of knowing they aren\u2019t capturing my cell phone number.When I call 911, they know immediately where I am physically located.Using a handset on long calls is comfortable and I don\u2019t have to monitor battery life.I can put it on speaker and write or take notes while I listen.During certain weather related power outages it is more likely to still have dial tone.If the cost spiked I would get rid of it, but for now, it is something I\u2019ve always had and I like it. I wish I could still have the WSJ and local paper delivered everyday but they got too expensive and I miss them. I would miss this too, and nostalgia has value as much as tangible benefits sometimes.

So it is the same number I always had, I use the same phones, it works the same way (except I have a cool feature where I can get my voicemail messages on my phone via an app) and basically is a landline. I don\u2019t remember if it costs $10/month or is free, but I have it probably from force of habit. I have had this number for a long time. Every doctor\u2019s office, credit card company, etc., has the number. It would be very annoying to have to change my number with all those entities. The \u201clandline\u201d also functions well as a \u201cspam catcher.\u201d Despite being on the do not call list, I get several calls per day that are probably spam, as well as calls from non-profits to whom I\u2019ve donated, political calls etc. I don\u2019t answer any of them. It\u2019s very useful to have that number to catch the junk calls. ",

It also looks rather old fashioned and cute. It\u2019s a black 1980s landline telephone. The hearing quality of the voice of the person at the other end of the line is sometimes OK, but not so great at other times. My parents still have a landline phone too.

I converted it to VoIP, so I will be able to call with national tarifs instead of international tarifs, while on holidays in other countries.The VoIP provider only charges conversation time, and no monthly subscription fee, so I can keep my landline number at nearly no cost Also VoIP and the SIP protocol was my specialty at work, so I still stay in touch with the VoIP technology while being retired.

It\u2019s not susceptible to power cuts, bad weather, &c.It is cheaper than a mobile, and cheaper to call as well. I can have extensions in every room.I don\u2019t have to worry about the battery running down.I can never lose it.I need it for the internet.I can use a proper answerphone.I can use handsfree or a headset.It\u2019s not dependant of the vaguaries of reception or if the local base station is working.If I want a new one, they\u2019re cheap to buy and I don\u2019t have to put up with the hard sell from the sales droid. That will do to be going on with! ",

That\u2019s cool but we live in a low coverage area and like that it is separate from our wireless service. We also occasionally use it for a telephone. It\u2019s actually kinda of nice that we have a backup communication method for those times that cell service isn\u2019t working well. ",

Here in the UK, it\u2019s usually (but not always) cheaper to have a landline along with internet service, compared to standalone broadband. Often the landline service comes with some free calls as well. Until recently, most cellphone carriers would not even let you call \u201cfreephone\u201d numbers for free, whereas landlines have always allowed you to call them for free. ",
