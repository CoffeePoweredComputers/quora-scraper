            "answer_text": "Size. Color. Materials. Big phones are much better at radiating heat. Black phone parts radiate heat better than silver parts. Metal frames help radiate heat and to spread it around. Glass is an insulator and thus phones with glass on two sides need a metal frame to conduct heat. Your hand is also used as a heat sink when holding a phone. Much better thermal conductivity to your hand than just air. ",
