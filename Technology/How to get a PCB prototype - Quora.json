            "answer_text": "If you don\u2019t really know what to do. look out for some good tutorials and info-sites (News - Mikrocontroller.net for beginners). For Testing: Use a breadbord for testing your circuit(s) before paying much money in a final PCB-board.For Hobbiests: Make you own (single or) 2-Layer PCB. (If there is no HF or something like this on your board )For Pro\u2019s: Mr. Lipphardt is right. Or look for EMS service providers.If it is your first prototyp board ever, contact your local EMS/PCB service and let them take a short look over your project (maybe it\u2019ll be not produceable; Some specifications must be observed; spending this money is maybe better than recieving 10-fault-boards from china) ",
