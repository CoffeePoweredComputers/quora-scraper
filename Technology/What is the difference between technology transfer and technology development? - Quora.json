            "answer_text": "In order to understand the major difference between technology development and technology transfer, you can consider two major terms, i.e., Invention and Discovery. Technology Development Now let\u2019s talk about technology development; it is a process of developing the technologies and products that have not done before. Besides, it is a process of improving and testing a new technology for particular applications. It takes an idea or product from a hypothesis to a usable product. In general, development is started after the product is finished, which is also known as the product prototype. It means here the product is tested to determine if it is ready to use or not. For example Let take an example of laser technology. Around 60 years ago, they were tested in the secret labs generally founded by the government. That was only for military applications. With time, the laser tech becomes condensed and modified to portable applications. For example, laser designators, range finders, aim assistance, and more. Technology Transfer Speaking about technology transfer, it is the process of using existing technology and innovatively utilizing the technology to achieve something new. The lifecycle of a technology transfer covers research and development (R&D), invention, evaluation, marketing, licensing of the new technology, development, and public use. Here the transfer of the technology can take place at any stage of the development. It may consist of offering data, apparatus, technical documentation, and more. Under this process, the firm which has brought the new technology from research institutes or universities can save time, investment, and more. For example If one country is planning to develop a radar system for the fighter jets but doesn\u2019t have any experience in this, that particular country can save time and money by obtaining that technology and then make some changes to it instead of developing it. Another example is the use of AI technology in cars. Generally, car manufactures don\u2019t develop AI technologies. They purchase the technology from the developers and use it in their cars. For a better understanding of this, one can take the help of IC1101, which has been actively helping companies in technology development and transfer since 2009. ",

            "answer_text": "Here\u2019s one way to differentiate these two concepts. Technology development involves improving and testing a technology for a given application. \u201cTechnology Readiness Levels\u201d provides a perspective. Here\u2019s the Department of Defense description of TRLs. https://www.army.mil/e2/c/downloads/404585.pdf The \u201clinear model\u201d of innovation proposes that basic scientific research is followed by applied research that evaluates the suitability of scientific discoveries and inventions for various uses and applications. Development then follows applied research. Here\u2019s the Federal Acquisition Regulation definition of \u201cdevelopment\u201d based on this model: \u201cDevelopment,\u201d as used in this part, means the systematic use of scientific and technical knowledge in the design, development, testing, or evaluation of a potential new product or service (or of an improvement in an existing product or service) to meet specific performance requirements or objectives. It includes the functions of design engineering, prototyping, and engineering testing; it excludes subcontracted technical effort that is for the sole purpose of developing an additional source for an existing product. FAR -- Part 35 Research and Development Contracting All this is formalized descriptions. In practice, the development of a technology can take place in all sorts of ways, utterly out of sequence from what lawyers and managers think proper. Steven Johnson, in Where Good Ideas Come From describes a number of situations in which technology develops without overt management\u2014\u201dnetworked, non-market\u201d approaches. Open source software projects, for instance, may develop code (\u201cinformation technology\u201d) in multiple directions, making local applications that then might be rewritten for general applications\u2014and mostly ignoring \u201cTechnology Readiness\u201d levels\u2014the stuff for big organizations with too much on the line (and often over much demands for central control). In historical accounts of innovation, often the operators of technology make improvements based on observations of technology in practice. For one version of such things, see Matt Ridley\u2019s The Rational Optimist, in which Ridley describes how in the industrial revolution, technology change often came before the basic science . For another, consider Richard White\u2019s account in Railroaded of locomotive engineers modding their engines for specific train routes, and then shared the details of their modifications with other engineers. Technology transfer, by contrast, has to do with moving a technology from one group that knows it or practices it to another group that previously did not know or practice it. That transfer may take place at any stage of a technology\u2019s development (or \u201creadiness\u201d). Transfer may involve providing apparatus, data, technical documentation, assistance, and/or intellectual property rights. There are variations on technology transfer. In one, a technology practiced in a one nation is provided to a nation that has not practiced it. For instance, a \u201cdeveloped\u201d nation might seek to introduce tractors (and all the infrastructure necessary to support tractors) for agricultural use into a country that has not used tractors. Such a transfer might not involve anything particularly new about the technology\u2014the technology is often well established if not lagging edge in the developed country. The challenge is whether the technology so well \u201cdeveloped\u201d in the \u201cdeveloped\u201d country will work in the conditions encountered in the \u201cundeveloped\u201d country. It may turn out that the \u201cundeveloped\u201d nation\u2019s approach is more workable\u2014ahem, more \u201cdeveloped\u201d\u2014than the introduced technology. Here\u2019s an account that fusses a bit over this sort of transfer: Technology Transfer and Third World Development In a second variation, a technology practiced in one industry is adapted for use in another industry. Such transfers might involve a thoroughly \u201cready\u201d technology in one industry having to be revalidated for a different use. Computer technology, for instance, has gradually made its way into automobiles. But those digital dash displays in cars often feel like they are a decade behind leading edge display technology in computer monitors, televisions, and cell phones. Technology transfer in such settings is akin to \u201clag\u201d in adoption. In a third variation, a technology (or something that might lead to a technology, or could be fantasized as becoming a technology) that has been conceived or discovered or invented or observed or collected in a research setting is transferred to one or more companies that might develop the technology for specific applications. In this variation, \u201ctransferred\u201d means \u201clicensed\u201d as to patent rights, along with technical documentation, data, and perhaps technical assistance from the inventors. This variation is typical of university administrators\u2019 usage of \u201ctechnology transfer\u201d\u2014they imagine a linear model in which the university uses licensing to initiate technology development. Here\u2019s a typical account and diagram: OSU Technology Commercialization Process What university administrators often don\u2019t get is that their insistence on patenting and excluding all others in the hope of landing a lucrative patent license deal (once in 2000 or more inventions) may also disrupt technology development that follows non-linear practices, creating a cumulative technology with contributions from multiple sources, often without the need for central control. In one other variation, Research Corporation created the idea of \u201ctechnology transfer\u201d offices at universities to assist faculty investigators in identifying patentable inventions and \u201ctransferring\u201d these inventions to Research Corporation for management. Research Corporation then would attempt to place these technologies with industry via non-exclusive or exclusive licensing. In this variation, then, technology transfer means conveying the patent rights and description of an invention to an invention management agent. While university-hosted inventions are often characterized as \u201cearly stage\u201d\u2014meaning, an early stage of technology development\u2014it practice many such inventions may be practiced immediately. This is true of research tools\u2014instruments and methods used in research. The research team that developed the tools is using them\u2014they are \u201cready\u201d for use. They may not be \u201cready\u201d ever to be commercial, mass-marketed products, but that\u2019s an entirely separate issue. Similarly, some university-hosted inventions can be adopted by professionals undertaking only so much \u201cdevelopment\u201d as necessary to teach themselves the technology and adapt it for their use. Disease diagnostic assays are one such area of professional use. Surgical methods are another. Any number of methods in information technology and programming are yet another area where code may be readily adopted without the need for \u201ccommercial\u201d development. ",

            "answer_text": "The difference between technology development and technology transfer is akin to that of invention versus discovery. Technology development is creating a new technology or product, to do something which could not be done before, or at least not in the same manner. Technology transfer is taking an existing technology and using it in a new way, possibly to achieve something else. They both involve innovation as they are both aimed to solving problems that exist, just going about it in different ways. An engineering example could be: A scientist is in the business of technology development, sitting in his lap and thinking of new products to create. An engineering is in the business of technology transfer, where he takes the technology developed by the scientist and re-purposes it for his use. Another example: The invention of the car was a technology development. The invention of the sports car was a technology transfer from the first car. Hope you liked my answer! Rohan ",
