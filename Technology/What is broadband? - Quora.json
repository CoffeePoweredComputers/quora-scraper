            "answer_text": "IT terms remain unclear till now. Mostly historical reason, since old time there are not many association to rule. Back to broadband \u2026 The word could be easily divided into two. What is band? Normal life when we talk about it, we refer to music. In telecommunication world, band is about frequency. Yet one thing similar to music band, it must not be single. That is to see, it ranges from low to high. How does frequency come? This is related wave, in our case, EMW. Telecommunication is based on these EMW. Discrete signal converted into frequency domain would have band (continuous). This is basic trick in DSP. Given a band is range of frequency. What is broad? This could be also asked what narrow is. As the term implies, if frequency range is short, narrow; otherwise, broad. What is the difference in use? Broadband can carry more information. These bands is somehow same as roads. More cars can be running on a wide road. Take mobile IP internet, like LTE, its bandwidth is 1 ~ 20MHz (depends on channel). Compared to radio AM, 1130 kHz. ",

A broadband connection, like a telephone line, is never switched off and can be accessed at any time. A user with a broadband Internet connection has a much faster and more enjoyable experience while on the Internet when compared to someone with a Dial up connection ",
