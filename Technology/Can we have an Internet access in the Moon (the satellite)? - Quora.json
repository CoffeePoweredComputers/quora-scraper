            "answer_text": "Can we use the internet on the moon? Not the one we all love and use. If we were to just hook up something on the Moon just as it is now, bandwidth would suck, latency would be 1200 milliseconds higher, and you would have lag of 2.5 seconds. That was the problem for the Soviet lunar rovers: they could get a low-quality television signal, and everything was delayed by two and a half seconds. Still, they drove them around for some time. We could build a local internet region rather easily if we could just get the equipment there, but for that region to be connected to the internet over here, it needs some additional stuff, like huge antennae, delay-tolerant networking protocols, and proxy servers. This problem will be a lot harder for the other bodies in the Solar System, but in principle this is how it would be done. ",

No, due to the fact that all of the serversare here on earth and I bet you are thinking \u201cwhy don't they just point an internet satellite twards the moon\u201d, well that would be great except for the fact that both the earth and moon are in constant motion, and any satellite can orbit the earth ina few hours depending on speed. Also even if we could get a synchronous orbit of a satellite to point to the moon the signal would dissipate way to much to have a connection. But in about eight to twelve years from now I believe that our Internet will be able to reach the moon. I mean twelve years ago cell phones were just for talking, texting and mabey a few cheesy black & white games. ",
