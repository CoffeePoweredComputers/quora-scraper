            "answer_text": "I know this is not what you specifically asked for, but I don't know of videos, and this guy's story is guaranteed to creep you out. It's a man who tweeted for months about being haunted by the ghost of a boy with a dent in his head, a boy he came to call \u201cDear David.\u201d This article supplies a synopsis \u2014 We Talked To The Guy Being Haunted By \"Dear David\" & Apparently It Got Worse Oh, my bad \u2014apparently there are videos as well as his photos. If this was a hoax, it was very well done. I would post a photo but I really don't want to spoil the effect, plus the photos are creepy and I don't want to see them. But I spent a night a few months ago reading every tweet and looking at every photo and video, and it gave me chills.

            "answer_text": "Creeper in my apartment New York City actor Joe Cummings made this video capturing what appears to be a homeless woman who secretly lived in his house for an indeterminate amount of time. As recently as July of last year, Joe continued to insist this really happened and is not a prank or joke. There was never another product or release that tried to market itself off this video, so chances are he's telling the truth, which makes it so much creepier.
