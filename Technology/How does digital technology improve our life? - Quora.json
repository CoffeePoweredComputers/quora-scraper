            "answer_text": "I\u2019ve cried more in the last few weeks than I had in 2019 combined. I\u2019ll listen to a podcast and cry. Or, I\u2019ll be running around my neighborhood thinking about my friends and family and feel so helpless and I\u2019ll start crying. A few reasons why I\u2019m feeling so overwhelmed with emotion: I\u2019ve just moved to a foreign country (Japan). I had no friends or prior connections, wasn\u2019t sure where I was going to live, didn\u2019t speak the language, etc.I find myself increasingly disconnected from friends and family. It\u2019s hard when you\u2019re on a wildly different time-schedule and can\u2019t speak with friends as often as you\u2019d like. It\u2019s easy to forget about people, and vice-versa.I moved in the middle of a global pandemic. I got here at the beginning of February, when things were generally quiet, and since then the chaos from Covid-19 has spread across the globe.So, I spend a lot of days, nights, mornings, and afternoons completely overwhelmed by the prospect of living life. It\u2019s been hard. And yet, in the past week or so, I\u2019ve started to feel more connected with friends, more creative, and like I\u2019ve had more opportunities than I can imagine. So, what\u2019s changed? 1st \u2014 with people moving increasingly online, I\u2019ve started to connect with friends, networks, and peers using software like Zoom, Whereby, Whatsapp, etc. 2nd \u2014 I\u2019m talking to my friends more over the phone using Facetime, Skype, and so on. I try to check in with my friends monthly, and it\u2019s become much, much easier to talk to people now that everyone is stuck at home. 3rd \u2014 I\u2019m started to get acclimated to my new home and learning the language with apps like Memrise and iTalki, and Covid-19 has actually made things a bit easier for me to connect with people. My roommates are staying home more, my visa has been extended because of Covid-19 and people are much more open to hanging out since they have so much free time now due to school and the like being closed down. Beyond that, I\u2019ve found myself with a lot more time to write long articles, create videos, and work on things that help me find purpose in my day-to-day. In Denver, most days I was far too distracted throughout the day to really spend hours at a time in deep work. Technology has made it much easier for me to connect with friends, and share what I\u2019m working on with the people who I love. That\u2019s made this transition to living in a new country in the midst of a pandemic much, much easier. Yes, studies show that tools like social media often contribute towards loneliness and depression[1], but digital communication technologies help us bridge the gaps in learning. These first few months of 2020 have been strange and difficult and I predict we\u2019ll have more difficult days ahead, but digital technology allows us to bridge the gap.

            "answer_text": "Digital Technology helps me in many ways as everything seems to be at my finger tips. All I need to do is tap, touch, type or say something. I love how easy it has made the world of reading/ learning. And how small it made the world to be, cause being seas apart you can still talk to your family everyday with ease. How things come to you, with you sitting right in your home with everything delivered to your doorstep. Distance is going to be no more a limitation. How its making life painless and comfortable with its feet in Science/ Medicine. Benefits are limitless. Provided these tools or technologies are used for the right purpose. All of this should make humans powerful. On the contrary,  I think people's social skills, connections are getting so impacted that only place they can cry out their hearts seems to be on Facebook! Not to friends or family but on social networks. Self-worth is measured by likes or comments or number of friends on your list. Are we losing our self-worthiness? Are we making our lives so public and pitiful, literally begging for attention? Are we making ourselves fools in all of this? Are we becoming slaves?  ",
