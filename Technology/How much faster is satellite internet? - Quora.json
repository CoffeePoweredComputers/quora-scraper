However, satellite also has a latency of at least .5 seconds, and in practice .6-1.5 seconds seems to be realisitc. in contract, my current internet connect at work is giving me a .06 latency. ",

            "answer_text": "Now a days, several of people use Satellite and are very pleased with it. It is much faster than dialup, but is only worth the cost if you use the internet enough for the difference to matter. Average download speeds are 100-200k, but that can vary greatly depending on what server the file you are downloading is on. Satellite overall speed is about 2-3 megabytes a second, compared to dialups 20k and for kicks 1 megabyte is 1004k, so satellite is possibly just over 100x faster than dialup. ",
