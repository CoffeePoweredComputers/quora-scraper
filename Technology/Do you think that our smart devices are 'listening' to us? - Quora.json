They can turn themselves on and of when they want. (BTW, you better get that snoring checked. You might be having sleep apnea.) They can track your location with about half a mile. They can check you pulse rate and blood pressure. The government, industry, and random hacker can get all that information. This can be combined with medical, employment, and legal information to get a complete picture of you. Every login and complete sessions on the internet you perform is tracked and recorded. Even your own security cameras can be hacked. ",

Google is very clever and they hid away the settings and make it very hard to find.. but you can turn off Google Assistant listening to you. Same with Amazon Alexa except Amazon is always recording because it's trying to listen to your commands.. same with Google Home and Apple Home Speakers. If you want to see how creepy Google is, go to Welcome to My Activity and look at all the Google Voice Assistant commands you made, they recorded your voice and saved it. Google Maps and YouTube also saves your history, you can turn it off from that link above. ",

Don\u2019t worry. Your appliances aren\u2019t conspiring against you. This \u201cwaiting state\u201d is no more sinister than the \u201cwaiting state\u201d your TV assumes after you click the remote control to \u201coff\u201d. Many models don\u2019t turn off the entire set, but leave some portions active to accept future commands when next you start mashing pudgy fingers on tiny buttons. Yes, you can still shut your appliances \u201coff,\u201d but it will entail flipping a switch on the back of your gizmo. ",

I also do not mind that it records what I search for etc. I found it useful when I forget something to be able to look it up. I guess if I was afraid to reveal what I a doing or saying, I might mind. But then it is my choice to get listened to or not. ",

They are constantly listening, and respond when keywords or phrases are used.. But even if they don\u2019t log everything they hear where you can find it, doesn\u2019t mean they don\u2019t hear everything.. Remember reading Alexa devices recording a home invasion?? Do you think the homeowner said \u201cAlexa, record everything you hear for the next ten minutes\u201d?? The only way they can respond to specific keywords is if they\u2019re always listening.. ",

I can also turn on your GPS tracking without your knowledge. I can upload your old photos and activity and intercept all of your inputs/keystrokes. I can do this on your laptop, Mac, Android, and iPhone, smart/fit watch, remote monitoring baby/door monitors, and voice command devices.. All of this is technically possible by loading the right malware on your device. This is why you need to be very vigilant with security. Make that active security and not just a download type perimeter defense. ",
