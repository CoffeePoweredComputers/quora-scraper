Once you are commercially licensed in your country, there are a number of ways to make money with your drone: Drone for hire, Filming - you can charge a significant amount of money to be a drone operator for video productions. This can be for production companies, marketing agencies, real estate firms, or anyone that is creating a video and wants aerial footage to be included.

            "answer_text": "How my experience with Drone flying earns me cash I believe everyone here has their own experience, stories, tips and ways to do it. But well here\u2019s mine. I could write a book about my life and how drone flying actually changes my life and earn me money while I\u2019m still pursuing my degree. But let me summarise it here for you. As an undergraduate, my friends and I would always drink and party during our weekend. I mean what else can we be doing? Besides studying(which we do have a lot of free time) it is the best time to be having fun before you actually enter into your career where you\u2019ll probably be working for the rest of your life. So one day, we got bored of it and decided to try something more laidback as the drinks taking a toll on us. Fishing, driving aimlessly to explore new places, kayaking, etc. whatever you can think of you name it. We have got a lot of hobbies and silly ideas, but I would never expect that one day my friend\u2019s dumb idea would earn us money. So Shawn(not his real name) the baller of our group randomly bought a Drone which he wanna try out of curiosity due to the recent craze regards to drone flying and videography with VR goggles. Needless to say, he spent close to $1000 for that drone. So we decided to take it for a spin like anyone else, and eventually, we all grow fond of it. Its one of the best feeling on earth. The thrill, speed, visibility, and distance. So how do we earn money from it? Well, photography and videography. Firstly, we took videos and photos of places at a certain angle any professional cameraman can never dream to make. We created accounts and post it all over our social media platforms to create memories for ourselves. Initially, we only do it out of hobby, but eventually, it becomes a habit, and it starts to catch quite a bit of crowd here and there. Of cos initially, we suck at it big time. We start going from websites to websites to learn more from other experts regarding drone videography and photography. The best way is to find a site that already collates all relevant tips for you like this one 16 Drone Experts Share Their Best Drone Photography Tips Before we know it, there are enquires on our social media platform asking us to help in volunteering to take videos of events. Yup, you read that right, volunteer work gets us no pay at all, but dinner was provided. We agreed because it seems like a challenge and its cool as it is our first time doing it for someone else other than our pure satisfaction. Little did we know that it build bridges for us along the way. After the event, we edited the video here and there and cut some scene away(please learn somewhere on how to do this as its one of the most fundamental skills you need) The organizer was very pleased with it and he shared it on his website and backlink us. That\u2019s where everything starts falling into places. People were contacting us and even offered to pay for our services. From that day on, we took on many other projects and got paid for our services. One of my friends eventually went out to the market and bought his very own drone, and he is now collaborating with a wedding videographer company as added on features/services that come with an additional price. P.S. Before you decided to do all this, there are some fundamental core skills you need. Pick the right drone at the right price there are many drone blogs available in the market that teaches you which to pick for different purposes such as photography, videography, racing, entertainment, battery life, etc. Google them!!! Learn how to fly it well and fly it right. If you can\u2019t even fly it right don\u2019t expect to earn from it. Video editing is a must! Lastly, learn and get more tips from the expert! 99% of the drone experts out there are all friendly and always ready to lend a helping hand. Cheers Jasper ",
