            "answer_text": "As Coppedge correctly points out, science is not a philosophy. Science is a process for determining how reality works. Because reality exists, independent of our perception of it, science must be objective or it fails to properly describe reality. Example: \u201cAnthropogenic climate change.\u201d So if we modify the OP to read instead, \u201cWhat technology do non-objective philosophies create?\u201d then you have your answer:  When non-objectively determined theories are not readily accepted because there is no underlying science, the above is ALWAYS the answer.

Engineering is kind of applied science, but it\u2019s more using your intuition and foundations to design it. There\u2019s prototyping, etc. There is no science being done here. But it does use science. Check out the Graph below:  ",
