            "answer_text": "For my part, I\u2019m on the architecture and design part of the arc - audit, governance, risk, compliance, and technology implementation. For me, I\u2019ve a 53-hour CPE requirement for two separate certifications - and all that tells you is I take effectively a full college load each year in additional classes, review, training to ensure that I stay up on the basics. on top of that, I independently pursue additional certifications (Currently working on a CCSP and some AWS certfications) to move toward increased understanding of the changing technological landscape. I also work with several shared-threat boards to keep abreast of what\u2019s going on down in the trenches, and work with a framework board (the PCI-DSS) to assist in drafting new language and cleaning up the old. It\u2019s definitely a labor of love - but - pretty much eats, between the primary job and the extras, a good seventy hours a week. Not that I mind! I love my lab work and am always more or less constantly making new toys or learning something. I can\u2019t imagine being anywhere else. ",

            "answer_text": "My job requires me to learn, test and design often not yet released technologies and build real world solutions around such. Spending 4\u20139 hours a day in meetings, means that rest of my free time to include evenings is generally engaged in my online lab. For myself it's a lifestyle that allows me to peer with some of the smartest people you'd ever have the chance to meet, anywhere. In turn those smart people return toe in kind and ask my opinion and thoughts on much the same. We learn from one another, build something unbelievably cool and move on to the next project. But all this comes at a cost. I don't have luxury of over specialization as we are developing new code and logical structures and I gave up my weeknight entertainment for the lab and learning. As to what do we learn? I'd say 60 percent new technologies, generally cloud based material. Thirty percent \u201cold\u201d stuff that needs to be brushed up but helpful. Deep dives into packet dissection, new protocols, advances in statistics every two years, etc. Whatever I feel the need and interested. The last ten percent entails keeping up on industry trends, gossip and vulnerabilities of all stripes. Now plan to keep up for several decades not a couple of years and you'll see the difference in career tracks and longevity in the field. I love alpha geeks or get out. ",
