Immunization records, Health care, Family Medical Leave Act, Manufacturing purchasing, Mfg invoices, Mfg Labor, Travel scheduling, Financial, Magazine subscriber, Help Desk systems, caching services, password services, Cable TV, Telephony, ISP, Coroner, Repeat Offender dbs, Real Estate, Foster care, City Tax dbs, Student tests and answers, Student records, Library systems, Payroll, Catalogs, and probably more I can\u2019t think of.

Well, companies and government groups and so on in my case. Yes, very much so. To the point that when we would do Disaster Recovery Studies against various dbs the usual answer that came out was that losing a day of data changes would often cost the company enough money to shut the business down forever. In some cases the entire business couldn\u2019t be accomplished without some kind of database system. ",
