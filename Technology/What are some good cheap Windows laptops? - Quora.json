            "answer_text": "There are many brads DELL, ACER, MSI, Lenovo and HP. But according to my experience and usage I found DELL, MSI, Acer and Lenovo are good laptops. HP has very poor customer support so I can\u2019t recommend this. MSI is best laptop for high end gaming and edition. Heavy duty laptops are dealing by this brand. ACER : They have mixed varieties of laptops. Gaming/Professional , general and average duty laptops. I found they have good customer support in city as well as remote areas. Lenovo : Recent times it is fast growing in general categories. Good laptops in day to day life. ",
