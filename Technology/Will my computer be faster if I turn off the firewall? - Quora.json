            "answer_text": "I turn it off on mine. Firewalls and antivirus programs tend to have to check everything coming through the internet, and slows the system. My mom has so many firewalls and protection, that she can\u2019t even go to some sites, because the programs think they are malicious.. I really have no real issues having the things disabled.However about once a week if the system seems slow I run some free ware programs to find any programs, or malware that maybe slowing down the computer. But usually it is nothing a good de-fragmentation or freeware anti virus program wont fix .I personally have never had any issues having the firewall turned off, or anything else turned off. But yes it does slow the machine down some. . ",

It will, however, have a drastic effect on your system, especially if you are using any version of Windows\u2014security could easily be compromised in a matter of minutes, up to and including making your computer worse than useless, the first time you connect to the internet. Things to consider instead: adding more RAM and/or upgrading the BIOS, both relatively easy to do. ",
