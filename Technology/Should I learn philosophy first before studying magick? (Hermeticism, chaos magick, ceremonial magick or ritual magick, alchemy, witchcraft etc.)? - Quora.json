            "answer_text": "My best advice would be not to study philosophy, but to do philosophy in the original sense\u2014there really is no substitute for independent thought in uncharted waters. And by doing philosophy I mean, \u201cwhy (do I think) this is? why (do I think) that happens?\u201d Emphasis on I (or you in this case), not other people you might study. I would also say that the mental muscles (and imagination, lots of it) you will exercise in speculating a little on your own are the same ones you\u2019ll have to flex to do magic in any serious fashion. I know that after myself going through old books with fancy names and sacred traditions, the very best insights therein can rarely match the intuitions about the shape of the world I used to have in childhood, which I used to dismiss as not erudite enough. To give you an excuse: if you reject so much of commonly accepted wisdom as to presume reality is subject to the mind (as in the Hermetic axiom, \u201cthe subtle rules the dense\u201d) or that Western materialism is fundamentally mistaken, then you had better be willing to question whether mere bookishness or any modern system of \u201cmagick\u201d is reliable. Otherwise, you\u2019re very uneven in your scepticism. Don\u2019t get me wrong, there are such things as good books: but to appreciate their insights, you have to already be on their level. They can, at best, remind you of things you have lost.  I\u2019ll also go ahead and question whether you can \u201cdo\u201d magic (dispensing with Crowley\u2019s frumpy -k). Not because I doubt its reality in a general sense, but because I am too aware of how insufficient the modern occult \u201cjargon\u201d and literature can be. As some answers here demonstrate, modern magick often degenerates into the repetition of forms. If a practitioner has only a vague idea of (say) what immortality and consciousness are, what a god would work like, and how occult laws (attraction, sympathy, etc.) work or don\u2019t work directly (not by reading but by seeing them work)\u2014and his magic consists of, mostly, movements and clothes, then it is a poor sort of magic. He has only recreated religion (using the term superficially) in a new form. What the religious systems of the past did understand, however, is that you can\u2019t take the supernatural apart from daily life. It\u2019s not a science, it\u2019s not even a thing. There is one sort of knowledge that is memorized, which is trivial, and another sort that simply appears in the mind\u2014perhaps with the excuse of a book, perhaps not. It\u2019s this other sort of knowledge you will need to \u201cdo\u201d magic. Books of magic\u2014in this case, the flawed working notes of 20th-century occultists\u2014will be useless unless you open your mind to this other knowledge. The same came to Jesus by night, and said unto him, Rabbi, we know that thou art a teacher come from God: for no man can do these miracles that thou doest, except God be with him. Jesus answered and said unto him, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God (\u2026) The wind bloweth where it listeth, and thou hearest the sound thereof, but canst not tell whence it cometh, and whither it goeth: so is every one that is born of the Spirit (\u2026) If I have told you earthly things, and ye believe not, how shall ye believe, if I tell you of heavenly things? And no man hath ascended up to heaven, but he that came down from heaven, even the son of man which is in heaven. And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the son of man be lifted up\u2026 [1] What I can tell you for sure is that any book of metaphysics which plays intellectual games with contemporary philosophy, or seems obscure as to its source of personal experience (esp. if it appeals to immemorial culture or tradition), will be confused to some greater or lesser degree. For example (picks up book)\u2014 If one says that man\u2019s view of the universe is subjective, this usually means that the view in question depends on man\u2019s particular position in space and time and on his more or less developed ability and knowledge\u2026 Human understanding, however, is not merely limited from case to case: it is specifically limited in itself, and in this sense there is no such thing as a purely objective knowledge of the world standing outside the sphere of the human subject. Neither the agreement of all possible individual observers nor the use of means which extend the reach of the senses can get beyond this sphere, which conditions the world as a knowable object and man as a knowable being. (\u2026) Nevertheless, in every knowledge, however much of it may be coloured by the individual or the species, there is something unconditional. Otherwise there would be no bridge from subject to object, from \u2018I\u2019 to \u2018Thou\u2019, no truth and no unity behind (the subjectivities) as seen by so many and so widely varying individuals. This unconditioned and immutable element\u2026 is the pure Spirit or Intellect, which as knower and known is absolutely and indivisibly present in every being. \u2014Titus Burckhardt, Alchemy (Walter-Verlag Olten und Freiburg im Breisgau, 1960) [2] A prime example of this good-bad philosophy, Burckhardt here is trying to express his intuitive experience of what the Sufis would call the Wahdat al-Wujud, the unity of being, in terms appealing to modern philosophy (subjective-objective, \u201cvarying individuals\u201d). But, sadly, he tries to obscure what he\u2019s really talking about to an audience that needs all the help it can get.  Burckhardt\u2019s book is sorta brilliant; a Florentine, Arabic-speaking German who picked up a passion for oriental ideas in his years in north Africa (not unlike the mythical German mystic, Christian Rosenkreutz), his mind is transparently afire with sights and feelings his knowledge of Latin and Arabic opened the door to. He might as well have been a continental exponent of the New Age. But he does his insights a disservice by trying to excuse them, in his German writing, as the answer to German philosophical problems. Part of this rationalism is the general trend of pre-Jungian Western esoterism to make Hermeticism into a magical tradition that was transmitted \u201cintact and unaltered\u201d through historical sources\u2014in other words, a mimicking of the orthodox dogmatic impulse. In other words: in the above extract there are two parts. Burckhardt\u2019s own sense of the wahdat al-wujud, a universal mind which is both knower and known, and which (though he does not spell this out) by his use of the Austrian Martin Buber\u2019s I-Thou (Ich-Du) distinction, grounds the unity of being in love, mutatis mutandis that the God in whom we live and move and have our being is himself the relation of love, or of universal compassion.a philosophical word salad that sums up both the anthropic principle (the subjectivity problem: we don\u2019t know \u201cthings\u201d in general, we know only \u201csuch things as humans can become aware of\u201d) and the hard problem of consciousness (wondering why we have experience at all)a sleight of hand which at once tries to disguise the former insight as philosophical, and then to summarily dismiss the latter problems in decidedly non-philosophical fashionmy readers may point out that 18th-19th c. German philosophy very often dealt with such issues, so that Burckhardt has some precedent; with which I agree, and reply that that this kind of muddled sleight of hand is part of the reason German philosophy ended up where it did.no, I have nothing against Germans. It\u2019s just that my opinion of French or English philosophy might violate BNBR, so we stick with the former.The intuitive insight is excellent; but it would have behooved Burckhardt to explain it in its own terms, and in relation to his own experience. Instead, he tries to cover his tracks in emotional mysticism (the \u201cother knowledge\u201d I spoke of) and try to transform his insights into philosophical jargon (the \u201ctrivial knowledge\u201d). The result is that, instead of teaching a man to fish, and feeding him the rest of his life, he hands him a fish for the day, because he is embarrassed to reveal himself as a fisherman. What Burckhardt\u2019s dismissal of the philosophical problems rests on is a tacit understanding that, in the good mind irrigated by faith\u2014for someone who cultivates his spiritual constitution over a lifetime\u2014these \u201cproblems\u201d fade away like morning mist. They had no place until a certain intellectual culture, hemmed in by a pervading scepticism of all things spiritual, made one for them. On the other hand, the same problems can have no solution: they were not framed as problems needing answers, but as what modern man might call \u201cpersistent worries.\u201d Burckhardt\u2019s problem is not spelling this out, out of a sense of modesty. So, whereas the philosophical problems should have been left out of the book entirely\u2014invisibly superseded by an explanation of how his mind was opened\u2014we have a \u201cnarrativization\u201d of the process. Instead of the dispersal of the problems, we have wahdat al-wujud posing as a philosophical consequent, an absurd (but very sophisticated and urbane) situation.  So much for advice. Perhaps you\u2019re thinking that if you critique everything, there\u2019ll be little left over. That\u2019s indeed the general idea. To reuse an alchemical metaphor, the process is solve et coagula. In an age when the proliferation of printed words, online voices and accrued stereotypes is so vast as to be beyond any one man (as the saying goes, \u201cno-one knows how to make a bicycle\u201d), the act of solve means reducing our bulky first material (in our metaphor, a roomful of hair, gristle, and soil) to something not true, but humanly helpful in getting at the truth (in our metaphor, a few drams of lead). But I\u2019m also liable to take this kind of question as inviting a book recommendation. If you\u2019re in the mood for magic, then let me suggest Lon Milo Duquette\u2019s Low Magick\u2014 written as a series of humorous, autobiographic episodes from the life of a practicing magician. Besides being practical - as it should be - it\u2019s also thankfully free of the illusion, common in supposedly technical works, that the entire thing is a science that can be learned rather than lived out.

            "answer_text": "This is a really interesting question. I don\u2019t really think it\u2019s necessary to study philosophy as a separate discipline before studying magic. First, not all of those fields involve philosophy directly, at least not in any sort of academic sense. If you want to study magic, it would be the best use of your time to study magic, and not waste any time with political, moral, or religious philosophy if you don\u2019t want to study those topics. The only type of philosophy you might want is metaphysical philosophy, and you\u2019re likely to learn that as you go along. Maybe I have a skewed perception because I do study philosophy, but then again, I\u2019ve never been taught Hermetic philosophy in school. That\u2019s something I\u2019ve had to learn on my own. The closest I get to that in school is learning the Classical Elements. If you study Hermeticism at all, you\u2019re going to get down the basics pretty quickly. Alchemy, a subset of Hermeticism, has much more complicated theory. Ritual magic has Agrippa\u2019s Books of Occult Philosophy, which I guess is square one. Chaos magic is pretty simple \u2014 it boils down to \u201cdo what works, screw the rest.\u201d It only really gets interesting philosophically when it considers whether the universe is \u201creal\u201d or not. I\u2019m not sure if witchcraft has any philosophical system to go with it. In terms of actual philosophy, Neoplatonism has had the most impact over Western occultism in general, so you might want to look into that. Study philosophy to your heart\u2019s content, but don\u2019t spend a lot of time on it if what you really want is to study magic. If you study magic, then you\u2019ll end up learning all of the relevant philosophy in the process. ",
