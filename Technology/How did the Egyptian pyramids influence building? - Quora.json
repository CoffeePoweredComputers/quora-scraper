            "answer_text": "It didn\u2019t influence building at all. Nothing new was invented because of the pyramids. They looked at a mountain and decided to create one. They used methods that had already been developed for building smaller buildings. The only thing they had to work on was how steep they could make the sides. Smaller pyramids like those in Meroe (Sudan) have steeper sides, but stone cannot support the weight incurred on larger pyramids. You can see the pyramid they tried to \u201cfix\u201d in Egypt, called the Bent Pyramid.  The bottom line is the building of the pyramids did not influence the building of other things, other things influenced the building of the pyramids. This is not to take away from the accomplishment of building them. They are marvelous structures and if you go to Egypt you MUST see them at least once. However, once you\u2019ve seen them, you really don\u2019t need to go see them again, unless you\u2019re with other people who haven\u2019t seen them (that\u2019s why I\u2019ve seen them 3 times now). As magnificent and awe inspiring as the pyramids are, they are just giant piles of rock, built geometrically like a mountain, with virtually no art or decorations on them. There are thousands of other things to see in Egypt, and after the first visit, the pyramids are a bit boring in comparison. ",

            "answer_text": "Following are my personal observations : The acute angle corners , in every horizontal plane of the pyramids consume lots of wastage of spaces and the concept is unfit for implementation in any urban locality where cost of ground places is very high. In contemporary desert area space was abundant . Stone use is feasible only where stone is abundant locally, like in Rajasthan at some places.Cutting of stones sharply and at appropriate angles call for manual means which are not only expensive at today\u2019s application , it is extremely time consuming. The very concept of pyramids in the particular shapes was the only feasibility as Arch construction used by Romans came much much later. Another important requisite was fool proof protection of assets of the kings kept inside, with entry to the pyramids totally concealed by unrecognizable stones, so that pirates cannot find the way in. I didn\u2019t discuss the planning inside. Pyramids were not built for residences . ",
