            "answer_text": "Hi Anikanto BD, The Raspberry Pi and Arduino Families introduced a whole new Industry and Generation of IoT. They made it very affordable, fun, educational, and with their respective Websites, a Plethora of How-To information along with Creative and Even Brilliant Ideas to try out. To answer your Question what are other Similar Products or Boards? I would like to offer up a few that I use. My next favorite to the Raspberry Pi Mode 4 is the Odroid-N2. Odroid has an entire family of SoC (System on Chip) Micro Computers. Another they have that I use is the Odroid-HC1, a board for setting up a Home File Server that uses the SAMBA Software, and also can operate as a Media Server for your TV or other devices.  Along with the Odroid Family is the Rock Pi, very similar to the Raspberry Pi and can be booted from Ubuntu or Android. And I believe a few other specialty Operating Systems. And along with the RockPi there is the Atomic Pi. Which comes with a Few Different Linux Versions of Ubuntu pre-loaded. One uses the KDE Plasma Desktop, and the other is Xfce Desktop. They also offer a few other Specialty OS\u2019s from their Website. The Odroid Website has an assume amount of information including the Odroid Magazine. The Raspberry Website is a Collection of very valuable and highly informative material, and the community Blog and MagPi Magazine need to be bookmarked for Future Reference. You can find Board Loads of Programming Links on GitHub for the Four(4) Boards that I have mentioned here.  I would be Delinquent if I did not mention what the ESP8266 Arduino adds to the IoT Community with being able to connect all kinds and flavors of Devices to the Internet then allowing connection from your Cell or Computer to those devices.  There is a Wealth of Valuable Information on GitHub. Sign and Register. Then search for Raspberry Pi or Odroid Spaces and you will be Amazed with Stellar Results.  So, Anikanto BD, I hope you have enjoyed my Ramblings. If nothing else, at least some information to wet your Technology Appetite. I really enjoyed providing a response and probably went a little overboard. But I do Love My Pi\u2019s. Sincerely and Respectfully submitted for all, Robert Tonkavich. ",
