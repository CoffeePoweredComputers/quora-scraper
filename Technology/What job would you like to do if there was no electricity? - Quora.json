            "answer_text": "Well let\u2019s see \u2014 my grandfather was an electrician and I learned a lot from him. That would be out. I also used to (long ago) work on cars but they require electricity to operate. That\u2019s out. I worked for a payroll company and I could theoretically do payroll and accounting by hand. In fact I did early in my career, coming to work in the days before small companies started using computers. I was on the cutting edge of that. I suppose we\u2019d still have taxes and bookkeeping so I could do that by hand. I still have my slide rule (for those who remember). They\u2019re more associated with engineering majors but in my time, you had to learn to use one if you were in a NYS CPA board approved curriculum. The reason - some interest schedules are non-linear meaning you had to take Calculus I and use a slide rule. If you were with anyone other than a large company, no computer available to spit out loan schedules. I can also play guitar and bass and have acoustic versions of each. I also have a (long out of practice) violin. Of course, playing guitar is much more fun than calculating amortization schedules by hand, so you know which way I\u2019d go here. For reference: the Bible mentions taxes and bookkeeping like functions early on. The absence of electricity doesn\u2019t mean we won't have government. With government comes taxes and with taxes comes bookkeeping and audits. ",

I am also an engineer and country lad, Farming/ forager would be third as would feed me. However its back breaking work in the old way as a kid used to grow vegetables for the table its a lot of effort. People don't appreciate what it takes to put actual \u201cfood\u201d on the table. ",
