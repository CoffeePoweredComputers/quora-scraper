So otg cables were used first to connect a pendrive to the mobile, having the 2 on 2 different ends. then otg adaptors came which can be connected to the mobile and pendrive shall be connected whenever required. Nowadays pendrives themselves come with OTG porton one end and the normal usb on the other end for ease of access with the mobile systems. ",

            "answer_text": "An OTG pendrive simply has 2 heads . On one side it has USB A port which fits into your computers and on the other side it has a micro USB port which fits into your phone . It helps to simply eliminate an OTG connector . If you're planning to buy one , I would suggest SanDisk . It's pretty good and reliable too . Edit- Image added  Cheers! Hope it helps! ",
