            "answer_text": "I think there are quite a few benefits to starting a Tech Company in Hawaii. First would be the amazing local Atmosphere. Where else in the US can you \u201cget out of the office\u201d and have access to so many relaxing and/or enjoyable activities in a tropical setting? From hiking to surfing (mountain to the ocean), Hawaii has lots of different things you can do to relieve stress and promote a healthy lifestyle. And when you're in the dungeon coding away for 12 hours straight, this kind of stuff helps! (both mentally and physically). I also think Hawaii presents an inherent location based advantage over other places in the US. Being that Hawaii is so close to Asia, I cannot imagine a better place to work on projects that either are (or considering) international expansion into Asia. It is my personal opinion that entrepreneurs in the US are often guilty of thinking \u201cinside the box\u201d when it comes to identifying their potential markets. Even the big analysts from the big VC's (such as Mary Meeker from KPCB) agree that China is the next emerging Tech Market. And when you consider just how big the Chinese Market really is, it's an amazing opportunity to tap into. This is just one example, there are many others (Japan, Korea, the Philippines, and the list goes on). Considering that you combine the potential to enter the Asian markets, with the readily available US markets, this just seems like a really big benefit to me. Beyond this, the local Start-up Ecosystem in Hawaii is booming right now. Start-up Weekend comes through. Start-up America is here. Not to mention the more localized organizations (like Aloha Start-ups). We now have local co-working spaces that sponsor events and foster innovation (like Greenhouse Hawaii, Box Jelly). And to top it off, with the LAVA Fund about to invest in / help create local Tech Accelerator's, I can only see it getting bigger and better. Like George (500 Start-ups) said at the last Accelerate Hawaii Workshop, \u201cStart-ups are the future of Hawaii\u201d ",

            "answer_text": "You get to be in Hawaii. I was born and raised in Hawaii, as were my 2 co-Founders. Hawaii is expensive. There are no good tech schools to funnel employees from should your start-up take off. There's no tech community - no workshops, no networking, no meet ups or conventions. Unless your startup is specifically Hawaii based, I'd re-think starting one in the islands. Edit: I did want to add that it can be a beneficial go between Japan and the West Coast, as far as a physical location is concerned. ",
