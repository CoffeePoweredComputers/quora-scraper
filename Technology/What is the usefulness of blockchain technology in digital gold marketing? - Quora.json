            "answer_text": "The first advantage is that blockchain doesn't need a third party to approve or reject our digital gold transactions. since it's running on the distributed data ledger there is no need for us to rely on third parties or middlemen anymore just like bitcoin,ethereum, or other cryptocurrencies out there digital gold is using blockchain technology for their customers in buying and selling gold it means that the third party player is completely out of the game which saves us from ridiculous transaction fees whenever you buy or sell digital gold there is no need for you to worry about getting them manually approved or rejected once and for all. The second advantage is that blockchain technology provides transparency for our peer-to-peer transactions with digital gold. The reason why blockchain plays a prominent role in digital gold is because of the transparency itself. Since it's running on the distributed data ledger we can see where these transactions are going from one person to the other in the form of transaction hash this is where digital gold has adopted in their ecosystem in buying and selling gold. transparency is what truly defines decentralization every time you execute a transaction in digital gold whether if you buy or sell it's recorded on the blockchain where we can all see it on the public explorer and it is completely temper proof this is something that we really need these days in transacting gold and blockchain is the answer to that. The third advantage is that our identity remains protected and secured when dealing with digital gold transactions on the blockchain we all know that our identity is clearly more expensive than our material stuff and the savings we have on our bank accounts identity theft is one problem that is ongoing until now and the security measures are questionable in centralized platforms for us to buy sell or store gold. I know that our identity is so precious and this is what digital gold solves the problem because of digital gold's ecosystem that is running on the blockchain it assures us that our transactions are going smoothly and having our identity protected at the same time, if you're one of those who is concerned about protecting our identity in buying selling or storing gold digital gold is the ultimate solution to your problem.
