            "answer_text": "By no means do I know this will happen with any certainty, I am just offering a contender:  I love C#. First, lets talk about the language:C# has all the great things about java, and more. C# supports generics, events, and linq. Not to mention the fantastic Task Parallel Library. In my experience, a lot of things in c#, like Lambdas just make the code itself cleaner, shorter, and easier to read. C# is completely open source, with the Roslyn compiler under the very permissive MIT license. What about the framework? It is true that for a long time, C# and by extension the framework was exclusive to Windows (except for that weird thing Mono). But in the last four years, .NET Core has been proven to run fast, and reliably on pretty much all major platforms. According to the benchmarks game, C# running on .NET Core is actually faster than Java. In the upcoming months, all the separate .Net versions are being unified into a single .NET: .NET 5. That means everything. .Net Core, Mono, Xamarin and the .NET framework are all being joined into a single entity, further proving the portability of the code. There are amazing new projects that make it all more interesting: Blazor for example. Being able to use C# instead of Javascript is a godsend! ",

            "answer_text": "Well just try to think about that\u2026 Java work on every hardware (most of that hardware is not computers, but industrial electronics, automotive electronics, smart cards, bank credit cards, mobile SIM cards, etc.). C# can\u2019t work on those Java devices, especially on JavaOnChip technology. Java and Oracle is another field that Java is the King. For instance, just try to create application for Nokia 3330 telephone with something different than Java. Do you can create C# application for JavaOnChip hardware ? LOL you are genius if you can do that. If you don\u2019t like Java, you must read CPU documentation for Assembler or C and try to reinvent a circle or hot water - application just written for specific CPU (for instance CPU in Nokia 3330 cellphone or in your new Porsche automotive board computer). Can you really do that with your C#, C++ or Python ? ",
