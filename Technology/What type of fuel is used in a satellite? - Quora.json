            "answer_text": "Satellites in geosynchronous orbit are at about 22241 statute miles (35793 km) altitude, so there's very little atmospheric drag. They don't require much thrust to maintain orbit. However they must control their attitude (pitch, roll, yaw), since even minute forces will eventually cause attitude drift. They must also be prepared to move orbital position if other satellites are repositioned. The simple answer is satellites use rockets and thrusters, just like manned and unmanned vehicles have always done. In general they use bipropellent hypergolic rockets, not cold gas thrusters like compressed nitrogen. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bipropellant_rockethttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypergolic However some newer satellites use hall effect or ion thrusters, since they're very fuel efficient. The below new Spaceway communications satellite has several different propulsion systems, including large and small bipropellant rockets and two sizes of xenon ion thrusters: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hall_effect_thruster_(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hall_effect_thruster) Lower orbit satellites may require larger propulsion systems, depending on mission. The KH-12 spy satellite is about the size and weight of the Hubble space telescope, and carries about 7 tons (!!) of propellant: https://fas.org/ Source; What kind of propulsion systems do satellites use?

            "answer_text": "If you are asking propellent, it uses nothing but just compressed gas, they push them using gas boosters. Some may also use solar radiation like Kepler telescope did to correct tragectory after two of its gyroscopes failed and some use ion propulsion for long space journey (for space crafts). Gravitational slingshot method is also frequently used. And if you are talking about the operational fuel, it uses various sources like solar, radioactive fuel, etc. There are many purposed method like photonic sails like sails used in sail boats, matter- antimatter engines and more to come, it just needs more innovation and technological development.

            "answer_text": "Usually hydrazine[1] monopropellant. Hydrazine is such a fun chemical that it will explosively decompose itself without any need for a catalyst or oxidizer. It will also dissolve living tissue on contact. Hydrazine can be stored in fuel tanks for decades, so it\u2019s pretty ideal for satellite propulsion. Some newer satellites use electronic thrusters that use electric fields to accelerate xenon gas the produce thrust. A smaller number use tether propulsion, and electrically charged metal cable that creates a push against the Earth\u2019s magnetic field. Footnotes[1] Hydrazine - Wikipedia",
