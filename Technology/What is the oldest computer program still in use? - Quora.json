            "answer_text": "Thanks for A2A. What is the oldest computer program still in use? Most of the preceding answers site MOCAS as being the most likely large scale implementation that is still in use. Venturing out on my own, I imagine that there are many pieces of 60s code still running on Air Traffic Control systems (loss of ATC was one of the biggest scare factors around the Y2k bug), because many of these systems have had newer bits patched in but the old stuff has never been updated or removed. While I find it difficult to believe that many mainframe systems right up until the 90s are still viable to operate (not enough bang per buck any more), there would have to be many 60s and 70s terminals still in use because switching to PCs simply isn\u2019t justified. Why do all that rewiring to install power-hungry PCs when the basic hardware terminals are doing just fine? There would have to be small businesses and home users who are still lagging behind and quite deliberately using 70s-based hardware and software. Dot-writer was a very popular word-processing layout language on the CP/M platform, allowing the user to specify a variety of fonts and sizes which would then be rendered line-by-line on a dot-matrix printer. It wouldn\u2019t surprise me if Dot-writer was the inspiration for PostScript. I only just learned that my insurance company is still running on DOS, with (probably) dBase IV+. It has its own internal network protocol and a special layer of machines to transfer information onto the internet. If you want to get really old, there\u2019s the player piano, the street organ, the mechanical version of the Jacquard loom, and even the humble music box. ",

            "answer_text": "The best evidence indicates that it is the Department of Defense\u2019s MOCAS, but I have to admit, I would be surprised if there weren\u2019t older systems still functioning in financial systems or old-world manufacturing somewhere in the world. For example, I know that Bank of America still uses software from the 1960\u2019s, as do many government contractors like General Dynamics and Lockheed Martin. And this says nothing of telecom, which has been using machines that could conceptually be called computers since the early part of the 20th century. Further, you would be amazed how many WWII-era manufacturing machines are still producing things like nails, screws, and bolts to this very day. If these machines were developed post-war with simple electro-mechanical computers, with a series of instructions that absolutely constitute software, then we could have software from the 1940\u2019s still running today. Further, since the machines are electromechanical and not solid-state, hand-making replacement parts is relatively easy, giving these machines neverending life. ",
