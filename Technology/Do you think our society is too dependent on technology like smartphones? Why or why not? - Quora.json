            "answer_text": "Originally Answered: Do you think our society is too dependent on technology like smartphones? Why or why not? There are technologies that help us, and there are technologies which hinder us. In general, we tend to more fully develop the helpful ones. But times change. Knowledge changes. Often times, it\u2019s technology which causes the change. Isaac Newton developed his theory of Newtonian Physics to help us understand the world. It was a big improvement at the time, and it\u2019s still useful today to teach introductory Physics. But anyone too dependent on it will have a difficult time with advanced studies. For advanced work, Newtonian Physics is a technology we\u2019ve outgrown. I don\u2019t think society is dependent on smart phones. I do think some people are. And I know some businesses are. In my mind, a key sign that someone is too dependent on a technology is when they just assume everyone else has that technology at their disposal, to the point that when they encounter someone who doesn\u2019t, they don\u2019t know how to deal with the situation. Take the hot-button issues of the day, and at the root you\u2019ll likely find a once-useful technology which has become obsolete, and people still too-dependent on it: Guns: Do Americans still need to keep and bear arms? Religion: Are we still organizing our society mindlessly around ancient texts? Nationalism: Is two-dimensional topology still relevant in a world with air travel and global communications? Racism: Can we maintain our illusions about race in a world where an understanding of genetics proves all our prejudice wrong? Abortion: Have we updated our laws sufficiently to match our knowledge of medicine, biology, and human rights? Tribalism: Are we still so threatened by others we need to draw an us vs. them distinction? Capitalism: Is it still to our benefit to rely so heavily on a system which requires scarcity for profit? Technology is the combination of people and tools and knowledge. Technology builds on itself, and as such it is always changing. It\u2019s a mistake for us to even think we\u2019ve found the best technology for all time, and in that regard it\u2019s a mistake to ever become too dependent on any one technology. ",

            "answer_text": "Defining how much being \u201cdependent\u201d is being too dependent is a tough question by itself. We might ask, for example, wether we can survive without smartphones. The answer would obviously be that even if they were to disappear tomorrow, without trace or reason - we will survive. The question of survival is not interesting, though, because it is not a realistic scenario. I suggest the following rephrase of the question: Is our society becoming so dependent on technology that it replaces our natural needs with artificial ones? To that question Iwould answer as my opinion: society has replaced some basic functions, most importantly the ones involving social interactions, with artificial ones. We no longer have to meet to interact; we receive a sense of community with people we never met; we can measure precisely how popular we are compared to our friends. These examples, and more, make it so that some very basic human need - having sex - is being slowly replaced by other, artificial \u201csupplements\u201d such as the porn industry and social interactions over the net. Now, I wouldn\u2019t argue that everything natural is better than anything artificial. I simply don\u2019t see any advantage for these artificial supplements, and many disadvantages: humans need to be physically touched to develop properly. Humans need to believe in their intrinsic value without comparing themselves continuously. Humans need communities that are not based solely on common hobbies, because humans are not just a pack of hobbies. There are more examples, but you get the point. I\u2019ll finish by saying that when I grew up, I was raised on the internet. I had virtual friends all over the world, we played and talked all night long. It was very fun, though a bit nerdy. Nevertheless, I always had physical fruends with whom I had different experiences. Then came Facebook, and suddenly everybody were on the net making friends. I thought it wouldmake everybody more like me, and allow me to connect with new people - but instead, it made everybody less like themselves, making them hunt for likes (jokingly at first, but it became ever more serious) and driving me out of there, making me shut down my account.

            "answer_text": "This entire world is clearly too dependent on social media. I won't even state facts, just observe and see how easily young people's ideals are twisted and changed basically everyday because someone they like on Youtube or Twitter said so. It's quite pathetic. When I was a child in the 90s I understood to take all the information I hear on the news and do my own research to get the facts, every news broadcast no matter how twisted carries a kernel of truth. You just have to dig through a lot of trash agenda-pushing shit to find it. My main problem with social media is now that everyone has a voice on social media I've noticed racism, in America mainly, comeback in full force. The ironic thing though is most of these people never act upon their big words in person. The crazy few that do though are changing the world for the worst. This was probably off topic and I am a little drunk, but this is my honest opinion on social media. It's a disease. The flip side of the coin though is we go back to only the powerful having an opinion and that's just as bad. Such a dilemma, now I understand why a lot of people just want to live a peaceful life away from politics. ",

            "answer_text": "No, why would it be. It is the nature of new technology to be weird and scary at first. Over a century ago people were sceptical of trains and cars. People thought tellevision would spoil children or that computers would never be practical for homes. I\u2019m sure the inventor of the bow had to take a lot of crap about how it could never replace the good old spear\u2026 It might seem weird if you still know the world without mobile and smartphones, when you still had to actually be punctual to a date, or had to use a paper map to get to places. But thats the nature of technological advancements: it takes over labour and simplifies certain tasks. It provides luxury and time at the cost of some independance. In the future our children will probably also worry about the new technologies of their time and how it makes everyone stupid. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes , we dependent on technology like smartphones because it makes our life easy than past . It saves our time and we do a lot of work in one hour. Example In industries a work of 3 hours was now we do in half hours. Robots are very helpful . But according to me our dependence on technology was very harmful in future . It gives us advantages along with disad -vantages . Both this are walking side by side. Example Microwave oven is a cause of cancer. New new diseases that were discovered was not present in past . Technology also have negative and positive Effects. ",
