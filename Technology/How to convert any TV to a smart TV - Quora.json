            "answer_text": "How do I convert any TV to a smart TV? By adding a streaming device. With one a viewer can see programming from Netflix, Hulu, Apple TV+, Disney+, Amazon Prime, and an endless host of other paid and free streaming services. They could also include programming from basic cable channels, if one wants to cut the (cable TV) cord. Most streaming devices connect with an HDMI interface. If your television has an available HDMI port, that\u2019s the best way to go. However, if you have an older television which doesn\u2019t or a standard definition tube television, some kind of adapter and/or junction switch box (especially if you want to continue to watch cable or OTA programming) may be needed. Check the television for ports. HDMI (1080p/4K) is best, component video (up to 720p \u2014 breaks out the video into RGB + 2 audio)) is next best, then composite video (480p \u2014 video + 2 audio \u2014 yellow/white/red), then S-video, then RF coaxial cable, and the least desirable is through an antenna input. The adapters will downsample the signal to the television. Component video inputs vs composite  . A standard tube television built in the mid-\u201990s\u2013early-2000s ought to at least have component video input. Early 720p flat-screen televisions may also not have had an HDMI input. The best least-expensive entry-point solution, for one of these televisions, is the Roku Express+, which can currently be found for around $45 (USD) and includes the component and HDMI cables (for a later television upgrade). It replaces the no-longer-supported Roku 2 and will support up to 1080p. Roku Express+  . HDMI to component video adapters (to get up to 720p) can be found under $10 USD and will go with any peripheral streaming device introduced in the last five years.  .
