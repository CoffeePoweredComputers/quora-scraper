            "answer_text": "VR in Business When creators are struggling to create a comprehensive storyline and immersive VR experiences for the audience, corporations and organizations have already started to apply VR to their business. The two most significant applications are medical therapy and professional training. A study found that VR could be used to treat phobias. \u201cIn a clinical trial of a new virtual reality treatment for fear of heights, participants reported being much less afraid after using the program for just two weeks,\u201d the study said.  Shuai Yuan, Chief Growth Officer of insta360, shared a story accordant with the study results. A doctor from New York used insta360 Pro to treat autism and PTSD patients by filming the things that his patients were afraid of, the subway for instance and showed to his patients. By doing that, the patients can experience whatever they are afraid of in a safe environment, which helps them overcome their fears. Zu mentioned how VR used to treat drug addictions. Therapists will get the individual with the addiction put on a VR headset and navigate them through various scenarios. By using the exposure to the drugs they are misusing in a virtual environment, the therapists can monitor patients\u2019 responses and teach them the coping skills. Professional training is another field that VR has widespread uses. There are many professions in which making mistakes can be disastrous, such as those of a surgeon, pilot, soldier, race-car driver or other professionals. Because the simulative training in these fields has always been a challenge, a virtual environment can sufficiently help them prepare for the real-world scenarios. There are still some glitches VR needs to fix before it becomes massive-marketable, but VR will continue to evolve in an ongoing process. One consensus was that social-driven content will accelerate the spread of VR. \u201cOnly social-driven content will increase the interaction amongst people, which makes the users stay longer on the platform,\u201d Shuai Yuan said. This viewpoint can\u2019t be denied since we\u2019ve already witnessed the success of multiple-player games. Although the preconditions for the massive adoption of VR are sufficient, the popular beliefs in VR are limited. \u201cThe VR headsets are cheap enough, and the contents are adequate,\u201d said Kevin Leung, GM of HTC Vive Shenzhen and Director of Vive X. He added, \u201cMany people don\u2019t understand VR, but they could spend plenty of times watching 2D videos. The real problem is how to change the perceptions for VR.\u201d  Other problems need to be fixed before the massive adoption of VR is to fill the knowledge gap and build the relevancy with the audience. \u201cThe VR education is costly,\u201d Zu mentioned. \u201cThere is no efficient medium to teach people what VR is and how to use it.\u201d Therefore, the audiences don\u2019t know how VR can be relevant to their real life. The tipping point for VR might reach three to five years later because of the high education costs. \u201cThe market penetration is still low in China,\u201d Leung said. \u201cThere are so many opportunities for VR, but the key is how to position it (in the market).\u201c The future of VR content is to be more interactive and engaging. The earlier virtual reality was almost exclusively gaming trend, but VR game and videos have an implicit boundary. The main theme is to engage the audience. Unlike the traditional film viewers who passively accept the information that the filmmakers want to convey, the audience who wears VR headsets can interact with the story to decide the direction of the story. In other words, the ending depending on how the audiences choose in the interactive components. Therefore, the audiences become the characters and have the power to control the VR stories. The global virtual reality market size was valued at USD 960.9 million in 2016 and expected an exponential growth over the forecast period from 2014-2025, said Grand View Research. The projected market potential benefits from diverse and affordable VR devices, and its ability to be incorporated into the widespread application from commercial to medical fields. The considerable market potential attracts many tech companies to share the big pie. Although the VR market is highly dynamic, the competition is also very intense, requiring the tech companies to upgrade their products consistently.  Image retrieved from Statista Virtual reality is a hot topic in the field of science and technology. It is assumed that the cost of hardware and the complexity of production are the obstructions for the massive adoption of virtual reality. However, the experts from the VR industry have different opinions. Virtual reality is an underestimated field that could bring changes to medical therapy, professional training, and life experiences for both consumers and business beyond videos and games.  Image retrieved from Statista Many of these innovations are promising us ways to change the way we live life in a more productive and connected manner. It\u2019s estimated that in the 2020s these technologies will converge into a synergistic human man-machine. AR in Business According to Lumus By 2025, AR will be big in the video game market, accounting for an estimated $11.6 billion out of what will probably be a trillion-dollar business by that time. (That's a conservative number for AR gaming.) And there are plenty of other industries where AR (and virtual reality) will contribute to revenue by 2025. Healthcare at $5.1 billion (imagine devices that can find veins faster than a phlebotomist), engineering at $4.7 billion, live events (picture Kanye dancing...with Kanye!) at $4.1 billion, the military at $1.6 billion, and the list goes on. Even at the low end, the education market will make $7 million using AR products. Looking at some specific industries, the infographic indicates that in real estate and home improvement, for example, $2.6 billion in 2025 will be driven by features such as interactive 3D walkthroughs using VR headsets and using AR to drive by a home and instantly get information on it using your mobile device, no Zillow search required. Ikea is already in on the act: It has an app that scales its items for sale to depict what they'd look like in pictures of your own home. There are other industries like the Retail industry that AR and VR technology its takin over and have a really big future as well. This is a great example so you can have a good inside about AR and VR in the retail industry.  Mobile AR Disruption The secret weapon that will lead to AR\u2019s boom is mobile devices. AR\u2019s ability to be deployed on mobile phones or tablets makes it more accessible than VR, which requires headsets for use. The fact that AR can be used on the devices that we all carry in our pockets every day makes adoption easier, less intimidating, and more affordable. Nowadays more app developers are using implementing AR technology to their apps and it has been a really successful technology for smartphones apps a huge example of this is the Pokemon Go app game people really like the fact that they were are to catch pokemon out in the streets and parks of their city it made the smartphone user feel like they were in the hunt for pokemons.   Augmented Reality in Manufacturing AR adoption has been quickly climbing in this industry, especially as IoT has found its place in the manufacturing world through intelligent objects. AR offers these users a \u201cdata to human interface,\u201d which means that users can utilize intelligent objects equipped with AR to see a worldview augmented with a rich set of data. A rising subset of AR software, Industrial AR platforms, is specifically intended to assist those in the manufacturing fields. Not only do these tools enable industrial employees to visualize a data set, but they can also assist in physical labor jobs. For example, if an employee needs to repair a part, AR content can be overlayed onto the existing product, so that the user can see what the end result should look like. Industrial AR tools can also be deployed by multiple users at once so that a supervisor can see what his or her employee sees as they work in the field. Other industries that are using AR and VR technology are Videos games, Real estate, Military, Education, etc. This is a great infographic that I found that explains a bit more the potential that AR has in the future  Do you like VR videos and immerse yourself in a VR World?

            "answer_text": "The Cappasity team answered this question in a recent blog post. You can read a brief version below.  This year, the number of customers using AR to shop both online and in brick-and-mortar stores will hit the 100 million mark. Figures like these cannot be ignored: 32% of retailers already plan on adopting augmented reality within the next three years, hoping to provide a fully immersive customer experience. It\u2019s important to remember that AR is not there just for the extra oomph. Like any tech solution, it\u2019s meant to solve problems. To prove that augmented reality is more than an ornamental shopping feature, we are listing the inconveniences consumers encounter in their daily lives below and how AR can help solve them. Scenario #1 How to visualize products in context Before making a purchase decision, customers visualize the product in a physical environment to see if it fits. Will that sofa look good in that corner, or is it too bulky? Getting an answer to question like this would be challenging without a trip to a store \u2014 and even then, there are no guarantees. AR technology presents an elegant solution. IKEA\u2019s Placeapp, for example, allows clients to \u2018place\u2019 IKEA products in their space in scale to get a better idea of how it will look in that specific context. Scenario #2 How to try on colors and avoid hygiene issues The most obvious inconvenience of shopping for cosmetics is the inability to try on the color. Shopping for red lipstick? It\u2019s not that simple. From fire-engine red to maroon to ruby, there are thousands of different shades to choose from. To solve this very problem, L\u2019Or\u00e9al has partnered with Amazon to enable clients to try on lipsticks and find the right shade by using their phone or computer cameras. The L\u2019Or\u00e9al and Amazon partnership also benefits those who prefer to shop in brick-and-mortar stores. With this digital try-on solution, customers won\u2019t have to use the same samples that have already been used by strangers, thus eliminating common hygiene issues. Scenario #3 How to create viral content for social media Shopping in a good company is a great experience. A trip to the mall often becomes an excuse to meet up with friends and family members. But what if you are browsing online stores? You can\u2019t exactly invite friends to join you. But with AR filters gaining ground on Instagram, you can! For example, Carlings, known for its already sold out digital fashion collection, released a T-shirt that can be adorned with various designs that appear on Instagram through augmented reality filters. You point the IG camera to the t-shirt and voil\u00e0 \u2014 a design appears. You can then share your results with friends and see what they came up with. AR combines the best features of in-store and online shopping, bringing together the comfort and timeliness of the first and the emotional engagement and interactivity of the second. ",
