            "answer_text": "Loring Chien discribes the difference well. Knowing that, some tech was discovered- like fire. Lightning created fire and men used it and found that cooking food made it easier to eat, tasted better, and lasted a little longer without spoiling. And it could keep you warm on a cold winter\u2019s night. They invented the wheel and then the wheel barrow and the cart. Beer was probably discovered. Then they invented different recipes to make it taste better. It was important because it provided the impetus for agriculture. Vulcanization of rubber was discovered-accidentally and so was Teflon. The microscope was invented and so was the particle accelerator at CERN. The principle of the sundial was discovered. They watched the shadow of a tree move throughout the day. Demarcating the hours on the shadow\u2019s path was invention. Many inventions follow discovery. The inventor of Velcro discovered the way thistles grab clothes. He spent 14 years invnting a way to emulate that so it was useful. ",

            "answer_text": "The quick difference is, that Discovery is the act of finding something that has always existed but perhaps we did not know about. Invention is the act of creating a new thing, a combination that has purpose but had not existed. something new and novel to people skilled in the art (is how its legally described). For examples: You can discover a cave, but you can\u2019t invent a cave.Electricity was discovered, not inventedPi was discovered, not invented.Money or currencies was invented, not discoveredLight bulbs were invented, not discoveredtransistors and ICs were invented, not discoveredBicycles were invented, not discoveredPlanets were discovered, not invented",
