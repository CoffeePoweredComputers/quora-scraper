            "answer_text": "Of course it does! Certain features are unavailable. Like FaceTime. If you buy an instrument from a kiosk in a mall like Micro or in Bur Dubai Satwa Karama you might get an American version which will run all applications (apps) as the United States. If you buy it from Etisalat Du - Grand Stores Virgin Sharaf DG etc the fearure of FT won't be available. Also be wary of the fact that an instrument bought in the Middle East is difficult to replace/repair in India thru apple service as software techs differ. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, it will work in India if you buy iPhone from Dubai. You have use all the default features it has, but you have to be very carefully that you CANNOT upgrade this iPhone in India, else it will get locked and of now use anymore. What unlocked iPhone means is, you are given a special code from the service provider in Dubai. So, when you bring the phone to India and insert in Indian SIM card it will ask for a code and then you just enter it and then you won't have to program the phone or anything. Rest is fine. Thanks.
