            "answer_text": "May I offer two interpretations of your question? I think you mean either: the cognitive competence of people to make decisions at the \u201cstrategic\u201d level, where this level is the outer boundary of the enterprise concerned (corporation, business unit, charity, government department, government, etc); orthe type of information, used here in its broadest sense, that is prepared to inform such decisions.I am going to address the second interpretation first. Information, in its broadest sense, can be set into a stratification that runs from data through information (in a narrow sense) to intelligence, comprehension, understanding, and, perhaps, knowledge and wisdom. In this stratification: Data is a measurement or a fact without context. For example, a communications agency detects a signal radiated from a place they are monitoring and all they have is the signal measurements. Or, a business person notes a change in a competitor\u2019s product, but is unsure of its purpose.Information in its narrowest sense places that data in context. The radiated signal is a data communications link used to connect to a satellite, or the product change enhances the product\u2019s performance in an area that has proved difficult to master.Intelligence combines multiple sources to deliver some understanding of the situation. Thus, the agency deduces that a military satellite has been launched that could pose a threat to GPS, or the competitor can disrupt the market and may steal market share at our expense.Comprehension means that the agency can articulate how the new military satellite alters the balance of power, and what the intent may be. Similarly, the business can assess how the competitor has managed to steal a march and what its intent may be. This stage is an exercise in hindsight in order to cultivate insight into the current situation. This is termed \u201csituation awareness\u201d in some military circles.Understanding introduces the concept of foresight. That is, it is an appreciation of the likely outcomes that may emerge from the courses of action the actors may make. Thus, the business will look at how long it is before it loses market share and what it needs to do to defend itself, given the range of possible responses in the marketplace. Likewise, the military will consider a range of scenarios emerging from the new situation and the range of plausible outcomes.At these various levels in the stratification, other pieces are added and decisions are made. Eventually, decisions may have to be made at the uppermost level in the enterprise. These decisions concern impacts on the health of the enterprise and its ability to execute its mission in pursuit of its vision. These are strategic issues because they concern the enterprise as a whole. To be strategic, which demands the continuous exercise of strategic intelligence, is to continually apply the means available to the enterprise in creative and efficient ways in pursuit of achievable ends. The crucial element in the exercise of such strategic intelligence is the cultivation of understanding, as defined above, both in the setting of achievable ends, and in the ways in which the enterprise deploys its means in the execution of its mission in the pursuit of its vision.

            "answer_text": "Several years ago looking to give some takeaway substance to a class of adults, I gave them the Gallup Strengths test. It's amazing and elucidating. One of my strengths is Strategic.I'll tell you external perceptions of it.My stepfather called me Diabolical.My ex, the Ottoman Prince, said to turn away from me was to leave a movie with a character plotting and to return to a whole scene with my having executed the plot.My mother often would fly me in to NYC from school to watch her employees, to tell her what I had seen or suspected.My father would play chess, four moves to checkmate me and refuse to play for 24 hours unless I figured out the undoing of the Queens Gambit. I was 10. I eventually did.A boss often would stop me in meetings when I had explained something only I could see, he said my insight was my trade secret. It feels like everything is on a 3 dimensional grid. Perhaps 4 with time. 5 including space-time. When I look at just about everything the closest I can explain is it explodes with not just information. Its not like simply seeing the future, but seeing the futures. If I do A then will C do B?If so, then what about D? I am constantly seeing the road traveled, untraveled, the dirt path and devising a strategy to accomplish.....whatever.Everything feels possible for me as I calculate those 5 dimensions against it. Do I want it? The romance? The person? Play too hard to get and I literally am moving in thought-time to the terminus point of our relationship. Three years. I pursue for a year, now I can see how it will end, could end, should end.Yes, I've broken up with people during the infatuation phase because I realized I was indulging a childhood trauma or that consistent behavior is building to abuse or worse, I can see them clearer and clearer as static. Strategic perceptions are not just thought to action but outcome. It saves time when I see a terminus point to a job, an idea, a relationship. Its saddening because it doesn't mean I don't care and want more but I am learning in maturity to speak my truths, coddle my gifts, banish detractors. I used to do the polar opposite so now, these past few years, I'm free. What that means is the grid is clear and I lay awake in candlelight at night contemplating moving across country, to Europe, to Australia. I calculate how much I need to do that. I figure out if I'm lonely or just not used to freedom. I eat healthier, I am cheery because so many of my interactions are decided. It's like I finally constructed my self driving car so that I sit inside and write and create. And it only opens from the inside. Yet amazingly I've programmed in a thousand subroutines to every curve, pedestrian, interaction. I'm not on autopilot, I'm on strategic pilot towards my two or three personal goals. that's what it feels like st its zenith. ",
