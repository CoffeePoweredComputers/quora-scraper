            "answer_text": "The VVS Vintorez. Its name means \u201cthread cutter\u201d in Russian. You did ask for \u201ccutting edge\u201d, right. All jokes aside, here are some I found: Let's start with shock rifles: Electrolaser: a pair of ultraviolet lasers ionize the air around them. These plasma channels are used as electrodes to deliver an electric current to the target. Basically a wireless taser. Electro-water taser: sprays salt water at the target and runs an electric current through the water to shock the hell out of them. Shock rounds: rubber bullets with piezoelectric crystal inside which shocks all fuck out of the target on impact. Battery gun: (forgot the real name) literally a fucking sniper rifle which shoots mini-tasers as amo. So no wires needed. Squawker: a sound cannon which can incapacitate or even kill using sound waves. Snap rifle (Pulsed energy projectile): basically a pulsed laser rifle. The laser produces a plasma burst on impact and the shockwave stuns the target. ADS: the ADS rifles, otherwise known as active denial system, uses microwaves to induce extream pain while not killing or leaving permanent dadamage. BTW, these are all real weapons. But some of them are still in development stages. ",
