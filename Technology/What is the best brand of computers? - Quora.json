            "answer_text": "Among affordable (not Apple) the best is DELL. No other brand I tried gave me such reliability: DELL laptops (have couple of them) run for 3+ years without any single problem. I can\u2019t give such compliment to Acer, Lenovo and especially (the worst) ASUS. Had Lenovo 2 times - serves from 1 to 3 years without malfunctions, ASUS - from 2 weeks (usb ports failure) to 3 months (dead), had one Acer - 3 years then dead. But DELL never let me down (even if it\u2019s budget laptops). ",
