            "answer_text": "WIFI is just another hardware level networking connection. From the point of view of the iPad and the hacker an iPad connected via WIFI is no different than an iPad connected with an Ethernet cable. If your WIFI connection is secure then the question is really about the security of the entire network, the wired components and the wireless components alike. The good news is that most hackers find it much easier to hack the users than to hack the network itself. Not because firewalls are unable to be hacked but because people are so easy to trick into granting the hackers access to the network. The reason that is good news is that your network security is likely good enough to convince most hackers to move on to an easier target. Unless iPad users are actually brighter than other types of users that easier target will be you . ",
