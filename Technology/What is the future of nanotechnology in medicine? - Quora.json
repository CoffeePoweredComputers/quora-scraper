            "answer_text": "thanks for A2A ! nanotechnology is revolutionary due to the flexibility and versatility of ideas that it can generate and make happen. and medical field is no exemption from it. 1) nanomedicines - drugs containing nanoparticles or meds diluted in colloidal solutions with comparable dimensions are clearing many obstacles in treatment. also, noval drug delivery mechanisms are formulated using nanomaterials. 2) diagnosis - quantum dots/fluorescent nanoparticles may serve as diagnostic tools for cancer and other diseases. 3) Biosensing - high-functioning sensors using thin films, nanomaterials etc are making the study of the living cells, mechanisms & behaviour way more simpler than ever. 4) artificial tissues - the rate of new materials with astonishing properties is so huge that we now have anything for everything, atleats at lab-scale. Efforts are in their way to create better transplants for stem-cell research and other stuff requiring artificial implants. 5) the whole new fields of nanobiotechnology & bionanotechnology,yeah the 2 are different, check 'em out ! :D 6) nanobots in action - this may sound sci-fi, but most people think nanotech is all scifi !tiny tiny robots are proposed to substitute drugs in future, getting into the body, identifying the diseased cells/pathogens, repairing/eliminating them and getting out ! but we've to keep in mind the cons coming along, the dangers of using particles at such dimensions, the problems that may arise if they go out of control, and nanotoxicology as a whole. with so little time, such ideas have formed shape and got going, so with more time, there's gonna be even greater flow of thinking and lets hope it happens for the good of all.
