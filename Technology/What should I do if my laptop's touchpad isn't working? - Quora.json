I would go to the control panel for the mouse/touchpad and see if it's turned off.  Also of course, reboot. ",

Reinstall it Check that your mouse is showing in Device Manager or not .Check the mouse properties Check the button on touchpad that disables touchpad.If you have pressed it accidentaly (Recheck it ) I think every laptop touchpad has this button.If nothing works contact Service center of your laptop else cheap and best advice is to use an optical usb mouse :)",
