            "answer_text": "Contrary to popular belief, 5G won't be here in India or to the world in fact till 2020. We will see it's snippets here and there but the proper implementation will not be till mid 2020s. On India, government is yet to grant 5G spectrum such in simple words means that companies won't be having the radio waves to run 5G on and even after getting the spectrum, they need to set up equipments as well. As to your question why one should not iPhone XR, well for one it has a freat processor and is now available at \u20b953k here in India. This means that if you are an Apple fan here in India, you can get the one of the best performing and latest iPhone at that price. Though if you care about the telephoto lens and use 3D touch, then you should look at iPhone X(if its available), since the performance should not be very different. Finally, if you are already invested in Apple ecosystem then this is one of the best reason to buy it. Side note: if anyone tells you that display is not full hd and not that great. Please ignore that, go to a store, look at the phone and display. If you like what you see them buy it and if you don't, well just leave it there and get something else. Hope this helped. ",

            "answer_text": "The iPhone XR does not support 5G. As for the second part of the question 5G needs time for implementation and in case of India We are not going to see 5G before the end of 2020, which is the case for most of the world as well. The technology is still in testing phase in many country and need time to be properly implemented. For the part why one should buy iPhone XR in 2019. It is the cheapest iPhone to come with A12 Bionic chipset which is just one generation old and is powerful enough to last for 4\u20135 years without slowing down. It also has one of the best battery life in iPhones. For the part of updates and support from the company it still support iPhone 6s which goes on to show that iPhone XR will be getting regular updates for at least the next 3\u20134 years. ",
