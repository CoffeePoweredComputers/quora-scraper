This is your first , I wouldn't get anything older and I wouldn't necessarily get a new one as  they are quite expensive . Learn it , learn what it can do and what you ask of it . Later in a couple of years you can probably sell it still for a good price and then go for a new one , one word \u2026warranty \u2026.they are great with customer service and warranty repairs. I have had several macs and macbooks through out the years and all were good and fun to work on .Good luck. ",
