            "answer_text": "I am not quite sure by what you mean by non-technical.  What I look for in a potential candidate for any position I want to hire is someone who not only has the technical qualifications but is also a well rounded and versed individual.  In that regard, I look at what his/her interests are.  When I was first starting out after college I was certified in a few health/life programs (CPR, First Aid, Advanced First Aid, Water Safety Instruction, SCUBA).  In interviews people immediately recognized that I was interested in people and their safety and was used to interacting and communicating effectively in both individual and group settings. I later earned my EMT (Emergency Medical Technician) certificate and was certified as a First Responder (fire department), Interior Attack, and HAZMAT (hazardous materials).  One person immediately asked me if I would be interested in being on their emergency response team and help work as a safety coordinator for the company in their building complex if hired. I earned my MicroSoft Office Certification and became part of a team of engineers that would go on to help create SOP's for all departments, write training manuals, work on corporate sponsorship programs, and be part of the community affairs group. A company can look at a resume and see if a person has the technical qualifications for a job without ever seeing or speaking to you.  What interests them is what else can you offer the organization?  How will you fit in and interact with peers, subordinates, and supervisors.  I have rarely faced a prospective employer who spent much time on my technical credentials.  He can see the degree but what makes me unique?  What can I contribute that sets me apart from others. When I applied to college my high school grades were a consideration and so were my test scores, but it was my extracurricular activities and interests that were the compelling evidence that I would be an asset to their community.  This does not change much when you enter the market place after graduation.   People are an asset.  Companies want to cultivate that and they want to see people with varying interests who expand their horizons, push their limits, and thirst for innovation.   ",
