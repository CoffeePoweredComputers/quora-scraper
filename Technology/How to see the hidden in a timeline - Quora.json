            "answer_text": "The definition gives it away - hidden things are exactly that - hidden from view. This means that when you make a commet hidden that the person who made the comment can see it - but only them - not others and you as page owner know that you or one of your admins have hidden it for a reason. Maybe profanity - ALL CAPS mean-spirited words or other bad things. After a time you may decide that actually blocking someone is better. Sometimes I will hide a bad comment\u2026. and then wait. Posters with evil intent go back to see if they have stirred things up and get sad when their post (that they don\u2019t know has been hidden) does nothing to get others mad\u2026 So they lose interest and go somewhere else to wreak havok. SO after maybe a few days I then BLOCK and BAN THEM so they canot bug me again at 2 am. However, if you block and ban them - without this 3 - 4 day waiting period - then they actually KNOW you banned them (because they can\u2019t find that nasty comment they are looking for - to see how they\u2019ve made everyone mad) and then they really get mad and start to hunt for your other social media accounts and cause a real problem in all the other places where you have a presence. SO - it\u2019s ok to hide\u2026..then maybe ban at a later date. I know you didn\u2019t ask for this additional information but thought it wise to lay it all out as a sort of \u201cplan to work around the meanies\u201d - good luck! ",
