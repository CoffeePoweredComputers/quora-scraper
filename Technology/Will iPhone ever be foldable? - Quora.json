            "answer_text": "I am reluctant to predict these things, but to me, foldable phones seem very much like 3D TV. They look very cool and promising, but in the end don\u2019t offer a significant practical advantage. While I can see situations when people may like the ability to double their screen space, it seems that most often (by far), people will be simply looking at the front screen of their device (holding the phone in one hand), so the inside display will remain folded most of the time. The trend to thinner phones is there for a reason: users love this. The folding display will necessarily make the device much thicker than it would be without the folding display, and none of that extra thickness would go to additional battery capacity (which will be sorely needed by the display that\u2019s twice the size). Therefore, in addition to the added thickness due to the inside display, there will be additional thickness to add extra battery to power that massive display. During most of smartphone\u2019s day, it is the display that drains the battery more than any other component. The bigger it is, the faster it drains it. The double display will require a massive battery, so the thickness will effectively need to be at least double, compared to standard phones of same size and display quality. I can\u2019t imagine Apple ever building a foldable display iPhone. Let us see in five years if I\u2019m right. ",

It was rumored that the oled technology would be so inexpensive and moldable that we would see folding screens, animated mugs, duffle bags with illumated and animated logos by this time. But, i never thougjt we would actually see it. Not because of the technology challenges, rather because of then gimmickiness of it all. And frankly, the way they fold is not really conducive to longevity. These are organic displays, but they arent rubber. I would want to ensure the screens donnit suffer from stress wear on the fold line. Any tech that costs over $1000 should last fir a good 5 years or more. I suspect Apple may have the same reservations. Longevity of OLED displays and accurate calibration were always the challenges that held Apple back from adopting OLED displays to begin with. Let\u2019s just wait and see? ",

The difference from what I could tell is that Apples device folds in the opposite direction to the Samsung one, meaning on Apple\u2019s the screen folds on the outside whereas \u201cSamsungs Fold\u201d folded on the inside. But there are rumours that a far eastern country (possibly Japan) has already got one tested and ready for marketing. If Apple do decide to market one I think it will be a little while yet before we see that one being offered for sale, possibly 2020. ",
