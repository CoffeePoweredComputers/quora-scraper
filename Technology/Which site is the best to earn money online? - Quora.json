            "answer_text": "There are many websites out there that offer productive ways to make money online. If you have any special skills you can become a freelancer and offer your services to people, also you can join different paid survey sites and make some productive money there as well. You could join many (PTC) this is paid to click sites, and make some productive money there to. This is just a few there are many other sites out there. If you want the most productive website that would benefit you the most in making you money, I would have to say that would be the website you build yourself. There is no website online that has more potential of bring you in good money then a website you built for yourself, geared around the niche of your choice. Most of the websites you join you will have to put in a lot of work in and the return for your work will always be much less then whoever owns the website. To me this is to much like a regular 9\u20135 job where you bust your butt to make someone else rich, and correct me if I\u2019m wrong but when we all comes online looking to make money it's to make us rich right? Don\u2019t get me wrong these kind of sites are great when you're starting out and have never made money online before, because most people that turn to the internet for income at first don\u2019t believe its really possible to do. This is a great way to start seeing some money coming in and build your confidence about being able to make a living from home. You can learn how to become a day trader and make very good money online, I thought I would throw that in there because I day trade and it is very lucrative when you know what you're doing. This does take time to become a profitable trader but it is a skill worth learning and you will be able to make money anytime or anywhere around the world with just a laptop and internet connection. I love any business that allows this :) You can make a living income from home with a free blog/website, personally I use Blogspot and Weebly and create very simple blog pages that I promote products on a make around $200-$400 a day with. Nothing online has to be as complicated as people want you to believe, this is just to get you to buy more pointless products/services that won\u2019t help you make any money and keeps putting more money in there pockets. I will tell you how to make a living from home in a few SIMPLE steps. You need to build yourself an email list where you can send offers out anytime you want. This is exactly what I do to make my living from home, over a few years I was able to build a list of over 50k. About every 2 weeks or so I send out a mass email with a hot product that I believe in of course and I know works and will add value to people's lives. Because I am trusted by my list as an authority figure when it comes to good information I usually get around a 4% conversion rate. This is about 2k in sales, now I say usually because sometimes it's less 2% or 1% but even so out of 50k that\u2019s still around 500 in sales. I hope you're starting to see how having your own website/blog and email list can make you very good money. (THE MONEY IS IN THE LIST) Always remember this. In order to build yourself a big email list you need a high converting landing page where people will come and enter there Name and Email and that is what I consider myself an expert in this department because of a program I found 8+ years ago that helped me. I hope this answer gave you a little insight about how to really make some good money from home. If you liked the information I gave and are at all interested in learning more about how I make a living from home and how you can to, you are more than welcomed to visit my Blog and I will show you exactly how I do it and what I use. You can believe this is the most honest information on how to make some great money online without being lied to. Also I\u2019m giving away a free ebook on my blog that shows you a cool little strategy I use everyday to make an extra $75-$150 a day to add to my daily profits. (Very Good Stuff) It\u2019s yours if you want to grab it. ENJOY :) Part 2 Making A Living From Home ",

            "answer_text": "Yo man, I was initially asking the same questions as you did, wondering what \u201cplatform\u201d was needed to make money. After quite some time trying to make money online, truthfully you don\u2019t need any \u201cplatform\u201d nor do you need any one website or program to help you make money. What you need are the necessary skills to make money online, skills like marketing, generating leads, etc \u2026 So, if you currently have no idea on what to do to make money online, I would suggest you get some training first, any basic training will do to know more about the online world of making money. One program I can suggest is Wealthy Affiliate, they have a free membership that includes like 10 training videos that can really help you out in terms of beginner knowledge. They let you create a free website as well ! What do you do after you know more about making money online? Here are a few ways to make money: Become a bloggerA lot of people are turning to blogging to make money nowadays. The earning potentials are very high and I\u2019ve seen bloggers make $5000 per month from their blogs and it can still go higher. To put things in simple terms, you create a website and you keep writing posts for your website. But reality isn\u2019t that simple, there are a lot of other things that make up your website as well and you have to learn how to make your website successful. You need to learn about keywords, SEO, e-mail lists, writing attractive headlines, etc \u2026 How do you make money? Very simple really. Your aim is to drive traffic ( visitors ) to your blog and then monetize them through methods like affiliate marketing or advertising. There is a catch though but I would say this catch would apply to all online ventures. This process will take time and effort. So let\u2019s say your aim is to get number 1 on Google rankings ( to get traffic ), well this isn\u2019t an easy task and will generally take a few months or more depending on your effort. Nevertheless, blogging is a good way to make money, despite the few months of \u201cstart up\u201d time needed. Just be sure to keep writing posts for your blog. Sell physical products online You have 2 choices you can take here: Sell stuff on your own websiteSell stuff on someone else\u2019s website ( like Amazon )Regardless of which you choose, the first thing you need to do is find a supplier. You will get products directly from them and feature them on your website of choice, like a middle man. If you choose to sell using your own site, you can try a model called drop shipping where you only buy from the manufacturers after someones a purchase on your site. If you want to sell on Amazon, you have to purchase in bulk and send it to Amazon\u2019s warehouse where they handle the rest for you. How do you make money? I believe it is pretty obvious, you buy stuff and sell it at a higher price. What about the catch? If you choose to sell stuff on your site, you would need some method of driving traffic to your site ( same problem as blogging ). You can always advertise your site ( on Facebook or whatever ), which will cost money. You might even need to try different campaigns to see which works. Selling stuff on Amazon however, would mean that you\u2019re competing with other similar products. Your aim would be to outrank them on Amazon\u2019s own search engine. The easiest way is to get reviews ( you know, by giving out free samples ). You also have to buy the stuff in bulk before you make any sales, which could be risky if you aren\u2019t sure about your product. Become a freelancerWith sites like Fiverr or Upwork it is pretty easy to do odd jobs online for money. There isn\u2019t much for me to elaborate on this. The idea is simple, you advertise your service on those sites and people come buy your service. It could be anything, like logo designing, article writing, etc .. Of course this is just a very short list with a few examples, there are so many other ways you can make money like social media, domain flipping, stock trading, etc .. There are obviously more ways that you can make money, you should research as much as you can and you will eventually find the perfect method for you. Do not hesitate to ask me anything if you need help or want to know more, I\u2019m here to help. ",
