            "answer_text": "This is an observation based on the hypotheses made by Gestalt Aether Theory, whether it proves or disproves the existence of positrons is moot. What it does do is restate the parameters of the original Carl Anderson experiment to detect positrons. This is done by using the GAT theory for the flow of a current in a conductor and the nature of the resultant electromagnetic fields surrounding the conductor that this current gives rise to. Thus it is possible to re-evaluate the manner in which a strong external electric or magnetic ( electromagnetic) field might affect the particles in a cloud chamber.  Cloud chambers were among the first devices used for detecting cosmic radiation and particles that we cannot see with the naked eye. These devices work by creating vapor trails from the trajectories of particles, such as cosmic ray muons. Cloud chambers were once vital to the study of subatomic particles, but have since been replaced by more sophisticated methods of study. An electric or magnetic field can be applied across the chamber, which will cause charged particles to curve. Positive and negative particles curve in different directions, making them distinguishable from each other. The first point to note here is that according to Gestalt Aether Theory there are no separate electric and magnetic fields there exist only electromagnetic fields. The second point to note is that according to Gestalt Aether Theory the more than 200 hundred year old convention that it is electrons that are charge carriers in an electric current is disproved and overthrown as is the similar belief that the charge is carried from electron to electron by an electromagnetic wave. Instead, Gestalt Aether Theory puts forward the theory that it is photons that are the charge carriers in an electric current. Since by the principles of classical physics, free electrons cannot emit or absorb photons because they lack a massive nucleus with which to absorb the forces of recoil. GAT states that free electrons can emit (relatively) low energy, low frequency, long wavelength photons, as long as by the principles of Heisenberg\u2019s Uncertainty Principle, they can be reabsorbed in a time . The second part of GAT states that the whole of the Universe, every part of it, is permeated by photons that were formed at the time of the Big Ban and that are of such low energy ( about eV ) that all matter is absolutely permeable to these photos. No atom of any type whatsoever has need of or can use such low energy photons. One result of this lack of interaction is that it is estimated that these \u201cvirtual\u2019 (low energy) photons can travel through a block of lead one light year across without any significant interaction taking place. They resemble electromagnetic dipoles that in the normal course of things are aligned at random, when a real photon is emitted they form up into a line whose ends rest on infinity and the energy of the real photon travels along this line of aligned \u2018virtual photons\u2019. Low energy \u2018virtual photons that permeate the Universe are identical in structure to real photons emitted by electrons.  In the case of an electric current the situation within the electrical conductor is chaotic, to start with it is chock full of free electrons, therefore an electron that emits a \u201cConduction photon\u201d might absorb a \u2018conduction photon\u2019 that has been emitted by another electron. In this situation the emitted photon might exit the conductor and circle around to re-enter it and be absorbed by a different electron than the one that emitted it. When this happens, the virtual photons\u2019 of the aether line up in the direction of propagation of the real photon forming the distinctive \u2018lines of force\u2019 that are seen around any electrical conductor carrying a current. In such a case \u2018each line of force\u2019 regardless of it length or curvature etc., possesses the energy of one \u2018conduction photon\u2019 amounting to  J. Thus each \u2018conduction photon\u2019 has a wave-length of m and a frequency of  Hz and an energy of J .  Incidentally according to GAT the \u2018conduction photon\u2019 is the longest wave length photon that an electron can emit further such low energy \u2018conduction photons\u2019 can only be emitted by free electrons, bound electrons cannot emit such low energy photons as they have no place within the atom\u2019s energy spectra. Since \u2018conduction photons\u2019 are the longest wave-length photons that an electron can emit, what are radio-waves and how are they formed? The GAT answer to this question is that they are \u201ccomposite waves\u201d and they form only with an AC current. Radio-waves cannot form with a Direct Current. Radio-waves are therefore time dependent structures. Just as in any normal photon, the energy of a \u201ccomposite waves\u201d (radio-wave) is also dependent on the relation . \u201cComposite waves\u2019 (radio waves ) are formed when the lines of force around a conductor suddenly find themselves without a means of resolution, as for instance a means of being absorbed by free electrons within the conductor. When this happens the \u2018virtual photons\u2019 forming each line of force re-orient themselves so that they are connected in parallel instead of in series and leave the vicinity of the conductor at the speed of c.  This is a radio wave and it explains how a tiny electron m in diameter can emit a photon that is several thousands of kilometres long. No problem at all when it is a \u2018composite wave\u2019 formed of parallel connected virtual photons. Here the energy of one conduction photon is distributed among all of the parallel connected photons in a \u2018composite wave\u2019 or radio wave. Thus if the \u2018composite wave\u201d has a wave length of 0.75 m. Then it contains  \u2018conduction photons\u2019 connected in parallel. The energy of the radio wave or \u2018composite wave\u2019 is then the energy of a \u2018conduction photon\u2019 divided by the number of photons in a composite wave , which in this case is  J calculate the energy of the radio wave using traditional methods the same answer is reached: using fh : J. In view of the above it is time to consider the situation in a cloud chamber.  Suppose an electron with a charge of 63 million volts enters the cloud chamber passes straight through a 6mm strip of lead and emerges on the other side with as a 23 million volt positron, according to current theory it would be emitting electromagnetic radiation ( emitting photons according to GAT) as it travels through the cloud chamber. Surely there is a good chance that this emitted radiation would interact with the external magnetic field placed around the cloud chamber just as if it were a current flowing through the cloud chamber with the result that both the Hall effect and the  Lorentz force would be present. One consequence of this would surely be that the direction in which the electron or positron would travel after it emerges from the lead strip would depend to a large extent on its position in the chamber.  If it was more towards the positive side it would be drawn towards that side and if it were more towards the negative side it would be drawn to the negative side. It doesn\u2019t really make much of a difference because the lines of force around the introduced \u2018magnetic\u2019, \u2018electric ( electromagnetic field), placed transverse to the particle\u2019s travel would definitely have an influence. The same would hold true even of the most sophisticated accelerators such as the Large Hadron Collider. The imposed electromagnetic fields would surely influence charged particles that are radiating electromagnetic radiation that are travelling in them. The same holds good for the radio-active sources of \u2018positrons\u2019 where moving and therefore radiating charges are concerned they will definitely interact with externally imposed electromagnetic fields.

            "answer_text": "Sure. They were discovered in cosmic rays by Carl David Anderson. He observed them in cloud chamber tracks that were like electrons, but with the opposite electrical charge. It was realized that this was the particle predicted by Dirac\u2019s theory of the electron. Of course positrons don\u2019t last very long because they annihilate with electrons to produce photons. But they are continually produced by cosmic rays hitting our atmosphere. ",
