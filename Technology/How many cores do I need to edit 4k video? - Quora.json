            "answer_text": "It all depends \u2026 On:a. Which video editor you are usingb. Do you have more time on your hands I have a 4 core i5-2500K, along with 24GB RAM, a GTX 1070ti and a couple of SSD for the storage. That works with 4k video on HitFilm pro. It is not as fast as it could be and I would like to shave a few minutes off the longer renders. So I am looking to up to a i7, with 32GB and a GTX1080ti - or even RTX 2080ti if this year\u2019s budget will run to it. Hope that helps. ",
