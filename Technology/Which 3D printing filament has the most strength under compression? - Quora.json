            "answer_text": "I assume that you're talking about the printed output and not the filament itself. But I'm not sure what your definition of \"strength\" is. There are materials that will maintain rigidity under pressure and then shatter, others that will have a tremendous amount of elasticity and will recover when the force is removed and others that will deform, but won't shatter or tear.  In general, I would think that nylon is probably going to be the best balance of rigidity and elasticity in an object that needs to maintain it's shape under pressure. PEEK and PEI are stronger, but most printers won't be capable of printing with them. They also appear to be quite rigid, so where nylon will probably fail by simply deforming, PEEK and PEI will likely shatter (I don't have hands-on experience with these, so it's just my speculation based on the specs. Hopefully someone else can chime in with real world experience with these) You can usually request a materials sheet from the filament manufacturer that will let you compare specific products in detail to match up with your requirements.  If you're just browsing, you might also want to check out Taulman. They have a number of specialty filaments and one may address your specific needs. http://www.taulman3d.com/how-to-choose.html ",

            "answer_text": "Let\u2019s start with ABS. (Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene as it\u2019s known by in it\u2019s hometown) is the grandfather of home FDM filaments. Temperature: Print at 210-250\u00ba C with a heated bed at 80\u00ba C or more. Print Performance: Due to the nature of the plastic, ABS tends to be very easy to print with from a hot-end point of view \u2013 as in it\u2019ll extrude beautifully from most hot-ends without fear of jamming or clogging. Strength: ABS is a rather strong plastic if printed at sufficient temps to get a great layer bond.ABS has a decent amount of flex to it and it tends to bend rather than snap when put under pressure.  ABS is great for wearables due to it\u2019s resilience When to use it: Objects that might be dropped, put in hot environments or used in a rough manner are perfect uses for ABS. Think of knife handles, car phone mounts, phone cases, toys, wedding rings (mine is black ABS). In short it\u2019s very good for most objects. When NOT to use it: If you don\u2019t have a heated bed, forget about it. If you want to print some large objects and don\u2019t have a way of protecting it from breezes or even the ambient air temp, you will fight with splitting and cracking. Avoid ABS if you cannot adequately ventilate the room you\u2019re in, the smell might be irritating. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-V/S\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 PLA (Polylactic Acid if you\u2019re asking for it on the street) is the sweet smelling hippy cousin to ABS \u2013 IT BIODEGRADES AND SMELLS LIKE CANDY WHEN YOU PRINT! If that fact alone doesn\u2019t interest you, then read on. Temperature: Print at 180 \u2013 220\u00ba C and while you can print without a heated bed, I recommend one running at 60\u00ba C Print Performance: In almost the complete opposite to ABS, PLA users sometimes have difficulties with jamming in the hot-end (especially all-metal hot end users) due to the sticky and expanding nature of PLA as it melts. Strength: While you can still print incredibly strong objects with PLA, it tends to be a little more brittle than other plastics. Rather than bouncing when dropped or struck, some printed parts may just shatter or chip.  PLA is no problem for outdoor projects When to use it: Personally I recommend using it whenever you can. It\u2019s a bioplastic that can be recycled or composted. It\u2019s perfect for boxes, gifts, models, prototype parts. Oh and don\u2019t be afraid of using it outdoors, while it does biodegrade, it does need a heated composting setup and it\u2019s insoluble in water, so make a PLA garden gnome right now! PLA comes in nice transparent options, the choice is clear When to avoid it: If you\u2019re making something that needs to hold up in 60\u00ba (C) temperatures avoid PLA, it will start sagging at this temperature. Due to it\u2019s brittle nature it isn\u2019t recommended for tool handles or parts that will be dropped repeatedly, also parts that have very thin portions will break after bending slightly. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 In Conclusion: It\u2019s worthwhile learning to use both materials since both ABS and PLA have ideal use situations. Myself, I try to use PLA at every opportunity due to it\u2019s biodegradable qualities, ease of printing and sweet smells :) but ABS is just the ticket for higher impact or higher temperature jobs.
