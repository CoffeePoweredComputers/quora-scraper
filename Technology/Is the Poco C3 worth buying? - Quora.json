            "answer_text": "Yeah, Poco C3 can actually be a pretty good device for most of the users. It has some really good features at low cost and I think this C from Poco might turn out better than the other latest Cs from Realme. Talking about the smartphone, the best thing I like about it is its storage section at the cost. The smartphone occurs in two variants, costing 7.5k for 3GB/32GB variant and 9k for 4GB/64GB variant. Apart from this, the smartphone is powered by a MediaTek Helio G35 octa-core processor that is clocked at 2GHz and it has good gaming performance as well. There is a 13MP triple rear camera with a 5MP front camera and a 5000mAH battery with 10W fast charging support. Overall the features at the cost are amazing and it is absolutely worth buying.  ",
