            "answer_text": "A book which I found balanced, informative, and well-written is Why Globalization Works by FT editor Martin Wolf. It was selected as a 2004 Book of the Year by the Economist, which writes:    The fullest and most sophisticated case yet for globalisation, by the chief economics commentator of the Financial Times. In plain, taut English, Martin Wolf argues that alleviating global poverty is the challenge of the age, and that the poorest countries in the world are poor not because of the baneful effects of too much globalisation, but rather because they stand outside the global economic system altogether. Mr Wolf pays a lot of attention to the interdependence of states and markets\u2014and to the vital, even if limited, role that the state needs to play if countries are to prosper. The poorest countries, after all, are often failed states. Source: http://www.economist.com/node/3422856   Furthermore, the book is also frequently mentioned for its superior nature in contrast to Joseph Stiglitz's one-sided attack on the IMF in Globalization and Its Discontents, and Thomas Friedman's popular but slightly superficial The World is Flat.    More recently, just released World 3.0 by Pankaj Ghemawat has been getting good reviews and seems worth picking up. ",
