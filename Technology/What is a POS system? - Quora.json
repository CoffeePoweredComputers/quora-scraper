            "answer_text": "A Point of Sale system i.e. POS system is the retail transaction device which is used to calculate the amount that a customer owes the retail store for purchasing a product. Previously such kind of financial transactions were being carried out by cash register system, but now it has been replaced with Point of Sale system because of its added advantages. It is the point at which the customer makes the payment to the merchant in exchange for the goods or provision of a service. After carrying out the transactions, a receipt gets sent from the electronic Point of Sale system to the mobile. Advantages of using Point of Sale systems are- 1. Point of Sale systems simplify the accounting process. Old fashioned cash registers force accountants to sort through hundreds of receipts, but with a Point of Sale system financial personnel can simply use the built-in reports or create their own. 2. Unlike a cash register, a Point of Sale system often includes an overall inventory management system. Store owners can use a Point of Sale system to track their biggest sellers and re-order those products when the stock gets low. 3. It is easy to look up past transactions. If you need to know how much you sold last Tuesday, a Point of Sale system can give you that information in a snap. It would take many hours of laborious work to find the same answer using a cash register. 4. You can use a Point of Sale system to create your own purchase orders, eliminating an extra step in the ordering process. You can even automate the ordering process to make sure you never run out of your hottest selling products. 5. Modern workers are often more comfortable with Point of Sale devices than old-fashioned cash registers. The generation now entering the workforce never knew a time without computers, and as a result, they are very comfortable working with computerized technology like Point of Sale devices. 6. Point of Sale devices provide faster service than old-fashioned cash registers. Every part of the process, from authorizing a credit card transaction to printing a customer receipt, is faster on a Point of Sale device. 7. Customers receive more informative itemized receipts with Point of Sale devices. Many cash registers can only print the date and the amount of the sale, but since Point of Sale devices are tied into the inventory control system they can provide much more detailed information, including a description of the item, the list price and the sale price. 8. Point of Sale devices can cut down on user errors. Hitting a wrong key is always a risk when ringing a sale, but Point of Sale devices have built-in checks to ensure that the information is entered accurately. 9. You can see real-time inventory with a Point of Sale device, something that even the best cash registers simply cannot do. In fact, many companies have found that implementing a Point of Sale system virtually eliminates the need for a costly hand count. 10. The maintenance and repair costs are often much lower on a Point of Sale device than a cash register. The number of companies that repair cash registers is dwindling, and that means that repair costs can be rather high. There are many vendors who repair Point of Sale devices, and that can keep repair costs low. ",

            "answer_text": "You've ever been to a retail outlet of any sort? The computer/cash register they have at the cash counter is what a POS system is. It stands for Point of Sale system and is used for managing sales, generating invoices for cash/credit sales and tracking how and which products are sold and in what quantities.  These systems have evolved over times and are pretty much capable of doing much more than just recording sales. With built in forcasting analytics, POS systems can also display future product trends so that one can take the right call in maintaining optimum stock.  In terms of professional services, these systems have become pretty common. Not only does a POS eliminate the need for manually feeding a computer with the transactions but also takes care of reproducing them in seconds. This provides relief to retail/franchise brands in handling business cash flow at multiple outlets without any geographical restrictions.  To sum it up in pointers, with an effective POS system :-  You can analyse sales data, figure out how well all the items on your shelves sell, and adjust purchasing levels accordingly. You can maintain a sales history to help adjust your buying decisions for seasonal purchasing trends. You can improve recording accuracy multifoldly by integrating bar-code scanners, electronic cash registers, credit card readers and recept & invoice printers with the POS system.",
