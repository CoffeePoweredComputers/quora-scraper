            "answer_text": " Quimbaya Airplane  These existed between 1000 b.c. to 1000 a.d. The Wright bros. discovered/re-discovered flight around 1903. These were aerodynamically sound so much so that replicas were able to fly without any problems. The natives back then didn\u2019t understand flying tech. It was thousands of years too early for them to even conceive the possibility of flight. But today, if we still can discover an ancient technology 1000 years ahead of us, we wouldn\u2019t be so surprised & we will be able to comprehend it. With the spread of ideas and modern futuristic concepts through Hollywood movies, we would just marvel at the sight of them rather than treat it like magic. It just means that Earth\u2019s history is much longer and more complex than what our historians has made out of it. ADDITION: When you think about the past and the people living 1000-2000 years ago, everyone would go with the \u201canimals\u201d, \u201cinsects\u201d theory. Most figurines can be easily represented by what you want to see, similar to local animals & insects. BUT there are a couple of oddities in the bunch. In 1954 the government of Colombia sent part of its collection of ancient gold artifacts on a U. S. tour. Emmanuel Staubs, one of America's leading jewelers, was commissioned to cast reproductions of six of the objects. Fifteen years later one was given to biologist-zoologist Ivan T. Sanderson for analysis. After a thorough examination and consulting a number of experts, Sanderson's mind-boggling conclusion was that the object is a model of a high-speed aircraft at least a thousand years old.  Both Sanderson and Dr. Arthur Poyslee of the Aeronautical Institute of New York concluded it did not represent any known winged animal. In fact, the little artifact appears more mechanical than biological. For example, the front wings are delta-shaped and rigidly straight edged, very un-animal-like.

Whatever power source it had is almost certainly exhausted and beyond our ability to revive or even replace (think about trying to provide the right amount, type, and cleanliness of electrical power to run your notebook computer with a Baghdad Battery array (pottery with vinegar, a copper and lead rod, no controls, trickle charge.) As we\u2019re seeing with the Internet of Things, it would almost certainly rely on wireless communication with databases, sensors, other devices, etc. and of course now be cut off from all of this (like a cell phone too far from any cell transmission tower.) At a thousand years buried it\u2019s labeling, attachments, controls may no longer be visible or workable (probably projected touch screen or even linked to the user\u2019s brain wirelessly), and there have likely been internal parts failures from time, dust, water, insects, freezing, etc. . So to us it\u2019s a \u201cthingamajiggy\u201d and unlikely to be sent to the right lab with the right scientists to look at it, instead going in a never to be reopened storage box with the thousnds of other artifacts from a dig that aren\u2019t a high enough priority for further testing or even display. Then it goes into the basement storage at the museum or campus buildings for an indefinite time, centuries or at least decades, before it\u2019s re-examined when moving the collection or thrown away to make room for new digs\u2019 finds. If it\u2019s very high technology it would need an engineer familiar with that field (or a team of diverse engineers) to recognize what it might be. There\u2019s an odd archaeological conceit that anything out of place in a dig, i.e. a 1950\u2019s beer can in a 1,500 year old site or a Roman coin on a New England beach was somehow lost there by modern folks and passed somehow through the same layers of soil and rock or has been placed there as a joke or hoax. It\u2019s why time traveling probably has gone on far more than we realize with it\u2019s traces just treated as contaminated sites or hoaxes. ",

It is quite improbable that you would understand what the little gold wires might do even if you thought to look at it with a microscope and the silicon chips would be absolutely incomprehensible. That is even if it were preserved particularly well. It is utterly unlikely that you might guess its functions. It is unlikely we would comprehend technologies just a few decades ahead. We have much less chance of even imagining technologies of 1000 years hence, and highly unlikely that there would be any trace left of the fine structure of any circuitry or other engineering. Another point is that we might be certain that the technology was behind us but much less idea that it was ahead of us, or by how much. If we could comprehend it, we would not take 1000 years to develop and adopt it. ",

Meet the Antikythera mechanism  This peculiar piece of Ancient Greek technology was uncovered in 1901 and appears to be from about 100 to 250 years BCE. It seems to be a mechanical system for showing the movement of stars. The level of craftsmanship and technology was not seen again until clockmaking some 1500 years later.  It has a mechanism that has been revealed via X-ray and can be described as a proto computer. It seems to be a one-off and remains an enigmatic lure to scientists and historians alike.  ",

I'm not being a racist, but a lot of religious and ancient hindu texts reveal a lot of things that we've just come across. The curvature of space, the distance between the sun and earth, the atom, the gravitational waves, the comets, the newton's laws of motion etc. being a few of these examples. We don't know how did the ancient people come across these things but we surely can now say that it is a lot about rediscovering what already has been discovered ages ago. ",

Therefore we have a technology which is 4,000 years old in acupuncture which has yet to be incorporated into western medicine or understood fully but which suggests to me something about human physiology which needs to be explained. In that sense it has yet to be discovered. ",
