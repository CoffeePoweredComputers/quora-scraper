            "answer_text": "A computer mouse or trackball generally will last until you get tired of it. I\u2019m partial to wireless Logitech brand devices, and have a portable mouse in each back-pack / carry case, and the trackball for home and office. With Logitech\u2019s \u201cUnifying Receiver\u201d, I only need to have the one USB dongle plugged into my laptop to use any of these at any time. Very convenient. These have been working for me for at more than 7 years, with use on a daily basis (especially the trackballs). One still has the original battery (!). I did knock a mouse off a desk onto a concrete floor, chipping one of the buttons. These are pretty much indestructible. Every year or so, I\u2019ll clean out the keys, buttons and the trackball. Other than that, there really isn\u2019t any maintenance required. If you are looking for a new one, check out our review Best Wireless Trackball Mouse \u2013 Logitech M570 . BTW - if you are actually asking about how long it lasts in terms of battery life (e.g., how often do you need to replace the battery), then here\u2019s an answer for that: With Alkaline batteries, and average usage you can expect about 1,000 mAh (e.g., 10 hours at continuous 100 mA) of juice. For a very low power device like a mouse, trackball or keyboard, you can expect about 9 months to a year before you need to replace the battery. We did a lot of battery research (The Best Alkaline AA, AAA Batteries) to get that data. However, your usage may vary. Like I said above, I\u2019ve still got a mouse with the original battery still going after years. Hope these additional data points are helpful. ",

            "answer_text": "For a simple computer user, it can be as long as a decade. For enthusiasts, it\u2019s probably more closer to about 5\u20137 years depending on the mouse. In terms of gamers, maybe 2\u20133 years. The average point of failure for a computer mouse is the button. The microswitch simply fails and a button on the mouse stops working after lots of use.  Next to a button no longer working, the second point of failure is typically the scroll wheel. Dirt, dust, and grime can get in there and totally screws things up. If you\u2019re not cleaning it out, it can lead to failure. I\u2019ve heard a few people mention the laser/light on a mouse failing. I\u2019ve been around many computers as an enthusiast, tech assistant, and so on and have only seen this after a mouse was dropped on a floor or other hard surface. Based on my Ebay order history, my office mouse (low end cheap gaming mouse) has been in use for about 5 years. My home, daily use mouse (budget silent mouse) was in use for about 6 years before I replaced it. ",
