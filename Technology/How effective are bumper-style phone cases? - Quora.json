            "answer_text": "If you have / are getting an iPhone 5, then you may be wondering whether it's worth getting a rubber bumper to fit around the outside of the phone, or a case for the phone to fit into.The two different styles of case can both protect the phone. But which is better and do you really need one?The iPhone 4 came with a bumper from Apple to make it work properly as the signal on the early phones was rubbish if you were holding the phone and trying to use it as a phone.The iPhone 5 is not supposed to need a case or bumper, as not only is it supposedly harder to break, but the signal issues that forced the people that bought an early version of the iPhone 4 to use a bumper (I was one of those!) have now been sorted out.But should you get yourself a bumper on there anyway?The bumper only fits around the edge of the phone and you snap the phone into it, while you can get cases that cover the whole lot.If you use a bumper, you won't need to take the phone out of there really, whereas cases can get filled up with dust and grit, or at least they do in my pockets, so you'll have to take it out now and again for a clean.Something to bear in mind is that the iPhone 5 back is easier to scratch than the previous glass backed version, so if you want to keep it in pristine condition, or as close as possible, then get a full case.I prefer the bumper. I don't know why, I just tend to find that full cases are a bit chunky and heavy and I've never really liked them. I know that by the time my contract is up I will have battered my phone to some degree, but as long as it doesn't break before then I'll be happy. ",

            "answer_text": "They are ok for the minimalist feeling , fit well in a pocket . I used one on an iPhone 4 when they came out and it was nice . Corner impact was covered and it raised the phone on the front and back so a dropped landing wouldn't do much if any damage . The problem though is if your phone drop on an uneven surface like on a cobble stone walkway or on large gravel walkway or such . It would not protect the screen or back . You sacrifice total protection for thinner profile and pocket ability . ",
