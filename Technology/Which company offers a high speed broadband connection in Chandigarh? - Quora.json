            "answer_text": "I am living in Chandigarh for almost 17 years. I am an online gamer so I can tell you this one better. Numbering mentioned below doesn't mean top priorities, they all have their own disadvantages and advantages. 1.Bsnl The worst! Why did I say that? Because of unstable connection, poor wiring and plans of course. If they you will get a plan of 2 Mbps speed, you can check it on OOkla speed test(online) it won't go near 1 Mbps. They will set it up for you at the beginning of the connection but after 10 days Booom! Kbps. The worst one is their customer care dealing. Hell ya, they will pick up ur phone which is satisfying in the beginning but I remember my internet connection was off so I called them and they came after a week. The reason was their strike due to low wages. So trying to cover up in short. DONT GO FOR IT! IF YOU ARE A GAMER DONT GO FOR IT FOR SURE! Since there is no wiring people have no choice they just have to use BSNL broadband. Bsnl has no advantage except the callings are free at night. Funny isn't it? 2.Reliance My close friend is using it.I wanted their broadband pretty bad. 4 Mbps in 1100 bucks. The best available right now in Chandigarh. They don't have bad customer care service, it's ok but at a level below airtel. Ping issues are negligible. My friend in cs go reliance user plays at 50 ping, jelly, isn't it? (ignore this one).I would really recommend going for reliance. But wiring issues, right? In Chandigarh, this is a major concern for individuals like us. 3.AIRTEL More wirings than reliance. Best in customer care services, not best it's awesome. They have the most managed way of doing work. One guy for feasibility, one for review, one for speed checking. Using it I know it. Using the plan of 16 Mbps downloading limit 60gb which is very less.If you have wiring of Airtel near your home. You can go for it. BUT RELIANCE>AIRTEL>\u2026\u2026\u2026..>BSNL DID YOU SEE WHERE BSNL LAYS EGGS. NOWHERE! 4.Local isps(Internet service providers)? They think they are competing with Nextra and Hathway. These two provides the best speed in Bangalore and Delhi. But in Chandigarh we have local isps such as Sky net, Netplus(Fastway), connect. You can choose them over bsnl of course. But they are not well managed yet. I used Skynet for 2 months, Couldn't bear their stupid excuses. Their customer care guy didn't even know what does ping mean. So you can understand it. I think netplus is a good one. I don't know about connect sorry. So I think the story ends now. You can choose it wisely. Thank you. Edit: Just got the installation done by NetPlus. My plan right now is 50mbps, downloading limit 300 GB, 5 Mbps after 300GB. Using it for one month it's good as I needed some good speed. Best plans they have available right now in the north I guess. Edit: 25\u201306\u20132019: Still using Netplus in sector 42. My plan right now is 150 MBPS and no restriction on the downloading limit. I am paying around 1500 Edit: 26\u201310\u20132019:Disconnected Netplus because of poor customer service. No one visited my home after fiber got cut, It been two weeks. Back to Airtel 16mbps plan. Edit: 15\u201312\u20132019:Using both Netplus and Airtel. Netplus(They have improved their customer care services quick fixes and all) plan is 1200 Rs for 100mbps unlimited and Airtel 16mbps 799 Rs (Also Airtel gave me 3 months Netflix subscription and 1 year Amazon prime when I activated it.I don\u2019t know if that deal is available right now.). Looking forward to getting JIO FIBER and Airtel V Fiber but they are not available in my area so I can\u2019t tell anything about it. I heard they have good plans. Edit: 12\u2013sept\u20132020:Airtel fiber and jio fiber are offering very cheap plans in chandigarh so get it if its available in your sector. Both are not available in sector 42 yet. ",
