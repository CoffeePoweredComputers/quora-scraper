            "answer_text": "Technically, the Internet does not provide services, anymore than the telephone system provides plumbers or dentists. The internet is a means of conveying data packets by addresses, and therefore provides access to services, just as the phone system provides the ability to call a plumber or a dentist. Your browser is able to craft data packets, such as HTTP (web) requests, to destinations accessible across the Internet, and (edit: the Internet) allows those destinations to reply to you with their data packets (web pages, images, etc.) Do not make the mistake of thinking that the Internet is providing you these end-services (Google search, Social media, Amazon merchandising). The Internet is not an entity that produces content. It merely conveys interactivity. Your ISP charges you a fee to access this conveyance and transmit your requests to different sites, and should charge you as well according to how much data you access, since it must be delivered to you through their systems. Sites like Google, Facebook, Amazon and Netflix also have ISPs and content delivery networks that they must fund in order to make their content quickly accessible throughout the globe. They pay to place their content on thousands of servers, so that when you send a request to view some content from their site, they can have the closest server respond to you. ",
