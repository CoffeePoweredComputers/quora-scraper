            "answer_text": "For me the simplicity of the Chromebook is a great thing. Not being involved with so many things that MS and Apple are concerned with. Security and safety issues, for get it. Maintenance matters, lordy, ten years ago with the new OSX white Mac laptops, it got to the point that I was adjusting and fixing things to work in a slightly different way, all the time. I was spending more time maintaining and adding new features that I was writing to my friends or studying the internet. The entire, what I call revolutionary idea Google started with to come up with the least operating system and applications. Google realized a huge number of laptop users were not business folks or their families. MS has been constantly bent on adding more features, permitting more action on our part with their annual new releases. To MS it was a great virtue to offer more every year, every update. Their machines were getting bigger, their apps more complicated, their operating system calling for more heedfulness all the time. Mac was kind of going the same route, more stuff, more complication. Google realized that a browser and web site apps and storage was all that most of us needed. It really comes down to \u2014if you or your boss insists you use the Word family of word processing \u2014get a Windows machine with as big a memory,RAM and storage as you really need. If you just have to use Photoshop on your pics \u2014get a Mac, again a Pro if you really need that much hard drive storage. If you want to play Minecrafte get a real gaming machine like my Dell Alienware 13r. But in the last month I\u2019ve discovered the ridiculously priced Pixelbook with the Intel i7 will do a perfectly good job of playing the most demanding reace and terrorist games. To my old weak eyes. You may discover otherwise. :) Chromebooks are by far the safest platform to use. Some of that is because our fiendish geeks haven\u2019t been interested in virus hacking into the Chromebook crowd, students and all, but have always enjoyed screwing business folks. At a Google Chromebook site check out the whole thing of Chromebook security. The sand boxing idea and all. Chromebooks get faster and better with each overnight auto update. I still have and use the first Aug 2011 Samsung basic Chromebook issued. Runs much better now with upgraded version 75 than when I bought it. Google has noticed me that they will no longer upgrade that machine. Limiting support like that to 6.5 years. Good to know how long Samsung/Google expects most Chromebooks to last. The fact is like $700+ Macs and Windows laptops the $200 basic Chromebook will last as long as you want it to. Battery changes every few years. I will keep using the Samsung and it will perform just as it does today, until I\u2019m tired of it or it really breaks down. This is true also for Macs and higher priced Windows laptops. Google\u2019s cloud storage and web site apps can be a really good thing. If I drop my sweetie Chromebook in the river, it\u2019s no big deal. I just get another Chromebook, perhaps with that new price reduced with a refurbish buy. I just fire up the new Chromebook (or any laptop including a fine pre-installed Linux machine). Put in my Google user/password as usual and away I go. Totally back in business. All my precious keeper pics/docs/videos stuff right where it\u2019s always been in web site Google cloud Drive. All of the bookmarks, settings, start up preferences, immediately on the new Chromebook. Everything is synced. To all my platforms \u2014Chromebook, Mac and Windows. My good stuff is not inaccessible laying in that river on the laptop\u2019s hard drive. :) And catch this about Chromebooks and web apps/storage. Nothing on the Chromebook hard drive, non of my precious keeps stuff, but a very good browser. I use Chrome for quicker web site access. As I\u2019ve said, I have a Mac and the Windows Dell Alienware gamer. If we save keeper stuff to Mac or Windows hard drives, they are gone,lost, when the Mac/Windows hard drive completely dies, or that laptop also fell into my river. Grandma\u2019s pic \u2014gone forever. That is the good aspect of web app and web cloud storage. Always sitting there awaiting our access with any kind of device \u2014phone/tablet/computer. We can do this same thing \u2014ever-available keeper stuff access by using Dropbox and not saving to hard drives. ",

            "answer_text": "I just want to add this to Bill West\u2019s excellent answer: My X2 is faster than my AMD Ryzen 5 2600 desktop with 16GB RAM and an NVME SSD in the browser based stuff I do on it. Which is 90% of all the stuff I do. I keep the desktop for AAA graphics heavy games (nVidia GeForce 1070ti graphics card) and one or two stand alone Windows programs I use. My spouse says her base model Pixelbook with the i5, 8GB RAM and SSD is much faster the her 17\u2033 Windows laptop with an i7 U series cpu, 16GB RAM and SSD. She keeps the Windows laptop for two stand alone programs she uses. Other than those 2 personal choices, both of us could otherwise do away with the Windows machines and not miss a beat. ",
