            "answer_text": "If you want to have an organized MP3 CD then you should create folders on your computer and copy the MP3 files into these folders before you start the burning process.It's recommended to burn your music to a CD-R instead of a CD-RW (rewritable), because not all CD players can play rewritable CDs properly.Place all MP3 files or folders in one folder and make sure that the total file size of that folder does not exceed the capacity of your CD (usually 650 MB or 700 MB). To view the file size of a folder, right-click on the folder and then click on Properties.Note: The CD or DVD you will burn using the built-in CD/DVD burning feature in File Explorer can only play on computers and CD/DVD players that support the file types/formats you burn onto your disc \u2013 except when you burn VIDEO_TS files and folders to DVD, because then it will create a Video DVD that will play on any DVD player.
