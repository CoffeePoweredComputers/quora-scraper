            "answer_text": "How 5G E Is Different from Real 5G 5G E is not 5G at all - this is 4G LTE. Of course, 4G LTE has some additional features that make it faster, but many operators have 4G LTE networks that are out-of-the-box. \"5G E\" means nothing.  Credit image: Fudzilla Real 5G is the fifth generation wireless standard that is actually being worked on by the industry today. This requires new radio hardware that supports 5G and does not work with existing phones. 5G. While AT & T says 5G is almost as fast as its old 4G LTE technology, 5G promises up to a hundred times faster. This promises a big reduction in latency, cutting maximum latency from 20 ms to 4G LTE today to 4 ms in 5G. 5G uses an entirely new radio spectrum band, and the company is experimenting with launching home internet services through 5G. 4G LTE, and only AT & T has 4G LTE.

When AT&T announced 5Ge, it was where they added carrier aggregation and upgraded the backhaul at the sites to improve the broadband. So now they are getting over 20Mbps, making it look like 5G speeds. Technically, it\u2019s 4.5G. Then you have the Wi-Fi systems that added more spectrum to their units allowing more throughput, this made the throughput increase and they started calling the Wi-Fi routers \u201c5G\u201d. All fake. The 5G system can use 4G spectrum but the network and wireless interface is different. The5G system will use the 5G NR format. Then we will have true 5G. We\u2019re waiting on 5G devices to be made. They are out there for FWA but not for mobile just yet. They should be released in June of this year in the USA. ",
