There has also been an eightfold increase in enrolments on online learning platforms during the lockdown imposed as a result of COVID-19. You can learn anything from history to tarot card reading on online learning platforms, they celebrate learning of every kind and not just conventional learning topics like maths and physics. Some good resources for online learning include a new online learning platform known as InfoDepot. This website offers the unique feature of live tutoring calls, allowing students to participate in real time classes with the teacher by phone or by video. This encourages students to ask questions and initiate discussions, whilst also giving the teacher the opportunity to answer questions directly and give feedback. Alternatively, you can purchase a video class covering a topic that interests you. Once purchased, you will have access to this video for life. You can rewind, pause and rewatch the video as many times as is necessary for you to learn. If you enjoy the video, you can purchase more from the same teacher or explore other topics. Make sure that you have everything that you need for the lesson ready before participating. A few pens, a notepad and a bottle of water are a good place to start.

Video conferencing software requires little or no additional equipment beyond a computer, microphone and internet connectivity. There are several massive open online course platforms like moodle, edmodo and google classroom that are avialable to create and teach online courses. In the current technological environment the only thing that is truly needed beyond the normal computer hardware is the instructors and students. Courses need to be created that facilitate self-efficacy and self-direction in students. Professors need to understand the potential and be able to create and utilize all the tools available within the chosen platform. ",
