            "answer_text": "Everyday! We're having conversations about something or the other every hour now and then. She's family, above that she's everything I've got. The best buddy I've not only been blessed with but certainly could've asked for. Talking to her about ANYTHING AND EVERYTHING is very easy because she's very cool, open-minded and comfortable with discussing topics that even the most contemporary parents would face trouble with. I think one of the reasons why our conversations are so free-flowing is that I take interest in her life too, even her professional life. I listen more than I speak at times, and that really helps her to vent out whatever negative or demotivating thoughts she's holding up. For any relationship to work, it's important that you must become a capable supporting pillar for the other person if they're doing it for you. It's not always that she's initiating the convo. Many times I do it, and it ends up in fun either way. The beauty of it all is that we don't feel like we're disturbing each other or need a topic to specifically talk about. We're not strangers and nobody should be acting like one to the people who love and care for them. Not only do we keep a \u201cYou're doing alright\u201d check on each other, but we also help each other out by taking the other's opinions in account, and respecting whatever they're doing for themselves. There's a boundary we don't cross and understand that the other is sane enough to do the right thing that won't hurt anybody. It's all a very heavenly experience for me in this aspect of my life. Thank you for the A2A! :) ",

            "answer_text": "During school and college days, my free time was devoted to giving her updates on how things are in school and college. After I moved out of home, our phone conversations increased. Every day I would talk to her after getting up and before going to bed. The typical conversation would be how things are in the office, how much I miss home-cooked food, how horrible the weather was etc. Post marriage, the conversations revolved around asking recipes, husband\u2019s health, and in-laws. Now that I have moved back to my hometown and am just 2 mins away from my parent's place, I visit them every Sunday. After a hearty meal, it's just mother and daughter time. My father happily enjoys his afternoon siestas whereas my mother and I sit and talk for hours together. Needless to mention, my husband also enjoys having a conversation with my parents, especially my mother. He gives her tips on how to invest in different post office schemes. She has a set of questions ready regarding bank transactions. These are patiently answered by my husband. Last Sunday, all my mother\u2019s siblings had come over to my place. They gathered in the living room and discussed their parents, what a terror my grandmother was, how all the siblings looked after their pet dog, college romances, love letters that some of them received from their secret lovers, etc. My husband and I were laughing listening to some of their funny puppy love stories. Irrespective of the changes in my schedule, moving to different cities, I always ensured that I am available for her. The day she's angry, the phone call lasts for hours together. She wants to vent out her frustrations and I happily lend my ears. To answer your question, I have never distanced her from my life due to the changes in my own personal life. Talking to her has been therapeutic, she instills a sense of calmness with her voice, and she always has the best advice for me in times of trouble. She is my pillar of strength. ",
