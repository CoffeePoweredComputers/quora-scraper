            "answer_text": "At the beginning of the year, my plan was to see the lineup of 5G phones available prior to the release of the new iPhone. Then at that point, I would have decided on which device to choose and probably bought a new phone in a few weeks[1]. Well a lot has changed since the beginning of the year. Since my wife lost her job just before the initial stay at home orders in March[2], buying a 5G device hasn't been on my priority list. For the most part it's been taking care of the family while also ensuring everyone is safe and healthy. I usually keep smartphones around 4 years and don't buy new devices unless we're dealing with hardware failures too expensive to repair. If things go as planned in my head, I'm suspecting some time mid 2021 when I'll make the switch to a 5G device. We'll have a better idea by then how well 5G devices will perform on this new network.
