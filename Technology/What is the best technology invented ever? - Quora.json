            "answer_text": " Technology never fails to amaze us: it leaves us in awe in every moments pass by. We are now into that stage of future where human eye can zoom in by just blinking with the help of a tiny contact lens. Yes, you heard it right. Few Scientists from University of California San Diego claimed to discover this wonderful technology. The bio-metric lenses will be driven by signals generated by the movements of the eyeballs. In simple words, the movements of the eyeballs(left, right, up, down) have been studied and converted into some meaningful signals, called electrooculographic signals. Those meaning signals charge will be fed to the bio-metric lenses which will respond to those . The polymer made lenses will expand or contract depending upon the electric impulses fed to it and when they become more convex, they resulted in zooming in. It is reported that blinking twice of the eye will make the lenses zoomed in.  The more advancement of this technology can be used in \"visual prostheses, adjustable focal length glasses or maybe in remotely operated robotics in the future\", as quoted by a researchers of the said University. Lead researcher Shengqiang Cai further added, \u201cEven if your eye cannot see anything, many people can still move their eyeball and generate this electrooculographic signal.\u201d For time being five electrodes are connected to the lens those will act as muscles. Scientists hope this technology in near future can be used to control mobile cameras remotely. Let us hope for the best and greatest.  The size comparison of the lens The photos are illustration purpose only. ",

            "answer_text": "With any of these questions, it\u2019s not the fact I can\u2019t think of anything, it\u2019s that I might experienced something wondrous and then it goes into the deep hole from which nothing can retrieved again. But enough digression. In my general vicinity, telescopes are pretty amazing. To be able to sit on your veranda on this plucky little planet, and look through this big tube filled with lens and to be able to see the craters on the Moon or even a different planet, must be one of the few things that can still inspire people with awe. In the same vein, Any space probe is an amazing feat. The unique ways they\u2019re built and the unconventional materials and processes, and the fact that they can actually function to any degree in the vapid vacuum of space, makes you realise the scale of the endeavours, if we put our heads together, we can achieve. And if a machine can make you think that, that is rather amazing. ",
