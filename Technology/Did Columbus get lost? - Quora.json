There would have been no time at which he didn\u2019t have a reasonably good idea where he was, or at least as good an idea as one could have before a reliable way of measuring longitude was invented. He had solid ideas of how far north or south he was and which direction he was headed, and probably an approximate idea of his speed. The problem wasn\u2019t that he didn\u2019t know where he was. It was that he really didn\u2019t understand where he was going. Or what there was to see along the way. His estimate of the circumference of the Earth was too small, and he was unaware of a big-ass continent being in the way. ",

So, even if he didn't actually know where exactly he was going, he knew there was something. It was not entirely an expedition into the unknown. Around the Antilles, he indeed was in exploratory mode: Getting 'lost' and finding out what was there was the idea. ",

Instead he \u201cfound\u201d the Caribbean (It was there and populated all the time and the locals never thought they had been lost) but on his second voyage he still never found what is now North America. By the time of his third voyage North America had been \u201cdiscovered\u201d by a certain Mr Cabot, from Bristol, on a voyage paid for by a Mr Americ. This is why the continent or continents if you prefere, are called America and not either Columbia or after his benefactors. Countries are named after the Discoverer, the Discoverers Monarch or paymaster. If the country has a population regarded as \u201ccivilised\u201d then the rest of the world, or at least the bits that matter as far as they are concerned, tended to go along with their name of their home. Oh and it is generally agreed that the lads from Norway got there first, around the 1100\u2019s and set up home for about 100 years. ",
