            "answer_text": "How do you connect a VCR to an HD TV? Easily. Easiest way is via the aerial lead - connect the RF out of the VCR to the RF in of the TV. Connect the incoming aerial to the RF in on the VCR, and tune the TV\u2019s analogue tuner to the VCR\u2019s output (this is usually ch. 36, but can vary, so you might have to hunt for it). This also gives the lowest quality, but with good equipment you won\u2019t notice - though if your VCR is stereo, you will only hear mono. You can also use the VCR\u2019s RF output to feed other TV\u2019s in the house. Better way, almost as easy - connect the VCR\u2019s ausio and video outputs to the corresponding inputs on your television. Usually this is the red, white and yellow RCA connectors (for left, right and video rspectively). If the VCR is mono, there will be one less. Some VCRs use something else for the video, sometimes a BNC connector or (if it\u2019s an old one) an SO239 (screw) connector. Adaptors from these to RCA are easily available. TVs and VCRs for the European market will have SCART connectors; again, suitable leads and adaptors are available. This will give a bit better quality, including stereo, and save you the bother of finding a free channel if you\u2019ve got a lot of transmissions in your area. Don\u2019t bother with things like A/V to HDMI converters unless you have no option; this will degrade the quality and might not work at all if the VCR\u2019s output is too far out of spec (which they can be). Happy viewing! ",
