            "answer_text": "Sell it on ebay. The problem is that this computer is circa 2008, meaning it uses a lot of electricity. Even if it\u2019s powerful enough, compared with today\u2019s servers, it\u2019ll be using hundreds of watts more. The TDP of the one Xeon X5365 CPU is 150 watts, each! Run your numbers, in a few years the money you spent on running this server and keeping it cool \u2014 you could\u2019ve bought a new server. Don\u2019t forget, each extra watt of power your servers uses means you need 2\u20133 watts of A/C refrigeration. Some very rough calculations, as an example. Let\u2019s say your old server uses ONLY 300W, you are actually using 900W of cooling. That\u2019s 1200W total. Ouch! A modern server is pretty stingy, energy-wise. Say it uses 100W of power and 300W of cooling. That\u2019s only 400W total. Not too bad. 800W x 24x365/1000 * $0.12 = $841 dollars EXTRA spent on electricity per year. The trend towards VMs, server consolidation, Docker, higher core counts, etc. etc. is all about saving money, specifically .. electricity. You wonder why companies typically swap out perfectly good old equipment after about 5 years .. that\u2019s why. ",

It\u2019s reported to have a rather low-quality display and regular SATA drives can\u2019t be installed in the rack so you\u2019re limited to the three 146 GB drives that come with it. Good machine for its age but don\u2019t expect it to be of gaming machine quality. There are reviews about this machine on Amazon. Maybe it would be helpful to you to read them. Other sites are sure to have reviews too if you google them. Basically, you get what you pay for. ",
