            "answer_text": "Yes its possible by sim cloning How To Do Sim Cloning Sim cloning is the process in which, cloning a original/real SIM card to create/generate duplicate/carbon copy SIM card without the knowledge of individual mobile subscriber/customer. When this process is completed then the cloned SIM card\u2019s identifying the information is transferred to a separate secondary SIM card. The secondary card used in different phone while having all calls & associated charges attributed to the original or prime SIM-card. The following phase defines \u201chow to do SIM cloning\u201d: We have two-networks in our cell phones: GSM & CDMA. This network offers good call-quality & other technical-features, which separates both the networks from each other. In CDMA mobile phones, cloning is achieved by changing the ESN (Electronic-Serial-Number) with the help of software\u2019s. This number is transmitted to the telecom-company in order to authenticate any cell phone onto the network. In GSM mobile phones contains IMEI number (International Mobile Equipment Identity) instead of ESN number, which means that fraudster have to get IMEI number in order to clone original SIM card to create duplicate one. Not every SIM card is clone able, there are two-types of SIM cards: COMP 128 v1\u2013 this is most popular & clone able version of SIM card. COMP 128 v2 \u2013 The new SIM\u2019s, capable of better 3G, video-call support, secure/safe firmware, complicated-design. Remote Sim Cloning Retrieving information from the SIM remotely is very hard process & this process is done by the professional hackers with expensive tools. The SIM applications is secured by encryption-keys & this key can cracked by using \u2018Over The Air (OTA)\u2019 commands, sent to the SIM card\u2019s Java Runtime engine. The OTA-commands are secured-sms messages, which directly delivered to the SIM. In order to derive or get a DES OTA-Key, attacker can start this process by sending binary-SMS to target-device. It responds to the attacker with error-code which carrying cryptographic-signature. The cracked-DES enables the attacker to send a binary SMS, which can download the Java-Applets to the SIM. Applets are allowed to send SMS, change voicemail numbers, & access the phone location. Gsm Sim Cloning Cloning of GSM mobile phones is accessed by cloning the SIM-card, which contained or implied within it, but not necessarily any of the phone\u2019s internal data. GSM- mobile phones do not containESN or \u2013MIN, only an IMEI (International Mobile Station Equipment Identity) number & there are various methods used in order to get the IMEI & MIN. GSM SIM-card is copied by removing the SIM \u2013card & placing or applying a device between the handset & the SIM-card & allowing it to operate for few days and extracting KI, or you can say secret-code. This process is done/complete with those handsets, which have the option of \u201cextended battery\u201d. ",

            "answer_text": "A SIM hack is a nuisance or the most expensive lesson any victim goes through. The loss evaporates each second time span in the SIM port attack. This drain your bank account and most of the risk-averse victims lose their appetite, leaving them gutted, sleepless, remorse and anxious. SIM hack is the loss of your original identity. It is not at stake \u2013 it is lost. Let\u2019s put it in a step-based way. \u2022\tYour sim card is linked to your phone number, email, and other social apps. \u2022\tYou opt 2FA (two-factor-authorization), and in case you forget your password, you can request a verification to be sent directly to your number to process the change. \u2022\tThe same email is attached to all of your social media and other online platforms. \u2022\tYou opt for authorized (or perfectly legitimized request) sim porting to another device. Now comes a bigger picture, make sure you have a glass of water. \u2022\tSince you have opted for sim porting which is legalized, have you noticed that this authorized porting could be performed using an unauthorized source by a malicious port? \u2022\tReverse the above process, once they have the pin to your phone (i.e. your number) they have the ability to reset your golden point (with the sheer volume of sensitive information) \u2013 email password which gives them access to controlling your password. \u2022\tA verification code is intercepted by the hacker \u2013 since they have ported your sim. \u2022\tNow they laterally move across luscious online accounts \u2013 cryptocurrency or digital wallet and bank account. \u2022\tUnfortunately, if they are \u201cmaliciously professional,\u201d or \u201ctop professional,\u201d they can easily lock your account \u2013 failing you to reclaim it. I founded Efani after being sim hijacked multiple times despite switching carriers & clear instructions not to port. I can clearly picture your dilemma; I get calls on a daily basis from people who went through the same emotional stress as I did. Sim-based hacks are growing and are a global pandemic, where no sim carrier is safe from hackers. Michael Terpin, a crypto investor and PR representative underwent a loss of $24 million, just because of a SIM swap hack (AT&T). Online wallet is linked with our emails or text message; this is why most of the hackers are attracted to SIM hijacking, SIM hacks or SIM cloning. SIM cloning is the process through which sims are hacked. Sim hacks are very much linked to digital currency and banks. This persuades worldly or borderless cybercriminals to invade your privacy. There is another similar cryptic incident where Namek Zu\u2019bi lost access to their precious Coinbase account. The hacking was possible through SIM spoofing or SIM swaps, where they logged into the Coinbase account. The ride has been frustrating where Conbase flipped the accusation game and Zu\u2019bi owed them $3K in return \u2013 they further blocked his account. We understand that sim hacks even with two vectors are prone to hack, this nabs most of us \u2013 at most secure and private cell plans, we take active steps to save you from these SIM spoof attacks. We have an agreement with all FOUR major US-carriers and provide military-grade protection against any of your SIM hack through a series of firewalls that exist to protect your SIM card. ",

            "answer_text": "Hi. To answer your question let me interpret your question with different contexts Is it possible to HACK the SIM, like reading the contents of the SIM card like the Authentication Parameters, Encryption Keys and modifying them ? It can be hacked, but it would be too too hard. It is too tough of a job. The job gets tougher with newer SIM cards with stronger encryption. The network uses both symmetric and asymmetric encryption for storing and sharing the data on the network. Also the mobile network is a closed network, that being said any HACK attack has to be done directly on the SIM card, so the attacker needs to physically hold SIM card to be able to hack it. Remote hacking is out of question until the attacker gains access to the phone that is using the SIM or the network the SIM is latched to. Is it possible to CLONE a SIM card ? Yes cloning is very much possible, and is a real threat. But it\u2019s also not easy. Apart from the fact that for cloning, the SIM has to be physically present with the attacker, the cloning gets tougher with the advent of EAP-SIMs and the USIMs/ISIMs. These SIM have stricter encryption and integrity checks. So its no piece of cake to clone SIM. Also SIM cloning cannot be done remotely. And the cloned SIM is no good if the original user blocks the original SIM. ",

Since those sim cards haven\u2019t been issued as new sim cards by carriers, current 3G, 4G, and newer sim cards simply cannot be cloned. I have cloned old GSM cards in the past for my own personal use, and as an experiment as well, but routinely 99.999% of sim cards being cloned will block themselves from being scanned internally within a few deep scans to obtain the KI encryption key needed to make a cloned sim card actually work. Since the bug was found around 1998/1999, new sim cards were issued phased-in. Newer sim cards, and the newer GSM sim cards would simply stop working normally by any and all equipment used to try and clone them. The only thing you can do with a sim card these days is edit, copy, or erase fairly simple device and user stored data there, and that\u2019s all you can do. As for anyone claiming they can clone a sim card and say it works, it\u2019s absolutely false. ",

SIM is just a subscriber identity module and you got nothing to hack in a SIM card.For every single transaction through SIM it's two way authentication. You can only change APN or access point names and some of parameters and that's definitely not hacking. if you try to do anything illigal activity or anything else experimental with viewing online tutorials for hacking without knowing what that means will trap you by cyber crime and may end up you behind the bars.

From my yesterday post on my blog: \u201cAs shown at the Blackhat 2015 U.S. conference by researchers of Shanghai Jiao Tong University, cloning even a 3G/4G SIM card takes from 10 to 80 minutes, requires a computer, an oscilloscope and a SIM replicator and, of course, access to the original SIM card for the required amount of time. Things get much faster if the original SIM card is a 2G SIM card (issued before 2002).\u201d So, short answers is yes. For a more detailed explanation on the process and a copy of this research results, check on our website (details in my profile). ",
