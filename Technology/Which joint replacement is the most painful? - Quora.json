            "answer_text": "That\u2019s easy - the one done to you is the most painful. Well, that may not be true. It would be painful to see my daughter or grandchildren go through a joint replacement. But in the sense I think you are asking, I think there is no simple hierarchy of pain. So much depends on the reasons for the replacement - trauma, disease, etc. The overall health and condition of the person going through it is also a significant factor. And, I have to believable that the method of repair / replacement has an impact. The actual type of replacement done is significant. As there are several manufacturers of replacement parts, selecting the right one (not just the one who gives the surgeon the best deal) has to come into play. Of course, the skill of the surgeon and surgical team also has some bearing on it. While not a joint replacement I had a tib/fib break when I was 51yrs old (not compound, but the sharp end of my broken tibia was trying real hard to poke through my skin). My leg was repaired using intramedulary nailing. Immediately after surgery it was safe for me to bear my full weight on the repaired leg. While it was pretty painful, I was back to work in 2 weeks walking without any aid in about 3 or 4 weeks. Yet, when I had a sorta weird, but far less invasive surgery on my knee when I was younger (28 years old), it took much longer before I was walking aid free. The surgery was done arthroscopically (just three punctures where the scope, tools and saline entered my body) - so far less invasive than an open joint procedure. I was awake and had a spinal block (which unfortunately worked, but not as well as hoped with a \u201cwindow\u201d of little or no effect). I had extra material in my knee (a lot of material that was apparently congenital). The surgery took about 45 or 50 minutes, but for most of that time my leg was hyper-extended to 210\u00b0 (180\u00b0 being straight). I was watching on a video screen, but when they first re-positioned my leg I looked down. Of course they had a surgical drape at about my waist to keep me from seeing my knee with these 3 things sticking in it). When the doctor asked for my foot to be raised higher I was a little freaked out when one of the techs said, \u201coh I know how I can do this) and her head disappeared from view over the drape. Then her head and shoulders reappeared - with my ankle resting on her right shoulder. And it felt just like it looked - my knee was bent 30\u00b0 the wrong way. I think that was more disconcerting than seeing my foot 45\u00b0 off to the side bending at bout the top of my boot level when the bone broke. When the EMTs got my boot off (without cutting it or causing any disturbance to my leg), and had my jeans sliced open I could clearly see where the top end of my broken tibia was pressing against my skin on the inside of my leg - trying to poke through. The knee thing, while not as painful as it was when I broke my leg, was definitely harder to see. I turned my head and closed my eyes when I saw that. The surgeon, who seemed to like having a patient to describe what he was doing as I watched it on the same monitor he was using seemed to be a treat for him. He asked me a question. I said, \u201csorry what? I had to close my eyes for a minute.\u201d I wonder if he sensed my extreme discomfort and was trying to distract me, or if he just liked having a captive audience. I\u2019m not sure why you are asking which joint replacement is the most painful, but I will give you a bit of advice. If you are preparing to have major orthopedic surgery do NOT search online for videos of the same or similar procedures. Many orthopedic surgeries are pretty brutal requiring the use of hammers, drills, pliers, etc. And often body parts are simply not where they normally are while the work is being done. Also, please know that the anesthetist is your friend. You may want to look up what a pain ball or pain buster is - a small pressurized plastic ball containing a local anesthetic. It is connected to a small plastic tube that ends up tapering down to nearly nothing like a cat whisker. That whisker end is inserted into the surgical sight before they finish putting you back together. It provide a few days of local anesthesia. So you can be pain free and not be stoned out of your mind. It can be refilled when it runs out. Some surgeons do not like them because they think it is an unneeded avenue of possible infection. Having had one after some rather unpleasant scar tissue removing and nerve grafting in my arm, I think whoever invented this thing should be awarded the Nobel prize for humanity. The anesthesiologist explained what it was and also told me that it was usually not covered by insurance. I think it ended up costing me $125, but gave me 5 days post surgery with almost no pain and then the effects wore off over the next 24 to 36 hours. As a recovering alcoholic/drug addict anything that eliminates pain and does not involve being on narcotics, is a good thing. If you want to avoid narcotics and pain it is worth asking your doctor. The worst they can do is say no, they do not want you to use it. ",

            "answer_text": "I've had a knee, two hips, and a thumb joint replaced. I\u2019d rank them in order from least to most painful HipKneeThumbThe thumb rebuilding was horribly painful and had long recovery before I could use my entire arm for anything weight bearing or useful. Hours of physical therapy. Carry no weight for weeks. Fingers in a cast for 8 weeks. I had to use my right hand for everything. I had my non-dominant left hand thumb joint rebuilt. I have put off my also painful dominant right hand because I don't want to deal with using my left hand for everything for 12 or more weeks. I mean everything. I have learned to live with the pain because the surgery was so painful in the other hand. To be fair, my left thumb had been completely pain free since 4 months after surgery. It was a success no regrets. The knee was painful and required lots of therapy. But I was up and about within a week, unassisted walking in 2\u20133 weeks. I still have some residual stiffness, but the pain is completely gone. Hips were a walk in by the park. A few short weeks of therapy and walkers and canes, but now, zero pain. My most painful surgery, for a few days, was hernia surgery. Would you ever expect to ask your spouse to go to the store to get more ice to pack around your testicles? I didn't think so. It was that!
