            "answer_text": "For tapping phone are there are only 2 ways: Legal.Illegal.It is impossible to realize that your phone is tapped legally. In such process, legal warrant has been issued from law / enforcement authority and later service provider can be contacted with a genuine & valid motif to unearth something. The carrier/ service provider has the system to intercept and listen or record your incoming outgoing calls. Even they can excavate all sent and received SMSs. Illegal tapping is a bit tricky, it involves proxy web server to stream or record audio or SMS communication. By such ways even your cameras, microphone can be activated anytime to know what is happening with visual evidence. Even Internet browsing history and call logs can be pulled anytime. Your latitude and longitude can be tracked for exact location. In such process, the victim may experience some abnormality like sudden popup flash messages (not from carrier), enabled Wifi/GPS icon, sudden flash of camera, beep sound but again it is in the hand of attacker, If he don\u2019t want you to know, trust me you will never realize about that. Such attack could be highly covered and spoofed. Frequency Interception based on SSID and IMEI is much more complex and requires high end router & sniffing device for decrypting voice channels otherwise injecting bug into your device just needs a single access to victims device.  Option 2 can be used for educational purpose and for family safely as well. you can track where your kids are lingering after bunking schools. It can provide you peace of mind that your best half reached office or home safely. You can locate and take care of your elders quickly. Looks towards the brighter side !!! ",

            "answer_text": "If it is being done lawfully then there is no way to know because every phone conversation cell or land line is tracked. This tracking is done by the phone company or companies as part of getting your voice or text data back and forth as well as billing you for that usage. How this information is used is the difference between most calls and calls that that are being monitored by law enforcement. After a call is completed the phone company only really cares about which phone number where involved and their location(s) during the call and the time and duration. They will use the information for billing. The location information only really matters when one or both of the phones in a zone that requires special billing. The common example is when a phone is roaming. The time of day may also have a bearing on the billing as well. The information gathered during the phone call related your location such as the cell tower your cell phone is talking to is only used by the phone company to route your data to your phone and ensure the best possible connection even if you are moving. After the call is complete the phone company will store this information for a period of time and dump it unless law enforcement wants to keep it longer for some reason. Tracking calls can occur on two levels. The first level which is available for law enforcement to tap into for months after the call is just tracking the phones number involved in the call and the time and duration of the communications. This does not require as wiretap order and is typically used for data mining purposes, which means finding out who someone talks to and how often. The second level is that actually voice or text data is stored so the call can be played back as needed. This is suppose to require a wiretap order. The old TV idea that is takes a minimum amount of time to find out where a calling came from has no been reality for more than 50 years in most phone systems in the US. For the last 30 years computers have routed phone calls and must now the location of all parties on a call even before the phones rings. If law enforcement knows they need to track a call the tracking is done before the phone rings and if they don\u2019t know they can get the information at their leisure for months afterward. ",
