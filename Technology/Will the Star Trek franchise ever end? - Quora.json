            "answer_text": "A better question would be when will it end? The classic Star Trek preamble, i.e. \u201cto explore strange new worlds. To seek out new life and new civilizations\u201d. But what do we get these days? We get dross such as the asinine Discovery with its crass revisionism and risible Red Angel story. Not to forget the utterly missed opportunity that was Picard which so obviously plagiarised other, better programs that I am surprised that there are not copyright cases in litigation. The plot of Picard has more holes that a proverbial Swiss cheese! Nor do we need another series with alien race of the week which: (1) has a culture based upon a facet of human society or current topic therein, and (2) is humanoid but with forehead prosthetics. And we certainly do not need more of the dumbed down Abrams films either or the other CBS series we here about in the media. We have had too much Star Trek in too many formats, i.e., TV series, fan fiction, films, fan productions, books, merchandising and so on. But you can only flog a dead horse so many times! So it is best that Star Trek be given a respectful and respectable death. That or a radical overhaul of the series from top to bottom. But I suppose it will limp on, a shadow of its former self. Comments are intentionally disabled for this answer because it is simply a point of view. Others will disagree: that is their prerogative. ",

            "answer_text": "No, and i\u2019ll tell you why, as long as there are devoted fans of the franchise and large crowds at the conventions, it will not end. there was a time when the series was dying with the original series based on who old the actors were, then came the next generation, then DS9, Voyager, an alternate past Enterprise with Scott Bakula, and then the JJ Abrams reboot which i liked because this was the Star Trek Gene Roddenberry wanted where Captain Kirk wasn\u2019t some demanding diva who wanted the most lines and the most scent time next to his co-stars. The Franchise won\u2019t end, Star Trek Picard has proven that there still interest. ",
