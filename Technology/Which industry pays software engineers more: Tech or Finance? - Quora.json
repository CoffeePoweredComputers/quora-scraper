            "answer_text": "The short answer is Finance. Source: married to someone who worked in both as software engineer. The only case I can think of where tech pays more or less the same amount as finance is an early startup with rsu that increases values exponentially over time. However, there is one big downside to the paycheck in finance, most of it is tied into your year end bonus. This is not guaranteed and no one even understands how it is calculated. You can lose this entire bonus if you underperform and get fired before the end of the year, or the company really underperforms that year. Money aside, finance can be a draining career. Not everyone wants that kind of work environment. ",
