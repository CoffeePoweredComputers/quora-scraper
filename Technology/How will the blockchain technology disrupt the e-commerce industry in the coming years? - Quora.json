            "answer_text": "The blockchain has the potential to disrupt e-commerce in several ways: Payments. The blockchain can ease payments, specially international ones, so it will be interesting to check how the ecosystem develops in this field. The people at Nuggets are working on that.Trust. Smart contracts have the potential to build a layer of trust not dependant on middlemen. You can build an escrowing and arbitration system that operates itself, always in control of buyers and sellers, and with no middlemen. BitBoost is building a marketplace with those features included.Another interesting application is building network effects on the blockchain. These effects are the core of the value provided by the most successful marketplaces out there. The distributed nature of the blockchain is great to build bigger, safer and less restricted network effects.Finally, stuff tracking it\u2019s an interesting feature you can build on the blockchain with tokenization. People like Provenance are doing some interesting stuff in this field.Finally, the blockchain will surely completely redefine the e-commerce value chain. It will take a while, of course, but I\u2019m sure it\u2019s coming. ",

            "answer_text": "E-commerce is one of the industries being changed by the revolutionary use of blockchain technology.  With future of e-commerce growth, some side effects are bound to occur. There are issues with trust, slow transactions, higher fees and policies, and digital data ownership. With its concept of a distributed, genuine ledger of all digital transactions, blockchain helps to build trust in online payments. It also excludes frauds and provides a new payment method with the help of cryptocurrency (Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple,etc). The notion of transactions using digital assets eliminates the need for a third-party. Additionally, these transactions are faster and fees are decreased both for buyers and sellers. All data entered into a blockchain is stored there indefinitely. This means that no matter how many times a good is sold or repurchased, the transaction history always remains. This can go a long way toward eliminating fraud and boosting transparency. ",
