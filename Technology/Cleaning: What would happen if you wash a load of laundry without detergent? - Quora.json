            "answer_text": " Considering that I wash my clothes with a plant-based detergent that has a hint of lavender in it, and I also add a full cup of white vinegar to the wash, if I were to run a load of laundry with only water - whether cold or warm - the results would be very disappointing and here\u2019s why. First, the water supply in this area is loaded with minerals. This makes the water in this community \u201chard\u201d and it leaves a white deposit on anything the water here evaporates from. This is why glasses that are half-filled with water end up with white rings inside the glass. Eventually these rings, if they aren\u2019t scrubbed off, will become very resistant to cleaning. It\u2019s for this reason that I add vinegar to the wash. The chemistry of white vinegar allows it to dissolve hard water deposits. Without it, my clothes come out of the dryer feeling stiff. Now let\u2019s make matters worse and not use detergent either. The superficial dirt and dust will probably come off in a water-only wash, especially if I use warm water, but oil-soluble stains from butter, cooking oil, a salad dressing spills will still be there. The detergent emulsifies these fats and rinses them away. Without detergent, there\u2019s nothing in the washing machine to remove stains. And then there\u2019s the smell. If you\u2019re accustomed to having your freshly laundered clothing smell like lavender, get ready for a surprise \u2014 your clothes will smell\u2026 damp. They\u2019ll be half-clean and if you don\u2019t immediately wash them again using detergent, the stains may set and remain there for the life of your garments. At a cost of less than 25 cents per load, I strongly recommend using detergent. ",

            "answer_text": "People wash clothes without traditional detergent like drycleaners, but something has to act like a dirt-release agent - even borax mineral, or sodium bicarbonate, or some thing that turns the water alkaline. The presence of humans creates a whole slew of output rubbish. Sloughing skin cells, oils and greases, and salty deposits from perspiration. All this is natural and our common \u2018lot\u2019, however to not wash it off is to invite skin problems and reduced resistance to disease. It changes the texture of the clothing and increases wear and tear on it. There is also a morale-factor. Clean clothes along with the bright and not dingy look and a fragrant smell of freshness, are morale boosters that make going through a rough day a little more pleasing. Some of our output is water-soluble and some is oil-soluble. In more backward societies, people just get as much water to dilute whatever is on the clothes and beat the hell out of it on the rocks in a side of a stream, in an effort to loosen it from the fibers and remove the smells and stains. They stretch it out in the sun which acts to bleach it somewhat, and the UV light and heat take care of some of the rest. ",

            "answer_text": "Cleaning: What would happen if you wash a load of laundry without detergent? Well, assuming it is washable in the first place and you used the recommended temperature, it wouldn\u2019t be damaged. Detergent doesn\u2019t all rinse out. If you only did this once, the left-over detergent from previous washings would leave you laundry pretty clean. If you made a habit of not washing with detergent, the detergent from prevous washing would all eventually wash out. In that case, all the water soluble stuff, which is most dirt and quite a bit of the organics, would come out in a decent washer. What would not come out would be all the oil-based stuff, which include body oil, body fragrance (ahem), many or most stains. ",

Next time you are in the bath/shower, wash one.side with soap and washcloth , and the other only with hot water and a cloth to scrub . Then pay dry or wipe I don't think this matters. But if you want more accuracy dry your legs or whatever part you feel like testing with a blow-dryer to simulate the dryer heat and feel the difference or get a friend/loved one to see if they notice. For verification:hot water bath will simulate washer water. The washcloth used to scrub simulates the agitation of the clothes. Blow-dried simulates the heat from drier, PLEASE BE CAREFUL NOT TO BURN YOURSELF , NOT FOR CHILDREN TO TRY EITHER. SOAP / NON- SOAPis washing detergent. I bet you there is a difference if not noticed immediately then you will after a few wears of clothes washed without detergent. ",

            "answer_text": "Water-soluable dirt would be rinsed away, but when clothes need washing it is the oil-based soils that we'd like to get rid of.  Detergent is needed to loosen the oil from the cloth and then hang onto the oil while dissolved in the wash water.  The detergent will keep the oily soils from re-depositing on the clothes. Sweat, for instance, has an oily component as well as the salt and water. Without detergent, the smell of the sweat would still remain.   Skin oil would not be rinsed away;  body odor also requires detergent to detach it from the clothes. ",

            "answer_text": "Most of the dirt will still come out. Detergent only helps get some of the more stubborn dirt. But the main action is to remove odors. Eventually washing in just water the clothes will not smell as clean. Also the dryer can with the higher heat temperatures set the stain and orders in making it more difficult to eventually get out. So maybe one wash out of 4 can be without detergents or reduce the amount you use because probably 80% of the people use too much ",

I think it is necessary to use some kind of cleaning detergent or liquid in order to clean your clothing properly, in order to get out any dirt received through the air, and also to clean off any of your skin cells that have attached themselves to the clothes as you wear them. It also helps remove any perspiration smells that have come off your body and attached themselves to the clothing. Clean clothes smell and look better if they have been washed in soapy water properly. ",
