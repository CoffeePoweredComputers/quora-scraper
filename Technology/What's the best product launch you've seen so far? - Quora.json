            "answer_text": "Sources: Tata Nano Wikipedia article Tata Nano , Nano-timeline - Hindustan Times and personal thoughts. Tata Nano's Tata Nano launch has been the best. It is the first proper car( passes all safety, emission norms and is a decent looking car ) under 0.1 million INR( approximately $2,000 US at the time) limit. Its mileage/ economy is 25 km/liter of petrol. Because of which it is a product for masses. No company in the world sells cheaper car than it. In India people prefer vehicles having low maintenance costs and high mileage  and it scores high in both departments. Beside being a technological milestone it was a social milestone too. It emphasized the public image of Tata group. As the product was for the people who could not afford car despite having a genuine need for it. It was projected in public as to fulfill the promise of Ratan Tata (then chairman of tata motors ) to provide 0.1 million INR car to country's people, which he fulfilled even on meager profit margins. In the media Small Wonder: The Making of Nano\u2013a book about the creation of the Tata Nano.A Megafactories episode on this vehicle.Expectations created for the car during the run up to its production may have been out of proportion with its realized success. A 2008 study, by Indian rating agency CRISIL, thought the Nano would expand the nation's car market by 65%,but, as of late 2012, news reports have detailed the underwhelming response of the Indian consumer to the offering; sales in the first two fiscal years after the car's unveiling remained steady at about 70,000 units although Tata appears intent on maintaining a capacity to produce the car in much larger quantities, some 250,000 per year, should the need arise. For the exact picture of the PR and marketing, lets have a look at Tata Nano's Time line (adapted from Nano-timeline - Hindustan Times ) January 11, 2008 - First official display of Tata Nano at New Delhi Auto Expo. Media gave prime importance to this news. It was in front page of every newspaper and prime time show of every news channel. It was made a superstar before it launch in market. March 26, 2008 - Nano displayed at Geneva Motor Show. Projected as symbol of India's technological might. Thus added a flavor of patriotism with the product. In between there were few other reasons which kept Nano in news. Like protests against Nano's factory in singur etc. But those did not affected potential buyers mindset as its USP was Owning a Car on low Price. March 23, 2009 : Ratan Tata launches the Nano. Bookings to open on April 9 and close on April 25. This event was telecast ed live on many national News channels. May 4, 2009  : Nano receives 0.203 million bookings. Top end variant gets 50% bookings. Media followed again. July 17, 2009 : First Nano delivered to Ashok Raghunath Vichare in Mumbai. Meanwhile 6 nano's caught fire. Company reconfirms Nano's robustness. Offers to provide additional protection in exhaust system and electrical systems free of cost. Dec 9, 2010 : Tata Motors offers 4 year/60,000 km manufacturer warranty on Nano also applicable to those on the road. Also offers comprehensive maintenance contract at INR 99 per month (less than 2 $ ). Beside this Tata group has a philanthropic, respectable and dependable brand image in public and the product has been in line with it. Tata Nano is the brain child of Ratan Tata under whose leadership Tata Motors bought British premier car brands Jaguar and Land Rover. This acquisition was significant and widely covered by media which again helped the public images of involved.  The reason cited by Ratan tata for Project Nano is  \u201cWhat drove me \u2014 a man on a two-wheeler with a child standing in front, his wife sitting behind, add to that the wet roads \u2014 was a family in potential danger,\u201d . This reason has a feeling of attachment towards the Indian lower-middle class which are the potential buyers of the product. And unsurprisingly this reason was also in media top stories when the car was being promoted. Personally I too feel it is a great product in every aspect and by any reason. Tata Motors also plans to convert it into electric and air driven models also which makes me to maintain even higher expectations from it. ",
