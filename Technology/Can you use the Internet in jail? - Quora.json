            "answer_text": "It\u2019s kind of a complicated answer but here goes. As of 2009 (when my career in corrections finally reached the runway and smoothly set it\u2019s landing gear down and taxied it\u2019s way into the terminal for departure) here\u2019s what the institution that I worked in had. Intranet - This was available to officers for communicating within the prison itself and to HQ. HQ was mostly a relay where they\u2019d get messages or communications from us and forward them to any other parties on a need-to-know basis. It didn\u2019t access anything else. So, no outside internet, no chat messengers, nada. Internet - There was a very very very restricted form of it available in the library on older computers for the inmates. It was also heavily monitored by staff. They could request legal documents this way and access to updated text on laws already in the books. It could also be used to request books from the state library. One inmate did manage to get a shareware version of Doom onto one of the computers and got caught. The state sent a small team (maybe two or three guys) to go into the computer and investigate the traffic on it. They wiped the software from the hard drive and blocked access to that portal. That\u2019s really all of the story I got and that inmate was no longer allowed to use it except by proxy with a C.O. standing there the entire time. As of 2015, I came across this: You Probably Can\u2019t Jailbreak This Tablet Made For America\u2019s Prisoners One of the advantages of the tablet is that you could use it to access some very basic internet (email, music, video chat and more) which will be monitored and censored. It has pros and cons. One of the things that we used to come across is religious cassettes (No shit, cassettes were still being used in the early to late 2000s) and what we would do is put them into a walkman (remember those fuckers?) and hit play\u2026guess what we would find? If you guessed Jimmy Swaggart or T.D. Jakes you would be dead wrong. These guys found a way to secretly record everything from DMX to Black Metal onto them. We\u2019d have to snatch those up as they were contraband. There were some other albums which had explicit content but weren\u2019t marked. If you knew that to be the case, you had to take it. Three good examples were Guns N\u2019 Roses: Appetite for Destruction, and the two albums by Acid Bath known as When The Kite String Pops and Pagan Terrorism Tactics. My strategy was based on my mood. If I didn\u2019t feel like doing paperwork, I\u2019d offer to let it slide if the inmate would keep me in the loop as to what was going on in the dorm. I always had no less than three of these informants. Kept them honest and on their toes. If one ever fucked me around though, not only was there an issue but that tape would come back to haunt him. The pro would be that the music is so censored, there\u2019s not much of a way to circumvent it but the con\u2026no way for someone like me to buy a couple of rats and set up a small intel network inside the dorm.

            "answer_text": "They are all over the internet. They have social media accounts under the known, FaceBook, IG, Twitter, WhatApp, all the Video Chat sites to communicate with whom ever they choose for a relationship, pleasure etc, all dating sites everything we do with phony accounts as they can get cell phones in prison through a number of ways. Contrary to belief, most men want a cell phone to stay in touch with family not do wrong. Lifeline to the outside world. Life in prison without a cellphone is a hard, lonely stint. They want to see their wives, husbands children etc. They are not just for illicit activity trust me. They are not cheap either. Prices vary from state to state along with additional costs for earbuds and chargers then you have to pay your monthly plan just like everyone else. If not you have phone privledge provide by the state which comes at a great cost in your families phone bill and restricted times. Prisons won't ever be able to eliminate contriban or crime within prison and never have due to many factors. There's corruption within the prison and legal system and higher political arena. That is not new. On the other hand there are classes offered in prisons to help men get their lives headed down a positive road and many men do and use it for such. Men and women have achieved great standards behind prison walls using their intellect and time. I know an inmate who came from little educational background in a gang ridden environment who has served 23 years for capital murder life without parole and is extremely well spoken and well read. Very news worthy and politically inept. There are men who have used their time and discipline to learn to read and write and even become lawyers after release from prison and change the direction of their lives. There are men and women who should never see daylight again. Each state has class schedules, mentoring programs etc and rules but no freedom on the internet ofcourse. I know one man who was released from federal prison this past summer and has an IG page that is devoted to positivity and is doing really well and so is his book. P.I.M.P. Positivity Is My Purpose. Very clever by QueezytheCeo. He was sentenced to federal prison for interstate trafficking accross the state lines. 5 years I believe. He's on parole running a small multimedia company. Very positive, very devoted to changing his life. I see his page everyday speak to him often. He left the life. Ofcourse we all know of Nelson Mandella. He used all his time writing and and corresponding to political officials and became the President of South Africa after a 25 year prison sentence. I have a saying .\u201dIt\u2019s not how you serve time, it's how you let the time \u2018serve\u2019 you.\u201d ",

            "answer_text": "In Florida only the law library has very limited internet access. However if you can hack their firewall software you can get on the internet. Not that I would or have done. Also cell phones are quite common in prison and you can access the internet from them. You can pay $5. In commissary items to use someone's cellphone. Be careful doing it though CO's take cellphone use seriously and if you lose one that doesn't belong to you it will cost you alot of money or you could be beat up or even killed over it. ",
