Why did the board name out new high school, high school and educational center. What the h... kind of name is that?When someone from the central office wanted to rename my library a media center, I let it go since I knew that no one would ever call it that, but when they wanted to change my title from Librarian to Mediarian, I said things using language that one should probably not use when talking to administrators. After suggesting what they might do with their idea, I simply told them that I would meet them at the next board meeting. My facility remained a library, and I remained a Librarian. The district did at odd times refer to me as Media Director, but since I didn't have to use the term, and there was certainly no extra pay involved, it didn't bother me. ",
