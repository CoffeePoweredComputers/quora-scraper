            "answer_text": "Unknown, why ?  Because sources are conflicting, the Armenian side says one thing, the Azeri side says another thing. I\u2019m very inclined to say that both are fibbing and being truthful, but they do that interchangeably to suit their narrative. The Armenians and Azeri are using a diplomatic strategy where they sometimes want to portray them as the dominant winner to look good in the eyes of the world and then they sometimes want to look like the wimpy loser so that the international community can sympathize with their side. From what I have gotten, the Azeris were initially on the offensive capturing a few border villages even though they claim to be the victims, then the Armenians started pushing back and all of that with tons of stalemates in between.  As for who is winning ? If we count the old war and how borders look, Armenia is still winning, but from what sources are telling, Azeris have won more territory during this recent breakout than the Armenians, so in a way the Armenians won the war, but the Azeris won the battle ? Yeah\u2026 I think we will need 20 years to pass when this conflict ends to find out the real truth. ",

            "answer_text": "It\u2019s roughly equal. Azerbaijan\u2019s military is slightly larger but it is trying to wage an offense, driving the Armenians back to take control of Karabagh. The Armenian forces are smaller but they are playing defense, holding their own on their own territory, which offsets the larger size of the offense. Morale/motivation is another factor. The current Azeri attack is motivated by national pride to reclaim the territory given to them by Stalin, and to distract from the corrupt regime in Baku. The events in Belarus are worrisome to Baku. Not the most inspirational of causes to motivate troops to risk their lives. The Karabagh Armenians see it as a matter of their national survival. If the Azerbaijan offense succeeds then it will result in the extermination or \u2018ethnic cleansing\u2019 of the Armenians of Karabagh. Strong motivation to resist acts as a force multiplier. The notion that the Armenians would initiate an aggressive attack into Azerbaijani territory is absurd. The Karabagh Armenians recognize the military problems and an offense by them would make them too vulnerable. They rely on defense, not offense. ",
