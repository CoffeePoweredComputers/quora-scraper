            "answer_text": "This is something that is starting to change, due to \u201cChip \u2019n PIN\u201d technology. Prior to swipe card encoding on the black strip Credit Cards (debit cards hadn\u2019t been through of for the general public), the card had to be \u201crolled\u201d by a machine. With the card placed on the machine which had the retailer details on it in raised type, and a area for the card, and the paper voucher placed on top. The roller was pushed forward and the back and the carbons imprinted the details on the slip. The amount in words and figures entered, and the card holder signed. This was compared with the signature on the back of the card. Each shop and bank offering Credit Card payments had their own code, and \u201cfloor limits\u201d over which the transaction had to be phoned through to a clearing centre. This was time consuming and at busy periods inconvenient to everyone. Swipe technology came in with the \u201cblack strip\u201d being magnetically encoded, and run through a reader which read the black strip and sent it down a telephone line and the card cleared/declined. Once we (UK) had better telephone systems (wider band width and more better technology as a whole) these became connected to a permanent telephone link which meant more machines could be used at the same time. Finally Chip n PIN arrived on the scene, much faster, (thanks to fibre optics) and infra-red card readers and processors meaning that you did not have e to go to one particular point to swipe your card. The Chip could be read, PIN Entered, and the information sent to a processing centre which automatically cleared/refused the card. It means that the security is much better, faster and the tracing systems can pick up fraud faster. For the shop keeper, it increases their speed of delivery, and it means that every transaction is cleared and fraud picked up immediately. Indeed I was saved from a fraud as a result of this technology when I had three transactions in quick succession two of which were ATM: First an ATM in the UK, followed by an ATM transaction in Holland, and then in a very short space of time a Chip\u2019n PIN transaction at a retail operation in UK. The computer \u201ccaptured the card\u201d and the other transaction in Holland sent back as a fraud. There was no way that I could carried out those transactions in that order with such a distance in terms of mileage, and the time frame. I was contacted by the fraud operations at my bank to say that my account had been suspended and an emergency account had been set up. Every transaction for the next 18 months was monitored and anything slightly out of the ordinary was blocked and a manual referral made. The point of relating that latter part of the sequence of events, shows that through computer technology, particularly Chip \u2019n PIN and the processing speeds of computers can pick up fraud far quicker that ever before, including \u201cCapturing\u201d the card. The card swipe system was really the pilot scheme for Chip \u2019n PIN; and since it was so successful in reducing fraud, and the technology in terms of Wireless Internet facilities developed on a global basis, has meant that the level of fraud across the world has dropped. It has also speeded up transaction processing, much needed as a result of the volume of transactions. ",
