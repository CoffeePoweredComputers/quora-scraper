Assuming that the tachyonwill remain a purely hypothetical \u201cparticle.\u201d[math]^1[/math] Short answer: Nothing \u2014 No material thing can travel faster than light. Lightspeed in free space is most commonly given as c (299 792 458 m s[math]^{-1}[/math]). Here\u2019s a cut from Wikipedia article Speed of Light: According to special relativity,c is the maximum speed at which all conventional matter and hence all known forms of informationin the universecan travel. Though this speed is most commonly associated with light,it is in fact the speed at which all massless particlesand changes of the associated fieldstravel in vacuum (including electromagnetic radiationand gravitational waves).Such particles and waves travel at c regardless of the motion of the source or the inertial reference frameof the observer. In the special and general theories of relativity,c interrelates space and time,and also appears in the famous equation of mass\u2013energy equivalenceE = mc[math]^2[/math]. Footnote [math]^1 [/math]Cut from Wikipedia(bold added): A tachyon or tachyonic particle is a hypothetical particlethat always travels faster than light.Most physicists believe that faster-than-light particles cannot exist because they are not consistent with the known laws of physics.

            "answer_text": "The question should be: can anything make something go faster than light? and can we get any knowledge of anything going faster than light? We use light to report on everything - light has some unique properties. The closer anything gets to a large mass, like the center of the Milky Way, the faster it has to go to maintain orbit. Gravity keeps pulling objects faster. Only the mass of objects and the distance between them defines the pull of gravity. Thus objects (or stars) can move faster than light when pulled by gravity. ",
