            "answer_text": "Quite frankly speaking NIIT University is quite different from the other private universities you will come across. The campus life is absolutely beautiful with the lush green surroundings. The university will give you ample opportunities to showcase your talent. If you do come here, you will see in front of the auditorium the list of the faculty and you will yourself be able to determine the quality of education given here. This university will make you work till hard. Very hard. There are scholarships for students based on their academic track record. If you have a good academic scores, then rest assured you will enjoy it here. But then of course, you will have to work hard and strive to keep that scholarship going in the upcoming 3 years. Since you said you are planning to study Computer Science let me tell you this university will be a good choice. As my batch mate has already told you, Swami sir is one of the best faculties this university has. And yes parties. Well that keeps happening from time to time too. Look out for the DJ nights if you join here ! And of course, the seniors. Well rest assured you will find the best of seniors in this university. The infrastructure is pretty good and hostel life is good. And of course we have Retired Maj. Gen. AK Singh sir as our Dean of Students affair, and whatever problem you may face in this university, rest assured he will take care of it. Another plus point you will get if you do join here is that NIIT University has collaborations with UMKC. If you manage to get good grades in Undergrad, then you might get an scholarship for postgrad which you can complete at the UMKC itself.  You will of course get answers from people who will tell you not to join here because of bad track record of the university and so on which of course cannot be prevented. That again depends on person to person and according to the \"University of the future\" does have a pretty bright future. Hope to see you here. :) ",
