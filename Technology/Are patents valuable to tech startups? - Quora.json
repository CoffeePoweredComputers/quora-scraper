            "answer_text": " I get asked this question regularly. Patents can and often do attract investors. They can also serve to deter others with similar ideas. Although it can be a costly endeavor, there are some great options, such as a provisional patent application. We at LawTrades help clients navigate the maze of requirements, as well as select the route that makes the most sense - whether it\u2019s a regular utility or provisional patent, or trade secret protection. It can be daunting, no doubt, but an experienced attorney can save you lots of money and time, while helping you to add value to your company. While patents can be valuable, but they shouldn\u2019t be the lynchpin of your startup tech\u2019s business strategy. As a startup, your patent strategy is going to be considerably different than it\u2019ll be for an established company. An established company has the resources to evaluate its markets and customers. Moreover, it has existing distribution channels that startups lack. These are critical ingredients to assessing whether you should invest the enormous sums of money patent registration - and enforcement - requires. For bootstrapping tech startups, there are alternative/more cost effective routes that can provide relatively robust intellectual property (IP) protection. Confidentiality agreements and trade secret protection can work just as well as costly patent registration, especially when combined with exceptional innovation design and speed. All employees, board members and advisors should be required to sign agreements obligating them to assign all business-related IP to the company. You will also want to extend IP protection through agreements with non-employees, including vendors, outsourced designers and engineers, and testing facilities. Contrary to some conventional wisdom that holds there\u2019s deterrence value in patent registration, the reality is that large companies can - and do - often prevail in this type of litigation. Its value as a sword or shield is, therefore, debatable. With all of that said, patents can offer a tech startup many benefits. It can attract investors and deter competitors. In order to address the high costs, mounting litigation and general burdens associated with patent registration, Senators Patrick Leahy and Lamar Smith introduced a reform bill that was ultimately passed and signed into law in September 2012. The America Invents Act (AIA) is the single most important change to US Patent law in 60 years. The AIA is likely most relevant to high tech startups with potentially lucrative patents. Significantly, the law changed US patent rights from first-to-invent to first-to-file for applications filed on or after March 16, 2013. The new law also expanded the definition of \u201cprior art,\u201d which is immensely useful for first-to-file patent applicants. This law can be a game-changer for tech startups. Whether your IP assets are assets that should be protected with patent registration or with other strategies can best be determined with the assistance of an experienced IP attorney. I encourage you to check out LawTrades for further guidance on how to determine the value of your patents. Also, please feel free to contact me directly with any concerns you have about registering your patent or protecting your intellectual property. I hope that helps and good luck with the startup! -R ",

            "answer_text": "Well, different experts have different opinions on this. Some business experts have said, filing a patent is very expensive, and startups should use that money for hiring developers and business experts. On the other hand, some have stated that it is necessary for a tech startup of it is dealing with innovative technologies. You might have heard about the news like Yahoo sues Facebook, Apple sues Microsoft and more such cases. All these happened due to patient-related issues. If you have developed an innovative product and can afford it, then to prevent legal consequences and miss-use of your products, you should file patents. To understand this in a better way, let's have a look at some benefits of having patents. Preventing competitors Some of your competitors can use your tech ideas and use them to earn profits. But when you have copyright or patent, you can sue the competitors for the patented product infringement. By filing a lawsuit, you can ask for compensation and can stop their product sale. So, patents are valuable for every tech startup. Protects your work through the documentation It may be noted that patents are applicable for inventions that are innovative and new. Documentation of works is difficult to prove, and your competitors may get a patient on your previous work, but can\u2019t prove the work. If you have filed for the patent, then you have legal work. When your application is documented, it can block the patenting efforts of the competitors. Increases the valuation Filing a patent increases both the long-term and short-term valuation. This will attract more startup investors. The reason is patent proves that your product is genuine and innovative. Besides, issued patents are generally valued at USD 1 million during the acquisition. So, get in touch with IC1101 Inc to get the necessary help regarding patenting your innovative technology and get ready to grow your business. ",

            "answer_text": "Here are some facts I know about patent for a software startup: 1)It consumes money. You need to pay for the application, and pay periodically after the patent is approved. If you apply the patent in the US, your patent is only protected in the US. If you want your patent to be protected in other places, you need to apply to, e.g. Canada, Europe Patent Office, Japan Patent Office, Korean Patent Office...and that's a lot of money. 2)However, sometimes it is necessary to have a patent, otherwise your business can be demanded to stop. This can be even worse when you already start your business, and a big, richer corporation threaten to sue, or sue, you will have to pay them or pay the lawyer or stop your business and never start it again.  Patent can be a hammer and you can be crashed by rich, big corporations, and more frequently, patent trolls, who have this hammer. 3)So, it is always advised to choose wisely where to apply the patent. You need to hire a patent attorney/agent to analyze your customers and competitors and decide to which country to apply the patent. You can also figure it out yourself, but the patent law is complicated and sort of different from other law. 4)If you have a patent, it can be a very strong asset, especially when you are in the process of being acquired by a big company. Many people think that a startup is acquired because of their genius product. Not necessarily. Big companies acquire startups to suit their strategy. Sometimes they acquire because they like the design team; sometime they acquire because the startup's product helps them to tap into a new market; and sometimes they acquire because they want the patent, which is a strong asset that helps them to defend from or attack their competitors. 5)Patents' power sometimes is nothing, but sometimes is so strong that it can be detrimental. In addition, it's hard to get a patent covering software. Because the judges and examiners like patents that tell people what to do; but software always offers information, and people make the decisions based on the information. It is just the way it is. 6)And, the patent law is so different and complicated, that an entrepreneur or a developer cannot imagine or understand. That's why patent attorneys are rich and rich. ",

            "answer_text": "Short answer: Yes.  You should file for them if you are doing anything innovative and can afford it. Longer answer with relevant examples and cautionary tales: There's been a lot of patent activity by the tech giants lately. Yahoo sues Facebook. Facebook sues Yahoo. Oracle sues Google. Apple sues Google.  Apple sues Microsoft.  Microsoft sues Google. Samsung, LG, Apple, Motorola, and HTC all sue each other. Google buys Motorola patents. Microsoft buys AOL's patents. Facebook buys Microsofts patents. Then, finally, everyone sues Google again for good measure. Lather; rinse; repeat. (That \"repeat\" part is genius marketing, by the way.) There's an interesting history in Silicon Valley over the past 20 or so years where we have moved from what was essentially a Mexican standoff on patents -- where all the big tech companies focused mainly on innovation, largely comfortable with the understanding that a patent war would largely be a value-eroding exercise in mutually assured destruction -- to today's landscape where the superpowers are stockpiling patents for what is shaping up to be Silicon Valley's Cuban Missile Crisis. The difference is that buttons are already getting pushed now, and real money is flowing (mostly to attorneys) as a result. I'll end the Cold War analogies now, as no actual lives hang in the balance here. But it's Goliath vs. Goliath and should make for some good viewing. Let's leave aside the growing problem of patent trolls -- a source of great frustration and much hand-wringing within the industry. We were nibbled on by one such troll at our last company immediately following our IPO. Not fun. In fact, I believe Dante simply forgot to reference the Tenth Circle of Hell, which is now overpopulated with patent trolls and certain other lower life forms ... like contingency lawyers and people who bathe themselves in patchouli before boarding an airplane. So what does all this mean for earlier stage tech companies like ours (RingRevenue)? Well, it's complicated ... and expensive. As James Temple aptly points out in his Dot.Commentary in yesterday's San Francisco Chronicle, software patents -- unlike patents on physical devices or specialized chemistries -- can describe similar functions in substantially different ways. So the only way a company could really be sure they're not stepping on existing patents or applications would be to have their attorneys read all of them. That's fine if there were, say, a dozen or so of them. But we're closing in on nearly a million software and communications technology patents now, with tens of thousands of new ones approved every year. That could take a while. And patents typically take several years and tens of thousands of dollars to be reviewed and either approved, modified, or denied. There are arguments to be made that tightening the approval process and raising fees would reduce the \"noise\" in the patent system. But that falls into the much larger sphere of things I can neither control nor influence. So let's focus, instead, on the opportunity and trade-offs for startups. For an earlier stage company, patents have potential value in three ways: 1. Offensive: If a company has an issued patent that is believed to cover infringing actions by other companies, they may choose to use it to either generate revenue in the form of damages or as leverage in business partnership discussions. (As an unnamed successful senior executive and now friend of mine once quipped, \"We sued you, and now we're talking again. How bad is that?\") 2. Defensive: Patents that may be applicable to broad swaths of the technology landscape may (repeat: may) have the effect of discouraging other companies from leveraging their patents against you. But here, again, don't discount the influence of contingency lawyers and that insatiable siren call of their driveways for more BMWs. 3. Valuation / Deal Terms: Patents can often positively influence valuation or other deal terms for a company seeking investment or negotiating an acquisition, if the other parties involved believe there to be potential Offensive or Defensive value in the patents. So, as a revenue-driven, cash-aware, early stage tech company, do you invest the substantial time and dollars to develop a patent portfolio? The answer for our company is yes. In our case, we are developing and deploying unique and inventive (\"novel\" in USPTO parlance) technologies that are at the core of our ability to deliver value to our clients which results in positive-margin revenue for us. So, if someone were to violate an NDA with us or otherwise infringe upon our intellectual property, we could demonstrate real damages and seek remedies, injunctions, butter pranks, and all sorts of other good legal stuff. That's defensive. We also expect more entrants into the market we are defining -- specifically the value of phone calls in performance marketing -- and it's likely that some of those entrants may \"draft\" off of us to seek traction in the market. In that case, when those actions are subsequent to our established invention date and where we see strategic value in pursuing the matter, we may choose to take on the additional expense of proactively pursuing resolution there.  That's offensive.  ;-) But we're also fortunate to be well-resourced enough to pursue the development of a comprehensive and growing patent portfolio. We have the money, the innovative software development, a kick-ass engineering team that can truly work magic, and very high-quality attorneys that are probably not going to hell. But, in general, if you are an early stage software company and you believe you are doing something meaningful and innovative (and there's probably some serious corporate soul-searching required here if you don't believe that to be the case about your company), then you probably want to commit some of your scarce time and dollar resources toward starting to create your intellectual property portfolio. At a minimum, you can get provisional patent applications on file, which are less-expensive and less-detailed placeholders which -- if done well -- can preserve the earlier filing dates on some of your claims while deferring most of the cost and work for another year.  Most importantly, tempting though it may be, do not attempt to navigate the patent process without very capable and experienced legal help. Patent applications are definitely one of those areas where you get what you pay for. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, although not necessarily for the reasons you\u2019d expect. It is often assumed that startups should apply for patents for the same reasons that large companies do, but this is an incorrect assumption. Startups do not typically have the resources to enforce their issued patents against another company; a single patent infringement lawsuit typically costs around $5M and lasts approximately five years. Startups often do not even have the resources to effectively license their issued patents; a process that requires a dedicated salesperson, and sometimes even the credible threat of a lawsuit. In our experience, the three main reasons startups should file patents are: to increase valuation, to deter patent lawsuits, and to increase leverage. Increasing ValuationFiling patents can be a good method for startups to increase both short-term and long-term valuations. In the Seed and Series A stages of a startup, filing a small number of patent applications (or even simply having a plan to file) reinforces any claims to innovative technology the startup may have, in turn increasing attractiveness of the startup to early stage investors. In the later stages of a startup, owning a strategic patent portfolio (including issued patents with significant protection on the startup\u2019s valuable products or services) can be particularly attractive to a large company that wants to bolster their patent position relative to another large company. Issued patents are commonly valued at $1M during an acquisition; this is a 25X return on typical patent costs (from filing to issuance). Deterring Patent LawsuitsFiling patents can also be a good method for deterring other companies, especially competitors, from initiating patent infringement lawsuits. Other companies (particularly sprawling, multinational companies) must first convince themselves that they are not infringing any patents of an infringement lawsuit target; if they are, they may have more to lose than gain, owing to the inevitable countersuit. Because of this situation, a startup\u2019s patent portfolio may successfully discourage competitors from filing infringement lawsuits. Filing patents may also serve as a deterrent to patent trolls. Because a strategic patent portfolio is a good indicator of IP law knowledge and sophistication, patent trolls have skipped over patent-savvy startups in search of easier targets. Increasing LeverageFiling patents allows startups to increase their leverage over strategic partners. When a large company enters into a joint-development agreement with a startup, the large company is often seeking the insights and technology of the startup. Since the large company often dictates the terms of the agreement, the startup can significantly increase their leverage if\u2014before the signing of the agreement\u2014they develop a strategic patent portfolio. This portfolio becomes the \u201cbackground technology\u201d for the agreement and is commonly not shared or licensed. ",

            "answer_text": "Experience tells me that patents are extremely valuable to technology startups.  Patents effectively grant the right to exclude others from practicing a claimed invention.  Theoretically, a well drafted patent directed to a novel and non-obvious invention can grant a startup an effective monopoly.  More practically, almost all innovations are built on earlier innovations, and established companies usually have patents that cover the earlier innovations.  Accordingly, strong patents prevent larger, more established companies that are threatened by the startup's technology from wiping the startup out with patent lawsuits - the threat of a countersuit effectively allows the startup to survive.   In addition, patents are critical to the ability of a startup to raise money.  The reason for this is that even if the startup's business fails, the patents will survive.  In some cases, the investors sell the patents to companies that were more successful in the marketplace.  In other cases, the patents are used as collateral to secure last ditch bank loans - a trend that is becoming more common based on some of the calls I have been receiving.  In still other cases, the startup continues as a patent enforcement entity.  This last case has become much maligned in recent days, with companies following this path being referred to as Non-Practicing Entities (NPEs) and \"patent trolls.\"  That said, it is very doubtful that new technology companies would be able to raise money if investors could not count on patents as a fallback position for tech startups.

Patent is juts one of the many various form of protection of IP. It is not the only one, not the most valuable one and not very universal... In many cases it is actually wrong and dangerous for a startup (or anybody else) to fine for patent - remember that patent met contain a full disclosure and sometime this is exactly what you want to avoid.There is a recent decade hype about patents that came a s result of come Patent Trolls ('non practicing entities') and publicity around it. But the important thing to remember is that patent intrinsically has NO VALUE unless you can extract it. Less than 3% of all patents ever recover the cost of their filing.Another important point is about a specific industry. Nowhere, except consumer electronics field patents have value without additional work, being it a prototype, demos, lab data etc. So back to the original question the way it is formulates the answer would be \"it depends\"!

            "answer_text": "For maximum benefit of a patent, you would want to have the patent process well underway pre-product. However, at your stage for a consumer tech startup, your success or failure hinges almost entirely on execution. Even on the slim chance that your product contained high-value, patentable technology, your success or failure would *still* be determined primarily by execution whether or not you ever get around to filing a patent. In short, and to reiterate, focus on your product. I am not saying it is not worthwhile to pursue a patent, only that it is very unlikely to generate value in most cases like yours. Patents have an additional downside in that they are a giant time and money suck, both of which are in short supply at most startups. Even if you have invented a high-value technology, it is not always worth pursuing a patent. Carefully consider why you are considering the patent and the value you realistically expect to realize from a patent first. ",

            "answer_text": "  IP's beauty is in the eye of the beholder Short AnswerNo - IP is worthless in a startup's early stages. Yes - IP is priceless when a startup matures and becomes an acquisition target. Longer AnswerStartups typically do not have the time or money to protect or prosecute their IP. However, if they fail to file for former protection, they run the risk of a larger company directly knocking off their technology.  Furthermore, big dumb acquiring companies typically over-value patents and other forms of IP. If a small company has no formal protection associated with their technology, many large companies will hesitate to purchase them for fear that the small company may be (knowingly or otherwise) infringing on another third-party's IP.  In addition, unlike startups, big companies have the time and money to prosecute and protect the IP they acquire. Thus, the same IP can be relatively worthless in the hands of a fledgling startup and extremely valuable as part of a big companies IP portfolio.

Some study shows that Venture capitalist, banks, Angel investors and even family and friends are more likely to invest in in technology startups that are patent-pending. Also, owning a patent plays a significant role in ensuring that larger rivals do not steal your innovation. Without patent your innovation is at the mercy of every copycat in the business and in the end you may not get enough reward for your innovation. And if you plan to cash out early, having a patent increases the chances that your startup will get acquired. So regardless of how challenging it is to file for a patent, you should get it ,especially if your startup has an innovation. ",

These are wildly different depending on the actual invention at issue, the business goals, and the industry at large.   There is no correct yes or no answer to this question for every tech startup.
