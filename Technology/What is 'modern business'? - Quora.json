            "answer_text": "When I think of a traditional business \u2014 I think of skyscrapers, offices, and things of that such. So for me, a modern business would be a business capitalising the efficiencies of the technologies created. The internet has opened up soo many channels of potential partnerships. Companies are spreading out across the world, easily. It\u2019s now common to see Internet Startups to launch in one country, have satellite locations in others, and still be less than a couple years old. As a modern business, you need to use everything that is at your disposal to help your business. It\u2019s like that old riddle\u2014How can you connect all nine dots of this square with just 4 lines?  And the answer, is you need to think outside the box. Forget the Boundaries that previous businesses have laid down as \u201cthe right way to do it\u201d. Take for example CallBackBox I\u2019m based in the US, but I am currently in Spain. The original developer we used was in Ukraine. And I am currently using developers in Poland. My graphic design work is being done in Belarusia through a freelancer there. I had someone developed the website from the designs in India. CallBackBox is already being used in 4 Countries \u2014 US, Canada, United Kingdom, and Australia. Did I mention that we are only 8 weeks old? We\u2019re utilizing the power of the internet to launch quickly, find great people to work with, and to spread our brand. ",
