            "answer_text": "I doubt they will anytime soon. If you see how technology is progressing, it feels like all gaming is moving to mobiles. Which makes it look like it will take over handheld gaming. However, that is not the case (and at least not yet). Games on mobiles so far just became a new demographic. Its a new outlet or another way of playing. Not all gamers prefer it and want it. You still have your handheld gamers. They want the screens and buttons. So far only Nintendo is the best in this market. There are loads of popular games (Zelda) that just doesnt work on something like mobile. But the game is intended to be on the move so they dont want it on a console. Hence, handheld gaming. Since the 1960s-1970s or so and from the introduction of video games to a PC it STILL did not die. It just changed. When the consoles came, a lot thought PC gaming could die, but the ones who buy console nowadays are not always the most hardcore gamers, others buy them for the exclusives and some buy them for the simplicity (as in to avoid setting up a gaming PC) Now PC gaming still exists and better than ever, most games are on PC, you can adjust your PC to handel the best graphics and performance and buy games on a pltaform like steam. It will always be there for you on the cloud if you ever change your device. All these awesome features were not available for PC gamers back in the day. So, handheld gaming has a kind of special atmosphere if you like, it has exclusives, its loved by avid gamers and ot has real buttons snd controllers. When gaming companies start focusing on mobiles if they were to have enough power for their games, the batteries can last a good amount and possibly attach some kind of controller then you might consider handheld to be on the road to being obselete. But if history of gaming taught us anything, is that even then it just may be a failure and handheld will live on. I mean connecting a controller to a phone? The idea may sound interesting, but in practice it may not even be convenient. ",

            "answer_text": "Not for some time. Most people seem to be of the impression that mobile gaming is taking over the portable market but I think this is just a temporary shuffle in the market as a new platform finds its place. I've had a portable console since the very first grey scale GameBoy and I've played a lot of mobile games in the last 5 years, for a time, my portable consoles even took a back seat but eventually, mobile games faded back into the background again.  What I noticed as a long time pocket gamer, was that the mobile platform had enormous potential, but very few developers are using that potential. The business models that have helped the mobile scene become what it is, are now choking the market and limiting the potential for growth, the mobile gaming industry is stagnating. A lot of that is because mobile gaming feels disposable, minor distractions to fill your time that are ultimately forgettable. Where a portable game might keep you occupied for a few weeks or months, a mobile game is often deleted and forgotten within a week or two. Portable consoles are often compared to mobiles as well, but if you have any experience with portable consoles, you'd know that there's a huge difference between the games found on these two platforms, they're simply not comparable, they have a different focus and are run on an entirely different set of business models. Mobile games are a different level of complexity, they fill a different role, that's okay, different games for different reasons however this comparison leads to a huge misconception when it comes to portable consoles. People mistakenly think that mobile games are just portable games on a different device and that's simply not the case. As mobile gaming settles down into its niche, I think portable gaming will see a resurgence of popularity as formerly portable gamers put down their mobiles when the novelty wears off and take up their old consoles again and new gamers will be looking for a more fulfilling platform.
