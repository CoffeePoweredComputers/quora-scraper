            "answer_text": "It varies and the funding formulae vary from local education authority to LEA. In England, most have a \u201cpot\u201d of money to distribute which they do by calculating the value of an \u201cAge Weighted Pupil Unit\u201d. This is typically valued 1.0 at age 11 when children have moved to secondary school. It will be higher likely for older pupils whose class sizes are smaller and therefore the cost per pupil for teachers is higher. In primary, the need for additional classroom assistants for early years pupils is often recognised. Each year in January there is a \u201cForm 7 day\u201d, named after the old form provided by the DfE, which is a census of the children in school or on roll that day. Each LEA uses their local data to calculate the cash value of the AWPU and distributes the pot by applying the formula. ",
