JUST AS YALL WANT US GOING THRU THE DUSTURBING SITUATION OF BEING MONITORED. Shame on all those with years of expertise and knowledge who vague response showing no empathy whatsoever stating who the hell are we to believe or why are we being spied on. We don't have to be rich, a celebrity or someone of importance to society. There are lots and lots of evil people out there. Pervs, pedophiles, and other type of individuals who just wanna make you and your family your going nuts who have no remorse on what they do to satisfy their evil appetite. People don't necessarily have to have physical access to your device in order to \u201cnot hack your device\" but remotely monitor and receive all the data from your device(s). I have a group of individuals who have done it to more than several devices, including my part family next door via bluetooth, sniffing on wifi, AND even thru something similar to SS7. How??? Idk. I have screenshots of lots and lots of data, even voicemails from someone else calling the other someone else who somehow forwarded my phone to who knows what number AND my phone WAS ON at the time and date of the voice mails. AND every time I spoke on the phone with certain individual, after we ended the call, my phone would get stuck in a loop and had to do a carrier reset and all to connect to my carriers network. Now, they also altered, my electricity to implant some type of listening device or maybe even video surveillance. And that is with the intention to come into our property at night, enter our garage and steal. There is lots and lots of ways to remotely monitor your phone without the need of physically having access to it. Some of these individuals have mentioned certain things we have discussed in our home. Throughout the entire 24+ years that we gave lived on this home, as many many times I have stayed in here BY MYSELF, AND I DON'T BELIEVE IN GHOST AND HAV NEVER EVER EVER HEARD ANY STRANGE NOISES, SINCE UP UNTIL 2 YERAS AGO THAT I WAS ALLOWED TO LET THIS GOOD FOR NOTHING stay here. And who is super knowledgeable in the area of electronics, our radio AND some home electronics appliances interfere with RFs and make too too much distortion in radio, when before it didn't do that. They know exactly what part of the house I am all the time and play stupid childish games by making cracking popping sounds. My family did not believe me until they actually heard it one night. Ever since that one family never heard and believe me, these idiots knew and we went for weeks without noises. I would even hear some music and ppl talking and wondered where it would come from at 2 to 4 am. And one night, I put my ear on the wall where the cracking g popping noises sound at most of these time, and that's where music is coming from. U couldn't make out the voices. They play the music to mask the sound of their conversations and voices. I have lived hell without any support or help from anyone. Now I no longer care. I talk to these idiots bcuz I know their listening and they'll res6 back with a popping sound. But I tell them they are so trifling and miserable and laugh at how they have made me so important in their life to the point I have complete control of their emotions cuz I know they hate. Lol. We are like the Kardashians they look forward to hearing us every night. They are like Lady Gagas song. Paparazzi. Lol .. Sooooo, if you have not lived thru this effin shizzle, KEEP YOUR PATHETIC COMMENTS TO YOURSELF AND YOUR NOT ALLOWED TO SPEAK ABOUT IT EITHER. LIKE I SAID AT THE BEGINNING. TO THOSE WHO THE SHOE FITS, IF YOU GET ALL UP IN YER FEELINGS, JUST SHAKE IT OFF JUST AS YALL WANT US TO SHAKE IT OFF THAT SOMEONE WHO IS NOT THE GOVERNMENT, NASA, CIA, FBI, OR LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT LISTENING TO US CUZ WE AINT IMPORTANT.

            "answer_text": "Sorry, but a \u201chacker\u201d isn\u2019t going to help you in the slightest little bit. They will take your money and I hope you have plenty if you contact them. Phone monitoring applications do exist, but they have to be installed by hand - with your phone in the perpetrator\u2019s hands. This cannot be done remotely and requires jailbreaking or \u201crooting\u201d the phone. So if you haven\u2019t given your phone to someone, you are probably safe. Let\u2019s say you aren\u2019t sure if someone borrowed your phone and did this. Don\u2019t you have a lock code on your phone? No? Well, then you are open to such things happening. While a lock code isn\u2019t absolute security, it will keep someone from being able to install stuff on your phone if they just pick it up for a couple of minutes at a bar or at the office. So how do you tell if you have one of these apps installed on your phone? It is extremely difficult to be sure. Two things that will be a clue are the battery life and temperature. Did your phone suddenly get so your phone needs to be charged more often? Is your phone warm when you pick it up? Both of these indicate that something is going on with your phone that you may not be aware of. OK, what do you do? Here is the hard part. Unless you are very, very lucky, removing one of these apps is extremely difficult and time consuming. You cannot simply back up your phone, wipe it back to factory state and restore. You would be restoring the spyware app. You need to basically wipe your phone and by hand transfer everything you need back to the phone one item at a time. There are ways to do this with a backup and external storage, but none of it is easy for either iPhone or Android. No, someone cannot do this \u201cfor\u201d you remotely. The apps cannot be removed remotely and really cannot be removed at all without wiping the phone. If someone says they can fix this problem for you and only charge you $100 they are robbing you and you probably do not have a spyware app on your phone at all. ",

            "answer_text": "Somebody is tracking your mobile phone, and they have to \u2014your phone company tracks the phone all the time because if they didn\u2019t they couldn\u2019t provide a service at a sensible price. They do have a legal obligation in most countries not to misuse the data and to respect your privacy, so it isn\u2019t anything to worry about. In most cases it is only computers that know where you are and the information is used only to provide the service. It is not normally made accessible to anyone, even within the phone company. As for anyone else, it is impossible to tell if the Police or security services are tracking your phone and that\u2019s just as it should be. If people could tell then criminals would have a free alert that they were being tracked. This makes it undesirable for it to be possible to tell. If you aren\u2019t a criminal of any kind then who cares if the Police or the security services are tracking your phone? If you have a smart-phone then it may be possible for a criminal to track it in some circumstances, but these are limited and if you look after the phone and its software properly you won\u2019t be affected. In theory a smart-phone virus could track your phone and report to somebody over the internet connection. To avoid this the following should be adequate: Don\u2019t download software from sources that might not be trustworthy.Keep your phone OS as up-to-date as you can.Learn about the better known security sites and sign up to a couple of their newsletters so you are made aware if there is a problem with your model of phone.Be sensible about web sites you visit. Some porn sites and many hackers\u2019 sites are a great way to pick up a virus, spyware or a trojan. Don\u2019t go there with your phone\u2019s browser.Don\u2019t let anyone get hold of the phone\u2019s serial number, known as the IMEI number in most countries.The other issue with smart-phones is your privacy settings. Check them and if you don\u2019t understand them call the phone company\u2019s customer services and ask them to help you. In some cases anyone who has your phone number could track the phone if you haven\u2019t set your privacy settings properly. Mostly this is so you can let friends track your phone so, for example, they can invite you to join them if they are having lunch in a restaurant near your location. This is a great little service that can be an aid to your social life, but you have to learn about how to set it up properly to prevent complete strangers from tracking you. ",

            "answer_text": "I remember there was a rumour back in the day, that if your calls are monitored (or intercepted by authorities), you will hear a clicking sound when the line is connected. Obviously, this is not true, and would go against the whole point of legal interception. Here is how it works, and why you will never be able to tell if you are monitored (by authorities, anything else must be done via applications as others said before). During call setup, your call goes through 4 phases: Establishing a ling between a tower and your deviceEstablishing a link between the tower and the serverEstablishing a link between the server (the same or different, depending if you are in the same cell as the called party) and a towerEstablishing the link between the second tower and the called party\u2019s phoneStep 1 & 2, and 3 & 4 are called legs. Between step 2 & 3, the server starts searching for B party\u2019s data (in their Home Location Register, wthe adress of which can be calculated from the called number). This HLR will send back data to establish the 2nd leg and connect the call - it will also send information about stuff like call forwarding, call waiting services, and legal interception (the same happens for calling party as well). If B is marked for interception, then during the 3rd step, a third leg is created, connecting the call to the authorities as well. At this point, B party still doesn\u2019t have \u201cline\u201d, meaning they can\u2019t hear anything from the process. Additionally, hearing any sound (like the ringing tone you hear before the called party picks up) is played when the server is intructed to play it - it can be disabled completely as well, but the point is, for legal interception, this \u201cplay tone\u201d command is never sent. Also, the legal interception line is strictly one-way: there is no voice channel established to send back any data. It is virtually impossible to detect legal interception by the user, unless someone makes some error in the call setup code and accidentally opens up the voice channel or sends back some \u201cplay tone\u201d command. PS: back in the days, when there was a big \u201crace\u201d on who can connect calls faster (we are talking about milliseconds here, like in Formula 1), Huawei actually made a feature where they sent this play tone command and connected the voice channel before both sides sent the OK signal, indicating the connection has been established between the two parties. In this cases, you might have experienced that you only hear the end of the greeting from the other party (like \u201clo\u201d from \u201cHello\u201d). It\u2019s a different story, it\u2019s basically the same if your car would allow you to start the engine before turning the key all the way or pressing the pedal fully. ",

            "answer_text": "You probably can\u2019t. First thing you should realise is that you most likely aren\u2019t being watched. TV and Movies depict hacking as agents sitting in dimly lit rooms that just press a button to get access to everything and stream your phone but this is simply not true (at least we don\u2019t think it is @NSA.) Apple is famous for security of their products so watching your screen or even remotely stealing data is incredibly unlikely, i can\u2019t comment for android or other operating systems but i assume they are also very secure. Most attacks will be in the form of \u201cphishing attacks\u201d where an attacker will send you a fake email claiming to be from Apple or Google asking you to reset your password. If your on iPhone and have iCloud enabled, once an attacker has your AppleId they can easily get access to most of your phones data (photos, contacts, sms ect.) Local attacks would be coming from someone on the same network as you, programs like Wireshark can be used to see network traffic and detect anything suspicious, but assuming nobody you live with or that uses your internet connection has advanced degrees and experience in networking or software engineering and an intent, nobody will be doing this to you. So while you can\u2019t really detect attacks there are steps you can take to prevent them. Prevention of Phishing attacks Inspect any email coming from companies by clicking into the \u201cfrom\u201d field and looking around, most of the time if its a phishing attempt there will be a different email listed.Don\u2019t click into links from emails. If you get an email from Apple asking you to take actions, go to the Apple website yourself, if action really needs to be taken websites will alert you once logging in most of the time.Inspect SSL Certificates of websites you click on. Look for the green \u201cSecure\u201d icon in the left hand side of the URL bar, clicking on it shows info about the website. Secure parts of a website should also show the company name in green in the URL Bar. Getting this requires proof that the registrar is who they say they are.Inspect the URL of the page you are going to, some attackers are so bad at this they will use completely random URLs, but some are smarter and might use something like \u201capp1e.com\u201d, notice the 1 instead of the l.Just in general prevent giving out information/passwords through emails or links in emails you receive. Stay safe. ",

            "answer_text": "There are two main ways a person can monitor a phone. The first way is to intercept the signals being sent by your phone and break the encryption. If someone is doing this, you have no way of knowing. However, this method requires a significant amount of resources, so its usually only done by government agencies and other similar organizations, so the chances that a hacker not affiliated with a government or other powerful entity will use this method is minuscule. If you are concerned, you can switch your device to airplane mode, which will mean that no signals will be emitted from your phone. The second way, on the other hand, is far easier to do and requires less resources. It involves loading an application on your phone remotely that can retrieve and send whatever data they would like to get. The way to check for this is to open up your settings and see what applications are running. Don\u2019t just check what apps are downloaded because you can covertly download applications on iPhones that have been jailbroken or Android devices. If there is something running that shouldn\u2019t be (not associated with an app or the operating system), you are being monitored and should either destroy your phone or determine how that application was downloaded. The way to prevent this from happening is to keep Bluetooth off unless you trust all the devices within range, updating your phone as soon as possible, and be alert to phishing scams and/or emails that look suspicious (although they usually get filtered out to spam).

(The method I mentioned below is just for Android phone and tested on Android 6.0, not sure about IOS environment, sorry, if someone can buy me an iphoneX, I\u2019d love to figure it out:) Open Call interface:  Type in: *#*#4636#*#* and the interface will shown up like this:  Click \u201cUsage Statistics\u201d:  Aha, You can check the \u201cLast time used\u201d and \u201cUsed time\u201d of the applications, and know whether someone has access your phone. I hope this will help :) English is not my first language, if I make any mistakes, pls point out for me, appreciate!!!! ",

If it's being done illegally, there are some subtle things, but those same things can occur on a phone not being tracked. Shorter battery life, long connect times after you push the SEND key, A sudden inexplicable change in signal strength, the number of bars your phone displays. But all of those things occur normally in a network sometimes. If you're worried about hidden software on the phone, you can check storage/memory usage to see if there is anything you don't recognize. You can go online and look at your detailed bill to see if there has been an unusual increase in SMS or data usage. if your phone is behaving strangely, print out your contacts and other important information, and do a factory reset. See if the odd behavior stops. Never click \u201ca\"I accept\u201d or \u201c\"I agree\u201d to anything, unless you know what it is. Im not familiar with Android, but on Apple you can disable ALL location based services. But as I said, there is no way to tell for sure. ",

            "answer_text": "There are, unfortunately, many ways to spy on your phone. I\u2019ll go from broader to the closest to your phone: Internet data: the US gvt - and other big organization - are capable of intercepting & storing your messages. You have no direct power over them. You can circumvent their monitoring by using cryptography but you\u2019ll end up looking more suspiciousPhone Service Provider : I worked for them, they have access to the \u201cpipes\u201d carrying you data, they can see / act on what you say / message / send, you have very limited control over thatPhone Cloning : this is rather advanced and unusual hacking, but basically someone can copy your IMSI (subscriber identifier) to create a clone of your phone on the network and recieve call / SMS as if they were youPhone Tapping : I saw that once, someone with access to your phone or account can install a spy software giving access to the phone\u2019s data, location, you name it. Such app provide the thieve real time data.Direct Access : gvt officials are legally capable of asking you to hand over your device or its data unencrypted in most countries.Most of the time, you have little to no chance of detecting a data leak when it happens. If you\u2019re suspecting something here\u2019s my advice: 1. ask you service provider for a new SIM card 2. reset your phone to factory settings (which will remove any spy program if any) 3. always use 2 factor authentication on all your accounts (supported by Google, Twitter, Facebook etc.) If you can\u2019t, use different password for each apps 4. crypt your phone internal storage (easy on android, IDK on IOS) 5. even turned off, your phone can still be \u201cseen\u201d on the network. if you truely want to disapear, remove both SIM & Battery.

            "answer_text": "Ofcourse unless you are sure about each of the app in your phone. By sure I mean you know how the app work and why you have it. Apps can't hide themselves unless you give them permissions. There are some keyboard apps which keep track of your typing history and clipboards. Apps you get from friends through shareit or xender etc, are also unreliable as they have no source mentioned on them.(Only if the app doesn't belong to a big and reliable company like facebook, chrome, etc,.). Someone might also have your email and password and hence he can see everything you surfed online wether it is a google search or a video over youtube. But you can delete your history by googling \u201cgoogle activity\u201d and deleting your history. Anyways you should never use your id in others phone as phones can save passwords and emails automatically. And if you feel like someone is monitoring you, your first step should be to change your passwords for email or any other social website or app. Apps which are not so popular can not be guaranteed to be safe specially if they were downloaded from outside of PlayStore. Or apps which have friends in their name (Friendzone, FriendLocation, etc,) are also for friends to access your details like location etc,. There is also an app called TeamViewer, Assist etc for anyone to see your screens live preview. And last but not least someapps can hide themselves after one set up. But you can get such apps by going to Device Administration or Device Admin Apps or Administration - (vary based on different phones). In most devices it can be found under security tab and for others they can search one of the above terms in settings. Once inside, there are apps with administrative permissions no apps need this kind of permissions unless they are for finding phone once lost or somekind of launcher etc,. No one can track you unless you are safe at your side never download apps sent over email and if you ever feel someone is eavesdropping on your phone just change every password you have (Google, Facebook, Twitter ) that will automatically remove your email from others phones. And uninstall useless or not frequently used less known apps. N Yeah please try to upvote cuz that'll make me happy which I need a lot during this pandemic \ud83e\udd1e ",

If there is some more detailed tracking from the network, then the network may be sending signals to the phone to request actual location every few seconds and if you aren\u2019t doing much on the phone you might notice increased battery drain. If you have enabled Android or iPhone phone tracking / findmyphone etc then your phone is updating accurate location fairly regularly anyway and someone with access to your google / iPhone account would be able to see that and you wouldn\u2019t notice as it would be normal phone activity. If someone has put a tracking app on your phone that isn\u2019t all that good then you might be able to find it, or it could use too much battery ",

If it\u2019s the middle of the day and your battery is significantly low you could be a victim. Your phone can also get hot. Phone Shuts down \u2013 your phone may shut down regularly, even when the battery is charged. Background Noise \u2013 this one isn\u2019t as reliable as it could be a bad connection. If you hear background noise regularly it could be a sign. Receiving Unusual Texts \u2013 you could get random texts from weird numbers, symbols or characters. Increased data Usage \u2013 look at your data. Some spyware increases it. But the best have reduced this making it hard to detect. ",

I woke up one morning, and I couldn't believe that not only were the apps misplaced but so many ads that made my head spin. I have an excellent security package that I pay for to protect me. It was doing so for a long time. When I went to my phone icon, a large old picture of me, being blurred, was plastered on the phone. I never asked for it or even had any views there. You would think of how that could happen? Here is another problem I found. When I read messages, I find that some hacker got in there and was communicating sexual activities, and I saw pictures as well. I blocked all the numbers that I didn't recognize and report. To this day, I still get them. I am going to call my provider and the security system, which is supposed to monitor that, but it is not working. Phones today are not secured, and all these hackers find some way to get in. For fixing service, check PacificEthicalHackers.Com\u201d\u201d ((Enter on your browser. You can't keep up with the security as there are changes by hackers always. Your phone is not as safe as you think. We should go back to the old way of using landlines. ",

On 3G / 4G data through the cell operator you can often do the same. i.e. current use and next ceck in 30 minutes or so. This should give you an idea if there is something goin on there. Do switch off all apps which use data of course. Chanses are that the spying app would only be active when A LAN connection is detected. This to avoid you using all your 3G/4G data allowance and as a result, be alarmed something is not right. LAN usually is \u201call you can eat\u201d so it is safer to spy upon one there. Avoidance: install a decent firewall on your LAN (like Smoothwall express as a free download, which is believed to have no backdoor!!!) and block all traffic going in or out between LAN and WAN/Internet except the traffic you really need. It also has a data volume measuring capability so may help you to identify and shut down illegal traffic. it also can list the IP addresses in the logs of the systems trying to get access to your LAN and systems..

If there is an actual application on your mobile device, it's still may be difficult to tell. Andriod devices are notoriously open and iPhones are notoriously locked down.  One way to tell if something out of the ordinary is going on is to: route your phones connection through your computer, and turn off the cellular signal so that the phone can only connect to the Internet via the wifi of you computer. Then open a network logger like WireShark or Fiddler depending on PC or Mac. You'll see the destination of each expected piece of information sent, but this still won't prevent the data from being re-routed before reaching its destination. ",

If there is an app on the phone reporting your location and other stuff (perhaps installed without your knowledge), you may be able to find it by looking at what processes are running on your phone. If it is a law enforcement agency listening to your calls, or tracking your location, this is done in the cellular network and you cannot know whether you are being monitored. The only sure way to avoid being monitored? Simple answer to that: don\u2019t use a mobile phone at all \u2026 ever! Or even carry one on you (regardless of whether it is powered off). ",

By removing the SIM card, there's no way for the cellphone to have internet access other than WiFi). Then, in the wireless network, connect using a laptop and use the app Wireshark.
