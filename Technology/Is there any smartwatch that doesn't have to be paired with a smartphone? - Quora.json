            "answer_text": "Samsung's Gear S (the Gear S1). This is a pretty old watch now and it's discontinued\u2026 but I recall this watch functions just like a cellphone and it has a SIM card slot underneath it\u2026 The watch is super big however as you can see.   The newer version that make phonecalls is the LTE version of the Galaxy Active Watch 2.. the LTE version requires you to pay for another line on your cellphone plan and you need to buy the LTE version, not just the Bluetooth/WiFi version\u2026 here it is:    Like I said, there are 2 different versions of these smartwatches\u2026 one is the data connected LTE version which allows you to make calls (you have to pay money for a plan for it, the SIM card is embedded inside the watch and isn't removable)\u2026 the other one is the more common one which is the Bluetooth/WiFi only which cannot operare independently without a smartphone (it can make calls but it will be using your smartphone and it's connected through Bluetooth).. so if you want a watch that could make calls, you need to get the one that has the ability to connect to LTE.

            "answer_text": "The Apple Watch with LTE doesn\u2019t need a phone. But due to its tiny display you can only get a glance. You can\u2019t use an app on the watch the same way as on the phone, and you can\u2019t use an app on the phone the same way as on a computer. It\u2019s the same thing. So if you\u2019re using an app which hold much more infos than the tiny display can show it can be synced it to the phone. It\u2019s a nice feature. I can take calls, set alarm and timers, read and dictate messages, use navigation on my smartwatch without using a phone (only by using Siri). But if the messages gets bigger than the tiny display i switch to the phone in to order to read it correctly. The watch doesn\u2019t NEED the phone. I often leave my phone at home. But the larger display on the phone is just more comfy to look at in some cases. ",
