            "answer_text": "ANSWER NUMBER 1: You. Yep, you being there and engaging the child in inquiry and discovery will be now and forever, the most important piece in this puzzle. After that, I always favored open-ended materials that can be used more than just a couple of times. Often \u201ckits\u201d in toy stores are just that. Use it a couple of times and everyone\u2019s done. Look for things that are challenging but not so much that they will become discouraged. It\u2019s important at that age to allow them to have early success. Also: Keep it analog! Things with interesting parts, and well-made tools will go so much farther than a big box of cheap stuff. Get a decent (real) metal microscope with good glass lenses. Doesn\u2019t have to be professional grade, but at least school grade. LEGOs in general are great for all sorts of creative and mechanical exploration, and will help with fine motor skills, which a 6 year old will still be mastering. Later they have plenty of even more technical sets to explore. ",

            "answer_text": "Magnets are always a good place to start.  A 6 year old can have lots of fun with just a simple magnet, but there are also kits with projects that provide a bit of structure and some of the science behind magnets. A gyroscope is also a fascinating toy at that age, and demonstrates several principles of physics. My favorite at that age was Meccano, which is good but expensive.  There are lots of alternatives now.  Build-it toys help foster the imagination while helping your child learn mechanical principles.  Look for kits that can be added to, and that have plans for multiple projects, and which will help your child learn about wheels, pulleys, levers, springs and other simple machines. Eventually I moved up to science kits, chemistry sets and electronics but six is a little young to start in those.  That depends on how precocious and curious your child is though, and where their interests lie. ",

Wonderful.   By 10 my father had installed a Bunsen burner for my more advanced chemical experiments and a concrete pad in our back yard to protect the house.  I had outgrown the Gilbert sets by then and merely had my father buy me materials at a local Chemical Distributor.   Keep their interest in Science and Technology forever peaked...... All the best.
