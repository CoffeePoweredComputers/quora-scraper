            "answer_text": "As a VR enthusiast and an entrepreneur in the VR industry, I\u2019d focus my answer around how VR would impact on people\u2019s social interaction. In fact, although digital technologies (from phones, text messages, online social media, and online communities, to VR) seem like incremental: they just push folks to online interaction further and further and dilute face to face human interaction bit by bit, what\u2019s interesting about VR is that the \u2018virtual reality\u2019 can be so real that it turns humans back to simulated face-to-face, interactive, multi-channel, and real-time social interaction that has been largely flattened by digital technologies so far. And, for sure, it would also propose brand new challenges on humans\u2019 social interaction due to its uniqueness compared to simpler media.  In virtual environments, people both feel and act differently from in reality. They may act less responsible as there\u2019s the less actual impact of their behaviors. On the flip side, they may act more confident due to the same reason. They may feel mentally uncomfortable because they are not familiar with the situation. On the flip side, they may also experience positive feelings that they would probably never get in real reality. In social VR, how one user feels would impact on how she acts. And how one user acts would, in turn, influence how other users feel. There is only a fine line between a virtuous loop and a vicious one or between a virtual utopia and a dystopia, and hardware or graphics or algorithms won't necessarily be the keys to VR that positively impacts on human interaction but clever UX designs, effective management, and, most importantly, to develop VR products based on what a target market group needs and to position the product correctly. The social market can be roughly divided into acquaintance socials and stranger socials. If you are a 360 VR creator, feel free to follow and request me any 360 or/and VR relevant questions! :) ",

You are now one of those guy, connected to friends thanks to face to face interaction, mobile phone chats, website participations, etc. The more you interact with someone, the stronger your link to this person becomes and the weaker the links to others become. With VR you get yet another way to connect, et another way to disconnect. VR will reshape our social network thanks to our social interactions. How it will reshape it is up to us. ",

It will make a few enthusiasts very happy, it will get many laypeople to say \u201cwow! neat!\u201d but otherwise\u2026 Why do I say this? Because Virtual Reality has been around for more than 60 years and most people weren\u2019t even aware of it. If it\u2019s lucky, the impact will be almost as great as 3D upon gaming! You remember that, right? Yeah, me neither :( There may come a day where VR is transformational. Today is not that day. I\u2019ll be pleasantly surprised if that day comes in this century. ",
