            "answer_text": "It is not so easy to compare these two companies , which have similar past. Both Nokia and Motorola are companies which have started producing smartphones again . They were at the top of phone industry before apple and Samsung came. And both companies experienced downfall and had to be shut down. Nokia Smartphone Division was brought by a Finnish company called HMD Global in 2016 and started producing smartphones in 2017. It is relatively a new brand now different from the past one. Still they have managed to produce some good phones like Nokia 7 plus and X6. Motorola was brought by Google in 2012 and sold to Lenovo in 2016 after producing hit smartphones like the G series. They provided very fast updates and produced really user friendly phones .Things went different after Lenovo bought Motorola ( also changed name to Moto ). They primarily bought the company as Lenovo's own phone sales was bad. Lenovo started pushing their ideas, into Motorola brand name and the result was evident in phones like G4 . Since then moto phones have not been very impressive . No more fast software updates and so on. Also regarding prices , both companies charge a bit more than the competitors , mainly for the brand name they have. ",
