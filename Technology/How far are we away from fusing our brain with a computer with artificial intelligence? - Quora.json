This is hardly \u201cAI Fusion\u201d but it shows an electrical interface to the brain can be done. But there really as os 2019 no AI that is worth connecting to the brain. The current state of AI is much more limited then the general public believes. The popular media has hyped it up to the point where many people think that computers now can actual think, understand and make plans. We are centuries away from that. Today\u2019s AI is just a mindless calculating machine that can match patterns to trigger preprogrammed actions. So there is noAI that you\u2019d want to connect and there will not be anything like that for a LONG time. ",
