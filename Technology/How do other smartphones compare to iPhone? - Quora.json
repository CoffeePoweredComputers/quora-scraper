            "answer_text": "The iPhone 6 and 6 Plus feature a dual-core Apple A8 CPU (two custom-designed Cyclone cores @ 1.3 GHz), 1 GB RAM and a PowerVR GX64xx GPU. Let the synthetic benchmarks do the talking then (data sourced from Gsmarena.com): Geekbench 3 tests CPU and memory performance:   (Bear in mind that the toppers above have quad-core CPUs and hence will post better scores in synthetic multithreading operations). Basemark OS II gives an overall device score based on CPU, graphics, system performance, memory, web, among others:   GFX 2.7 T-Rex (off-screen, 1080p,) shows that the new iPhone's PowerVR GX6450 GPU is a real beast, handling heavy graphics with ease:    GFX 3.0 Manhattan (off-screen, 1080p):   Mozilla Kraken 1.1 is a web browser test:   BrowserMark 2.1 (compound web browser test) :   What does all of this mean? The upgraded dual-core Cyclone processor seems to be handling things way better than expected providing similar performance as a quad-core Krait 400 CPU (found in Android flagships). The new GPU is better in every way against the current crop of flagships. The new iPhone 6 Plus is a flagship device in every way - beating everything the competition has to offer to date.

            "answer_text": "Hi there! To be honest Samsung phones are quite successful compared to Apple\u2019s iPhone. Samsung is catching up with Apple\u2019s iPhones (chipset wise too!). With the new Exynos 9820 just released and looking at the benchmark scores, it\u2019s multi core performance is up to Apple\u2019s A12 chip, but a bit low on single core. Samsung phones are almost as successful as Apple\u2019s iPhones, that is just talking about their phones. ",
