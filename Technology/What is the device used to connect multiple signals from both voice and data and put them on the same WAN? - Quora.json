            "answer_text": "To add to Rick Noonan\u2019s great answer\u2026 Modern WANs are packetised, and use various link-layer protocols (Ethernet, etc) to transmit data. Voice is packet switched (eg SIP), compared to circuit switched (eg ISDN) in the past. This means voice is just another packet, no different to web browsing, etc. Hence it travels across the same WAN. In the past, voice would often use a separate WAN link, an ISDN2 or ISDN30 link to your voice service provider. ",

            "answer_text": "What you describe is a Router. Routers were invented for this purpose, bring different information, from different networks, together onto a common set of connected networks. Some LAN switches contain routing functions, and some routers contain LAN switching functions, so the definitions can become blurry sometimes. WAN\u2019s or Wide Area Networks, are typically connected by routers, or sometimes switches that contain routing functions/features. ",
