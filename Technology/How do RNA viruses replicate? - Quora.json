            "answer_text": "According to the Baltimore classification, there are 4 classes of RNA viruses, which are dsRNA virus (double-stranded RNA genome), +ssRNA virus (single-stranded RNA genome. Here plus means the RNA has the same sense with mRNA), -ssRNA virus (single-stranded, but its RNA is complementary to mRNA) and retrovirus. Viruses within each class generally have similar replication strategies. Apart from retroviruses, all RNA viruses replicate via RNA replication, with the help of an enzyme called \u201cRdRp\u201d (RNA dependent RNA polymerase). For this reason, most virologists don't consider retroviruses as RNA viruses. +ssRNA virus +ssRNA viruses generally have a non-segmented, single-stranded RNA as the genome. Because their genome have the same sense with mRNA, they can serve as mRNA for translation. Actually these viruses never carry any enzymes within. Instead they head straight toward the endoplasmic reticulum upon cell entry, where the viral RNA is translated into a single long polyprotein. The polyprotein is then processed by the host and viral proteases, into individual functional viral proteins. The viral replication enzymes including an RdRp assemble into a replication complex. The endoplasmic reticulum invaginates around them, forming a vesicle called \u201cmembranous web\u201d where RNA replication takes place. A negative sensed RNA intermediate is synthesized using the plus strand as the template, which in turn yields many more positive sensed RNA. Newly synthesized viral +ssRNA either serve as mRNA to direct the synthesis of many more viral proteins, or be packaged into viral progenies as genetic materials. The newly assembled viruses exit the host cell through exocytosis (HCV, Dengue and Zika) or cell lysis (polio).  HCV life cycle.

Image credit Rewiring cellular networks by members of the Flaviviridae family  Video: HCV replication -ssRNA virus -ssRNA viruses have a single-stranded, negative sense RNA genome, which is either segmented (influenza) or non-segmented (measles). Because their RNA are complementary to the mRNA, they cannot be translated directly, but instead serve as templates for mRNA synthesis. So these viruses need to carry their RdRp within. Another difference is that unlike +ssRNA viruses whose genome are naked RNA, the genome of -ssRNA viruses are encapsidated with viral proteins, forming a long RNA-protein complex known as the nucleocapsid. As a result, the viral RdRp only replicates encapsidated RNA but not naked ones, which is unusual among polymerases. Here I take rabies virus, which is a non-segmented -ssRNA virus (also known as mononegavirales) for example, because non-segmented -ssRNA viruses have very similar genome architecture and replication cycle. Rabies has a linear, modular genome which encodes 5 genes: N (nucleoprotein), P (phospoprotein), M (matrix protein), G (envelope glycoprotein) and L (large protein or RdRp). When rabies virus enters a cell, it undergoes uncoating, releasing the viral nucleocapsid into the cytoplasm. The RdRp, or L proteins, sequentially transcribe each gene following the order N-P-M-G-L, into individual mRNA, which give rise to individual viral proteins. Because the RdRp can detach anytime it finishes the transcription, while it must reinitiate the transcription from the uppermost, the genes at the upstream are more frequently transcribed than downstream. As a result, the concentration of viral proteins follows the gradient N>P>M>G>L, which is desirable for the virus, because it clearly needs more N proteins than L proteins. When sufficient amount of N protein is synthesized, the viral RdRp switches to a replication mode. This time, a full-length, positive sensed RNA is synthesized, which is immediately encapsidated by the viral proteins. The antigenome does not undergo translation, but serves as a template for synthesis of negative sensed viral genomes (remember, only encapsidated RNA can serve as templates). The newly synthesized viral nucleocapsids together with viral envelope glycoproteins assemble into virions, and exit the host cells via budding.  Nucleocapsid of rabies virus  Rabies virus life cycle. Image credit Rabies  Transcription and replication of rabies. Notice that the antigenome is also encapsidated, and never hybridize with genomic RNA to form dsRNA dsRNA virus dsRNA viruses have a segmented, double-stranded RNA genome. Like -ssRNA, dsRNA can\u2019t be translated either, so these viruses also carry their own RdRp. When they enter the host cell, their outer capsid is stripped off, while their inner capsid never dissociates, so the dsRNA genome never goes out of the capsid. The RNA replication actually takes place inside the capsid. The RdRp use the dsRNA as templates to synthesize mRNA, which are exported into the cytoplasm for translation. The newly synthesized viral proteins and mRNA assemble to form new viral particles, and the viral mRNA are converted back into dsRNA inside the capsids. The inner capsids then acquire new outer capsids, and exit the host cells via cell lysis.  Reovirus life cycle. Image credit Structural insights into the coupling of virion assembly and rotavirus replication Retrovirus Like +ssRNA viruses, retroviruses also contain single-stranded, positive sensed RNA genome, which can also serve as mRNA for translation. However, the genomic RNA never undergo translation upon host cell entry, but instead serve as templates for reverse transcription. Hence these viruses also carry their replication enzymes\u2014reverse transcriptases and integrases. The retroviral genome entails three essential genes: gag, pol and env, while more complex viruses (e.g., HIV) encode additional accessory genes. Retroviruses enter the cells through membrane fusion, which releases the viral capsid into the cytoplasm. The capsid contains viral RNA as well as replication enzymes. Like dsRNA viruses, the viral capsid doesn't disintegrate immediately, but serves as the shelter for viral reverse transcription, which converts the viral RNA into a double-stranded DNA. When the reverse transcription is done, the viral capsid docks onto the nuclear pore and breaks apart, releasing the viral DNA and integrases into the cell nucleus (some viruses like murine leukemia virus (MLV) can\u2019t cross the nuclear envelope and must access the chromosomes during cell division). The viral DNA is then incorporated into the host cell chromosome by the viral integrases. The integrated viral DNA (aka \u201cproviruses\u201d) can be transcribed like cellular genes, giving rise to full-length and spliced half-length mRNA. The half-length mRNA are translated into the envelope glycoproteins (env), while the full-length mRNA are either translated into gag and gag-pol polyproteins, or packaged into the budding viral particles as genomic RNA. Like +ssRNA viruses, the gag and pol polyproteins need to be processed by viral proteases, into functional structural proteins and replication enzymes, respectively. However, the proteolytic process (aka \u201cmaturation\u201d) occurs after the viruses leave the host cells, unlike +ssRNA viruses which process their viral proteins before release.  Retrovirus life cycle. Image credit Studies of endogenous retroviruses reveal a continuing evolutionary saga Although the replication strategies of RNA viruses appear quite diverse, there\u2019s one thing in common: they must conceal their replication activities from the host cells. Human cells are not without defense. Instead they can sense the viral infections via their unique molecular patterns, like traces left in the \u201ccrime scene\u201d. For example, dsRNA is the signature of RNA replication. Because the host cells don\u2019t undergo any RNA replication activities, the presence of dsRNA is a huge \u201cred flag\u201d. To conceal their vulnerable parts, +ssRNA viruses form the membranous web at the host ER membrane, thereby evading the host sensors in the cytoplasm. -ssRNA viruses replicate in the cytoplasm, hence their genomic RNA are encapsidated, which prevents the RNA hybridization in the first place. For dsRNA viruses, the viral capsid is never fully uncoated, but serves as a cover of their dsRNA genome. Likewise, the retroviral capsid is the cover of the RNA-DNA hybrid intermediates of reverse transcription. So you can see that viral life cycle is like a never-ending game of cat-and-mouse, which is what makes virology so interesting. ",

            "answer_text": "we'll be talking about the replication of RNA viruses from the classification of the viruses. We understand that RNA viruses could be either single-stranded or double stranded . w talking about the replication process and the assembly process of single stranded RNA viruses inside the single stranded classification of RNA viruses. There could be positive since RNA viruses or negative sense RNA viruses a positive fames RNA virus and negative sense. RNA virus use different strategy to replicate inside the cell and to assemble inside the cell. The first step of the viral entry is attachment of the viral particle to a cellular receptor which is displayed on the membrane surface now. The virus get adsorbed on this receptor then the second step is penetration, if the virus is enveloped there is no problem the angle of fuses with the membrane but if the virus is not enveloped it can also undergo receptor mediated endocytosis shown like here and inside the endosome the virus particles especially the viral capsids where the matrix protein all these things get disassembled because of the altered pH and the viral RNA gets out into the cytosol. Now the enveloped virus such as HIV and influenza virus they has ease of the axis because they have enveloped and it quickly fuse with the membrane and that's allow the membrane entry very easily nan in where the viruses has a little bit difficulty but they also get inside by receptor mediated endocytosis.
