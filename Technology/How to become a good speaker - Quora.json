            "answer_text": "This is my opinion and it has helped me improve quite a bit, although I wouldn\u2019t be calling myself an orator. To become a good speaker one must have a lot of confidence, in himself, his content and his ability to express. A genuine smile has a charming effect, looking into the audience while you speak, making a few eye contacts and not shying away has an effect. Never gaze in a single direction, look around, because when you look at them, you make them feel involved in your words. Your accent doesn\u2019t matter, but your tone does. That is the single most important thing while speaking, you must know when to be soft, when to be stern and when to be jovial. But how do you develop these skills? Being an introvert, I always shy away from social interactions and never join any discussion voluntarily, not unless its critical or I\u2019m compelled to. But this is what I do, and I hope it can help you. First thing you do is, isolate yourself and practice in front of a mirror. Being shy means that you\u2019re only free to express your views to yourself. But you do that only by thinking to yourself, If you are to stand in front of the mirror and face yourself, you would be shy to speak up even then. So all you have to do is get rid of the shyness when you face yourself in the mirror. Doing that isn\u2019t so easy either. In the beginning you have to force yourself to be overly dramatic, try enacting a movie scene that you like, it doesn\u2019t matter how miserable you are, because it\u2019s only you. Being overly dramatic doesn\u2019t help you become a good speaker, but it does help you to get over the fear of being under-confident and also helps in learning to be more expressive. And you must learn to look yourself in the eye when you practice, not look away, that is when you learn to maintain eye contact with others around you, and once when you have gotten over these stages with good practice, all you have remaining is the matter, the topic that you are going to speak about. It doesn\u2019t matter if it is public speaking or a general conversation in a group, you\u2019re only as confident as the amount of knowledge that you have, unless there is a licence to be creative, then the practice in front of the mirror and some thought is enough to suffice. But, a well informed person with good knowledge in what he is about to speak can naturally deliver better. But there are instances where people who know nothing about the matter speak well, charmingly and convincingly, that is a good trait to have, to be able to misdirect is fine up to a certain extent but giving misinformation is not a trait of a good speaker however eloquent he may be. But to be well informed and not able to express isn\u2019t a good trait either. So if you continue to work on your confidence, charm and knowledge you will develop yourself to become a good speaker.

            "answer_text": "There are two ways. The first is to learn all the separate elements that make up a good speaker - voice projection, fluency, standing confidently, hands in control, well prepared material etc etc. and then gets lots - and lots - of practice in groups like Toastmasters, with constant feedback on your performance to hone your skills. You'll end up skilled and proficient. The other way? To find your inner core of confidence and speak from there. That doesn't mean you don't ever get scared - ALL great performers get scared. Stephen Fry, Sinead Cusack, Sir Laurence Olivier, Barbra Streisand, Julia Roberts, Sir Ian Holm ... EVERYONE gets nervous. But that very energy links into something deep inside, and they speak from that place. When you do that, you don't have to learn what to do with your hands and legs, and body and voice and all the rest - it happens automatically because of where you are speaking and acting from. And - coming from that place - it's far more powerful than any accumulation of behaviours and individual skills.  So, how to do that? Well, first of all get in touch with what you're like when you're at your best. How do you feel when you're at your most joyful? How do you feel when you're happy in the company of good friends? Get to learn your physiology, feeling and whole sense of being at those times, so that it becomes a state that you can return to at will.  What else do you do? You breathe. Feel petrified? Breathe. Get worried about mistakes? Breathe. Get ready to speak? BIG breath. As you breathe, you keep alive, you keep moving, and you prevent yourself turning into a robot. Breathing helps you to think clearly. Breathing connects to the creative part of you. And it connects you to all the other living breathing beings in the room. Now look around and see how many speakers - even established ones - look and sound like robots. Boring aren't they? So stay alive, allow your fear to be, and realise that when you speak from your heart, from the core of you,  even in your vulnerability, you are far more powerful and influential than any super-trained, super-prepared robot will ever be. By the way, you don't need a public speaking opportunity to start working on your ability. Use every encounter with another human being as a chance to connect. Lots more to say, but that's a start ... ",
