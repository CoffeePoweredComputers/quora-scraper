            "answer_text": "You can learn how to develop your polar function, some types easier than others. But you will always have the tendency to fall back to what is natural to you. I always use the example of the left and right hand. Assuming you are a right master hand, and you train your left for years. Sure you can use your left anytime easily, but given the chance, you would use your right. Your ability to use your left comes in handy when it is needed. The same goes for Sensing and Intuition. Me as an ENTP, use Extraverted Intuition, Ne as my main function. My polar function is Introverted Sensing, which is about routine, details and memorising. I hate all those 3 traits and i can\u2019t stand being in those situations. I need to be in a constantly changing environment. However, i can train myself to be able to put up with routine, and the smaller details. I do that by focusing on what is the greater goal and my reason for focusing on the details. This gives me the push and motivation to do something that i dislike. So if in a situation where this trait needs to be used, i can do it, which might cause others to mistake me for a sensor. ",
