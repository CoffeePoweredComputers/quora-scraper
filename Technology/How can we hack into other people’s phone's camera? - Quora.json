Unless you are a spy and are being chased by a government then there is nothing you have to worry about, Apple is constantly monitoring what the hackers are doing and they immediately update our defenses when a new attack is detected, so that we stay safe. There is no such thing as an active virus on iPhone, so there is nothing to worry about. Apple expends a great deal of effort to make its operating systems (macOS, iOS, iPadOS, watchOS, tvOS, audioOS, etc.) secure, safe and private by implementing defenses in many layers of its core OS, which includes but is not limited to: XProtectYaraGatekeeperSystem Integrity Protection (SIP)Malware Removal Tool (MRT)Core SuggestionsIncompatible Kernel Extensions (KEXT Exclusions)Application Firewall (cannot be disabled)pf Firewall (BSD firewall, optional)Chinese Word List (SCIM)Core LSKD (kdrl)Camera or microphone access requires user consent prompt (macOS Mojave onward)Notarization (macOS Catalina onward)System Extensions (replacing kernel extensions) (macOS Catalina onward)System files are stored in a separate read-only partition (macOS Catalina onward)Endpoint Security framework (macOS Catalina onward)Gatekeeper enhanced with random validation checks (macOS Catalina onward)Gatekeeper now requires a User Prompt and approval for changes (anti-ransomeware protection) (macOS Catalina onward)Camera access, microphone access, screen recording or keyboard input monitoring requires user consent prompt (macOS Catalina onward)Moving or reading files in the Trash (by an app) require user consentFlask Security Architecture for flexible mandatory access control",

            "answer_text": "Of course it is possible for a hacker to hack into someones phone and access the camera. There is a technique called spying, which comes under Remote Accessing/Administration Tools (RAT), which can be used do to the same. Using a RAT , hackers infect a users phone and install a tool which can gain full access to the users phone which is probably hidden and cant be seen unless directly to the user. When the RAT gets installed the hacker gets the admin rights to access the phone and can do whatever he wishes for, sending texts, making calls, altering data, spying on user using phone camera,etc. ",

There is lot of Remote access Tools or torzon which enable you to control others device remotely. For this you have to access that device once and install RAT in that particular device. After that you can control that device or spying remotely. But remember this an highly sensitive and illegal act and there is punishment for this. You can be arrested and get few years punishment with hard labor. If you are interested in hacking you can learn it and work as ethical hacker. An ethical hacker hack others pc, laptop or android phone with user ascent for good reason. Big companies and organisation appoint hacker for their security. You can get good job with handsome package in this field. ",

But again I would suggest that if you are doing it with anyone then do it in an ethical way or to be straight ethical hacking giving the person some knowledge about what you are doing or else you will be prosecuted or arrested for breaching into privacy of peoples personal life. Now these are done by RATs like AndroRATs which are malwares created using Metasploit Framework and are sandwiched or decompiled with any Trusted apks to keep it hidden. So once it gets installed in someones mobile then you can listen to the device and compromise it whenever the payload is activated. This way you can access almost anything in the phone once you compromise the Root permision and you can even access camera. So thats the entire story Again Please follow ethical hacking and dont try to breach into anyones private life as you might end up being prosecuted or jailed. ",

Sure the pilot light goes on, but in most cases it is already one, if you are charging it or have unread notifications. There was even an interesting fad last year when new phones came with a sliding front camera like the Xiaomi mi9 or Redmi. Users started to notice that the front camera slid out for no apparent reason and thought it was a phone soft or hardware issue, warranty repairs found a ton of apps that when installed got access to a camera and caused it to slide out and take pictures.
