            "answer_text": "The short answer is no, but there's more to it. For some Apple Watch owners, their Watch is a status symbol. These people are either extreme Apple fans who will buy anything with the Apple logo on it, or people who know the popularity of Apple products and wear an Apple Watch to express importance or dominance over others in a passive manor. For the rest, it ranges from a cool gadget to a life-saving accessory. On one end of the spectrum you have spoiled kids who had a parent buy it for them to look cool around their peers (tying into the status symbol element) all the way up to people with medical conditions who can literally have their lives saved by the data recorded by their Apple Watch. (That sounds crazy, but it's actually happened. If I can find a link to one of those stories, or if anyone can comment with it if they know it, I'll gladly add it here) The Apple Watch is a luxury Watch, a tool for quickly accessing what's on your phone, and a fitness tool; different users place a different importance on all three, but it is designed to appeal to very different groups of people. Of course, for the majority of Apple Watch users it is simply a convenience tool that makes staying connected easier and is cool to have. People who get a lot of notifications constantly can have a lot of their time saved by having an Apple Watch, so they can just glance at their wrist instead of checking their phone every time, and sometimes it isn't appropriate to glance at your phone but you can glance at your Watch easily. So to answer your question, the Apple Watch is not necessary for most people. It is definitely not required (unless you work for Apple and want to make yourself look better to your superiors, I suppose) but is a convenient tool that serves many purposes for many different kinds of users. If you can't think of a reason to own one, you're probably not the target market and will be fine without one. Side note: I used to own an Apple Watch Sport for a month in April 2016. I really liked it, but ended up returning it right before the return period elapsed because it wasn't worth the $350 I paid for it and I'm not wealthy enough to spend that kind of money on a convenience item like that. (There were other factors as well, such as seeing a young relative have his parent get him one just for pleading that he wanted one, and seeing how he looked when using it\u2026 and a metal allergy which started to show up near the end of that month I had mine for. But dang, did that thing look nice on my wrist! (and it is really convenient for driving when you don't have a CarPlay console or other navigation system in your car apart from mounting your phone to the dash)  Photo: me and my old Apple Watch Sport, April 2016 ",

            "answer_text": "For this has been quite a debatable question which has been argued since the launch of Apple Watch as I observed.To answer this question, I would say give half a \u2018No\u2019 to it. Just wanted to justify your question a bit as it had became too subjective to me. Into the topic, just to give out a idea that nothing in the world is literally \u2018necessary\u2019 (except those to keep you living) to our lives. Your phone is not necessary for you to live, your internet connection is not necessary for you to live. As an Apple Watch user myself, I just started to use it about a few months ago, my live had been still peaceful before that, also for now. After owning one of these, I haven\u2019t observed any significant changes to my live bought by my Apple Watch, other than wearing another fancy gadgets near my wrist. I mainly used my Apple Watch to get the latest notifications, having a glance on the weather, and to start up a workout without my phone. It has made me developed into a habit that I just wear on my Apple Watch when ever I goes out of my house (not suggesting to wearing it within home as it\u2019s batteries really flies!). For now I am into a situation that Apple Watch has moderately blended into my daily routines but not into a stage which I can\u2019t live without it. Wanted to keep this short and going to conclude here: Apple Watch isn\u2019t necessary before using it; but can be so called making users\u2018addictive\u2019 into fancy features hence blending Apple watch into our daily lives. So, just want to advice that just don\u2019t buy it if you aren\u2019t into regular workouts (as Apple put lots of efforts into this side), or wanted a fancy experiences without your phone but still connected to the world (the internet I mean). Just a short text on my very own opinions based on my experiences, and to share my thoughts. P.S. Apple Watch really uses lots batteries literally\u2026 ",
