            "answer_text": "I am a 10th grade student. I have been a tech-enthusiast cum a coding geek since the past couple of years and I had been searching for an online coding platform which is not only wholesome but nevertheless, provides me with a holistic approach in my learning process. Though I found several websites hosting coding content, their daily performance on the basis of the way they make the children learn, unfortunately, didn't meet up to my satisfaction. I then came across WhiteHat Jr.: Live Online Coding for Kids , a 1:1, online coding platform for kids. WhiteHat Jr stood beyond my expectation from the day 1 itself. They host such comprehensive and lucid contents on AI, Machine Learning, Robotics, Deep Learning, etc. for the children between 6-14, that every learner would not only learn efficiently but also enjoy the entire process. Moreover, the most interesting thing is that the learners here get a chance to apply the knowledge they have gained in various trailblazing projects, which would ultimately give them a knack over that skill in the future. They give the learners the opportunity to think and analyse the logic behind a certain code and what changes need to be made to that code so that they achieve a particular result. Needless to worry, they conduct a 1:1 interactive session between the student and the tutor, so that the student never finds himself lost with doubts within a bunch of batchmates. They follow a very dynamic and well-structured curriculum which is set as per the levels of the students belonging to different age groups. The thing to be really appreciated of them is that they promise to hire only top 99.9 percentile of the certified teachers, which was also one of my deciding factors to undertake this course. WhiteHat Jr has been a huge blessing for me. The knowledge I have gained from these recent classes have been immensely put forth in my recent projects. These courses for various levels are available at a reasonable price, still, if you feel to be a bit sceptical about that, you might try out their trail demo classes through the link: WhiteHat Junior. I feel that their services truly possess the best value for learning. Had this course been available when I was a kid, I would have never ever missed this opportunity at any cost. ",
