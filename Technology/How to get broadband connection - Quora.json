            "answer_text": "Depending on where you live you should find out what the various ISPs will support and how you define \u201cbroadband\u201d. Years ago broadband meant anything over 1 megabit/sec. Today it can mean anything from 10 to over 100 megabits/sec. So check with your various ISP and see which one provide the speeds you think you need. A side note: I was at a persons house last week helping them with some network problems. This person mostly just surfs the web, does email, and watches streaming video like Netflix. Normally a data rate of about 10 megabits/sec is all this person would ever need but I tested hers and found out it was 120 megabits/sec. ..way more than 10 times what she needed. This was a separate account and not and institutional connection. Lesson to take from this: only get what you need and don\u2019t pay the extra $$ for rates you will never use. ",

            "answer_text": "Dear sir, To get BSNL Broadband connection on local copper cable, go to the nearest Customer service center or telephone exchange and give an application in the prescribed format along with address proof for identity card like Aadhaar card. If your locality is feasible, they will ask you to pay the deposit and make arrangements to provide the connection. In case, if you are not able to go to the BSNL office, contact the JTO or SDE concerned of your area over phone and tell your address and contact number. They will send a person along with the application form and in turn he will do the needful. If you want a BSNL FTTH connection, you can follow the above procedure or book the request \u2018ON LINE\u2019 as per the video in the following link. Remaining things will be taken care of by BSNL. http://youtu.be/vuap1XXQaaQ For BB from private operators contact their local dealer / agent. Thank you very much ",
