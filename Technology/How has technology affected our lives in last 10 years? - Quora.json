Contacting to friends, family members in seconds. We can book travel tickets immediately in need.10 years before, we were not harmed with the rays coming from smartphones. Our health was better because we go to airport to book tickets, we go to railway station to book tickets, we work hard to go meet our family members and friends and this is because we are more on sitting and working that results in decreasing the body stamina. We have better building these days and less plants whereas, before 10 years we had much better atmosphere.  No doubt the technology is making our life easier but their is always a pros and a  cons from every technical improvement. ",

            "answer_text": "If you are to consider a factor and analyze it, you would really have a positive phase on a side, and negative phase on the other. Likewise the \"Technology\".- Positive side is that it has made the human life simple, at the same time it makes us to be idle (negative, indeed). Certainly, most of the people would come up with the opinion of equalizing both the constructive and adverse effects on technology.  Technology improves, but why does poverty remains the same?Technology has impacted large in a person's life, but what is the status of the relationship that you would really want?Life is made simple, but still aren't we balancing our lives correctly????? Remains to be a question utmost. ",
