            "answer_text": "Redmi note 9 pro isn't for gamers. Just am using the same phone with 6gb 128 varient.. Is phone good as day to day life.. Good battery life up to 2 day with continue using Good processer snapdragon 720g but Yaa in box this phone providing you 18w fast charger it take one an half hour to charge full battery Only one problem i've facing in this phone is camera. Camera isn't good suddenly stopped working. Auto focus not working.. Sometimes it takes a lot of time to capture a picture with normal camera. And this problem can be done by after a xiomai update And for gamers who only buy this phone for gaming note my point. If you will buy 4gb 64 varient damn sure your phone will lack while you're playing game. Design this phone is so good and I realized it little bit looks from samsung devices like front camera in the middle back side 4 camera set up with square box is actually looks like a samsung device.. And one more thing everyone says in display fringer print locker is futuristic but from my opinion side mouted fingerprint is too fast as compare than in display This phone is decent good Apsculity you can buy I hope you got my information.
