            "answer_text": "I think Sony was a victim of its own success. The Walkman was created when Chairman Morita decided he wanted a portable music player that could handle up to 90 minutes of music \u2014 long enough for Beethoven\u2019s 9th, which is a Xmas classic in Japan. It was a ridiculous order. Nothing Sony had done previously had prepared them for a leap like that. But Morita was a god, and so armies of engineers went \u2014 mumbling \u2014 to figure out how to satisfy the insane demand. The rest is legend. Now jump ahead two decades. The brand name alone is worth a 20\u201330% premium. That\u2019s great for the bottom line, but it also means the company can\u2019t afford to fail. A high-profile disaster would cost far more in lost brand value that out-of-pocket costs. To stay ahead of the innovation curve, Sony demanded the next generation of a particular product be halfway done at same time the current version is launched. That\u2019s a great way to come up with a steady stream of new products, but it ensures each is a tiny improvement on its predecessor, rather than the giant leap of faith the Walkman represented. Engineers, who had once been almighty, were now cogs in an R&D machine. They were outnumbered by accountants and market researchers and procurement people, all of whom ensured that the company never strayed too far from home. As Apple began to wow the world, Sony satisfied itself with making poorly designed copies of whatever Apple turned out. They still had the brand name, and the distribution, to be reasonably successful selling what were essentially knock-offs. They stopped making their own panel displays, simply tacking their brand and a 30% premium to screens made by other companies. Like all ventures that live by eating their seed corn, eventually they run out of reputation. At one point \u201cIt\u2019s a Sony\u201d was a powerful statement of superiority. By the early 2000\u2019s it begged the question \u201cSo what?\u201d Samsung was young and hungry and willing to take giant leaps, like the Sony of old. Plus it was cheaper. I think sometimes they\u2019re guilty of launching tech before it\u2019s ready \u2014 like the folding-screen phone. But while I usually wait for the 2nd generation of anything Samsung, I do respect their ability to keep pushing the envelope, while Sony seems content to remain folded up neatly inside. I suspect, however, that Samsung will go through the same decay stage as Sony did. They\u2019re certainly under pressure from lower-cost Chinese brands in the phone business, as well as from LG at home. Arguably it\u2019s harder to remain an innovator than it is to become one in the first place. ",

            "answer_text": "Sony is still around and they make money doing other things like make cameras for smartphones (the phone you're using probably has a Sony IMX camera sensor), make films (TV shows and movies like the older Spiderman movies), create professional audio/video equipment, professional filming cameras, and they still make TVs but they only focus on mid to higher end TVs and they're not selling cheap TVs like they used to. But Samsung has far surpassed Sony as a household electronics brand. Sony used to create TVs and music players like boombox players and CD players or Walkman (FM tape player) which made them a recognizable name brand.. and Sony was like Samsung and Panasonic was like LG in terms of name recognition and popularity. I don't think they really did refrigerators and washing machines but they should have expanded beyond small electronics.. Samsung is a behemoth and they make a wide range of products.. and Samsung kept pushing further for higher quality and they invested more in research and development.. so that's why we started to see more and more innovation from Samsung.. their Samsung Galaxy smartphones, flat screen TVs, smart refrigerators, washer & dryers, etc. At my house, we have a Samsung washer and dryer.. and a Samsung fridge.. the quality and technology is much better than the brands that we've used before and they work very well. Samsung invested A LOT early on with AMOLED screens (I don't think they invented OLED but they liked it and invested early on).. now they own pretty much almost half or more of the OLED market while LG owns the rest. So you can see, Samsung just keeps pushing itself further.. they are not scared to take risks and continue to innovate while Sony played it safe just staying where they are. Sony was the only brand that could have defeated Apple and Samsung as they had the head start.. but they didn't invest enough early on and this is where they are today. Sony is not a dead company however, they still make TVs but they don't sell a lot and they actually focus on making higher end TVs instead of a bunch of budget TVs. I myself am looking into getting a Sony TV instead of Samsung (I had a bad experience with a Samsung TV, the capacitor blew out). Sony and Panasonic still make excellent products.. I trust their brand more than Samsung to be honest, despite Samsung being more popular. Japan made products seems to last forever.. I don't every think I saw a Sony product break down or fail.. I think the Japanese make some of the longest lasting products. I feel like Samsung is now outsourcing some of their work for TVs and I don't think they make budget Tvs anymore (they recently announced they are no longer producing LCD, so someone else will make their LCD screens). But like I mentioned, I still think Sony or Panasonic brands may last longer than Samsung (at least their TVs).. the budget Samsung TV I had broke down and the capacitor blew out.. So next time I'm considering getting a Sony TV and I want to be guaranteed the product lasts for many decades, not just a few years. So in my opinion, Japanese made is still better.. but the technology behind Korea's technology is better (their OLED screens for example), and Samsung and LG has a variety of great products other than TVs or smartphones\u2026 but if I had to pick between a Sony, Samsung, and LG, I'm considering a Sony.
