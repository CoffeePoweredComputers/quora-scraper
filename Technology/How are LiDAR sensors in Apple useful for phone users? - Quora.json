            "answer_text": "The job of Lidar sensor which stands for (Light Detection and Ranging) is to 'map' the area surrounding it by measuring distances of objects via reflecting light rays. It is present on the iphone 12 pro & iphone 12 pro max because the manufacturer claims that this sensor will enhance the autofocusing capabilities of the iphone 12 pro & 12 pro max and will make it 6 times faster in low light as compared to normal camera and will enhance the overall low-light photography of the smartphone. So it can be helpful for phone users to take better shots in night with the rear facing camera. I hope it helps. Thank you, peace \u270c\ufe0f. ",
