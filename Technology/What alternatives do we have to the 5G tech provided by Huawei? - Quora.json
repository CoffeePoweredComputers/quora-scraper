            "answer_text": "The US, the schoolyard bully that is overstepping the mark by threatening and bullying Leaders across Europe, including the UK, to drop Huawei from it's 5G infrastructure rollout has effectively demonised Huawei and is, quite openly, trying to put the company out of business as part of it's mature and very grown up \u2018China, BAD' policy. \u201cThere are three main suppliers of 5G networks: Huawei, Ericsson & Nokia.Samsung & ZTE are tier 2 and then a lot of niche players.\u201d My Thanks to Rupert Baines for this information. Now, one has to consider the providers of the 5G infrastructure, Huawei, Nokia and Ericsson in a new light! According to the US, and with no logical reason, no evidence at all, just lies and propaganda, Huawei is not safe for US \u2018allies' to use because of American security concerns. They claim that Huawei will pass on information from it's 5G networks globally, to the Chinese Government and, by extension, the Chinese Communist Party. Don't forget that this is without any sort of evidence to back up their lies and vicious, false propaganda. The US continues to spy on it's own population, and has been caught spying on some of it's \u2018allies\u2019 in Europe. Or is that former allies? This appears to leave only two options for 5G infrastructure equipment, certainly in the UK and Europe, Nokia and Ericsson. The US has not came out and said who their \u2018preferred\u2019 infrastructure provider would be, at least, not in public! But one should consider this, is the US government \u2018steering\u2019 it's \u2018allies?\u2019 towards these companies? If this is truly the case, then countries should consider giving them a wide berth! If Nokia and Ericsson are said to be OK in the eyes of the US government, that should be enough of a reason to avoid them like the plague! My basis for this conclusion? It's the same basis as the US is using. The only difference being that I'm not a devious and lying government led by a narcissistic egotistical evil dictator. My rationale is simple, if the US government is offering two choices, A or B, then I pick J, as far as possible from the choices offered by a corrupt dictatorship! Nuff Said! ",

            "answer_text": "This will be very difficult to answer without an overwhelming use of Ceteris Paribus. I will only be partially responsive to get some forward momentum, I hope. Rural deployments have different problems then highly Urbanized deployments. If one looks at the SEPs (standard-essential patents), no one owns everything, or nearly everything;  The architecture & infrastructure for 5G is multi-dimensional. As I write this, not finalized. Bits & pieces of 5G are being initially deployed. That doesn\u2019t exclude other participants\u2026yet. Cisco (w/ Rakuten) is trying to get attention w/ a different architecture that would off set some assumptions (monolithic infrastructure vs a highly tailorable virtual network application environment) that have been made up to this point by Huawei & others (marketed by Cisco as Network Function Virtualization or, NFV). The challenge for the \u201cwe\u201d you refer to is that \u2018our\u2019 major service providers are in an existential battle to capture 1st mover primacy in 5G. Unlike the USA, China\u2019s mixed economy has both Capitalism & State Capitalism. The latter is what Huawei is based upon. Which has allowed Huawei to invest ~$12bn in 2017- nearly 3x Ericsson\u2019s $4.1bn. So that R&D funding for Huawei is designed to push the ante up on, or push out, the smaller providers like Ericsson & Nokia (which are traditional rural solution providers). Last year, I recall reading that Huawei spent ~$800mn in 5G R&D alone. ",
