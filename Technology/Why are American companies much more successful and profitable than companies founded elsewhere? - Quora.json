            "answer_text": "Technically in terms of success this isn't true- 7/10 of the top 10 companies in the world right now, are not American. They are foreign utility monopolies. Our most successful companies in the US are also utilities and finance. There are few exceptions to that, which I will explain below. America does lead in terms of innovation however. No other country invests as much in R&D as we do. Though I think there are now a few Asian countries getting ready to surpass us. We still have the most developed venture capital industry. All countries run at least a few years behind us in innovation so the resulting pattern is companies start here, then those trends spread outward. But I guess that depends on what you refer to as innovation vs success. You asked specifically about success. I think most our innovation isn't really what I would call \u201csuccessful innovation\u201d. Most of it lacks any bigger vision in the world. That appears to be the caveat. For example, there was huge flux of tech startups doing on demand meals. That arrive unprepped, cost 2x more then what the average consumer would pay at a restaurant. On the surface, that may look successful. But not when approx 75% of our population still lives paycheck to paycheck, and cannot even afford an increase in grocery budgets. Those companies won't be able to grow, nor will they be sustainable long term. The most successful company in the world is ironically Walmart (also known as as Walmart de M\u00e9xico y Centroam\u00e9rica in Mexico and Central America, as Asda in the United Kingdom, as Seiyu in Japan, and as Best Price in India), which is more representative of the average US lifestyle, a reality Silicon Valley is completely out of touch with. Same thing with Amazon (not located in Silicon Valley). I also don't consider Apple (3rd most successful?) to be very representative of the Valley culture either, Steve Jobs was very much the odd ball out there as an artist. ",

            "answer_text": "Tl; dr; The Federal Government wants a few large entities that can fund the electoral system. The US fields 20 of the world\u2019s 50 largest companies by revenue, but the likes of General Motors and Ford often post some of the biggest corporate losses, and in GM\u2019s case have to bailed out by a Federal Government that wants to see the company survive as is. Neither are larger or more profitable than their international rivals: VW, Toyota, BMW, Honda, ... so in the automotive sector there's no advantage. Though I\u2019ll give you the US medical / health sector is almost always extremely profitable, but they do get to charge 5 times the global average for drugs and treatments, largely down to a rigged market that prevents the end user shopping around, or collectively negotiating a better price for the regulated/restricted/monopoly supplied goods and services they offer, entirely due to Federal Government interference. The US oil companies are no more / less profitable than their UK, Dutch, French, Chinese, Saudi, Russian, \u2026 competitors. Boeing is comparable to EADS Airbus, HSBC is larger than Chase, \u2026 So I guess the deciding factor is the degree to which the US Federal Government can / wants to lend money to, provide tax relief schemes for, offer overpriced contracts to, or rig the market in favour of the local mega corporations, to achieve a dominant position at home and / or abroad. All in exchange for a few billion in campaign donations. ",
