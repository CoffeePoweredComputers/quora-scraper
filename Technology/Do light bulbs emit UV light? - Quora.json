            "answer_text": "When you said regular light bulbs I would take it as CFL lamps or fluorescent tube lights here. All Fluorescent tube lights or CFL lamps with cool-white Color temperature(visible light source Color output) is in spectrum of 6500k as per chromaticity diagram(hence Tungsten/GLS bulbs are ruled out here as they emit Warm while/yellowish light spectrum in range of 2700k-3000k). This spectrum overlaps with UV light spectrum as well, so light sources from 6000k and above(slightly bluish white) does emit some amount of UV light, which is invincible to human eye anyway. To avoid this, Color temp needs to be brought down to 5700K (keeping +_300K tolerance) by changing composition of flouroscence, which is practically difficult in Fluorescent or CFL light source due to their design technology with phosphor composition as flourescence component converting blue light in visible white light. However adjusting phosphor composition in LED is relatively flexible to change the Color temp of light. So yes, UV is present in (most of!) these two kind of light sources, but note that it is also present in LED light sources if they are designed with Color temp 6000k & above. Now talking about infrared light, IR is also invisible light spectrum to human eye, however it isn\u2019t pertaining to Color of light source. It is more of heat quotient in light. So when you are under any artificial light source like GLS/tungsten bulb or cfl, you experience warmth in it. It also interferes with signals of electronic equipment. The reason being, these light sources emit IR in the direction of light spectrum itself. LED also emits IR, but since it is not in the same direction of light, you don\u2019t experience warmth in it\u2019s light. Light is emitted from front surface of LED chip and heat is emitted from the back side of it and usually driven into heat dissipation mechanism. I hope this helps! ",

            "answer_text": "In general the answer is no. The potential for UV emission varies with the technology. Ordinary incandescent bulbs - the kind with a glowing filament - no way. There\u2019s little enough emission from those in the blue region of the visible spectrum, and essentially none at all at the UV wavelengths. Similarly, LED bulbs (which use \u201cwhite\u201d LEDs - these are actually blue LEDs with a yellow phosphor coating over the LED itself) don\u2019t emit any UV to speak of. Fluorescent tubes have the potential for UV emission, but standard white fluorescents are designed to emit very little. The common fluorescent tube is actually an example of a mercury vapor gas-discharge tube, and the mercury vapor emits short wavelength UV when excited. But this UV emission is converted to visible light by the phosphor coating on the inner surface of the glass tube, and relatively little of the UV makes it through to the outside (and this can be further reduced by adding UV-opaque materials to the tube). But the \u201cblacklight\u201d tubes you may be familiar with are simply fluorescent tubes designed to emit certain wavelengths of UV light (for consumer \u201cblacklights,\u201d the much less harmful long-wavelength UV) and lack the phosphor layer that would otherwise convert the UV to visible \u201cwhite\u201d light.

Most light bulbs are full spectrum light bulbs and the amount of ultraviolet that they emit won't give you a sunburn and they won't be tremendously harmful. Other light bulbs. Like my two type c 3 ft long bulbs with an electronic ballast. Are so darned powerful that if you aren't wearing ultraviolet sunglasses and fully covered you'll get the worst case of sun burn you've ever had within a minute. And it can make you permanently blind. That screw in blacklight bulb emits a lot of ultraviolet. The big moogle based bulb that's in the overhead Street lamps which is predominantly halide. They emit a lot of ultraviolet light. A photographer's son gun. He is a wonderful tool to take a picture with it cranks Out full spectrum light which includes a crapload of ultraviolet light. If the light bulb doesn't explode on you. And you shine it on somebody for 2 minutes. Decided that you were shining it on will be bright red by the next day. ",

There is also reality, givent that we are bombaarded with UV for 12 hours every day. So, there is a \u201cbackground emission\u201d of UV that humans have adapted to. Then there is the absolute above zero measurement. Next is the question. \u201cdo light bulbs emit harmful uv rays\u201d. But then there are these bulbs that definitely emit UV rays.  [Imaage : Tody I found Out [1] ] But the question asks \u201cis it harmful\u201d, and for that I would have to defer to a skin dematoligist, and I am not one of those specialists. I just know about \u201clight bulbs\u201d. This is another variation of the UV emitter.  It is a tube-light that emits UV. (Above). The spectrum of an ordinary \u201clight bulb\u201d looks like this.  This is the spectral distribution of a \u201cTungsten-Halogen\u201d Light bulb. Tthe UV range is between a certaain range of AAngestroms.  But, the problem is that not everybody is harmed by UV light when it hits them. So, there is disagreement on how much is too much. So, an \u201cIndex scale\u201d was developed. Ultraviolet index - Wikipedia But, this is a scale of emission of UV as it hits earth. Footnotes[1] Why Black Lights Make Things Glow",

            "answer_text": "Many off light bulb do Emit fair amount of UV and other non visible spectrum. I actually had used some of high power CFL light as way to expose some of cyanotype print after I noticed amount of UV light it was emitting. So, yes, lot of light bulb do emit UV, especially if you are talking about traditional incandescent light bulb which emit fair amount of energy as either UV or infrared. As I stated, fluorescent do emit UV as well, but it is really depend on your light bulb to light bulb. For above those, if you are just looking for some visual effect, you can get black light version of those light bulb. But if you are looking for UV source for some practical applications i.e killing germ type of things, you should get dedicated UV lamp. Edit: I respectfully disagree with some of answer. LED and Incandescent light both emit UV light. Halogen light bulb for example are significant source of UV light. LED depend on how it emit light (highly depend on their design) do also emit fair amount of UV. Some of inexpensive LED model do use UV emitter hitting phosphors layer material to emit visible spectrum light is one of such type of LED that has UV leakage. ",

You can barely notice the light difference except very close to the bulb, much closer than you would normally get indoors.Incandescent bulbs mostly emit in the green, yellow and red. The amount of UV is negligible.LEDs and fluorescent bulbs use a similar method to produce white light. They actually produce blue light which is then absorbed by a phosphor and re-emitted at lower wavelengths allowing some of the blue light to pass through unaffected. I\u2019ve looked at the spectrum of LEDs and there is no UV. Fluorescent bulbs do use mercury vapor and this has some small amount of emission in the UV but it also passes through a phosphor to produce white light. The amount of UV is also negligible.There are many more important things to worry about than UV from artificial light! ",

They don\u2019t get very hot and therefore emit little infra-red. LED light bulbs create blue light, which is then spread to other colours by phosphors. They will therefore create little UV or IR.

Fluorescents (standard tube OR compact type) - emit tons of UV but then the coating converts it to visible. Areas where the coating have worn out will emit some UV but tend to be small areas. The coating itself will not tend to emit UV. \u201cblack light\u201d and \u201ctanning bed\u201d bulbs however have little or no coating and emit almost ALL UV. They won\u2019t emit much infrared, and what they emit is due to their temperature. LED bulbs generally emit ZERO UV at all, but they will have some infrared radiation from their base area where the power conversion electronics are at but none from the LED itself (LEDs themselves).

How much makes it through the glass is a matter of the glass. In any case, the UV is only a small part. Gas discharge lamps mostly first emit lots of UV which then is converted into visible light in a fluorescent layer on the inside of the glass. For LEDs it is a matter which semiconductors are used.
