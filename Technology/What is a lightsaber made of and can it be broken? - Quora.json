            "answer_text": "Some say the blade of the saber is made of plasma contained by an electromagnetic field. The blade could be broken by a few materials: Cortosis:Cortosis ore was a very rare, brittle, fibrous material whose conductive properties caused lightsabers to temporarily short out upon contact. This effect made cortosis a useful material for anti-lightsaber melee weapons, though with repeated strikes, a lightsaber could still cut through it. Cortosis, due to its energy resistant properties, was also resistant to blaster fire Source: Wookieepedia Cortosis was used by the Empire to build armor for shadowtroopers, cover up the walls of the Imperial Palace, strengthen starfighters and many more. In the games covering the Old Republic Era Cortosis was portrayed as having effects similar to Mandalorian Iron. ",

            "answer_text": "Lightsabers consists of a plasma blade that is emitted from the hilt and powered by a kyber crystal. The plasma blade cannot be \u201cbroken\u201d in the same way that a solid blade can be snapped in two, although this energy beam can be interrupted or deflected by some rare (fictional) materials. Since the temperature of plasma is in excess of several thousand degrees Celsius, putting your hand around a lightsaber blade would result in you receiving the nickname \u201cStumpy\u201d. ",
