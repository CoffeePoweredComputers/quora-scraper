            "answer_text": "Anti-satellite weapons (ASAT) are space weapon designed to incapacitate or destroy satellites for strategic military purposes. Several nations possess operational ASAT systems. Although no ASAT system has yet been utilised in warfare, a few nations have shot down their own satellites to demonstrate their ASAT capabilities. Only the United States, Russia, China, and India have demonstrated this capability successfully. Indian scientists successfully conducted Mission Shakti shooting down a live satellite target in the low earth orbit (LEO). Low earth orbit refers to an altitude up to 2,000 km. A satellite in the LEO can monitor activities on the ground and water surfaces. Such a satellite can be used for espionage and pose a serious threat to the country\u2019s security in the instances of an anti-satellite missile, the one that was fired by the scientists of the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO), can target an LEO satellite. The missile can incapacitate or completely destroy the satellite in the LEO range. Explaining why Mission Shakti was so special, two reasons: 1. India is only the 4th country to acquire such a specialised and modern capability, and 2. The entire effort is indigenous. Till now, only the US, Russia and China had the capability to hit a live target in space. India had been working on developing A-SAT missile capabilities for nearly a decade. Former DRDO director Dr VK Saraswat had in 2010 said that India possessed \u201call the building blocks necessary\u201d to integrate an anti-satellite weapon to neutralise hostile satellites in low earth and polar remort support will change entire defence sector. It will open scope for private firms like(Tata advanced systems and reliance defence industry) to do more research and development in this field. ",

            "answer_text": "The difference is, the Way of looking towards India by the World. Now world will look India as more powerful country and any country of this world will think twice before bullying the India. Aliens are allowed to bull the India. Anti Satellite Missile (ASAT) means POWER. I will explain, why Power is necessary ? Power is a necessary evil to survive in this hard world. Past is evident that this World only understands the language of Power. America dropped Atom Bomb on citizens of Japan and Japan could not retaliate. In War of India and Pakistan 1971, US threatened and sent an Aircraft Carrier towards India. I think that all above must not happen against India in future. That's why India is making Intercontinental Ballistic Missiles, Atom Bomb, Anti Satellite Missile (ASAT) etc. Along with it, India is also making Satellites, Rockets, Super Computers etc for peaceful usage. Some countries made thousand of nuclear weapons and used those and they want others not to do so? Such mentality cannot work forever. Every country has right to protect itself from Bullying and the only way to stop bullying is POWER. ",
