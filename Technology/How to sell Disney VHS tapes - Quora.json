            "answer_text": "Some people have had success selling them on eBay; but keep in mind the time involved in creating a listing, photography, fulfillment/shipping, not to mention eBay fees. There are a few out of print titles never released to DVD/streaming that may fetch a few dollars, especially some of their non-theatrical content. Also, do you have an established eBay account with good feedback? Do you have the skill to create attractive photos/listings? In general, used mass-market VHS movies (anything widely sold in the 90s) are worth an average of $1 at Goodwill and thrift stores, and most have stopped taking VHS altogether. Older, select titles unavailable on newer formats may sell for more. However, keep a critical eye on completed/sold listings that show outrageous prices. Did a new seller with zero feedback and a single crappy photo really sell a Snow White VHS (a movie ON DVD) to a buyer for $800 in one bid? A buyer that placed exactly one bid on 75 other auctions and won none? When the same VHS version of that movie routinely sells for $1\u20132 in other completed listings? Get real. This is some kind of money laundering. ",

            "answer_text": "Garage sale. I recommend 25 to 50 cents each. Unless they are original box, unopened and unwatched collectors items, in which case I\u2019d check ebay. But if you broke the clear plastic wrap on the original box and ran it through a player its not a collection piece. Its trash or super cheap in a garage sale. ",
