            "answer_text": "Science is that boundaryless knowledge that never stops growing and never stops amazing us. Best part of science is that people dig into it just for the sake of knowing more. Majority of scientific stuff has nothing to do with humans or human life. Technology is something that grows out of science and it is more human centric. It always has to do with us. Scientists started studying the behaviour of small clusters of molecules of differnt compounds and elements and found that their physical and chemical behavioutr very different to the same element or compound in normal situations. The procedures to create and manipulate these small clusters became to be known as nanotechnology. The nano technologists started finding out ways how this newly found knowledge can help human. The art of making devices and systems to benefit the mankind is engineering. Well, we have linked up science. technology and engineering well. How do we link up economics? Economy and Production It is a known fact that economy is the financial well being of a country or a geographical location. Some metrics of a well to do country or city could be the turnover in the markets of the country or city. The turnover in economy is called the velocity of money. It shows how many times money changes hands. It is well known that every time money changes hands there is either a loss or gain and since humans will not transact to lose money it is usually gain. Now to transact humans need to produce something that can be sold for money. This production essentially means taking something available as it is, then adding value to it by working on it. So you can collect natural rubber and cotton and produce tennis balls. You will of course pay for the natural rubber and cotton to the person who grows and produces those two commodities. After the tennis ball maker \u2018works\u2019 on the two commodities the tennis ball is produed. Obviously the price of tennis ball is more than the cost of rubber and cotton. The excess value is the tennis ball makers gain. Let us assume country A has 100 tennis ball makers who make 1000 tennis balls a year. And if each tennis ball earns $1, the tennis ball maker earns $1000 a year. And the country as a whole earns $100,000. Consider country B, where tennis ball makers are smarter, they make 1200 balls a year. That country earns $120,000 a year. What that means is that Country B is not only smarter, they are richer too. Question Why is country B richer? Because the peopl;e who manufacture tennis balls in country B are smarter. Why do they make more tennis balls? Because they have smarter ball making machines. Who is responsible for increasing the productivity? The engineer. So that is how the engineer and his antecedents the technologist and the scientist help in improving the economy of the region. ",

            "answer_text": "The 4 topics are all interlinked. Let me not explain each term but rather illustrate how they are all interlinked. Lets start with Economics.Lets go back in time to 1950\u2019s when radios were all the rage. Radio was fun and engaging. They were popular. Advertisers poured money and it was a good business. Then, however, people wanted more. Imagine watching that sports game rather than hearing the commentary. This idea seemed big.ScienceSo now people wanted to see the match in addition to hearing about it. Enter science. The tech behind television is based on solid principles of physics. How light behaves, how photons behave when scattered across a medium and so on. This is where your plain jane research scientists worked together to come up innovative techniques to harness the power of physics into something which can be used by engineers for building the fabled TV.EngineeringSo now the science guys have established theories and come out with some cool new technology. The engineers now work on that to bring it to life. This involves applying the theory of light and related knowledge to build something practical. This involves building the CRT tube, adding speakers and so on.TechnologySo now the initial TV is built and is working. The next task is agreeing on a broadcast standard, adding useful features like maybe picture adjustment, way of tuning channels and so on. This is where the technology aspect comes in.EconomicsOnce the TV is built..it needs to be manufactured in large numbers, marketed and actually make it available to end users for purchase.This is where economics and market plays a role. Manufacturers started flooding the markets with TV\u2019s, advertising about it and so on.Eventually it became mainstream.This flow shows how all the above terms are linked in real life. PS: And yes, video killed the radio star! ;) ",
