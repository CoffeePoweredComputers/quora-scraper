            "answer_text": "The answer depends on why they are trying to demonstrate their knowledge.A neglected child would be reticent or rebellious, seeking validation of competency stems from something a bit different. Going along with it depends on how you feel. If you like watching people play into a role that you've set for them it could be entertaining. Find a topic they are uncomfortable about discussing and then set them up to fill the role of being the \"expert\" by talking about it in front of them and asking questions. Make them squirm the more they share. It doesn't have to be one or the other, you could do a bit of both and maybe they'll pick up on what an acceptable level of \"sharing\" is. ",

            "answer_text": "Interesting question. The answer depends on several things.  What is your relationship with this person? Will they care about your different view of the topic? It the other person doesn't know you have their interest at heart they are likely to not care or they may even react negatively to your offering your observation about their behavior.  Maybe you can bring up your observation of this behavior when they aren't doing it to see if they are even aware of doing it.  Reading the book, \"How to Win Friends and Influence People,\" by Dale Carnegie may help you know a way to respond to this person. It might also help the other person see the situation and respond in a way that is more beneficial. ",
