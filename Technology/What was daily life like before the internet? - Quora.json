            "answer_text": "Snail mail, post office, and library. If you wanted to know something, you turned to your dictionary or the encyclopedia, and you visited the library.  Many folks owned encyclopedias and had a set in their homes.  Current news came via printed newspapers, television news broadcasts, and magazines.  We learned about other cultures and lifestyles by reading books and magazines. We played a lot of cards and board games.  Kids played games outside, played in the creeks, played in the streets, rode bikes, swam in city pools and lakes. You bought everything locally or via mail, from a catalog.  Your bills came to you in the regular mail, you wrote a check or bought a money order, and sent the payment via mail.   We saved box tops and proofs of purchase from food labels and sent them in for toys and prizes.  Folks saved S&H Green Stamps and other stamps and redeemed them for prizes.  The mailbox was a busy, busy thing back in the day. At tax time you had to go to the post office or library to get the forms you needed.  Then part way through calculating your taxes, you realized you needed a supporting form, so you'd drive to the PO or library again.  And again.  Until you finally had all the forms filled out and you sent them in by mail. To get an airplane ticket you called the travel agency.  They could book your hotels, too, and reserve a rental car.  Nobody else could do that; nobody else knew the right phone numbers to call or had all the schedules and super top secret information necessary to book a trip. Favorite TV shows, such as \"The Wizard of Oz\" aired once a year.  You planned around that, and were careful not to schedule anything else for that night.  The kids got home, hurried through homework and an early dinner, took baths and got into their pajamas, and then everyone gathered around the TV.  When the show was over, the kids were ready for bed. This was before cable and VHS recorders, when there was only a broadcast signal.  We went up on the roof and fiddled with the antenna when reception was poor.  We got three or four channels: ABC, CBS, NBC, and PBS. All your recipes came from a cookbook and women's magazines, and the newspaper.  Music was on vinyl and came from the record store. Sales people came door to door a lot more. They sold cleaning supplies, makeup, food storage containers, vacuum cleaners, encyclopedias... Everything happened more slowly. People interacted more.  Our worlds were much smaller. ",

            "answer_text": "As kids, we got a lot more physical excercise, but mostly because we were soul-crushingly bored. We would do just about anything for a few moments of entertainment. Some of it was really dangerous, and those of us who lived have great stories to tell of running away from vicious dogs, climbing tall trees and having spectacular bike wrecks with colorful injuries ro be retold-of for decades. Those introverts among us might tell you about the hundreds of books they read. You know- on paper? Of course, these stories are great, but to be honest about the experience, we were just trying to stay ahead of that dreadful boredom. If your best friend moved to the next town over, you never saw that kid again. You might write each other a few letters, before one or the other of you lost interest and moved on. If you had a quirky personality or interests, and nobody else in your physical circle did, that meant you were weird, so you tried to keep it to yourself. If you needed to find your way to a place, someone would give you directions. People varied in how good they were at this. My dad used to like to send people to his country place with the instruction to \u201cturn right at the Pinto Horse.\u201d People would invariably drive around, looking for the restaurant, tavern or bar they assumed he meant. Eventually, they noticed the actual horse standing directly at the turn- at the corner of the fence. It was always there, for years- it never moved! Kids don\u2019t understand these stories, at all. They can\u2019t get their minds around it- why didn\u2019t you text your friend who moved? Or find them on Facebook? Couldn\u2019t you find answers in Google? How were people confused about the horse, didn\u2019t they have gps? Seeing their utter incomprehension really makes a girl feel old! ",

            "answer_text": "You went to a library (private, public, university) to research any topic for a submitted written paper.Imagine the topic for an American student was \"The Life and Culture of Iran\"Pros: You usually found books written by someone who had dedicated a large part of their studies to the subject. This means the source of information was often very complete (Note: not the same as accurate) accompanied by an index which you could peruse to find chapters of interest or chapters that were not relevant to the topic, but which expanded your horizons anyways. You might find a six-volume work on the subject.You found articles written by Pulitzer winning journalists in periodicals.You found periodicals you did not know existed, covering very constrained subject areas in-depth, like Journal of International Relations and Foreign Policy - who would've imagined?You were forced to absorb, organize, and make sense of information by actively applying your cognitive process, rather than passively skimming massive amounts of random quotes that may or may not have matched a few keywords you typed in, bespattered with distracting, flashing links about some Hollywood starlet whose pants fell off at a restaurant.Cons: All you had were books written mostly by American or English speaking authors whose knowledge of the subject was likely gained more at a desk rather than on the road.Books in libraries are often outdated. You were further out of luck if you were a student from a financially underfunded inner city with a majority non-white population.Most of the periodical articles about Iran would have been heavily influenced by a single event: the hostage crisis of 1979.You would have written a paper consisting mostly of filler, gotten some grammatical corrections from someone who could care less about Life and Culture in Iran, maybe gotten an A- or B, and gone through most of your young adult life convinced that this was an area of specialty that you were qualified to discuss at dinner parties.Update to this answer with the relative xkcd imagery:  ",

We did not own a television & relied on the library & traveling & experiences for our entertainment & to broaden our knowledge. Fast forward 25 years & our children are out of the house (college then law school & grad school) so I decided to go back to school to finish my undergrad degree.   Imagine my shock when I showed up to take my entrance exams w/several sharpened #2 pencils & found my exams were going to be done on a computer (which I had no idea how to use!).  The poor proctor had to deal w/my continual raised hand asking how to unclick an answer I changed my mind about or clicked by mistake.  He got irritated w/me very quickly! So I finally got registered for some classes.  One I was really excited about was a writing class.  I went into the designated classroom, but thought I must be in the wrong room. This room was full of computers; surely it was a computer lab room.  When I asked, I was assured I was in the correct room.  Uh Oh! I sat down in front of a computer (no where else to sit; computers covered all surfaces) & the instructor came in & explained about how all our research would be done on-line (No Dewey decimal system or card catalogues?!) & that we would work in groups & correspond by email. Everything was to be done on the computer.  So time to get started! I had to ask the young fellow next to me how to turn on the computer! He looked at me & asked, \"Are you Amish?\"  We do have Amish in our area, but I wasn't dressed in traditional Amish gear. After he turned on my computer & helped me w/a few remedial tasks like how (after explaining what a mouse was) to move the mouse & click it he said, \"You are NOT going to be in my group.\"  I realized I had to take computer classes before I could take the writing class.  I took the first basic computer course FOUR times (for some reason I could do the tasks while following the instructor in class but at home I was AFRAID of the computer).  I was afraid the instructor would think I was stalking her & my husband told me to show the computer who was in charge--\"kick it in the balls\" (by taking out the battery). Needless to say, I've had to learn a lot coming from the \" Amish\" perspective to being fully functional on the Internet & computer--too much so that my husband now is assigning me researching things on the Internet!

            "answer_text": "Life before the Internet was much like it is today and it was only slightly more difficult to carry on with whatever you were doing than today. Frankly, if the Internet were to go poof tomorrow, there would be a brief hiccup in your daily routine and we'd adapt.  Obviously having a global communication infrastructure makes life eaiser. Looking up information required a trip to the library or cracking your years old encyclopedia. You'd keep in touch with friends and family using a telephone (much better sound quality, by the way) or writing a letter and putting it into the mail.  You'd shop at the store and you were generally limited to what you had locally. Many people did shop via catalogs, but it was more difficult than hitting a web site. Of course, it was also harder to find out how good or bad a product was and finding a good local restaurant particularly in a new city was hard. You'd have to *gasp*, talk to someone. When you went on vacation, you were out of touch and no one expected you to have your phone with you on the beach, at the museum, or hiking a trail. You were out of touch. If you were said you were going to be somewhere at a certain time, you often were because it was inconvenient to find a pay-phone, dig up a quarter, and call to say you were running late.   Your world was often smaller. You could really only interact with people that you could reach out and touch regularly. Rather than have phone calls, you might go spend a week-end near friends and relatives to visit with them. But you often didn't have the opportunity to meet people from around the world like you do now. ",

Life was different: knowledge was much more difficult to obtain, looking up words or facts in old encyclopedias was worthless. Mailing a letter was a legitimate form of communication. Also I memorized every friends phone number, compared to now where I struggle to recall even my significant other's number. When playing PC games, I learned a bit about networking and LANs as the only way we could play multiplayer was to connect the PC's with this really weird serial connection. I don't think Ethernet really existed back then. I will also touch on the early emergence of the Internet: dial up.I still cringe thinking about it. It was totally normal to wait 10-20 seconds for a poor quality picture to download. Websites looked pathetically unprofessional compared to today's sites. AOL was actually relevant, not just something your inept grandparents refuse to change.  In some ways life was better, you connect in person with your peers. There was no such thing as cyberbullying. News happened slowly. Sex wasn't such a pervasive thing. But now I can get advice from a person I've never met, on the other side of the planet, in a few minutes by posting a question on a really well made website. I can look up and learn virtually any skill or service, instantly and in most cases for free. I can send my girlfriend a picture of a sweater to see if she likes it before I buy it, I can keep in touch with people in my past with minimal effort. High school reunions are almost pointless since Facebook: I already know how everyone turned out - why bother with the reunion part.  ;) ",

            "answer_text": "What was daily life like before the internet? For hundreds, if not thousands of years, there have been cultural institutions similar to the Internet, beginning with the written word, whose origins are various and lost in antiquity. Prior to the advent of the written word, knowledge was communicated almost entirely from one person to others within earshot; an argument could be made that nonverbal communication and artistic renderings may have also been \"culture bearers\" in antiquity. But the transmission of symbolic knowledge and information is what the Internet is all about, and that's been going on for millennia. Through to the present day, over half of the people in the world do not have Internet access of any kind, but with the exception of a small group of \"uncontacted peoples,\" almost all of the people in the world are profoundly affected by the Internet as an institution that enables more or less instantaneous worldwide communication. Indeed, most people who are not on the Internet have daily interactions with people who are, getting, giving, and exchanging all sorts of information. The Internet of today is actually very different from the Internet of last year, the year before that, and the years before that, stretching back decades. The Internet's most immediate technological precursors were personal computers, television (three major public networks), radio, faxes, and telephony (rotary dial), all of these technologies arguably overlapping the advent of the Internet, email, the World Wide Web, and smart phones. That is to say, it's really impossible to pinpoint a particular spot on the technological timeline where the Internet as we know it came into being, but I think it's fair to say that email was the first real \"killer application\" of the Internet, and that first came into widespread use in the early 1990s. Prior to the widespread use of email, a small handful of people used cell phones; most people used personal landlines and public telephones to stay in contact with each other. Most land lines had answering machines as opposed to voicemail that could be accessed remotely. Pagers, with and without text messaging, were more common than cellphones back in the day, at least transitionally, and people typically used the aforementioned public phones to respond to those pages, using pocket change to pay for those calls. The biggest change for me, personally, with the widespread use of the Internet in my daily life is that I so seldom need to check my post office box now for snail mail. Almost all of my bills and important correspondence come to me by email or the World Wide Web. There are still a handful of Luddites who send me bills or checks in the mail, but I seldom do more than open my mail to confirm the nature of its contents, removing items of value like checks, gift cards, credit cards and Southwest Airlines drink coupons; printed bills are simply a hard copy backup that I store for later destruction, not unlike all those checks that I deposit into my checking account using my smart phone.

            "answer_text": "I started college in '95, and we'd had a year or so of dial-up Internet at home before that. So my recollection of the pre-web days is mainly a childhood/adolescent memory.What I remember as the most striking difference is the scarcity of media before the web.Your TV viewing options were limited to what the cable company showed, or what you happened to have recorded. If you wanted to watch a particular movie, your only option was to go out and rent or buy it. So, if some obscure vintage movie came on and you really wanted to see it, you made sure you also recorded it on VHS, to preserve it. Because you never knew when or if it would be shown on TV again. Whatever TV showed you, is what you watched.It was also quite impossible to look up information online about anything at all, so discovering new things was a laborious, inefficient but often enjoyable process. You'd come across a book or movie on a flea market, perhaps recognise a name or a face, and that was it. No IMDB to look up entire filmographies and endless lists of trivia, no Amazon or Goodreads to give you similar recommendations. No Wikipedia to find out every little background detail. Trawling the library or getting in touch with a knowledgeable friend-of-a-friend could help you along, but it was real detective work.You were also highly dependant on whatever shops in your area sold in terms of comics, books, music and other media. Today, if you have money and can more or less spell a band name, you can order/download any music you want, never mind how niche. Google will find it for you. Back then, seeking that stuff out was much more involving.I remember visiting London and basically buying as much stuff as I could afford. T-shirts, books, magazines and movies. Lots of tough choices there. That notion seems absurd to me now. ",

Here are just a few of the big differences: \u2022 If you wondered about something, you'd go to a print source for the answer--dictionary, encyclopedia, atlas, thesaurus, some other reference work. These things were in most homes. \u2022 Almost all written communication was by mail. There were also fax machines, but pretty much only at larger businesses, so copies of documents could not be transmitted to people's homes, for the most part.So, significant time lag in written communication. \u2022 The vast majority of shopping was done in what we now call \"bricks and mortar\" stores. Some was also done mail-order, using print catalogs sent through the mail as they are now--ordering would be either by mail or by phone.. \u2022 Different technology but same time frame--cell phones weren't around before the Internet, and they came in at roughly the same time, so all voice communication was via what we now call \"land lines.\" There was obviously no texting. Public, coin-operated phones were at every gas station and restaurant, in many retail stores, and on the street. \u2022 GPS hadn't even been thought of. Motorists who traveled had stacks of paper maps in their glove compartments, and flashlights. \u2022 Music was sold on CDs or tapes, or vinyl. No one had thought of downloading it. Most computers at that time couldn't burn CDs or DVDs (this was the era of the floppy disc), so digital copying didn't exist either in people's homes. You bought music in stores. ",

Look outside to see what the weather was like (verses looking up a weather site) and dress accordingly (without texting my friends to see what they were wearing). I would walk to the bus stop for school or walk to school if I missed (no uber, no locating the bus to see how much time I had left, no parents driving me, no friends with cars that they didn\u2019t buy themselves). I would talk to my friends face to face (no facebook, twitter, chat, cell phone etc). They would call me at home on a phone that was plugged into the wall if they wanted to talk to me (no cellphone, no voice message, no video chat). If I wanted to know anything I would go to the library and look it up in books (verses quick searches on the net). And my photos were kept in a photo album book style (verses in albums on facebook or other photo containing sites on the net) . I would mail photos in xmas cards that took a stamp (verses posting the photo on facebook). I would eagerly look for letters in the mailbox (verses emails, texts). No one was tracking me like a felon with an ankle bracelet via cell phone. I remembered appts by memory not by a cell phone. I also didn\u2019t have crane neck from always staring at a phone in my palm. And no carpal tunnel from \u201ckeyboarding\u201d or texting\u2026.I didn\u2019t stay up all night watching movies or youtube, I rested because I was more responsible. I didn\u2019t have blood shot eyes from staring at a screen. And when I watched a movie, I paid attention, not like today where I can pause it and replay it. . ",

            "answer_text": "I was born in 1963. Life was slower. More in the moment. People did not so much go out to places to entertain, they entertained in their homes much more. So life was more intimate. Relationships were more face-to-face (facetime). People had time to get used to news,ideas, people. And people were more respectful. We knew of the others in our smaller (not necessarily little) worlds. We knew or acted as through we knew the value of the connection, and better sought to respect others. We were always being trained to be adults. Children were allowed to run freely through there neighborhoods. Yes, they hurt each other's feelings as children are often cruel. But they had time and space to work it out. Another way children were training to be adults. Having said all that, I appreciate and rely on my internet connection. I can sign up, decline services, update, pre-shop, order, and learn things on the internet. As an aging person with various diseases, I appreciate learning about services, medical updates, and appreciate supporting organizations that benefit me, organizations that many would not know about. I everyday appreciate the information immediately available to me on my devices. I cannot have it both ways. ",

Before Facebook, I had a scrapbook where I used to stick all my favorite pictures and write about them. There I pasted my favorite cars, news articles, information and amazing facts. Before Quora, I was way much curious and questioner. I would ask anything to anyone - be it my grandparents, milkman, shopkeeper, or even a temple priest.Before WordPress, I had a bulky diary where I used to write all my thoughts and ideas. I have dozens of them now. They are energetic as memories. I am still obsessed with those leather diaries. Before Instagram, I had a habit of carefully making an album of all the photographs clicked by our old Kodak Camera.Before Pinterest (product), I had a huge notice board where I used to stick all my notes, wallpapers, and pictures of idols.Before Twitter, I used too much of sticky notes all over my room to paste all the quotes, inspirational sentences, etc. I still have them! Before YouTube, I used to watch Discovery Channel and National Geographic a lot. Particularly, I loved Bear Grylls. Before Netflix and Hotstar, I used to watch that ancient Doordarshan TV channel which was enjoyed by all the family members together.Before Google Play Books, I used to borrow a huge amount of books from my friends, sister, sister\u2019s friends and even my uncle.Before Foursquare, I used to read my maps for all the free time I got. I used to stare at the maps endlessly. This is the reason I know more cities, capitals, and countries than most of my peers. No regrets. Before WhatsApp, I used to call my friends and ask the whole stuff which I missed due to my bad health. Only occasional calls were done because they were costly.Before Skype, we actually met our cousins and had fun. Now, we have grown up. No time. Only Skype.PS: Crackers are going to be banned now. Probably, I\u2019ll be bursting crackers online. ",

Being born in early/mid 80s, I got to experience a bit (at least 10 years) before computers became mainstream (with the internet) around mid/late 90s. And that was when the internet was a baby to mainstream society - metaphorically speaking. Compared to today, there was certainly pros and cons to it just like any other time in history. What some things kids these days would hate, we would love or be okay with. What some things we hated, kids these days would maybe find funny. We certain had struggles, but every era has them. And we did what we could to get around it or get by. And we were still quite happy for the most part. As for the daily life? It depends on each person, each family and where they are from. And each DAY would be different as well. Although, watching TV was a common constant for most people, we would still find days where we\u2019d go outside and do something - whether it\u2019s tackle football, shooting hoops, playing baseball, played on the playgrounds (swings and slides), going sledding/snowmobiling/go-karting/bowling/ice skating\u2026 Just about anything fun to do outside (or inside). The list goes on and on and on\u2026 ",

Your chance of finding out how events actually unfold in reality is zero, and your view of reality would be completely shaped by the media you had access to, as you have no way of counter-checking from a different perspective. People agreed with each other more since they shared more information sources in common, but they were also more commonly wrong since they can all be misled at once. Specialised information was difficult to get, and researching into topics gets expensive, so very few people knew anything of value outside of their specialisation. There was no such thing as interdisciplinary mastery - if you wanted to know something, you really had to ask someone who studied it. People based judgement a lot more on authority rather than logic, since they had no possibility of counter-checking an expert's reasoning without the required data. People spent a lot more time with other people in person, and along with deeper relationships also came deeper enmity with others. Yet people would spend time mostly only with those of their own social group or class; interaction between races or nationalities in the vast majority of nations was completely unheard of, while people routinely have international friends today.

            "answer_text": "Indexed information was slow and manual.I studied medicine pre-internet and pre-personal computer. To review the world literature or even local literature while researching a topic or preparing a scholarly article, you would first go to the main library on campus to a dedicated room with walls of large books called Index Medicus, containing cross-references of much but not all of the English language, peer-reviewed medical, nursing and health literature from the late 1800s, 1 set per year and monthly updates covering the current and past year until they made it into the annual compilations.To begin you would choose a keyword (just one), and go through the index for each year's book and each monthly update, jot down the likely references, then look up the abstract of the articles in the main section of the Index. You'd then repeat the process for other keywords.With your filtered list you'd then go find the printed version of the actual journal and photocopy it, or ask the librarian to request it from elsewhere if it wasn't in the local collection. It thus took months to do a lit review, and months more to get an article written and into print. To be up to date with other parallel research, personal networks were paramaount.In the 1980s our library switched to MEDLARS / MEDLINE which was available on CD-ROM. You still had to go to the library to use it, and still photocopy full-text articles.In 1996 PubMed arrived, a free, online service to search MEDLINE via the web. It was so revolutionary that it was ceremonially launched by Vice President Al Gore in June 1997. Now I can get full text articles on just about any topic, sitting in bed using my iDevice, translated from just about any language. Scientific articles can be instantly published as soon as they are peer-reviewed and accepted. Indexing just happens. ",

Before I had access to a personal gaming computer with internet, I sat around played board games, read comic books, and went outside. I remember visiting friends a lot more often and calling everyone from my landline. Once we had access to dial-up (AOL), our goal was to find cheat codes for different video games. N64 was the popular in the late 90s. You didn\u2019t need the internet since you could buy codes from magazines so Blockbuster and Gamestop were very popular on the weekends. But the power of the internet grew year over year. Video games were going online and chat rooms were becoming popular. All of a sudden no one went to Blockbuster or rented games from Gamestop. Daily life before the internet may have seemed simple but it wasn\u2019t convenient. Today I would rather order everything online and meet up with friends than visit a physical store to rent a movie or game.

The internet was probably around most of my life but it wasn't until I was about 12 (I'm 30 now) that it became something Australian families could afford to have in their homes. When we did get the internet it was connected to the same line as the telephone so you couldn't use both at the same time. It made a loud screechy noise as it connected and was slow at best. Before the internet, I remember being outside a lot more. I played sports and did after school activities with friends. I had people over to my house, we played with Lego a lot and we had a Nintendo game system that I loved. I liked arcades and mini golf and go karts. My parents took us on outings for barbecues and bush walking. I made three way phone calls to my friends and talked for hours, much to my mother's chagrin. I met with friends at shopping centres to see movies and hang out in the food court. It wasn't really that long ago now that I think about it. Life was fine. ",

I know someone who would regularly spend his lunch hours photocopying books and magazines so he could do some pleasure reading at his desk without it looking obvious. On the flipside, it was harder to do any kind of research, or share files easily before the internet. You couldn't send attachments with pre-internet email; you either had to put them on the server or have disks sent/FedExed/messengered to remote locations. The bike messenger industry started and flourished during this window in time; after digital files became standard but before internet was widely used. You also had to do your shopping, banking and bill-paying in person or by mail (well, you could order from catalogs and pay bills over the phone, but it was still a hassle and time drain). ",

I get her number and after calling her many times and only getting a busy single I mentioned it to her at school and she told me \"Oh, I was on the Internet.\" and I replied \"What is the Internet?\" she explained and said she will bring me a CD to the Internet and the next day she showed up with an AOL CD from then on I have been hooked. Before the Internet, From the time I was 6 months old tell I was 18 years old I was at the local Farmers Market helping sell produce as I did not care to have friends as I was a loner other then being around my mom & grandfather at the market. I was there Friday afternoon till Monday morning and every afternoon Monday through Friday. After getting connected to the Internet I naturally started looking up selling online because that is all I had ever known. Over the years I have moved to researching any topic related to online jobs or businesses and to this day I have no regrets of getting online. ",

I can still remember how often I was visiting PC and Games shops to talk to the salesmen and managers to give me tips on those games. I knew which ones of them were into game playing. This gave me great advantages. I was given the chance to play games before buying them. I also got discounts & pre-release sneak peaks to some games. Not to mention free coffee and snacks and of course nice game-chatting for my Saturday morning. Back then not many people that I knew of were playing games. I was the odd one out (yes, \"geek\"). ",
