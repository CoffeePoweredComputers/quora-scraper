            "answer_text": "AI will take our jobs, But not until AI gets smarter than us. But I think that will happen in less than 20 years. Probably sooner than that. But 99% probability we will develop the AI in less than 20 years. I do AI research, so I see the progress and the end goals. But not everyone believes this. Dani Alexis in an answer here shares the view that we are light-years away. No one knows it\u2019s all speculation. But there is big money being spent by very smart and rich investors today because they believe it\u2019s almost here. The money does not support Dani\u2019s view. But his view is common. Even within some very smart people that study the field. Eon Musk for example just made a claim the AI will pass humans in less than 5 years. I think he\u2019s correct. But this is only the time the first technology arises. It will still take many decades after hat to integrate the new technology into the economy and to replace all the current jobs. The job of retooling our entire economy to use machines instead of humans will be very expensive and time-consuming. But as it happens, there will be great social unrest for the massive job loss that will be happening. Dani says we will always have work to do. But what I disagree with is that having work to do is not the same thing as having a job. We already have lots of work to do. I must make my bed when I get up. I must take a shower. Fix a meal for myself. Talk to my friends and family. Get exercise. Watch TV. Take my car to the shop to be repaired. Shop. Plan my future. We only work a job for OTHERS 40 hours a week. But we are awaking \u201cworking\u201d for ourselves 16 hours a day 7 days a week. Or 112 hours a week. We work for OTHERS in a job, 40 of those hours. When the automation gets smarter than us, there won't be any point in doing work for others. Why would Bob hire people to build his house, and pay $200K for the house to cover say $120K of labor and $80K of raw materials when he can have robots built it for $100K in less than 1/3 the time? Humans will only get in the way and produce an inferior product for more money. And if you only pay the humans what the robots cost, the humans won\u2019t be able to feed themselves. So they won\u2019t work for you. What happens when we replace humans with machines, is that the current labor to capital ratio of the economy shifts. Our economy is now (and has been for 100\u2019s of years) about 60% labor, and 40% capital rents (like land and oil and trees and profits). But once automation passes us, the human labor share will drop like a rock. We will see it fall quickly to say 10% labor and 90% capital. At that point, all the workers combined will only get 10% of the economic output of for their labor. The owners of the economy, stockholders, small business owners, investors get 90% as dividends on their investments. We can not support a society where the 1% get 90% of the output of the economy (the GDP value), while the rest of society struggles to live on 10%. The inequality will be so large that the poor will rise up in mass and stop chopping heads. People would rather burn down the society than continue to live in one so unjust. The solution is to share most of the capital wealth. We do that by taxing the 1% (taxing corporate profits, rents, capital gains), and handing out the money as a Basic Income for everyone. When the machines actually do become smarter than us, that\u2019s how it will work. We still tax the owners of the machines to create a Basic Income, and most people will just live on their Basic Income. They might have a little extra income from work, but the bulk of their family living expenses will be paid by the UBI money. The UBI will be our joint share of the wealth created by the robots. What will we do at that point? The same stuff everyone does when they retire. We will seek out whatever we enjoying doing the most. We will take care of our personal needs. We will seek entertainment. We will help others because we enjoy helping others and have lots of free time to do that. We can teach and care for the kids because we enjoying doing that (the robots can do it, but we will do whatever we WANT to do). The robots will do the stuff we would rather not do. Want to go to school and learn something new? That\u2019s an option. What to go fishing every day? You can do that do, Teah some kids to play baseball? What is fun for you you can pressure because you won\u2019t have to worry about your basic needs like food, shelter, and medical care anymore. You won\u2019t have to worry about your kids having these things as well. We should start a UBI and share a good chunk of the capital wealth today. Maybe 20% of the economy should be shared that way today. Which would be $1000 a month for everyone, children, and old included. A family of 4 would get $48K of income even when no one was working. Work and you will have more income. tat\u2019 what we can do TODAY to make the world a better place for everyone and to help deal with the impacts of people losing their jobs and having to find a new one. Maybe even go back to school for a few years before they are ready to go back to work in a new field. A Basic Income makes all that possible today. Now we are just coping with turn over and competition in the job market from automation. And some level of raising inequality created by the dynamic work environment. Working is a moving target and gig jobs are becoming more common. But once AI reaches and passes human general intelligence It\u2019s all over, the jobs will start to drop like a rock. At that point, we MUST start sharing the economy output with a Basic Income or something like it. We should do it now but because people still believe you must contribute to be allowed to get a share, we are stuck with 18th-century thinking about our 21st-century problems. ",

            "answer_text": "Here\u2019s the thing: Human work exists to meet needs. By inserting money in between us and our needs, we\u2019ve largely forgotten that all human effort is an attempt to meet a need. Most of us go off to jobs that don\u2019t actually contribute anything to a direct human need, not even our own. Money serves as the mediator: We labor at all day at something that does not directly result in a house for us to live in or food for us to eat or clothes for us to wear or tools for us to use or stories for us to enjoy, but at the end of the day we get money, which we use to buy the housing, food, etc. If AI somehow takes over all the work we\u2019re currently doing, we will still have human needs. We will still do the work required to meet them. If AI somehow does all the work to meet all our human needs (not the same thing has \u201cdoing all the work we currently do\u201d), then humans will still work. Guaranteed. They\u2019ll just work at things not directly related to their needs or to getting money to meet those needs. Humans will make more art, have more social events, and do more of the things AI cannot do because AI right now has about the same processing power as an earthworm can only do what we train it to do. We\u2019re light years away from AI running all of human society for us. In the meantime, however, we all have actual needs, right here and right now. ",

            "answer_text": "Good question. Human had been a result of natural evolution (I suspect you are an evolutionist, because otherwise, you might have asked the almighty, instead of Quora). This means we developed capabilities to be fit to the environment were lived in. However, we became so capable of changing our environment, making the environment fit our desire, we have not really had time to evolve our biology side yet. What happens when AI replaces our intellectual work and companies like Amazon covers all of physical needs? I think there are 2 areas that we will be affected. the majority of people will follow natural evolution path, which means without a personal survival as the attached outcome, they will stop developing \u201cuseful\u201d skills, and fall back to do nothing (both willingness wise and ability wise). At the beginning (first couple of generations), it would be a very relaxing pure consuming life, but as time goes on, more and more people will lose the \u201calternatives\u201d to being fed by machines. And because of the second thermodynamic law, entropy always increase, AI will cut off fulfilling human demands;for the minority of people who want to do something for the sake of doing things, they might very likely start to fight against the AIs. It is because most of the things we know how to do would become AI\u2019s expertise, AI will do most of the things we do better, more efficient. This means AI will either beat us on all of our games, or they might even forbid us from doing anything, because it would be a waste of resources (human making a bread likely will cost more energy, flour than AI). So fighting for freedom to use natural resources less efficiently might become the goal for the small minority of human who just want to have a hobby.One might ask \u201cwhy can\u2019t we make AI that will always allow human to do things they like?\u201d The answer is we actually don\u2019t know what are the things \u201chuman like, that is harmless\u201d. We don\u2019t have a proper way of distinct what Hitler wanted to what you and me wanted to do. And for Machine Learning, while the majority of human would chose to just do nothing, that will also be what AI learns. It is not a bad thing, if you understand what I\u2019m talking about. Because you don\u2019t want AI to be the assistant of a super small minority to help them rule the rest of the human population. It took me a long time to learn the fact that for a lot of people, it is actually very hard to understand \u201cwhat is the difficulty to tell AI to allow me to do thing?\u201d The fact is if you allow every single human being to \u201ctell AI what to do\u201d, well, do I need to remember what happened when everyone could tell what an AK47 can do? So it is not a problem of the AIs, it is a problem reside in us. To maintain world peace, AI can\u2019t be handed to each individual to decide what can or cannot be done. Then someone will have the next question:\u201dcan we make sure AI can\u2019t start a war? but will otherwise listen to human\u201d? the answer is still no. What if in a desert country, someone wanted to use extra amount of water? On this path, one might start to get more and more detailed demands, and as you can figure out while playing this experiment, very soon, your idea of what should be allowed will conflict with someone around you, which means their \u201cideal\u201d AI will follow rule that not doing something you want to allow, yet might do something you want to forbid. I know this is hard to understand, but we are at the door step of something that will be very hard for human to comprehend and respond to. In short, because of our own shortcoming, our future is very much doomed. ",

ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE AI produces more jobs than it takes and those jobs tend to be less manual, better paying jobs. If AI takes their jobs, they\u2019ll have to go through the unpleasant process of re-employment. Re-employment is not all bad. It usually results in a better job.
