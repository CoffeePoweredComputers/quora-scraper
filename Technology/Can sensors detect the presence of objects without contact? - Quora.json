            "answer_text": "Sure, they can!The 'link only' answer provided by Anonymous is a good one. I hope you mean position, when you say presence. There's a slight difference. Presence is the state or fact of existing, occurring or just being present. While, position is a little more specific - 'Where it is present', maybe approximately. There are sensors which can detect the position and thereby the presence of an object or rather a state or a condition. Many methods are available. Change in capacitanceChange in inductanceChange in magnetic field strengthChange in impedanceChange in induced emf and many moreA simple example would be the IR sensor. See, no contact with the object at all. When there is an object, light is reflected and a signal is generated.  However, when you take the object far way, there is no output at all. Hence the object is 'present' but not within the 'range' of the sensor. It can be adjusted though to an extent. Hope this helps. Thanks for the AtoA ",
