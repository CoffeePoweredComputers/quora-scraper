It allows you to determine the size of industries and corresponding sub-segments (this gets very detailed). It includes information such as: - Market Sizes- Company Shares- Brand Shares- Pricing- Products by Ingredient- By geography etc. Note - this is a paid resource, but you can typically get some level of access at your local library.  IBISWorld - This is another paid resource but typically provides a broad overview of specific industries and has some high level commentary around it.  Equity research - This may be more readily available for you. Typically industry info comes from initiation of coverage reports or sector reports. I've typically found that the industry reports from big banks been very insightful, however, it may not have the detail data segmentation that you will get from Euromonitor. Government websites - This is a free resource that provides a lot of info on various sectors and uses some of the data sources above referenced. See link below. Industry, Markets and Trade ",

Look for white papers, reports, and for mentions of the names of the company's CEO, CMO, and CFO at conferences. If these people speak at conferences, you'll sometimes find notes for those conferences available online in forums. ",
