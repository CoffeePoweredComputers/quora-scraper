            "answer_text": "It\u2019s hard to know what you are asking here. The original computers that took up massive rooms and were only used by governments and big corporations are likely impossible to find now and if one was found I doubt many of us could afford them. If you are talking about the first computers aimed at the home or small business such as the early Apples, Commodores, Radio Shack, etc. they can be found on eBay but watch out on the prices some sellers are insane. If you want the early IBM desktop systems such as the IBM-5150 PC their original Personal Computer they can also be found on eBay. If you are lucky you might even find them at a yard sale, estate sale, or even on craigslist. I personally have a collection of these vintage personal computers that includes the Apple IIe, commodores, IBM PC, XT, AT, and their first portable. I enjoy collecting and restoring them. When the IBM XT first came out I was certified as a tech on them and maintained a group of over 100 of them. The first computer I owned was a TRS-80 color or CoCo, and yes I have one in my collection. The first computer I trained on and worked as a tech on was AT&Ts 465L system, it was a beast full of vacuum tubes, relays, and ferrite core memory and no I don\u2019t have one in my collection. ",
