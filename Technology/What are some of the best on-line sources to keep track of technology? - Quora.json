            "answer_text": "I used to keep track of technological advances by reading books. That began when I was eight, and continued until the Internet came along. With the Internet as advanced as it now is (think Google search, YouTube, Ted, free online classes, news sites specially for technology, HowStuffWorks\u2026), it is far easier and more efficient to learn about, and gain clearer understanding of, new technologies as they emerge. I can\u2019t wait for VR and AR (Virtual Reality, Augmented Reality) technologies to make such online sources even more efficient and clear. I use the example of the inner workings of the Wankel Engine to illustrate this point: as a teenager, I had read descriptions in books with still pictures explaining the Wankel Engine\u2019s inner workings. My vivid imagination filled in the obvious gaps and aided in my understanding. With the Internet, I can now watch videos and multimedia animations which clearly show how the Wankel Engine\u2019s triangular rotor spins within the epitrochoidal chamber, creating constantly varying sized combustion chambers as it spins.
