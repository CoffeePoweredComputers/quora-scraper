            "answer_text": "It was a policy which made sense 30 years ago, but lasted far longer than it should have. Because it lasted longer than it should have, it created a lot of trouble and resentment on both sides. In the early 1990s, China started the policy of requiring foreign companies coming into the Chinese market to find a local Chinese partner, set up a JV (joint venture) partner, then turn its technology over to the JV. In almost all cases, the JV would hold the technology while the Chinese partner would take care of land, hiring and all the stuff which a local partner could do. For the most part, this worked out well. There were abuses, but they were not large enough for most companies to go to litigation. China joined the WTO (World Trade Organization) in 2001, and it was expected that this practice would gradually end. However, in 2001, there were the 9/11 attacks, and the US got distracted by the War on Terror. The US government and public were all focused on the war in Iraq and Afghanistan, and no one talked about business practices in China. With no pressure to reform the system, China just continued under the same system for JVs, assuming that there would be no pressure to change. China did not think that there would be a backlash, and only realized too late what would happen with the election of Trump, and his two trade negotiators, Robert Lighthizer and the strongly anti-China Peter Navarro (he made a video titled \u201cDeath By China\u201d). Both of them had the ear of Trump, who was always on the lookout for villains he could lash out against. In his speeches, Trump repeatedly said that China had \u201craped\u201d the US, and was the source for many of the problems which the US had. Many Americans believed this, and even the Democrats who do not like Trump have largely bought into this view. In my humble opinion, now that China is very strong in many technologies, and even leads the US in some areas, it would be best for China to say that it no longer requires foreign companies to find Chinese partners and turn their technology over to the joint venture. It has agreed to do this with Tesla China, which is the first foreign auto manufacturer which does not require a Chinese partner. However, it should do more, and waive the requirement all across the board, saying that this period in its development has past, and that manufacturers from all over the world can come and invest in China, without requiring that they hand over their technology.
