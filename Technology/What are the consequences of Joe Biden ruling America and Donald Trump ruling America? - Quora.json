            "answer_text": "Well, first of all Biden has no plans to \u201crule\u201d the US - he hopes to be President, not a ruler. Trump does want to \u201crule\u201d the US. As a communist-style President for Life dictator. So your use of the word \u201crule\u201d applies only to Trump. That being said, lets do Trumps plan for healthcare: 200 dollar cards for seniors on Medicare for prescriptions - how great is that, right? Except that the 200 dollars will be totally gone after the first couple of refills. And since there has been no money put forward to pay for these, what, exactly, is Trumps plan to pay for these cards? A mystery. Getting rid of the ACA. Which will throw about 20 to 24 million people off healthcare coverage of any sort, AND get rid of pre-existing conditions being covered. How great is that, right? Got high blood pressure? Your premiums just skyrocketed, or you might get turned down if you\u2019re hunting for insurance once the ACA has been done away with, or you might lose your existing coverage. Got migraines? Got high cholesterol? Got arthritis? Again, your premiums just skyrocketed, or you get turned down by the insurance companies, or you lose your existing insurance - because you have what the insurance companies deem \u201ca pre-existing condition\u201d. So, what do you do? Republicans say \u201cwho cares?\u201d We got rid the ACA didn\u2019t we? That\u2019s what you wanted, that\u2019s what you voted for when you voted for us. So just be quiet. You got what you wanted.\u201d Obviously Biden has a rather more sympathetic plan - not a medicare for all, but a plan to build on the ACA, thereby keeping coverage for those with pre-existing conditions, and allowing 20 to 24 million people to actually keep the insurance they are paying for. The list of consequences for a Biden Presidency compared with a Trump Presidency begins and ends with healthcare. Which one would you choose where your family members are concerned? ",

            "answer_text": "It is clear to me that the election is not about Trump or Biden,,, It wouldn\u2019t make a difference if Warren ran against Rubio\u2026or Sanders ran against Cruz or Pelosi against Jordan. . This election is about socialism vs capitalism\u2026..bigger government and what goes along with it\u2026fewer freedoms and liberties, higher taxes, more regs, and slow growth VS smaller govt , more freedoms, choices and liberties\u2026.and more growth. It is about religious freedoms, abortions at 9 months, gun rights. It is about packing the courts as the left promised to do. Doing away with the filibuster\u2026 If Biden were for what Trump was for, I\u2019d vote Biden. It is not the man it is the policies. The far left who will take over a few months after the inauguration is comprised of Harris, Sanders, AOC, Tlaib, Omar, Warren and even Cub fans know what they are for. Review the tapes of the primaries and what has transpired since. Now the left currently controls or owns the MSM, most unions, SPLC, Hollywood, social media, ACLU, and most colleges and universities. Once they control health (medicare for all including illegals\u2026..essentially single payer) and energy (ridding fossil fuels with apparently no substitute) then we have govt control over production which I see as socialism. Remember the left has other plans like making PR and DC states which gives them 4 more senators and a certain number of House reps. The idea of packing the courts and getting rid of the filibuster. Then there will be 3 political branches to the govt in lieu of two\u2026(executive and legislative), Eliminating the electoral college along with amnesty for illegals and open borders gives them a majority of voters with spare and control of the whole shebang. If that is not socialism I \u2019d like to hear your definition. I am talking a one-party system for the foreseeable future. These are not policies I see them making\u2026these are policies they have talked about in their primaries and outside the primaries. ",
