            "answer_text": "I recently purchased an HP ENVY Photo 7155 and it came with ink. 1 Black cartridge and 1 Tri-color cartridge. Since I had been told that the ink cartridges that come with HP printers and others are really just sample type cartridges and not full, I went ahead and purchased more HP ink at the same time I bought my printer. To my surprise the ink cartridges that came with my HP lasted a long while leading me to believe that they were full cartridges after all. So yes most HP printers come with ink. Just in case always read what comes in the box before you purchase\u2026. Hope this helps. ",

All were solid machines, major reason for the purchase\u2026I needed different features or I did something goofy and broke the thing. Each one came with a low-volume cartridge or cartridge set; this included both laser and InkJet. Two final points: Off-brand cartridges for HP are not worth the headaches they cause.The HP cartridge subscription program is worth investigating\u2026convenience and the cartridges are larger capacity than the XL commonly available.",

            "answer_text": "HP printers come with \u201cstarter cartridges\u201d. How long they actually last depends on your printing needs and habits. As a rule of thumb, they generally will last for 400 to 600 impressions, again depending upon what you print. You then have your choice of regular quantity cartridges or XL cartridges. The XL size gives you just under twice the amount of ink and is a significant savings. Print ON! ",
