            "answer_text": "Yes, using the same technology as a lift door. Elevator door in the US. Here you have two problems, one closing the gate and the other sounding an alarm. Closing the gate is easy, you make the gates motor-operated, there are companies that will do this for you. Sounding the alarm is easy enough, you have a sensor that senses when the gate is open and a timer that only waits long enough for the gate to close and then sends you a message (could be an alarm, a message on a monitor, even a text.) Or you just put a CCTV camera or two so you can see the gate from indoors. Your biggest problem is the one you haven\u2019t mentioned: \u201cSAFELY\u201d You really shouldn\u2019t close a gate entirely unattended, trapping somebody\u2019s pet or child is possible. You would avoid this if you had the cameras. Sensors on the gate edges could stop the gate and give you an alarm if something was in the way. You certainly wouldn\u2019t be allowed to force a gate shut. Also, if this is for security purposes, the sensors could be fooled and the gate wouldn\u2019t close, which is not very secure. Just phone up a security gate company and ask them. ",
