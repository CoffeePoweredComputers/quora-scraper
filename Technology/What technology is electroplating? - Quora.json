            "answer_text": "Electroplating is a process that uses an electric current to reduce dissolved metal cations so that they form a thin coherent metal coating on an electrode There are essentially two technologies: electroplating and electroless plating. In the electroplating process, the substrate is immersed in a liquid solution called an 'electrolyte'. Then, an electrical potential is applied between a conductive area on the substrate and an electrode ",
