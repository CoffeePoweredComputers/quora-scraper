            "answer_text": "I have a different take on this. I live in the Middle East. In the early 2000s, having an Internet connection was a bit of a big deal because most parents didn\u2019t want to allow it in their households. Between my friends and I, when one of us would talk about having a Hotmail account, that was a big deal. When we all got our first Facebook accounts around 2007 (which is when I first witnessed the Google homepage), that was a huge deal. In hindsight, Internet was pretty cheap back then, if far below standards set by other countries, and it still is below those standards ($20 for a 1 MB/s connection. Seriously, I\u2019m running on 4 Mbps in 2018). Most people weren\u2019t accustomed to normal piracy websites like The Pirate Bay back then because downloading a 1 GB movie would take days, not hours. Instead, Arabs found a way to circumvent this issue by putting up their own websites, where pirated content would be put up in a compressed format. So instead of downloading the newest movies/video games in one go and dealing with an unstable connection, bandwidth throttling, or the power suddenly going out, they\u2019d be split in 5\u201310 .rar files you download separately, and it would take a fraction of the time it took to download a huge file (\u201cfair use\u201d was a contested policy used by most ISPs where I live so throttling was a big issue). And voila! You had your movie in 240p, or your video game without the audio files. Why was I such a sinner? Because back then (and to this day), people living outside North America and Europe are apparently subhuman to most game publishers, movie studios, and content providers, so they do not make an effort to reach consumers living in other parts of the world. On top of that, we get everything at nearly double the cost considering tariffs, VAT (which is 14% where I live), other taxes, and a myriad of factors that insanely hike prices up. In 2009 when I pirated Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2, maybe I had better options. I probably could have nicked a physical copy for $70. Nowadays, that could be $80\u2013100 for the newest installment in the FIFA series. Retailers go crazy with pricing. But curiously, those Arabic websites and forums dedicated to pirating movies and video games are all but gone. In comparison, people are a lot more connected to the Internet today than a decade ago when I started using it. They\u2019re a bit more informed, so the average senior can go ahead and buy a song album on the Google Playstore or something. Today, people have Netflix Arabia (which is subpar) and a lot of local competition that offer a way to watch local/foreign entertainment. A few years ago, Netflix was region locked on all platforms in the Middle East, so they were forced to stream everything. You see where I\u2019m going with this? I don\u2019t remember the last time I pirated anything ever since PayPal became functional in North Africa, Steam started accepting more payment options, and a bunch of online retailers started allowing people to purchase their products using alternatives to credit cards (unlike North America, cash is still the normal method of making transactions here). When you start making your content available to people, less will have an incentive to get it for free. Why on earth would I buy a copy of Photoshop for double the price if I just want to remove the background of an image? 10 years ago, why would anyone buy anything for double the price if they could get it online for free? Unless they lived in North America of course! A lot less people pirate content online these days because more companies are making an effort to reach overseas consumers. Virtual content has some monetary value now. Because for us over here, the value of your product is directly proportional to its availability. It just so happens that most things aren\u2019t available to us, so we\u2019ll use it for free. You decide who\u2019s being more unethical. ",

            "answer_text": "\"Copying is not theft. Stealing a thing leaves one less left. Copying it makes one thing more, that's what copying's for. Copying is not theft. If I copy yours you have it too,one for me and one for youthat's what copies can do. If I steal your bicycle you have to take the bus.But if if I just copy it, there's one for each of us.Making more of a thing, that is what we call copying.Sharing ideas with everyone, that's why copying is fun!\" - Nina Paley (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fw-MFeR8Frw) This should be a song that kids sing in pre-school. That would help civilization transition from an object-based economy to an intersubjective economy. As long as people still believe that ideas must be treated as objects there will be a fundamental conflict between emerging technology and the obsolete ideology. It's not simple or clear cut - sharing is not always 'moral', just as it's not always moral for a social networking company to share your personal information for a profit. In an intersubjective model, meaning replaces the object - it's texts and contexts acquire relevance only through interpretation, so that the morality arises from within the customs and conditions of the situation and the conscience of the participant.  Going forward, it's much more individual. Some may feel it's ok to copy unless they use the file to make money. They may be right. It's not a ten commandments situation \"Thou shall not DL Warez, N00b\" wasn't on the tablets. To attempt to control file sharing is obviously counterproductive in the long run and only serves to discredit any authority attempting to assert such control, as well as making bootlegging more profitable. It's not that difficult to create a model to extract revenue from things like music. Broadcast radio and TV were able to accomplish this without having to charge viewers per program. It was highly successful. I think that most people online recognize anti-file sharing sentiments as originating from the music industry directly or indirectly. It's the 21st century equivalent of being a 'narc'. ",
