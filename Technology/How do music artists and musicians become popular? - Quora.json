Do something amazing and unheard of before that people will share. I am getting a bunch of friends together and we're going to do a cover of their cover on the bagpipes.Find a producer and make him love you. Or an agent, or somebody with the experience of how to groom a star, the contacts in the business, and the interest and drive to make you famous. Find him, sell your soul, your firstborn, and the love of your life to him, and hope that he likes you to sign you up. Even then you're only going to be promoted, and may not be promoted.Be found. Get yourself out there, play as much as possible, network as hard as you can, and build a web of connections. The bigger, and stronger, and stickier your web is, and the further you cast it, the more chance an unsuspecting Someone will fly by and take notice and be caught - and then, then, you have a chance of getting famous.There are quite a lot of music sites you can upload your music to - ReverbNation, Musicovery, Indie Music, etc., - as well as the conventional places like Youtube, Vimeo, etc. Have a Facebook/LinkedIn, join the appropriate groups, get Twitter, use Hashtags, put yourself out there online and offline...and pray.Self-Aggrandizing Disclaimer: I run a startup, StartCut.com, and it's a simple tool that uploads your video to multiple video sharing sites. If you already have a clip of music you can use startcut for free to put it up on the web. Go on, have a go. ",

            "answer_text": "The answer is in the question, sadly. Many musicians and \"promoters\" think that if you just work hard enough on your social networks connecting with your fanbase and also promote video content on YouTube, you can get somewhere. Disclaimer: Yes, you should do those things.  Truth: Those should make up about 15 percent of your overall promotion strategy...no more. You can set up profiles on Facebook, Twitter, Reverbnation, Bandcamp, Last FM, Sonicbds, Tumblr, and on and on endlessly, and what you'll end up with is a bunch of profiles. That's all. There's no mystery to it. I'm surprised that no one has mentioned actual promotion (although there are some great suggestions on this list). In order to find success, or to give yourself the chance, you need to actually promote yourself OUTSIDE of social networks. All the endless \"social media coaches\" have confused artists to the point that most artists think there is no reason to promote outside of social networks. For the general public to find you, you need to stop targeting your poor friends on your social networks and get your music on prominent and independent publications, blogs, radio shows, podcasts, websites, magazines. It's entirely possible and it's a major way to grow your band and reach thousands of new listeners.  Don't get stuck in the social media box! ",
