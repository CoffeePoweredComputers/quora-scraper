            "answer_text": "Probably quite a bit. The school is not attempting to restrict their social interaction. the school is attempting to engage the students in their studies. Granted that social interaction is important for the development of a well-rounded citizen. However, During the class period, it is impossible to engage students when they are texting or playing games on their devices. Next time you go to a restaurant and you see a young couple eating. Watch their interactions with one another. Both will have their phones in their hands and looking and smiling at their phones. No talking no personal interaction with their partner. Personally, I would rather interact with people on a one-on-one basis. You can look them in their eyes and see a smile or a frown slip across their face. This tells you they either liked or disliked what you said. This gives you an opportunity to rephrase the statement. If you are texting and use the wrong word then you have to go back much later that you rubbed someone the wrong way. Phones are distracting to the world. Not just in school but in church, home, ball games. We have people in our Christian church that will not attend unless we provide the password to the WI-FI. Using the excuse \u201cI have to keep in contact with (________). I know it is tough not being able to be in contact with your friends for 45 min during class, but it gives you so much time to work on something a little more exciting than who is dating whom. ",

            "answer_text": "There's a lot to consider when answering this question. First off, I'm going to crush the myth right now that cellphones don't help social interaction, cause damage to relationships, taking away phones help you focus, talk more, have more meaningful thought, etc. Stanford University recently did a study pointing out that phones aren't to blame. Just has a pencil doesn't make you write words, phones don't damage anaything; it's the person behind the phone. They even go as far to say that phones have made social interactions with kids easier, and our social life is only to bettef from it. Full article below, It\u2019s not your phone, it\u2019s you | Stanford News Now, the main issue is obviously kids being distracted while working. To this I say teach them how to use the phome for school work. Additionally, Dr. Beth Peters, a clinical psychologist in Westminster, Colorado, stated \u201d Restricting kids from they're phones isn't going to make them focus. When phones are taken away as punishment, it\u2019s immediately seen as a consequence not related to the behavior exhibited. This creates the potential for emotional backlash and a breakdown of the adult-child relationship. \u201c Full article below, When Should You Come Between a Teenager and Her Phone? So overall, the answer isn't ever \u201cwhen should we take them away? \u201c Instead figure out, \u201chow can we incorporate them? \u201c ",
