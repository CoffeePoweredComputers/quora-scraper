            "answer_text": "Let me think. Okay, so before the iPhone made it to the scene, smartphones weren\u2019t exactly smart. They were semi-smart.  They weren\u2019t good touch phones. They had no proper UI navigation. There wasn\u2019t exactly a good browser. They didn\u2019t have dedicated apps. They were simply there to make the person holding it look different. When the iPhone was released, it didn\u2019t just make the person using it look different and good, it actually made them more productive. Everything you expected a smartphone to do was now possible 10X better.  Better touch screen, Insanely great UI, insanely great apps (the App Store improved it all over time) and insanely great utility. And most of all, smartphones were aesthetically beautiful. With time, every phone manufacturer started copying, and with that entirely new industries started cropping up that brought the world one step closer to becoming a global village (which now it is). People started making tons of money, (billions in many cases) and new ways of teaching and earning, and helping people started cropping up. We can go into a lot of detail with this one, but to keep it short and simple, yes, the invention of iPhone did make the society better to live in. ",
