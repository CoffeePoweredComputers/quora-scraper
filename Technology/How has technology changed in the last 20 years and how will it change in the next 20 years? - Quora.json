            "answer_text": "It's easy to forget it's 2017, when I think of 20 years ago I think of the 1980\u2019s, but it's actually 1997. In the 90\u2019s the internet was relatively new, and the technology not as fleshed out. Slow dial up connections ran over phone lines, the \u201ccloud\u201d wasn't a thing for the most part and companies ran on-site infrastructure. Cell phones became commonplace, search engines and web companies were nowhere near the level of today. On the hardware side processing power was increasing but was still primarily single core processors with low frequencies. Hard drives were low capacity compared to today, and ram was low capacity. Artificial intelligence was in it's infancy and nothing like today. In the next 20 years artificial intelligence and machine learning will advance rapidly and I'm sure their use will become as the use of the internet is today. Self driving cars will likely transition to becoming mandatory at that point due to our rapid advances. The block chain will likely be implemented globally in some fashion, though not necessarily as used today. Phones will likely go through another redesign, if flexible technologies are developed further that'd probably be in use. The advances in technology occurring every year are tremendous, at this rate in 20 years who knows what we'll have. But it's safe to say that AI and machine learning will drive the future of technology. ",
