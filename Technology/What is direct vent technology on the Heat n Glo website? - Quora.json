            "answer_text": "As this name is associated with a variety of fireplace, I\u2019m going to assume that\u2019s what we\u2019re talking about here. Direct venting describes where any exhaust is conducted only a short distance to vents on the outside of a structure, rather than through an elaborate chimney or long ducts. That said, there are still regulations in play, such as (1) the exit vent must be at least a minimum distance away from any air intakes, (2) the exit vent must be more than a certain distance off the ground, (3) it must be properly insulated from any building materials, (4) it must be beyond the reach of children. I\u2019m sure there are others. ",
