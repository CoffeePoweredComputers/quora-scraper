            "answer_text": "The most important factor to keep in mind when buying a refurbished device is the seller. Always buy from a reputed website if you buying online. If not, you\u2019ll likely land up with a fake product, a dud or in some cases, even a stolen device. Pick a website that offers a transparent return policy, and offers a minimum warranty of six months. Ensure that the website guarantees quality-checked products from a certified refurbisher \u2013 many products come with a \u2018refurbished\u2019 tag but are just used and resold. If you receive a product that\u2019s damaged or defective, report this to the seller immediately, since refurbished goods have a small returns window \u2013 usually between a month or so. More than that, you can check out Jemjem, selling Apple MacBooks and also Chromebooks from Samsun, Dell, Acer, and Lenovo. Shipping is free around US. ",
