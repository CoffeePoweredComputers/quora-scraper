            "answer_text": "If you do not mind waiting for the new iPhone 12, then definitely wait for it. It could be worth it because it is rumoured to come with lots of new features. I\u2019m not too sure about the price, but it could possibly come at the same price as the iPhone 11 Pro Max, if not then it might be slightly more expensive. Don\u2019t get me wrong though, the iPhone 11 Pro Max is still an amazing phone nevertheless, and getting it will be as good as getting the iPhone 12, but if you do not mind waiting or (possibly) paying a little more then why not enjoy the new features that might come with it? Either way, it\u2019s going to be worth it, and the answer for this question really comes down to your personal preferences. Hope that helps! ",

            "answer_text": "No stranger on Quora knows your needs, wants, or budget better than you. Apple will always be coming out with something new. Always. So here is what I tell my clients: If are using something with which you are happy right now, then wait. Wait as long as you can. Wait until fall of 2021 or 2022 if you can. That way, you get the most bang for your buck out of your current device. If you are not happy with your current device, then go ahead and purchase now. Buy when you need to replace what you have, not just because Apple introduces a new model. ",
