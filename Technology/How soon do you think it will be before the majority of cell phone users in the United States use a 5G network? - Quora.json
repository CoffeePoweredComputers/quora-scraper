Unless you go the AT&T route and just re-label 4G as 5Ge. :) The reality is that low band 5G is ultimately the same to the majority of consumers, so if you ask when will US customers have 5G running on mmWave in the US, that is likely never. You just can\u2019t afford that many tower sites to push mmWave to all of the US, given the terrain, clutter and other various challenges. ",
