            "answer_text": " Credit image: 5G There are 8 key areas of technology that 5G technology is going to release. The area that 5G will influence is : SpeedThroughput.That means peak data rates are going to rise up to 10 Gbps and mobile data volumes to 10 terabytes per kilometre. This means that anywhere will cell and data service will be more accessible to the world unlike what we\u2019ve ever seen before. MobilityConnected DevicesInternet of Things.Hans Vestberg, CEO of Verizon, forecasts that 5G will allow devices travelling at up to 500 km/hr to stay connected to a network. This is unfortunately still too slow for all commercial air travel, but it does increase use cases for wireless connectivity. 5G is also expected to allow for up to 1 million devices functioning at full capability in 1 square kilometre. EnergyEfficiencyService DeploymentAre the next key areas that will be changed by 5G, allowing for devices to consume a staggering 90% less energy in data operations compared to 4G networks. Higher efficiency, lower energy, and 5G will also mean that services will take much less time to implement. Finally, the last 2 of Vestberg\u2019s projected impacted areas are latency and reliability. He forecasts there will be a 5ms end-to-end travel time. For reference, that\u2019s faster than the blink of an eye and it will likely be 99.999% more reliable as well. For users on all end of the data spectrum, this means good things for the world of tech. These deliverables and changes to the technology industry rely heavily on Verizon and other tech providers to update their fibre systems, network density, and real estate availability. 5G is for more than just your phone, it\u2019s for connecting the entire world to faster better internet and it looks to be here soon.
