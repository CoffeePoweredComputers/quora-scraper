            "answer_text": "Lithium ion battery technology today is an industry that largely relies on two materials (carbon and silicon) to address three issues (cost, energy and power). There have been several R&D articles on alternate materials but even today, pretty much everything that makes commercial sense (cost, manufacturing and performance metrics) still boils down to these two materials - carbon, the reliable old horse and silicon, the holy grail.  Unfortunately this leaves very little room for radical innovations and most of the R&D activities have only led to incremental improvements so far. The innovations need not be constrained to materials research but can involve manufacturing innovations, form factor and pack / module design breakthroughs or incorporation of high voltage, high performance electrolytes. This DOES NOT IMPLY you stop working on materials innovation altogether or you drop carbon and silicon from the list. However, it is extremely important to keep an open mind and try and solve the problem at hand. To put it more philosophically, don't create a problem to supplement an existing solution but try inventing a solution to an existing problem.  It will be wrong to say that none of the players, big or small, are focusing on out of the box innovations. Take Tesla for example - they aren't radically changing the core technology. They are simply scaling up manufacturing... EXTENSIVELY. And yes, while Tesla has the resources (and the courage) to think beyond the traditional thought process, most other business entities resort to the low-risk, low payoff conventional approach. As a result, the lithium ion technology has only been seeing incremental improvements since its large scale commercial introduction in the early 90s by Sony.  The industry has to make a choice if lithium ion technology is to gain market dominance in the years to come - the three issues identified shall remain the most critical and how you address them, without being restricted by the traditional thought process, is going to determine the fate of the technology. It is commonly argued that lithium ion technology is indispensable and alternate storage systems such as sodium ion and liquid metal batteries is specific to grid sectors. This is a kind of complacency that can really hurt the lithium ion industry. Technological breakthroughs can strike you out of the blue. Look at the rise and fall of fuel cells and that should be a good lesson about how aggressive and unrelenting the energy storage sector can be. ",

            "answer_text": "According to the prospective industry Research Institute released the \"China lithium battery industry market demand forecast 2015-2020 year strategic planning and investment analysis report\" the lithium battery has been widely used in notebook computer, tablet computer, mobile phone and mobile power and other consumer electronic products, but also the most powerful power lithium battery is used in the field of new energy vehicles for the development the momentum of the field of lithium batteries and the rise of investment in new energy vehicle sales volume is closely related. At present, the vast majority of new energy vehicles using lithium-ion power battery as the power source, the cost is about 50% of the cost of pure electric vehicles, new energy vehicles in the country continue with the popularization and promotion of power lithium battery industry has benefited in the new energy vehicle market volume. The lithium battery industry will usher in ten years of gold development, but the safety and endurance problems of lithium batteries need further improvement, which depends on the development of key materials technology for lithium batteries. Under this background, the state has promulgated the specifications of power battery and lithium ion battery industry, which is conducive to strengthening the management of lithium ion battery industry, improving the level of industry development, guiding industrial transformation and upgrading and structural adjustment, and the development of lithium battery in ten years can be expected. www.captainbattery.com ",
