            "answer_text": "I have been using 18650 Lithium Ion batteries for several years now building battery packs and power walls. My power wall has 8KW of energy stored in 1120 batteries soldered together in packs They are charged through my solar panels and discharged into an inverter when power is needed. As long as I don\u2019t draw down the batteries below 2.6 volts, or charge them greater than 4.2 volts, the batteries will last years. Now if I charge above the 4.2 volts, the battery begins to overheat and in that instance, they will more likely become dangerous. That\u2019s why I use a charge controller specifically designed for Lithium-Ion batteries. Now, how dangerous are they, well I have seen videos on YouTube, although I haven't experienced anything like it, where a 18650 battery was short-circuited, and within several minutes, exploded in a ray of sparks. I also know the Lithium-Cobalt Oxide Battery, which is the flat packs, expands when they are ending their life cycle and these batteries will explode more quickly than 18650 or other Lithium batteries when shortedor after they have started expanding. Here\u2019s something I found on the web The 5 types of Lithium-ion batteries along with their properties are given below. Lithium-Cobalt Oxide Battery Used mostly in handheld electronics (Cell phones, Laptops and Cameras)Risky especially when damagedCobalt is scarce and expensiveLow discharge ratesHighest energy density (110-190) Wh/kg Lithium-Titanate Battery Can operate at very low temp (-40\u00b0C)Rapid charge and dischargeUsed in Mitsubishi i-MiEVLower inherent voltage 2.4 V (compared to 3.7 V)Lower energy density (30-110) Wh/kg Lithium-Iron Phosphate Battery Dramatically reduces the risks of overheating and fire.Offers much less volumetric capacityUsed in power tools and medical equipmentLonger-life and inherently safeLower Energy Density (95-140) Wh/kg Lithium-Nickel Manganese Cobalt Oxide Battery Longer life and inherent safetyCobalt is scarce and expensiveLess prone to heatingUsed in Power tools, e-bikes and electric power trainsLower energy density (95-130) Wh/kg Lithium-Manganese Oxide Battery Lower costLonger life and inherently safeUsed in Hybrid Vehicles, Cell phones, LaptopsHigh discharge ratesLower energy density (110-120) Wh/kg ",

            "answer_text": "Somewhere between not dangerous at all if we handle them correctly, and flash fire dangerous if we don\u2019t. Think of it this way, the vast majority of people on this planet (about 4.5B people as of 2018 and still growing higher.) Walk around every day with them in their pockets, placed up to the side of their heads, etc. About 150M laptops and 150M tablets with them get sold every year. Wireless earbuds and headphones use them. All kinds of things use them. And while there are been some isolated incidences (Galaxy Note 7 battery, Sony laptop battery) that have had some poor design resulting in the isolation membrane being punctured, and fire happening in a handful of these. There have been somewhere around 100B Li-ion batteries made over the past 3 decades. How many deaths have been attributed to them, even the ones that have gone up in flames from design/packaging issues? Sure they\u2019re dangerous if you take a sharp object in puncture it. It can and likely will start a small fire. If there\u2019s other flammable stuff nearby that can go up too. That said, they not dangerous enough for use to avoid sticking in our pockets, holding to our ears, or putting on our laps. ",
