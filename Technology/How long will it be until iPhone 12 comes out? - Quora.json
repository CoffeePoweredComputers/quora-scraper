            "answer_text": "Apple usually launches its new series of iPhones in their annual September press meet every year. The same was expected this year as well but because of the ongoing situations, it is not confirmed if the launch will happen as planned. According to reports, however, the iPhone 12 is slated to be launched and released in October and the pro versions of the 12 series in November. It is however certain that the launch will be later than usual and consumers will most probably get their hands on the new phones only by November. It seems unlikely considering recent situations that it is going to be sooner than that although the pre-orders might open up in October.  The iPhone 12 is being waited on excitedly by the users because it is slated to be integrated with pretty decent features. Apple usually never fails to impress with its camera performance and the same is expected from the new series as well. It is also being rumored that iPhone 12 will be integrated with the upcoming Apple A14 bionic processor, although there are conflicting reports stating that the new processor will be included only with the pro versions. We will have to wait and see regarding this aspect as there has been no confirmation from the brand on this part, but personally I want the entire series to be powered by this processor. Apple A14 Bionic will be the absolute highlight in this smartphone and honestly for good reasons. Its predecessor - the A13 is considered as one of the best smartphone processors and the A14 will be its upgraded version with a likely core speed of 3.1GHz. Moreover, it will also be 5G powered which will make this series pretty strong in all aspects. I am definitely looking forward to seeing the new Apple offerings in action. ",
