            "answer_text": "The jury is out on this one. Currently the answer would have to be \u201cCell phone radiation has not been conclusively linked with increased incidence of brain tumors, benign or malignant.\u201d The three largest studies that have been conducted on this subject are the Interphone study, the Danish study and the Million Women study. None of these found any association between cell phone usage and the incidence of benign or malignant brain tumors. That said, despite these results, the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), which is part of the World Health Organization (WHO), with the major goal to identify causes of cancer, has classified RF fields as \u201cpossibly carcinogenic to humans,\u201d based on limited evidence of a possible increase in risk for brain tumors among cell phone users, and inadequate evidence for other types of cancer. So it is better to be safe. Some basic precautions one can take are - One should not sleep with the cell phone close to one\u2019s head or groin.Use of a handsfree calling system (wired or wireless) may be of use in reducing the radiation exposure to the head.Reduce the total calling time as much as possibleAvoid making calls in poor signal zones. If making calls in a poor signal coverage zone is necessary, use a handsfree cabled headset.",

            "answer_text": "According to the Brain Tumor Foundation of Canada, brain tumors are the leading cause of cancer death in children under the age of 20, now surpassing acute lymphoblastic leukemia. They are the third leading cause of cancer death in young adults ages 20-39. \u2013 Research published by Dr. Lennart Hardell indicates that brain tumor risk increases with more years of cell phone use. Proving the effects of cell phone radiation are cumulative with more hours of use, those with the most usage had a 300% increase in having a brain tumor on the same side as a cell phone was most used. The official technical abstract of this study can be found here: http://www.spandidos-publications.com/10.3892/ijo.2013.2111. Cell phones work by sending signals to (and receiving them from) nearby cell towers(base stations) using RF waves. This is a form of electromagnetic energy that falls between FM radio waves and microwaves. Like FM radio waves, microwaves, visible light, and heat, RF waves are a form of non-ionizing radiation. They don\u2019t have enough energy to cause cancer by directly damaging the DNA inside cells. RF waves are different from stronger (ionizing) types of radiation such as x-rays, gamma rays, and ultraviolet (UV) light, which can break the chemical bonds in DNA. At very high levels, RF waves can heat up body tissues. (This is the basis for how microwave ovens work.) But the levels of energy given off by cell phones are much lower, and are not enough to raise temperatures in the body. So, it's still a discussion of ponderers that whether cell phones do really cause brain tumor. ",
