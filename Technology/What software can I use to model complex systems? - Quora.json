You can get some hands-on exposure to NetLogo quickly via the Complexity Explorer (Santa Fe Institute) archived course Introduction to Complexity, led by Melanie Mitchell. (This course will run live again this summer - which means you can take the quizzes then and earn a certificate if you meet the criteria.) William Rand's course on Agent-Based Modeling is scheduled to start this summer.  Note: Melanie Mitchell's Introduction to Complexity book serves as a helpful companion to her introductory online course listed above.  Also: You can try Decision-Making in a Complex World, a free online course by the University of Groningen in the Netherlands. Part of the course provides an introduction to NetLogo.  ",
