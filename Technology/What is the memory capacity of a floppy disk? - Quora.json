            "answer_text": "Memory capacity ... how much and for how long ... of a floppy disk? I have some 8 inch floppies (1980 era), some 5 and a quarter (5.25\"), and then the 3 and a half (3.5\") -- of various flavors and formats ... including some written at 50 hz. For the time of the various formats, they held what was considered a lot of data. By they time they were obsolete, a box of them would barely hold your backups -- and you were upgrading to a different format. Some manufacturers created even different formats than \"standard\" (like Apple's use of the 3.5\" single sided and then double sided floppies), and special programs were created to allow interoperability. Some even ran the floppy motors at different speeds depending upon where on the disk(ette) the head was positioned for reading/writing. This allowed more to be written on the outside tracks than the inside tracks. (It is a \"2 pi\" circumference math problem.) The wikipedia article describes the most common in detail. It doesn't cover VAX boot floppies, for example, nor Data General formats, neither Apple's, nor rare examples of Plato floppy formats for microtutor (there were several, *ahem*). Some floppies were created with holes physically punched into certain places as ways to verify that software was purchased legally -- the type and spacing/location of the errors was used for the equivalent of today's verification methods. If you think of an IBM PC with 460k bytes, a 3.5\" floppy was adequate. Today's 32 gigabyte memory machines do not consider blueray as a reasonable backup media format. Think of a simple list of 355,590 English words (/usr/share/dict/words for example) -- no definitions, no suffixes/plurals, no thesarus ... it is about 3,722,800 bytes or eleven 360k floppies or four 1440k floppies.  The \"how long\" did the memory last? It is very determinate upon the storage conditions -- humidity and heat being two things that destroy the storage media. The plastic and oxide used is similar to reel to reel magnetic tape used for audio and data archiving. There are techniques of using water to soften the media, and then a one-time-only last reading of the data. Now, why did you ask this question? ",

            "answer_text": "There are several variables. A drive can use one or two sides, there can be typically 40 or 80 tracks and the density of the data on the track can vary. We use terms single density, double density an high density for the last one. The data on the track is divided into sectors. A single density disk could for example have nine sectors each 256 bytes. This would with 40 tracks and one side give capacity of 90 binary kilobytes or kibibytes. Disks of such type (single sides, single density) were used on some computers in the early 80s like Osborne 1. On the PC world at minimum double density disks were used. They originally had one side and eight sectors of 512 bytes. This gave capacity of 160 kibibytes. Later the second side was used (320 kB) and then the number of sectors was increased to nine giving 360 kB. HD floppies had 80 tracks and 15 sectors giving 1200 binary kilobytes. This was marked as 1.2 MB in a strange mixed binary/decimal unit. On 3.5 inch DD which came with IBM PC portable in 1986 had 80 tracks so it had double the capacity of a 5.25 inch DD floppy. HD 3.5 inch which came with PS/2 in 1987 had double the sectors i.e. 18 giving capacity of 1440 binary kilobytes or 1.44 MB in the mixed binary/decimal notation. Sometimes the term quadruple density was used for disks with DD and 80 tracks though not n the PC world. There were some third party software that allowed more capacity to be used. Methods included using 10 or 20 sectors respectively instead of 9 or 18. In some cases even 21 sectors could be used by interleaving sectors (using a different sector as the gap between sectors). Also often they put one or two extra tracks on the disks. These disks required a special driver to be read and can be a pain if you encounter them now. There probably were many more more exotic formats. I just touched the surface. ",
