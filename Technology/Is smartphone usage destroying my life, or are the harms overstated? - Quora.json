            "answer_text": "It depends on what you're talking about. Anything that talks about them and specifically states it the way you did in your question is almost certainly biased in some way. I specifically mean 'the harms'. Microwave ovens are far better shielded from blasting us with electromagnetic radiation, but that only applies to the frequency range that does the actual cooking, and it certainly doesn't block all of it. Every electrical device in your home gives off some. A phone in your pocket is quite close to your genitals and gives it off in a frequency range that has been known for decades to cause health problems. You're talking about the psychological aspects though. Television had a HUGE effect on daily life and social interaction. Once upon a time, it actually *increased* social interaction at home. Now, it usually decreases it. The key is in HOW it's used. If your phone is just taking you around to entertain yourself and you're not learning anything useful nor interacting with people, then it's quite possibly distracting you from important and healthy aspects of life. If you're learning things and interacting, then it could be one of the healthiest things you own. You're on quora, and i doubt you got the phone yesterday and this is the first website you've ever seen. If you haven't showered in weeks and have been skipping work or school to smoke weed and take lsd every few days and don't talk to anyone except on quora, then that might be a problem. Your question doesn't include details about the usage itself. Is alcohol harmful? That's similar to your question. I could use it for a flame for a variety of very useful/healthy things, or to clean/sterilize something, or a shot and a beer to help me sleep every once in awhile. There's likely more good than harm in those things. Alternatively, i could be drinking a pint of terrible vodka every single night for years, that's probably not good. ",
