            "answer_text": "In some ways it was, yes. Being interconnected all the time can feel stressful. It feels like the lines between the personal and professional have been blurred due to technology. We also feel a constant need to succeed because of social media, which isn\u2019t realistic, everybody needs down time. But there are a lot of ways that technology has made our lives easier. My great-grandmother had six children and she (obviously) was born before tech was around. So imagine this: you have no washing machine, so you have to wash clothes by hand, dishwashers don\u2019t exist (so you have to do dishes by hand), and you have no plumbing (my great-grandmother\u2019s house didn\u2019t have plumbing for a long time) so her family had to use an outhouse. She had to feed, clothe, cook for, and bathe 6 six kids (they all bathed in a giant kettle outside.) So that\u2019s 8 people to take care of total if you include herself and her husband, with 0 technology. A life like that sounds unbearable in my opinion, you\u2019d be exhausted every day. How would you find the time to be creative if all you ever did was household chores? Compared to a life like that, technology makes our lives infinitely easier. Housework is essentially automated now, so we save a lot more time. We can vacuum instead of sweep, put clothes in the dryer instead of having to hang them, etc. Housework is still a pain, but at least we have washing machines instead of washboards! If my great-grandmother was alive today, she\u2019d be shocked due to all the household tech. That\u2019s what my grandmother constantly tells me. She tells me that her mother (my great grandmother) would die of happiness if she had access technology like this back then. It would have made her life a lot easier. ",

I can order dinner and set delivery time so it\u2019ll be there when I\u2019m ready. My bills are on auto-pay so I don\u2019t have to worry if I paid or end up double paying. And I get to work from home while still having instant communications with my coworkers and supervisor. If anything, technology has made my life far less stressful. ",
