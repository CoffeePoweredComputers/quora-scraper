            "answer_text": "Ways AI and machine learning are facilitating average people\u2019s lives  The concepts of AI and machine learning aren\u2019t completely foreign to us as they have been heavily explored by popular media. There are lots of movies which have shown us a world where AI-enabled robots and machines hold the dominating power. And these have triggered, to a good extent, lots of negative impressions about AI and machine learning among the average people. However, despite how negatively movies demonstrate the power of AI and machine learning, these technologies are truly transforming average human lives into better ones. Let\u2019s explore the most common aspects that are being impacted by AI and machine learning. 1- Banking and financial services  It\u2019s hardly possible to count the number of people that have bank accounts. In addition, just consider the number of their associated facilities like credit cards which are in circulation. Now imagine how many hours human employees of these institutions would have to invest to sift through the transactions that are performed every day? And how much time and effort it would take to identify an anomaly? With the help of AI and machine learning, a huge number of banks and financial institutions have become able to review the quality of various applications and to analyze and predict risks, in an effort to make informed decisions. The so-called traditional industry is implementing AI and machine learning to increase user engagement. High-end technologies like predictive analysis, chatbots, voice recognition etc are helping minimize the gap between potential customers and financial institutions. These days, it\u2019s possible for any customer to contact any of these establishments anytime and from anywhere and receive real-time replies. 2- Healthcare services  Both AI and machine learning have already acquired a significant part in our well-being and health. From being utilized for faster patient diagnosis to the prevention of illnesses \u2013 these technologies are being used on a regular basis by lots of healthcare service providers. These days, it\u2019s possible to predict the potential health hazards a person may be susceptible to, depending on his/her genetic history, socio-economic status, age etc \u2013 which was simply unimaginable before the emergence of AI and machine learning. With the help of AI and machine learning-powered programs, healthcare service providers can cross-reference symptoms against databases that contain millions of cases of illnesses to expedite the process of diagnosing disease and illness, saving lives through faster and appropriate treatment. These technologies are also being adapted to expedite research works toward cures of different diseases. 3- Email  Almost every person uses email these days for a huge number of purposes. It may sound unlikely but your email inbox is a place where advanced technologies take place on a regular basis. There are two key aspects where email service providers use AI and machine learning. First comes the advanced spam filter. Unlike plain rule-based filters that aren\u2019t much effective against spam as spammers can update their messages quickly to work around them, advanced spam filters continually learn from a wide range of signals like message metadata, words in the message etc to prevent spam. Another aspect is smart email categorization. You\u2019ve probably seen that Gmail uses an approach to categorize the emails into primary, promotion, social inboxes. This is made possible with the help of AI and machine learning together with manual intervention from users. When some messages are marked in a constant direction by a user, a real-time increment to that threshold is performed by Google in order to achieve appropriate categorization. 4- Transportation industry  There\u2019s a heavy influence of AI and machine learning on the present transportation industry can be found. These technologies have been instrumental in lowering threats triggered by reckless driving via the deployment of automation and sensory management. There are vehicles that can understand their surrounding parameters and thus, can take precautionary measures whenever needed to ensure passenger safety. Apart from vehicles, AI and machine learningtechnologies are to be deployed soon to prevent traffic congestion on roads and for traffic management. 5- Taking over tedious and hazardous jobs  AI and machine learning can seem to be a boon to humanity when we consider the fact that they liberate humans and enable them to focus on tasks in which they excel. These technologies take care of a wide range of tedious tasks that have to be performed in order to attain different results. Machines excel in performing cumbersome tasks, leaving enough time and room for humans to focus on more creative aspects of a business. In the financial sector, for example, AI and machine learning help financial analysts to get some relief from the monotonous nature of their jobs and concentrate on deeper analysis and research of all-round customer experience. In the context of hazardous jobs like bomb disposal, welding etc, AI and machine learning are helping the professionals to a great extent. These days, machines are taking over those jobs with the help of human intervention. 6- Social networking  Almost everyone has experienced it several times. When a user uploads pictures to Facebook, the faces get highlighted automatically and the service suggests friends to tag. If you wonder how it can find out which of your friends are in the picture, Facebook uses AI and machine learning techniques to recognize faces. It also uses these technologies to personalize their users\u2019 newsfeed and ensure that they are viewing posts that interest them. Apart from Facebook, almost all other social networking platforms including Pinterest, Instagram, Snapchat etc leverage AI and machine learning to maximize user experience. 7- Online shopping  Online shopping has become almost an inevitable part of life for today\u2019s tech-savvy customers. Have you ever wondered how e-commerce websites quickly return with a collection of the most relevant items related to your search? AI and machine learning are technologies that make it possible. Personalized recommendations on their home page, product pages etc are also examples of their deployment. Fraud protection is another aspect where these technologies perform a great job. Here, AI and machine learning are deployed to not only avert fraudulent transactions but to lower the number of legitimate transactions that are declined because of being falsely marked as fraudulent. 8- Home security and home automation  When it comes to home security, these days, a significant number of homeowners are deploying cutting-edge systems are deploying high-end cameras and security systems powered by AI and machine learning. These systems are capable of building a catalog of the frequent visitors of a home and thus, can detect uninvited guests instantly. Smart homes also offer a multitude of different types of useful features such as providing notification when the kids come back from school etc. When combined with appliances, AI and machine learning can make household management and housework seamless. From allowing the refrigerator to communicate with the oven to replenishment of food and supplies \u2013 all have become possible. ",

            "answer_text": "The major goals of artificial intelligence also correspond to the traditional problems AI research intends to solve, as well as to the subsets and specific fields of AI. These goals are knowledge reasoning, planning, machine learning, natural language processing, computer vision, robotics, and artificial general intelligence. 1. Knowledge Representation and Reasoning Knowledge representation and reasoning, also known as KR&R or KR, is a specific field within artificial intelligence focusing on designing and implementing computer representations that can process information about the world to solve complex problems. As one of the major goals of AI, KR&R specifically aims to automate different kinds of reasoning. It involves the codification of factors or relationships between ideas, or rules or transitions between sets of facts in a manner that can be interpreted by a computer system. Some of the applications of knowledge representation and reasoning include a computer-aided diagnosis for assisting physicians to interpret medical images, as well as a natural-language user interface that involves using human language as input for interacting with computers or software. 2. Automated Planning and Scheduling Some times called AI planning, automated planning, and scheduling is another subset and field of artificial intelligence concerned with the automated generation of action sequences that correspond to strategies that can be executed by an AI system such as unmanned vehicles or autonomous robots. As one of the traditional problems of AI research, AI planning aims to mechanize and automate the generation of a plan based on predetermined goals and objectives, and a set of possible actions. Note that it is also one of the fundamental abilities needed to increase the autonomy and flexibility of AI systems. Examples of AI planning include self-correcting computer programs or software applications, robots that serve as autonomous agents, automated information gathering, and computer-aided suggestions. 3. Machine Learning Machine learning is both a specific field of artificial intelligence and an actual application of AI. As a field of discipline, it involves the study of algorithms and statistical models that computer systems use to perform a specific task without using explicit instructions effectively. Central to the concept of machine learning is a different approach to computer programming. To be more specific, it involves the development and use of computer algorithms that can process and analyze Big Data and learn from the outcome without being explicitly programmed. The benefits of machine learning include supplementing data mining, continuous improvements, and automation of tasks. Real-world applications include search engine ranking, content delivery, online advertising, autonomous driving, and intelligent assistant, among others. 4. Natural Language Processing Another major goal and subset of artificial intelligence is natural language processing or NLP. It deals with the analysis and generation of languages that humans use naturally to interface with computers. In other words, NLP is about human-computer interaction using natural language instead of computer language. Because it is also one of the traditional problems of AI, NLP aims to develop and implement computer systems, particularly computer programs that can process large amounts of natural language data. Achieving this aim means overcoming challenges such as speech recognition, natural language processing, and natural language generation. Intelligent assistant services such as Google Now and the Siri application from Apple Inc. use natural language processing, along with other subsets of artificial intelligence such as machine learning and knowledge representation and reasoning. 5. Computer Vision Computer vision involves acquiring and understanding visual data from still or moving digital images or live images from the real world to process them in a manner that AI systems can utilize to make decisions. The aim of computer vision, as one of the major problems in AI research, centers on the computerization and automation of tasks that can be performed naturally by human vision, as well as the development of systems that can process, interpret, and utilize visual data. Facial recognition is one of the notable applications of computer vision. Other applications include video tracking, automated image manipulation, object recognition, and integration with virtual reality and augmented reality. 6. Robotics Another one of the major goals and thus, one of the subsets and fields of artificial intelligence in robotics. Note that robotics is an interdisciplinary branch of engineering and science that includes computer science, electronic engineering, mechanical engineering, and information engineering. Robotics is about the design, construction, and operation of machines or robots that can replicate human actions and replace human tasks with mechanical tasks. The integration of computer science and AI in robotics corresponds to equipping robots with sensory feedback and information capabilities to allow them to operate autonomously. Current research in robotics aims to introduce commercial, domestic, and military applications. Online retailer Amazon has been using autonomous robots in its warehouse facilities with the task of organizing items and making warehouse operations more efficient. 7. Artificial General Intelligence The utmost and long-term goal of artificial intelligence as a field is artificial general intelligence or AGI. By definition, AGI demonstrates the capability of an AI system to perform any intellectual task that a human can perform. In consideration of the three types of AI systems introduced by Andreas Kaplan and Michael Heinlein, AGI demonstrates a humanized AI system equipped with cognitive intelligence, emotional intelligence, and social intelligence. An AI system with artificial general intelligence is either self-conscious, self-aware, or both. This system will demonstrate seamless capabilities of machine-to-human and machine-to-machine interactions that replicate normal human-to-human interactions. Artificial intelligence tech is being used in many fields and industries. Even the pet care industry is affected by AI tech, A project that I heard of that implements this is called Pawtocol. It is a blockchain-based AI system to make sure your pet gets all the nutrition it needs\u2014and you know it\u2019s high tech because there are two buzzwords in the sentence. The project is led by \u201ca team of experts\u201d which includes at least two dogs. Part of the system relies on Paws, a scanning device for \u201cincredibly accurate molecular analysis of pets.\u201d The Paws device uses \u201cphotospectrometry\u201d to check your pet\u2019s food and toys for toxins, vitamins, and minerals, which are then shared with the blockchain and digested by the systems\u2019 AI.

            "answer_text": "Cynically \u2026 to sell more software solutions . The AI badge is often used to try and convince others that a system/software is somehow better (cleverer). If that aim is removed from the possible set of aims. Then the next aim is for the system to think, but faster than us. This would create a faster rate of change in innovation and ideas - but it is a faulty assumption based on computers which are not AI architectures. So that Aim is probably eroneous. The need to sample at the rate the environment supplies information tends to regulate the performance of AI systems. So we are left with: to prove that we can do it (somewhat pointless). Or the only one that makes sense to me: to understand how we think, and what makes us conscious. This only has to happen once - so AIs taking jobs and dominating humans should not be an issue. There is one other aim\u2026 to build sophisticated weapon systems which are clearly expendable. I hope we can avoid that one. If you are thinking of computer based expert systems such a Medical diagnostics you don\u2019t need AI for such knowledge systems - Using deterministic computers - but be prepared for the system to cost a great deal to get then optimised . At least they can then be sold as advisor systems, but they are not AI. In that they are used by Doctors, feeding test data into the system. (Neural nets can have a use here). (Keeping systems free from the AI label but using them to model solutions is playing to the computer\u2019s strength) . Knowledge handling is OK as a computer program, it is the intelligence bit which requires access to our total domain (the environment). ",
