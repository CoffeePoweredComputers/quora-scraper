            "answer_text": "Shalom friend What you mean when you write: Technology? As for me technology was/is/will be everything done in the world. In some places the standard of living is very low, because their standards are low. In some places the technology is higher. Now, in order to live we need technologies. Different ones. Everywhere has its own local technology. The difference is due to the kind of materials available. IN some places the construction blocks are made of mud and in some places of concrete. So, these technologies are changed due to changes in life, people, weather, materials and manpower. The more the people are educated and experienced-that more they are looking for. Looking for new lives. they develop new construction methods, new food technologies for the industry, more medicines for the health ETC. All these are examples that answer and explain your question.

            "answer_text": "Into Huntsville, Alabama, NASA brought a coterie of German scientists to help design and build rockets. Their work changed the course of the town\u2019s history (and likely its menus, too). There is probably a really funny fish-out-of-water story associated with their journey and subsequent advancement of the state of the art. Perhaps an enterprising writer would like to share story credit with me for the suggestion. ",
