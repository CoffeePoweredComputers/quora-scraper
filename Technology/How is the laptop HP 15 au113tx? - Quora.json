            "answer_text": "As per its specs & price, its overpriced & not worth the money (also its a 65k laptop without 1080p display) For that budget, for gaming Asus R510JX is the best with best CPU & GPU under 70k (due to 4th gen quad core i7 & GTX 950M). It has 1080p display but no backlit keyboard Otherwise, you can buy this: HP Pavilion 15-AU116TX (7th Gen CORE i5 7200U|4GB|1TB|4GB Graphics NVIDIA|Windows 10) Silver Add another 8GB DDR4 RAM worth 3.5k. Buy a 1TB ext HDD worth 4k. This HP laptop has 1080p display, in case you are wondering. As far as gaming is concerned, GT 940MX would run the latest games smoothly at lowest settings at 720p (high end games releasing next year might not run smoothly). It\u2019s i5 7200U is nowhere near i7 4720HQ in terms of performance. For gaming, if you can increase budget by 10k & get this laptop: Dell Inspiron Core i7 - (8 GB/1 TB HDD/8 GB SSD/Windows 10 Home/4 GB Graphics) Y567502HIN9 7559 Notebook Rs.75990 Price in India - Buy Dell Inspiron Core i7 - (8 GB/1 TB HDD/8 GB SSD/Windows 10 Home/4 GB Graphics) Y567502HIN9 7559 Notebook Black With Red Accents Online - Dell : Flipkart.com It has 6th gen quad core i7 & GTX 960M (it can run all current games at 1080p medium setting smoothly & should easily run all games for next 3\u20134 years). Also it has a M.2 SSD slot & a good battery life for a gaming laptop. I highly recommend Dell Inspiron 7559 (its officially priced at 95k but don\u2019t know why its available at 75k, better get it soon from FK) ",

            "answer_text": "For me this models is not good enough but you can pick any from below specs as they cost almost same amount as of 113TX.1)Asus R510JX-DM230T2)Lenovo 80SV001SIH3)Dell Inspiron 15 5559So do check & compare them before choosing any one.You can consider HP model but personally I am not happy with HP as it does not support well for gaming & multitasking. So it's just my opinion you can pick any one from above. ",
