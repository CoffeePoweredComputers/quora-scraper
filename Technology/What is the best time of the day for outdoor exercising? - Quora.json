            "answer_text": "I would argue early in the morning. The air is fresh. There isn\u2019t much traffic. Most people are still asleep, and it\u2019s pretty fulfilling to know that you are starting your day on a productive note. Of course, there\u2019s the sunrise, morning birds and idyllic stillness that comes with the dawn. Now, you can argue that you may not be a morning person. I wasn\u2019t one either. But that\u2019s the power of outdoor exercise. It\u2019s the real power to change. You can become a morning person. Exercise, after all, wakes you up better than anything.  I\u2019ve run almost every morning, around 6am or earlier. It\u2019s really the best time to experience the world, and get in the hard work before the day begins. Trust me, you feel so much better, so much more relieved from stress, if you start your day with exercise. ",
