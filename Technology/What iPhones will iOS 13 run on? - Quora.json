Let\u2019s look at the statistics: iPhone 4 came with iOS 4 and received iOS 7 -> 4 years of support and 3 major updates iPhone 4S came with iOS 5 and received iOS 9 -> 5 years of support and 4 major updates iPhone 5 came with iOS 6 and received iOS 10 -> 5 years of support and 4 major updates iPhone 5S came with iOS 7 and received iOS 12 -> 6 years of support and 5 major updates (So far!) Since iOS 12 was designed to optimize the experience of older iPhones, I don\u2019t think iPhone 5S will receive iOS 13. So if I were to guess, I would say the iPhones that will receive iOS 13 will be: iPhone 6, 6S, 7, 8, X, XS, XR and SE. ",

(Those months are guesses from past experience, Apple has made no announcements of availability in any way yet. They routinely don\u2019t hint those things.) ",
