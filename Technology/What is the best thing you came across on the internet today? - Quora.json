            "answer_text": "Five fascinating pictures\u2026. 1\u2026.  That guy has something wrong with his eyes, right? True, but it\u2019s not only the eyes but the whole face. What this gentleman wears is a full face covering prosthetic mask to avoid facial recognition. In times where we are more and more heading towards a world like 1984 or a Brave New World, these masks could be very useful for people with opinions that are not shared by the masses. You might think we aren\u2019t that far, but check out that video of a school in China which uses face scanners to let the students in. Actually a good way to use it, a possible predator can\u2019t enter, but like every other technology it can be used for good and bad. Companies are already developing \u201cface bases\u201d \u2014 faces without noses, mouths, ears or facial hair. A user can swap parts in and out for a new look every day. 2\u2026.  An elderly Afghan man offers some tea to a U.S. soldier in Kabul. The name of the photographer is Rafiq Maqbool, and it was taken in 2009 when the fight against the Taliban was in full motion. A little act of kindness and internatonal understanding in difficult times, shown in an incredible act of hospitality. Yes, this picture has been posted many times already but I think it can be reposted from time to time to remind ourselves that war is never a solution, but if it happens we need to make the best out of it. 3\u2026.  Galileo Galilei\u2019s first-ever drawings of the moon after observing it through his telescope in 1609. Just as much as Newton, Copernicus, Da Vinci or Carl Friedrich Gauss, he was far ahead of his time. For in the sciences the authority of thousands of opinions is not worth as much as one tiny spark of reason in an individual man. Besides, the modern observations deprive all former writers of any authority, since if they had seen what we see, they would have judged as we judge. - quote GG 4\u2026.  The U.S. Northrop Grumman B-2 bomber resembles the peregrine falcon when diving from the skies. The plane had its 30-year anniversary just last year, and was obviously a product of the Cold War. The Peregrine is the fastest bird in the world, with one indivdual tracked with the highest measured of speed of 389 km/h (242 mph). It shows perfectly that nature still does the best designs and we can learn a lot of observing it. 5\u2026.  There is a question about a 20 year gap photo here on Quora, this here is a 71-year gap. Same girl, same bike, unfortunately just the dog is missing. I hope we all could do such a picture some day too and maybe post it here on Quora ;-) ",

            "answer_text": "These are the most amazing ideas I saw on the internet today\u2026 Most of the time, when you lose a wallet or your keys, it\u2019s game over. However, this clever tile attachment works as a Bluetooth tracker so you can locate your lost item using your smartphone. Just make sure not to lose all three. 2. These innovative batteries are embedded with a USB interface on the side so you can dole out the electronic juice with ease while on the go.  3. This clever ironing board serves more than one purpose to help satisfy your getting ready needs. With a mirror attached to the other side of the board, a simple flip will save you from having to go from room to room.  4. This puck uses a small Stirling engine to harness the power of hot and cold drinks and convert it into energy. A resourceful concept that urban coffee shops could certainly get behind to help prevent electricity freeloaders.  5. Considering how much we\u2019ve grown to rely on our phones, they are usually always within reach. Keys? Not as much. Instead of fumbling around once you get to your front door, this system allows you to unlock with a quick tap of your screen.  6. This separate-cooking pan allows you to fry up multiple foods without having them turn into one giant blob.  7. This parking garage system uses lights as indicators to show whether a spot is vacant or not so you can stop circling around aimlessly.  8. Public transit often uses signs to indicate specific seats that should be given up for those in need. However, this bus takes it a step further by having the seats upholstered to show that it\u2019s a designated courtesy seat.  9. This innovative highlighter has a cut-out section in the tip so you can see exactly what you\u2019re highlighting.  10. Most cars\u2019 back seats don\u2019t take knees into consideration. However, this vehicle has indented spots so you can sit comfortably without having to involuntarily resort to the fetal position.  11. Knowing when your slices of bread are perfectly toasted can be quite a gamble with the average toaster. This transparent toaster eliminates the need for repeated pop up checks.  \u201cEvery once in a while , a new technology, an old problem and a big idea turns into an innovation\u201d ~ Dean kamen Keep smiling !!
