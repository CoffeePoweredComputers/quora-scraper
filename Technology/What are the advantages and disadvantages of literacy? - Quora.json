            "answer_text": "Advantages: Easier to communicate certain information in certain conditionsPeople don\u2019t need to have good memory they can just rely on reading/writingPeople being literate just looks better to some peopleDisadvantages: Consumes many resources (every year more than 4 billion trees or 35% of trees are used for producing paper)Linked to poor visionLinked to poor health (nausea)Don\u2019t need to be literate for survival, unnecessary and unused in many conditions (can still learn the majority of things using oral language (audio), images, video)Possibly causes bad memory (prior to literacy becoming popular people use to orally recite hundreds of pages now in modern times many find it difficult to remember an eight item grocery list)Seems that the human brain was never specified for literacy\u2026notice that we\u2019re all born illiterate, automatically understanding oral language at early ages without being taught to but our brain doesn\u2019t automatically understand written languageCauses people to not talk much and become bad speakers, a lot of people can read/write well but can\u2019t speak well, stutter, mumble, don\u2019t speak clearlyDoesn\u2019t really solve any problem (Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Trinidad & Tobago have extremely high literacy rates and also very high homicide rates)I think that encouraging literacy was a big mistake in human history. We shouldn\u2019t have forced literacy\u2026the people who care about it can become literate but it might be better to have only like 10% or less literacy and have people learn naturally the way the brain was designed to learn (through audio/images/video rather than through reading/writing). This might cause people to learn quicker, better, and more efficiently as well. I\u2019m disappointed that the media and society focuses so much time and effort on literacy and ignores things like homicide rates, crime rates, and health as if literacy matters more. ",
