            "answer_text": "Does anyone use razors with replaceable double-edged blades anymore? Yes, I\u2019ve used them since 2014, and I love them.  Seems like they are growing in popularity - even Gillette has started making double edge razors again. I used to use the two bladed cartridge razors, then I tried the three blade ones. One day, buying more, I was stunned at the price. I\u2019d been trying the thing where you strop your cartridge on a pair of blue jeans to extend the life of the blades and while i was looking for more ideas for saving money I read that double edged razors were making a comeback. So I got one and tried it.  Today I shave with a Merkur 39c razor, and use Astra Platinum blades. The blades cost about ten cents a piece and give me 7 to 10 shaves each.  I enjoy shaving. With a safety razor you must pay attention, but that can be half the fun. I\u2019m right handed, and I started shaving with my left hand a couple years back - a bit of an adventure at first. The cartridge razors have their advantages. They are easy. As far as I can tell, you will never cut yourself with one of the cartridge razors. I used to shave in the shower without a mirror. They are easy, they are forgiving, they are expensive. It takes a small bit of skill to use a double edged blade, yes, you can knick yourself. You have to buy the razor up front, thats $12 at the low end, over $100 at the high end. The ones I use the most cost $25 and $56 - the shave is the same, the German one is more nicely made. Frankly I think 3, or 4, or 5 blades is silly, what you get is a lot of blades scraping on skin. Heated blades? You can just rinse the razor under warm water. ",

            "answer_text": "Just used one this morning. I would say I\u2019m a part of the \u201cwet shaving\u201d movement (which never made sense to me because I never heard of a dry shave) in that I own multiple safety razors, and straight razors. I\u2019m a history fan as well; so I find a bit of joy in knowing that the razor I use was made when people like Theodore Roosevelt and Johnny Cash were alive and kicking.  (A straight razor, the same model I use now. Made in the 1890s.)  (A safety razor, not mine, but very similar to one that I own. Made in the 1920s.) As for why people still use them, I began using it because I joined the military, and went from shaving once every 2 weeks to shaving every day. When my sensitive skin became red and gained ingrown hairs every day, I had a friend recommend a safety razor over a standard cartridge because it only uses one blade instead of 4 or 5 for every pass. Since then, I\u2019ve enjoyed the many different types of soaps and other items that\u2019s turned shaving from a terrible chore into a fun hobby. I highly recommend anyone to invest the money in getting a Gillette Super Speed from the 50s off of eBay. Proraso green soap is my favorite, along with a boar brush. ",
