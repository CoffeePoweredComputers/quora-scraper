            "answer_text": "Original question: Who created the first guitar patent? Probably William B. Tilton. The standard acoustic guitar design has been around for centuries, long before the first patent laws were written to protect inventors\u2019 rights. There have been a huge number of innovations that improved on the original guitar - bracing, tuners, saddles, bridges, truss rods, etc. - and then there are innovations in amplification from the first use of steel strings to resonator cones and then onboard pickups and full electric guitars. C.F. Martin & His Guitars, 1796-1873, a book by Philip Gura, discusses a US patent #8,338 by William Tilton from 1851 for bracing techniques for violins, guitars, and other stringed instruments to increase the strength of the top, Patent #10,380 from 1854 for the innovation of a guitar tailpiece that further improved string tension. Tilton also received Patent #14,378 from 1856 for a circular metal disc in the soundhole, plus another patent that covered slanted alignment of the wood grain for improved tone. These are probably the first patents that specifically call out guitar applications. Walter Carter\u2019s The Martin Book: A Complete History of Martin Guitars discusses the early days of the C.F. Martin Company, describing the earliest instruments with an option for \u201cpatent screws\u201d used on 2 instruments sold in 1836 when Martin was a merchant in New York rather than a producer. These are elaborate scrolled tuners similar to those found on violins, raising the value of the guitar by 50% compared to wooden pegs. ",

            "answer_text": "It was not so much invented as evolved. If you think of the mythical dead tortoise with sinews story (Ancient Narrative) you can imagine the roots go back to antiquity. You just have to decide at what point did an instrument with strings and a neck sticking out becomes a \u201cguitar\u201d. In Portuguese, guitar is called viola still today. Over 500 years ago you had the viola da mano and the viola da gamba. One was for plucking and one was for bowing. You can see/hear a viola da mano here:  Note the waist which gave room for a bow to play at an angle and gives a guitar its characteristic hourglass shape. The first instrument to be called guitar had four pairs of strings and was small. You can here one here:  By the 17th century, the guitar had five pairs of strings. You can hear a Baroque guitars all over Youtube. If I may be so bold, you can hear me playing one here:  If you want to hear a professional, there are many, but check this out, a real Stradivari guitar:  Single strung 6 string guitars appeared in the second half of the 18th century.
