            "answer_text": "Not gonna happen\u2026 That\u2019s the thing about unlimited data plans. They\u2019re really Unlimited*, not unlimited (by literal definition). The asterisk makes a significant difference. An Unlimited* plan means you have more data available than the average person would need, but ultimately there is a cap or limit. Usually, once you get to that limit, you continue to have unlimited data, but it\u2019s not high-speed data.  The best option is to contact the sales department and ask what the upcharge or additional charge would be to add more data to your plan. When I had this conversation with my ISP, I had to push the point as they said it was not something they do nor customers need. Yet every month I was well exceeding my allotted data. After escalating the matter, I was quoted a price to add another 500GB of data to my home internet bill.  In terms of a mobile carrier, the same thing applies. You\u2019ll have to contact customer support/sales and request a higher monthly data allowance or higher end (non-advertised) plan. Either way, expect to pay more money. One trick I\u2019ve seen quite a few do is to open up a second line on the plan. Often carriers will pool the data together and it\u2019s shared among both devices. As you\u2019re only using one device, you\u2019ll have access to the entire pool on the one device. You may have to buy or borrow a cheap smartphone to enable service out the gate.  Short of that, know that you\u2019re stuck under some variant of an Unlimited* plan. Even on the business side of things I\u2019ve had the same troubles. Sure I have a business unlimited plan, but in the contract, there\u2019s reference of a data limit. ",

            "answer_text": "Due to the fact that unlimited means it never stops you will never get to the unlimted usage. But usually what it means is that there are no limits to the amount of data you have access to at your assigned data speeds. so if you want to push those limits then stream as much video you want and download as many large files as you can find. And if you are just trying to push limits then you would set those things up in continuous loops. Now what you can accomplish doing this is not very exciting or fun but it will keep data flowing to you. At the end of the day this basically just allows you to access any and all data available whenever you want without restrictions of some kind. but you might want to check what the actual message is because some \u2018unlimited\u2019 plans will still slow access after a specified amount of data has been transferred.
