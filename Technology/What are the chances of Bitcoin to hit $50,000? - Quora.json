            "answer_text": " Yes, it does and I will tell you exactly why. I will actually dare to make a prediction now for the start of the next bull run and there is a reason for that. You have all heard about ETF right? There is something that is bigger than ETF. Bakkt CEO explains NYSE-backed crypto-platform Do you know NYSE, the New York Stock Exchange? They are the LARGEST stock exchange in the whole world, amassing a total market cap of 23 TRILLION dollars. That is 100x bigger than all of crypto. Now, they have decided to open a crypto exchange together with Starbucks and Microsoft including crypto investment products such as 401(k) and possibly credit cards. The NYSE's Owner Wants to Bring Bitcoin to Your 401(k). Are Crypto Credit Cards Next? Now, the big guys are coming and there is one thing that makes all the difference, they will physically back their leveraged trading with Bitcoin. That means, they will need to buy the Bitcoin first from the market, driving up the price. When will this happen? It\u2019s exciting to do this work as the end of a busy summer approaches and an even busier fall awaits. An evolving market \u2013 Bakkt Blog \u2013 Medium\u201d So, now they will have to buy up all the Bitcoin they need until fall probably until they open the exchange in November. That\u2019s why I will now make a prediction that the bull market will start in late September, throughout October, November while BAKKT buys up lots of Bitcoin and reach its peak in December, January when actual investors buy Crypto-derivatives on Bakkt. This timing is quite similar to last year, however, I don\u2019t tie the timing of the bull run to the bull run of last year at all, I tie it to Bakkt. With Bakkt being announced, ETFs now also have a much higher chance to be approved now, because the big guys (Microsoft, Starbucks, NYSE) have made their move and politicians approving an ETF will be seen as smart, since the big guys also do it. That\u2019s why the SEC is probably reviewing ETFs again. Follow the herd. An ETF approval will add extra fuel to the fire. Conclusion Institutional money now has a definite date, November. This is alongside the very positive sentiment and strong traction among the first coins already. I predict the bull market to start in late September, reaching a Bitcoin price of $20,000 throughout October, November and reach its peak of $50,000-$100,000 in December, January or even $150,000 with a bit of luck. Looking at an average multiple of 17x and a maximum multiple of 40x, this is within the normal range. If you want to know which are the best coins to buy in September, check out my answer yesterday.

            "answer_text": "There is no use asking about the price, we seem to be stuck in a range for now, and you just have to look at the emotional undertones of the crypto market are quite dangerous right now. The average person is swamped by bears calling death to crypto, and talking about seeing the price never go up on crypto again!. In one instance we hear saber rattling, and a newbie to crypto selling his mortgage back in JAN 2018 to buy into bitcoin. This guys needs a reality check! You should never ever put money into crypto you CANNOT AFFORD TO LOSE! <- read that last part again! I Share more with my VIP members - HERE. It seems the world has gone crazy with crypto and bitcoin this week. It seems people are losing their minds and their bank accounts, and all hell is breaking loose! At what point did we lose all rationality and throw all commonsense out the window in this new world called crypto! Feels like one of our platoon has stepped on a minefield this week and we have to stay behind and clean up the mess!? Right?.. We look around social media this week, and it seems that people have lost their mind, and their money and there is no where to turn. It reminds us of a Vietnam vet wounded in battle, bleeding, gushing, and dying in battle, and in so much pain they have simply had enough, and begging the lord jesus above to put them out of their misery and beg him to take them home!  In other pockets of the internet some crypto traders simply dont know where to turn. As they lay out on the stretcher, in agony, lets us act as the medic, and at least attempt to take some of the pain away for you. Right now the crypto market has very thin volume, and investors are looking for solid underbelly support. We have not seen this the last few days. There have been some shallow attempts, but this is no cause for concern. When we study the data from the CBOE, The larger smart money is not wanting to touch bitcoin right at the moment. To say there is thin volume and lack of interest would be an understatement. They too [larger crypto funds] dont want to dive on a LIVE GRENADE! You can either panic sell, and move out of the road, or realize there is so much good news not being reported and so many earth shattering, developments in crypto behind the scenes you feel blessed to be witness to this rather awesome historical event. The choice is really yours to make. The reason for the rather NEGATIVE events you have seen in crypto land the last few days, is due to 2 reasons\u2026. 1) LACK OF REGULATION OVERSIGHT! 2) INCREASE IN CRYPTO FRAUD & ILLEGAL ACTIVITIES So the question is not will BTC 50,000 come soon, the question is when will this 2 major problems get fixed. You dont have to step out of the square too far to realize that big institutes with larger amount of money ready to siphon into crypto are quite hesitant right now, due to the scrutiny over illegal activities happening in all corners of crypto-land, and this is forcing them to stay on the sidelines. [For now anyway] Sure our reports are have been hinting massive INSTITUTIONAL support for crypto currency, but specific players are really waiting for news of an ETF based fund, or vehicle they can trade before giving themselves the all clear to simply DIVE IN! Based on our evidence we doubt that will be happening SEPTEMBER 2018, so forget the nonsense and rumors circulating out there. We can blame goldman and other banks for manipulating the prices the last few days, but we have talked with some rather large funds today and main reason they are scared about bitcoin and cryptocurrencies in general is that as you read this, there are BILLIONS of dollars of fraud infiltrating the crypto landscape on any given day. And these big guys feel they are in danger without regulation and the proper authoritative counter measures being put in place to STOP this. There are so many issues at play and then you get the greedy cry-baby \u201cI want to be rich by tomorrow\u201d type investors who feel the world owes them and feel they will get rich by investing in crypto without first do the proper research first. That is why we are utilizing our blockchain software and chatter bot to help keep us ahead of \u201cthe game\u201d in times of need. This is intended to help you more than you have ever been helped before as an investor, Especially times like now where there is so much uncertainty around the traps! There is a magnitude of things to deal with right now. We understand investors might be underwater and hurting really bad right now. But do not let that deter you away from the fact that crypto is here to stay, and NO, we do not believe this is just going to wither away into the cold quiet night, and just fizzle out into \u201cblack hole\u201d of nothingness!. We can hear the yelling in the dark of night, the terror and the blood curdling noise of shear panic and utter devastation coming from investors. We can clearly see that the last few days have been painful! But we are so early in the crypto game here, that is not even worth listening to. We must warn you to keep alerted and dont get your ears burnt by listening to the wrong person at the wrong time. Once you see the complicated happenings with bitcoin, and the underlying problems we keep discussing with our members you can see how these turbulent times are not over. If we had to categorize the Cryptozoic landscape right now, we would compare it to that of being in CAVEMEN DAYS, like we have hinted at before. So its there is an evolution process to what is happening here, meaning a series of problems are occurring but its just a matter of time before they are resolved. Remember for every problem there is a solution. :-) Eventually fraud and manipulations will be able to be better controlled, but right now its more like watching a death deifying scene from a movie like MAD MAX! It may seem like MAYHEM and complete and utter chaos, but please realize every investment boom in the past did not come without its flaws, and problematic events. So there is nothing more to do right now is sit beside elon with a glass of whiskey, strap yourself in and ENJOY the ride, you are witnessing history at its best!
