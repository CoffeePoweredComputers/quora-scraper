            "answer_text": "Not sure about the cost of DVD's now but it is considered OLD SCHOOL now. There are very few people in this society today who like watching their movies on DVD's.. Thanks to the PPV (Pay Per View) channels provided by most of our cable operators - we almost always have a good collection on movies/documentaries/musicals etc within our homes. I would say the production costs of the DVD should have risen now as there are less sales compared to the previous years...less sales means less profits... less profits mean less funds for overheads...hence, all this affects your final DVD price and production. A little understanding of what is a DVD and a little about its background As per Wikipedia, DVD is a digital optical disc storage format, invented and developed by Philips, Sony, Toshiba, and Panasonic in 1995. DVDs offer higher storage capacity than compact discs while having the same dimensions.Pre-recorded DVDs are mass-produced using molding machines that physically stamp data onto the DVD. Such discs are known as DVD-ROM, because data can only be read and not written or erased. Blank recordable DVD discs (DVD-R and DVD+R) can be recorded once using a DVD recorder and then function as a DVD-ROM. Rewritable DVDs (DVD-RW, DVD+RW, and DVD-RAM) can be recorded and erased multiple times.DVDs are used in DVD-Video consumer digital video format and in DVD-Audio consumer digital audio format, as well as for authoringAVCHD discs. DVDs containing other types of information may be referred to as DVD data discs.      ",

            "answer_text": "The cost has done down a lot. Mostly they are burned today with automated arms that pick up a disk, put it in a burner and then stack it to be put into sleeves. I had a job where we had a limited run DVD burner/printer that would burn an image and print a full disk color label on it.  If you don't want to do it yourself even FedEx Kinko's can burn DVDs now. Generally it costs about $1.50 per disk with printing and a sleeve for about 1,000 disks. ",
