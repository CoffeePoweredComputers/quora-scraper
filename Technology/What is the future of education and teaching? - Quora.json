            "answer_text": "Like all of us, education would like a crystal ball to look into the future. Unfortunately, education tends to respond to current and near future trends. Or worse, it reacts to sudden shortfalls of certain knowledge and skill sets. Of course, education should be there for the here and now. For instance, with the global pandemic, there will doubtless be a rush to educate and \u2018train up\u2019 many students to enter jobs within the scientific field. I believe some future educational needs are already emerging in the form of the need for knowledge bases relating to sustainable agriculture, energy sources and recyclable issues. As the other answer points out, knowledge is incredibly dynamic. This is particularly noted in the field of technology, where the opportunities for education to meet the needs of societies continues unabated. This has already altered to role of the teacher immeasurably. I also, think there will be a greater need for \u2018joined up thinking\u2019 in terms of survival of the planet\u2019s biodiversity, and how education can be harnessed to bring about answers to the problems facing the local to global environment. Perhaps there should be a citizen of the world certificate that all human beings must complete, which should include conditions, such as responsibilities to each other and the planet, irrespective of place of birth or any other biographical details. Education uses the currency of knowledge, in this way \u2018knowledge is power\u2019, BUT more importantly knowledge is for sharing \u2013 and this is what should happen in the future, for everyone.

            "answer_text": "Education is quite dynamic and organic (This means, it keeps changing, and it has life.) Anything that is organic, keeps evolving constantly, and the course of evolution is not predictable. Teaching which is an integral component of Education is also dynamic, but not organic. It is to some extent synthetic for it is controlled by \u2018human factor\u2019. Teaching has been making changes (better to call it adjustments) to cope with the changes in education. This being the case, predicting the possible teaching scenario in the future is a difficult prospect. But one thing can be said with some amount of certainty. Digital platforms will be here to stay for some time and they will lend support to teaching. Whether the education (which is organic) will accept this change, we need to wait and watch. Read a story called \u2018The Fun They Had\u2019 by Isac Asimov. This might give you some answers. ",
