            "answer_text": "You are probably looking for Vocaloid. It is probably the most advanced voice synthesizer out there. It uses actual human samples to create realistic vocal performances. You can make Vocaloid sing any melodies and any lyrics in Japanese, Korean and English (I believe there are other languages in the works). Complete  recordings and live performances have been made with Vocaloid and it is actually quite big in Japan. Search in Youtube for Vocaloid and you will hear some interesting examples. ",
