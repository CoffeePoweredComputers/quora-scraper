            "answer_text": "YES. Hell Yeah !. We have the manpower, resources , knowledge to create a technology that can takes us to other planets or galaxies. Our humanity main goal is to explore other planets for our survival and that we should not get extinct.  Everyone should work together on this. In fact the job or life we are having should be focused on this. Instead what we are doing in this real life. We are trying to earn money (which is nothing but a man made virtual material). We are working hard and giving our own life to earn that useless money and to spend that for other useless things.  It's very,very  difficult for the humans to become an interstellar civilization as long as  we are living in a money based economy. In this world everyone is running for money. But once we have an economy based on technology and eliminate the money concept and work towards our human future, we will become an Interstellar Civilization. ",

            "answer_text": "Even if we were immortal, it would be enormously long to get from place to place. I think there would be a lot of strain among the crew during the journey. Then you have time dilation problems where you get to Alpha Centari in 100 years and 600 have happened on Earth. Of course there are gimmicks that have been proposed. Wormholes are the leading favorite but even then you might have time effects, the journey would be short to you but centuries to the outside world. My favorite is hollowing out an asteroid and living in it as you cruise the galaxy. I think that may be the only way but it would be far from being a civilization, more like nomads. I imagine there are problems with this too. ",

            "answer_text": "I doubt that humans will start an interstellar civilization, but the descendents of artificial life forms that we created may very well do so.     There is, as far as I know, no law of physics that precludes the existence of a self-replicating physical system that needs only radiation and minerals to sustain itself.   Such physical systems could be self-aware beings.   These beings could survive without depending on any planet, and so be able to colonize solar systems through the simple expedient of moving into them and locating mineral resources on low-gravity objects like asteroids.
