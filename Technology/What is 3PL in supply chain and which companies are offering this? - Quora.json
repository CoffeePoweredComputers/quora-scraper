            "answer_text": "Third Party Logistics (or 3PL) companies help businesses manage their supply chain. In any supply chain, there are producers, distributors, wholesalers, retailers, and end-users (companies or consumers) who are the final receivers. Effective companies are realizing that by garnering the knowledge of 3PL\u2019s, they can actually improve their bottom line and focus on their true core competencies, which is usually manufacturing or selling products, not necessarily logistics and transportation. So, rather than maintaining a staff to manage the trucking, shipping, warehousing, technology and all of those vendor and carrier relationships, companies are leveraging the established and extensive network of 3PLs. Much like financial traders have real-time visibility into the stock market, 3PL\u2019s know the transportation market, from which carriers best service those routes, to carrier and driver reliability and safety, and specific market costs and surcharges. Major 3PLs, like Trailer Bridge, are able to leverage global partnerships, assets and infrastructure to manage and deliver the best end to end transit options by lane, product or commodity. When working with a 3PL, companies are able to garner the most up to date market knowledge and transportation support for a customer\u2019s supply chain. ",

            "answer_text": "3PL is short for third party logistics. It is when a company hires a third party company for its logistics and shipping requirements. There are many companies working as 3PL and they are all growing because of growth in online delivery startups. Companies that sell online and have just started are not strong enough to have their own delivery network. They need some third party help and for that one of the best options is Varuna .net. This one company has flexible pricing plans and their services are decently fast. This is the time when people have the option of single day deliveries on various websites. This is the reason why startup delivery businesses need to hire a 3PL that offers fast delivery. Fast delivery and return increase the trust of customers and make sure that they stay. Varuna .net is a company that will not disappoint any business that trusts them with their logistics needs. ",
