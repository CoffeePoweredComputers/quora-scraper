            "answer_text": "I\u2019m working on my degree right now and I also have a different one also based on IT, but I have never learned IT from school, university etc. When I was 13 I got an internet connection for the first time and I was amazed at all the things I could do. I\u2019ve started being more interested in PCs and just played around with the settings and figuring out what everything does. A year passed, I started watching videos on YouTube for special effects, so I grabbed After Effects and started playing around with it. This was before there was an abundance of tutorials all around. After I learned a bunch of things about editing, I wanted to try programming so I looked around the internet for \u201chello world\u201d-like code and tried to understand it and how everything ties together. A couple years passed and I became interested in Web development. This is where I started to get a lot more serious about programming and by that time, there were enough tutorials to get me started. So basically, I learned everything by trial and error mostly, just played around with a bunch of stuff, trying to figure out how they work. After that I searched for clients and made websites for a couple people in my city. I said I haven\u2019t really learned anything from school regrading IT, because by the time I got there, I already knew most of the things that the teachers taught. Today you can just grab a book or finish courses like \u201cIntroduction to Computer Science\u201d by Harvard on the website edx.org. That website has a lot of courses for pretty much anything and most of them are free. Good luck! ",

            "answer_text": "I\u2019ve been in IT for over 15 years. I have a BS degree but in a completely unrelated field. Outside of one Python class I took as an elective, I didn\u2019t have any technical courses as an undergrad. My early IT experience was self-taught on an old 8088 computer. This was back in the early-90\u2019s when the Intel 486 processor had just come out. Because the 8088 was such an old processor relative to new computers at the time, I had to learn MS-DOS, BASIC, as well as setting up my own BBS (basic dial-up service providers, a precursor to AOL, MSN, etc). Real basic stuff compared to the nice games and applications normal people had access to. The main motivation for learning was largely boredom to be perfectly honest. When I somehow convinced my parents into buying a computer with a 486DX2\u201366 CPU, I was able to play some decent games, albeit after messing around with memory managers, CD-ROM drivers, etc. I became the go-to person for advice on technical issues among friends and family strictly from learning the ins and outs of computers trying to get them to run DOS games properly. Because this was largely self-taught, I never thought I could get a real job in IT without certifications or a degree until a dear friend of mine pushed me into applying for a few of them. To my utter surprise, I got a few offers and the rest is history. On a side note, there was one client I had very early on that had her MS in Computer Science that would frequently tap me for technical help. She was very sweet and never held her MS above me, but I always felt it was strange that despite her degree, I often had to help her with what I felt were rudimentary technical issues. Made me realize that a degree can only get you so far. ",

            "answer_text": "In South Africa there are a permanent skills shortage. So I did a MCSE certification boot camp, wrote the exams and did not get work in Systems. Then y2k :) My goal was always databases, and in 2005 I managed to \u201cget in\u201d. I worked for Sybase and some companies that have customers that has nice big databases, but I specialize mostly in MS SQL. I do think a degree would have made it a lot easier. I would have missed out on the journey and the knowledge of how to get where I am. I have in the last years tried to finish a BCom degree but between work, marriage, kids, divorce and life - lost momentum and made me question what use it will have for me? These days I am a Database Architect, but I believe in continued learning, (a spending more time on quora than I should, it does not help:) and still have the most fun fixing and prodding systems. So if you can do a degree, do that, it is a investment, and will make your life and goals easier to achieve. Persevere. Have good ethics and Work hard, work smart, and the most important - learn smart. ",

Except you only learn programming for the first 2 years. 3rd year is oriented on project/company creation and most people start working part time in real IT jobs from there. 4th year is a mandatory foreign exchange where you get better at english but do nothing programming wise. Most people keep working remotely part time. And last year is making an \u201cinnovative\u201d big project all year long. I had the chance to go to Japan after my second year and found a Job. Didn\u2019t see the point of doing 3 more years and spending 40k euros more on it. So I stopped. ",

Without the degree , it's a lot harder because college prepares you to face issues that are current with use of current tools or applications . They also teach you how to do presentations right for topics covered in the semester. People without tech degree don't have in depth knowledge of the subject matter and crash courses are only like spark notes for people. ",

There are many people even in my circle they are the drop out from the university. But they have skills; they are good programmers and designers. They are working with some good companies and making real cash. In IT if you have enough skills to serve the customers, a degree doesn't matter much (depending on your skills level). Yes, it's good to have a degree it can impact the salary. But not that much, if you can beat it with your talent.You can learn it from Youtube, Google, Froums, Lynda, Udemy and lot of other websites. Or simply go to a lybriary and pick a book realted to skill you want to learn. ",
