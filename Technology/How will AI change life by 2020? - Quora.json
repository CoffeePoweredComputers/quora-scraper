            "answer_text": "The answer to this would be hypothetical, but I will write something which is sure. AI will not change the life that much in 2020. At present, AI is just another toddler and it will take years to reach a point where AI can work like humans. After that, we can assume that AI will change life. I want to ask what do you expect from AI to do? If it is a robotic task then yes that is happening today and will improve much in coming years, but if you are expecting intelligence tasks like creativity and thinking then there is time for that. So looking at the Machine Learning and Deep Learning technologies evolution, I am expecting following from AI by 2020. Increase in numbers of Self-Driven CarsSelf-driven Cars will help humans a lot. With self-driven cars, the accident numbers will decrease because of machine driving the car and zero chances of human errors. Traffic violations, Sleeping, Drunk & Driving, Speeding, Stunts, are the common mistakes can be neglected with a machine driving the vehicle. Agricultural ImprovementsWith the help of AI, Blockchain, and IoT we can expect lots of improvements in the agriculture field. Today we need to accept the reality of agriculture and farmers problem. Few tech companies have already started investing heavily in this industry. Our Government wants to help the farmer and they are doing so but the help is not reaching to individuals (farmer). The politicians, government official, and other mediators are taking the advantages of the help (money/resources). So with these technologies, we can build a system where we can track everything and reach out to individuals (farmers) directly. More Personalized Virtual AssistantsYes, today we have virtual assistants but we can expect improvements in them so that we can get more personalized user experience. At present these assistants are more robotics kind of thing, but with ML technology coming into play we can expect a lot in near future. So till 2020, we can get a smart maid which will evolve/grow along with us (owner). Home SecurityWith the help of AI, Machine Learning, Image Recognition, IoT, and Blockchain Technology, we can build a smart security system which will avoid most of the unexpected (criminal) incidents. I have covered this (future of home security) in detail in one of my posts. Read that here. There are other points too which I will add after some time. Thanks for reading \u2026:) ",

            "answer_text": "Artificial Intelligence is a new trend and is creating a hype in the technology world. In today\u2019s era, people are using AI to simplify the processes. When you think about AI nearby you, you don\u2019t have to look around because you will find it on your smartphone and communication devices. Thinking what?? It is the AI assistants such as Alexa, Siri, and others. If we talk about other sectors then you will find that AI applications are on the verge of completion that will change the way we live in all the aspects. Let us understand how AI will change the world in the year 2020. The burden of the employee will be decreased Most of the human resources will be replaced by machines which include repetitive tasks. If we look around then we will notice that AI is already used in many places and fields. In the coming future, you will see that the cashiers, receptionists, and the drivers will be replaced by AI. Knock Knock: New Jobs If you think that AI will take your jobs then please \u201cDon\u2019t panic\u201d because it will only lessen your burden. New jobs will knock your doors and these jobs can be done only by humans. AI will help in increasing productivity and will also create new opportunities, So, we can say that AI is coming to make our work easy and new job opportunities on the list. AI: Major Key For Developing Even Better Technologies If we compare humans with machines then we will be considered fools. I am saying this because we have a limit on everything but machines don\u2019t. They have the capacity to process unlimited information till the power is ON where a full stop comes in our thought process. This unlimited information gives out solutions that will be beneficial for the world and the possibility to fix a problem increases. ",
