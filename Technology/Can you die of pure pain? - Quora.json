            "answer_text": "Yes, Yes, and Yes. I nearly died seven times. Others have answered this question who clearly have never been subjected to pain that is so intense and prolonged that sleep deprivation could be the cause of death by a heart attack. That was my first \u2018almost\u2019 died. Just so you have a sense of the intensity of the pain. Imagine being in the last stage of labor as if you are going to give birth. Mothers can fully identify with this. The abdominal cramps had no intermission. The pain that I was in for about four weeks caused a psychotic break. Now, that break pushed me close to committing suicide. Too close. At the same time my body was breaking down because I could barely eat or drink anything. I dropped to a dangerous ninety pounds. Now came the worst part. No pain management doctor would take me or administer anything other than Tylenol with codeine. The laws now are so severe to stop drug abuse that no pain doctor would follow the advice of my specialist: either paralyze my body or prescribe methadone. If I had cancer, I would have had a code or reasonable assurance that a doctor would have prescribed me something strong enough to deal with the pain. But some disorders are not well-understood, so those people fall through the cracks and either die because of suicide or breakdown of bodily organs. This is what will happen to Baby Boomers if there is no change to accommodate those who are in horrific pain, assuming the diagnosis isn\u2019t terminal cancer and perhaps a disorder not understood by the medical community. Caregivers will risk their lives to take care of loved ones. They, too, are up throughout the night to make certain loved ones don\u2019t fall because ones they are so disoriented and delirious.People telling you need to have a positive attitude to survive.Doctors telling you that they will lose their license if they were to prescribe drugs such as methadone to people who even have incurable disorders. What difference does it make if the drugs are addictive if the pain is incurable?Family members who invalidate your pain because they, too, don\u2019t understand the pain you\u2019re in.Having to keep silent about the pain because no one wants to hear about it. So, you don\u2019t discuss it. Except now.Loss of friends and your previous life because of being housebound.Loss of dignity because you can\u2019t do anything by yourself.Knowing that the pain could be dealt with if the laws supported the doctors\u2019 judgments.How did I finally get the medication I needed? I ended up in the cardiac unit a second time in shock from the pain. Fortunately, a team of doctors saw one of these full-blown episodes. They were frightened, so they gave me exactly what I needed. For the first time in thirty-five years, I knew what it felt like to not be in pain. But it wasn\u2019t over.After 4 days, the doctors signed my release to go home without a script or even a few pills! My husband was in disbelief. Now we were back to square one, and I was going through withdrawal.One week later, my pain management doctor, from a few years ago, saw me at another clinic. He whispered to me that there was nothing he could do at the clinic, but that I should call his office. He broke the law and prescribed what I needed. If he hadn\u2019t done this, I wouldn't be alive today. This was five years ago. Know that if my condition gets worse that I have been told that under no circumstances can he raise the dose. This was the result of yet another law about methadone.My husband now has a heart condition that is a direct result of taking care of me. My health ruined his health.Edit: I was asked by Quora to add a credential to the above question. My credential is experience. Pain can cause heart attacks. Psychotic breaks can cause suicide.",

            "answer_text": "As a chronic pain sufferer myself, I am going to answer yes. I have heart trouble as well and I can tell you, pain is exhausting. You might ask can a person die of exhaustion? Lack of sleep? I just had heart attack #4 and I think my uncontrolled pain had something to do with it. Constant exhaustion because pain will not let you sleep. Constant anxiety and how to relieve it, what to do minute by minute. Lack of appetite and reluctance to cook due to the pain. In my case this lead to a low potassium level which does actually cause heart attacks. Pain is physiological and psychological stress. That makes you adrenal glands kick out cortisol which I'd determental and increased adrenalin production which stress the heart and kidneys. There is no reason people have to be in unrelenting pain, but you will find government regulations and red tape stop many doctors from prescibing approriate pain medicine. I wish this damn society would stop stygmitizing pain sufferers with drug addicts. We might as well be living in the dark ages as far as access to proper care and the fault lies with doctors, the government and the public who think pain killers are made for drug abusers and not patients. The damn public needs to get their noses out of everyone's business, stop being judgmental, and think they know how to micromanage everyone's lives. Some of the people I know who wish these medicines weren't even available I wish I could let have my pain for a few weeks. Then we\u2019ll see what they beg for because hey, their lives are important, jobs, families. They must function. Which is exactly what pain meds for chronic pain allow the person to do, stand, walk, rest, and participat in life. People are very bad about judging otheres if they have nor been through the same situation themselves, they are as blind empathetically as the autistic child. ",
