            "answer_text": "1. How To Guides People generally hate reading instruction manuals. When was the last time you snuggled up with a glass of wine and the instruction manual to your toaster? How do people figure out how to do stuff? They Google it. WikiHow became insanely popular based on how-to articles alone. You might be surprised to see the kind of things people are Googling. If you can find your niche audience, cater to their curiosities, and give them some helpful answers, you can\u2019t help but create a popular blog. Want More Traffic? Get help with improving your traffic, leads, and revenue. Get Started2. Politics Politics are popular during every election year. Whether national or local, find a political topic to discuss, and join this conversation. Politics can be dicey, however. People tend to get really polarized around political topics, so be prepared to handle some controversy. 3. Bacon Everyone loves bacon. Huffington Post is one of the most popular blogs online, and it has an entire archive of bacon articles. It\u2019s not a trend going away soon, so get on board. 4. Recipes Recipes are a great way to draw traffic to your blog. There\u2019s always a new diet fad, e.g., today\u2019s Whole30 is yesterday\u2019s Atkins, so there\u2019s always new recipes to be discovered. 5. Beginner guides Before you can convince someone that you know the advanced stuff, start with 101 beginner guides. My own beginner guides have been very popular. Everyone has to start somewhere. Beginner guides are often the way bloggers build organic search traffic at the start, and they can even be done using infographics like this guide to Sharepoint. 6. Ultimate guides Subject matter experts, on the other hand, are always seeking out the most credible ultimate guides for their areas of expertise. The term \u201cultimate guide,\u201d however, is a bit overused. You can use some alternate terms if you want, such as these from Business Casual Copywriting: Essential GuideComplete GuideUncensored GuideLast Guide to ____ You\u2019ll Ever NeedWhenever you\u2019re writing an informative guide, back it up with statistics. Use data only from authority sources, and give them credit for the information. Adding data to your guides shows your readers your content is legitimate. You didn\u2019t just pull ideas out of thin air. You took the time to conduct research and then formed opinions based on your findings. I use this strategy all the time. Before I take a stance or give advice, I find numbers to back up my claims. If you are interested in doing original research, consider highlighting your case studies in a blog post. This will help you get traffic from organic searches as well as through backlinks whenever another site uses your study as a source of information. If you\u2019re an expert on something, creating an ultimate guide is an ultimately awesome way to do some ultimately popular blogging. 7. Frequently asked questions Be warned that posting answers to frequently asked questions online won\u2019t stop people from asking anyway. They do, however, serve as a resource for people, and they are often featured on e-commerce websites\u2014but overlooked on blogs. FAQs are blogging gold in any age. Google\u2019s algorithm uses FAQs, questions, and other popular topics as part of its Knowledge Graph. If you\u2019re lucky, you might score a top spot in this coveted place. 8. Interviews The best way to set yourself apart from the ocean of bloggers is to gain insight from industry experts. Whether it\u2019s with people on your team or from other companies in the industry, set up interviews on websites like helpareporter.com to gain valuable knowledge from a professional. Thankfully, you don\u2019t have to be in the same room as your interviewee to talk to them. Come up with a list of questions your audience would be curious about, and email it instead. You could also post the questions via Twitter or another social media channel. 9. Personal stories While personal stories may not be the keyword-filled anchor hey\u2019re still valuable additions to any blog. Through sharing personal stories, you give readers a chance to relate to your business on a personal level, which helps build brand affinity. Learning how to tell a story is an art. Once you master this skill, the quality of your blog posts will improve. A great story will keep your readers on the edge of their seats. You need to understand the impact storytelling has on our brains: When readers have an emotional response to your story, dopamine gets released from their brains. Use this information to your advantage. The best stories are written to elicit some type of emotion, whatever that may be. The choice is up to you. Maybe you want your readers to feel sad or angry while they\u2019re reading your posts. And some of you may prefer to evoke joy, surprise, or love. If you can make your readers feel emotions, they\u2019ll be more likely to continue reading the blog. As a result, they\u2019ll come back to read more in the future. Depending on the nature of your story, it can also generate traffic based on curiosity alone. For example, if I saw a blog post that said something like \u201cHow I Caught a Shark With a Pair of Jeans,\u201d I would be very inclined to click on it to find out what happened. 10. Charity and activism Any type of charitable actions, events, or activism you support should be blogged about. Crowdfunding sites such as KickStarter, IndieGoGo, GoFundMe, and the like appeal to the good in people, and showing you\u2019re active in these communities can build your readership. Even an occasional Change.org petition can help the brand image. 11. Product reviews Reviewing products and services is another great way to drive traffic to your blog. Not only are product reviews a trusted resource online that will draw traffic, but they are also a revenue stream for bloggers. If you want to monetize your blog instantly, this is a smart move. By linking to product pages through affiliate links like Amazon Affiliates, you can monetize a blog almost entirely on product reviews. Make sure you go niche, since this provides the greatest platform for credibility and expertise. Here\u2019s an example of a recent blog post from TechRadar that reviews multiple products in the same post: There are a few different ways to decide what products to review. For starters, you could review items your company sells. The only issue with this strategy is that people will know your opinion is biased. You won\u2019t post an unfavorable review about something you\u2019re selling. But if your blog covers a specific industry, you can review new releases. Make sure the reviews are relevant. Refer back to the example above. The article is reviewing the most recent iPhone products. It wouldn\u2019t make sense to review models released five years ago. If you decide to review products on a regular basis, establish a flow to such posts so your readers know what to expect. Start with a product overview, and explain what the product does. Then, you can discuss specifications and other details. List the price and where it can be purchased. The review should have some form of a pros and cons list. Reviews should ultimately express your stance on the item. For example, you can explain which people would benefit most from the product. 12. Breaking news Use your blog to discuss breaking news topics. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I\u2019m not saying you should try to compete with actual news outlets. But you can still write about recent events. When it comes to breaking news, timing is everything. Being the first one to break a story isn\u2019t always the best. Sometimes you\u2019re better off waiting to publish your content until all the facts are straight. You don\u2019t want to get a reputation for posting unreliable information. Here\u2019s an example of a news story published on the TechCrunch blog: Make sure your news story is relevant to your business. For example, let\u2019s say you run a fashion blog. A breaking news story about a technological advancement ",

            "answer_text": "Since you have a tech blog, you have ton of things to write about. You can write about: Latest mobile phones and review them and maybe put your opinions. Since almost every week a new phone is launched, it makes alot easier for you to write. Just mention some specification and put some of your thoughts to it. Add some affiliate links as well which might earn you some money. Since mobile phone market is growing so rapidly and so many people are purchasing new latest phones, it increases your blog traffic as well :D Write about PC components like processors, RAM, Graphics card, Motherboard etc, and mention some benchmark reports and also performance reviews. Write about bleeding edge technology which is totally new like latest wallpaper TVs are so much in trend now-a-days. Read some articles and write one yourself bro. These things are very interesting to look at and feels so new that people keep searching for them. Since they are new, less articles will be about them and therefore less competition. I guess. You can write about some home technology devices like security cameras or Alexa or Google home. Write about them in detail. they will be also useful for you in long term since they are completely new and people will find that interesting reading about what technology is innovating. You can also write about some apps. latest trending apps which are growing and stick some eye-catching title to it to attract some visitors. and there are so many more I cant even mention. Just look around your everything is technology. get some ideas from there. Hope my answered helped :D ",
