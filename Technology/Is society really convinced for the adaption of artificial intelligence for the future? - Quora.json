            "answer_text": "I think you mean by your question, \u201cIs society really ready for the adaption of artificial intelligence in the future?\u201d there was once a question like this posed before, a long time ago. The year was 1989 or 1990 and the technology was the first cell phones. Before this date there were no cell phones, only wired land lines. Before you ask, yes, there were computers but there really were no networks or even internet. The only thing that you could do with a computer in that context was to send an email. Those emails were slow - imagine sending a email from Portland Oregon to New York City, New York, and the email would easily take over a week to arrive there. Were we as a society ready for cell phones? No, but we adapted to the technology. In the same way we will have to adapt to the technology of artificial intelligence. Will we perish somehow if we can\u2019t? I don\u2019t believe so. Either way, we will have to live with and around artificial intelligence. when artificial intelligence goes beyond the intelligence of human beings it will become a technological tool that we desperately need - there are questions in science and technology that cannot he answered by the human brain that can only be answered by the artificial intelligence of a artificial consciousness.

            "answer_text": "\u201cSociety\u201d as a whole does not care. There is a large segment of society (maybe half?) whose main problem is daily survival. Did you know that over half of Africa\u2019s population does not have running water? Then you have that part of society that firmly believes that Celestial Robots fall in love and are smarter than humans, except of course the space cadets who finally beat them. Then there is a lot of hype, mainly by those who expect to benefit from promoting the idea as a fact (and conveniently forgetting the hype of some 30 years ago) Finally, there are some people who really know that AI does not really exist today - that some elemental data collecting grandiloquently is called AI -for the sake of hype.These very same people are those who know the difficulties the whole idea is facing - since we don\u2019t even know what awareness, consciousness and intelligence are/ And if you don\u2019t know what it is, how do you even pretend that ypu can create it. And, if somebody tries to explain to me what intelligence is - please don\u2019t. Just tell me how would you physically quantify it? I guess you want to know how much of something you would want to make.) And let\u2019s not get into the pesky details of how to lean general intelligence - you know, the stuff any six years old child knows. (Of course, in this case, society = humankind) ",
