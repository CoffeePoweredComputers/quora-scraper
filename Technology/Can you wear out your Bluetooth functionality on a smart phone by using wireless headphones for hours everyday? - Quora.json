            "answer_text": "Can you wear out your Bluetooth functionality on a smart phone by using wireless headphones for hours everyday? No. Bluetooth radios have no moving parts, so there's nothing to wear out in the phone. Headphones do, however, have moving parts, but in normal use, with reasonable care, should last for a long time. The only caveat is that bluetooth headphones often have built-in Lithium ion batteries, which usually only hold up for about two years of charge/discharge cycles (much like the batteries in smartphones). In this case, the batteries will limit the useful life of the headphones/earbuds. ",

            "answer_text": "Thanks for the A2A. In order to \u201cwear something out\u201d there have to be moving parts. The Bluetooth functionality on your smartphone has no moving parts, and therefore does not wear out the more you use it. You can wear your wireless headphones 24/7 if you would like. The only thing you will wear out is the physical headphones themselves from constant use, but the Bluetooth functionality will not be affected. ",
