            "answer_text": "Only in extreme forms such as lightning. The reason is simply that electricity requires a conductor to travel, and air normally isn\u2019t one. But we don\u2019t need electricity itself to travel through the air. We just need a form of energy that will, and that we can readily convert electricity to and from. In the same way that we don\u2019t need to store electricity in a rechargeable battery, but rather we can store chemical energy in a form that we can readily convert electricity to and from. Energy travelling through the air is electromagnetic energy. Like light or radio or X-Rays or magnetism. Well, to be comprehensive you could include some form of particle beam, but that\u2019s hardly going to work for this case! The problem is that EM energy either tends to spread out and so becomes diluted very quickly with distance, like light from a light bulb, or if we focus it then it only goes in a single direction and becomes potentially dangerous to anything in its path, like a laser. So we can easily transmit energy over very short distances, such as by using magnetic fields as in existing wireless charging technology. But over longer distances it becomes all about tracking a beam of energy, and shutting this off when interrupted. Which results in technologies like this one: Wi-Charge.com. This example uses a beam of infra-red to transfer energy, using feedback from target devices to continuously direct the beam in the right direction and cut it off whenever something else interrupts the beam. Notice in particular that the marketing for this technology emphasises safety and FDA approval, the manufacturers being wary of the dangers. To achieve this they\u2019ve had to limit the power, so the best case is 5W delivered over 5 metres. Even then this is a powerful beam. If we say that 5W is delivered to an area of 1 sq cm on the receiver, then this concentration is around a 100 times that of the Sun\u2019s infrared energy when the Sun is overhead. At the same time this represents a slow charge in today\u2019s terms, and effectively limited to nearly overhead transmission. In fact this comparison ignores receiver efficiency. If the receiver is only 20% efficient then we\u2019re talking about 500 times Sun equivalent, or alternatively just 1 W charging. It turns out that the latter is roughly in line with best case in published reviews. 1W charging is roughly a maintenance charge for a modern phone - it will just about maintain existing charge levels when the phone is idle. Also of course you need a plug in receiver for your phone. So as with magnetic wireless charging such as Qi, the idea of overhead charging is only likely to succeed if the manufacturers can persuade mobile phone manufacturers to incorporate receivers built in to their phones. All in all this really doesn\u2019t look like a practical solution, and it\u2019s very difficult to see how this could be improved significantly without unacceptable safety risk. ",

            "answer_text": "Well, there is electricity and there is electrical energy.   Electricity can indeed be transferred through the air - but standard temperature and pressure air has very high resistance to the flow of electric current.  This is a good thing and makes walking under high voltage power lines more convenient. Voltage is electrical pressure somewhat analogous to water pressure.  Once a sufficiently high voltage (approximately some 30,000 volts across an air gap of 1cm) has started electric current flowing through air, things get out of hand in a hurry as the air itself changes composition by ionizing. Ionized air has a very low resistance so electricity can flow in quantity; once an electric arc gets started it can be hard to extinguish. This is the spark you see when you unplug an appliance - as even the household 110 volts is enough to get the current flowing through air if the 'gap' starts small enough. Nature uses millions of volts for lightning and therefore has much more fun.  Same electricity, largely the same physics. Generally, passing energy through a non-conductor like air is best done by converting the electrical energy to something that the air does not impede.  To do this electricity is generally first converted into either of two forms of energy: photons (light) and magnetic fields. Converting electric energy to light and sending that light through the air to be re-converted to electricity is done by devices as simple as your TV remote control.  Batteries power the infrared LED and at the TV end photo-receptors convert received infrared photons into an electric current. Converting electric energy to magnetic fields and recovering that energy is the technology behind 'wireless chargers' now coming to your local handheld device. ",

Neon is proven as Convertible to light and decomposing thereon Energy Applied, thereby the Diminishing of the Lumens per Intensity of Antiquated Neon Signs Refilling Neon to a Specific Pressurization which realizes as \u2018Virtual Solidity\u2019 also reduces the Hum of Neon Signs in direct concordance to density. You need not Apply energy directly to Neon to make it Glow, you apply Super Vibrations to acquire an increased Longevity of the Supply and Pressurization. To extents: 12 ounces of dynamite or otherwise combustible can fuel any energy proficient array for Life, via Controlled Microthrusters. Efficiency is associable to a fact: Electromagnetic Energy is technically Supercondensed Hum. If it wasn't, condensed Electromagnetic devices as motors would not Hum at the \u2018end of the \u2018Lifespan\u2019\u2019. \u2018End of the Lifespan\u2019 is hardly a Factual Phrase, Scientifically speaking it is beyond Peak Supercondensation of Hum to extents it is no longer at Ultrasound Frequency above Audible Levels. There is a Reason why Dogs dislike Vacuum Cleaners. That reason is: Dogs hear Ultrasound. B. A Specially Designed Miniaturized Neon Plasma Ball which contains a Miniaturized LED bulb sufficedly blinks inside Silicon to onset Specific Ultrasounds which onset: Increased performance of Electromagnetic Devices. And Thereby the Increased Frequency of Molecular Fibrillations to extents it is SuperMegaUltraSound the Combinatory result is: it Powers More Turbines by Energy Resistive Flow Chambering to Effect that \u2018Power Travels only where the demand exists\u2019 as \u2018Equal Powering the Entire Receptive Collective to Tax All Receptors 35% in circumference\u2019 is no longer a necessity for Ground, per the Tesla Discovery of 3 --> 6 --> (9 / 3)@3-----------|J_1 Loop ^-----------------------Junction=J_{1,2,3} By the Inter-Reliant Charging, in Contrast to: Subservient by Disconnect to wholly Refract instead Into Itself Selfsame As an Intra-Reliant Charging in a Vaccuum, there is no need for Intrareliant charging in a Vaccuum. C. Energy efficiency of the Internet is Increased in Contrast to Intranet Consumption for the Same Tasks. Thus in response to your inquiry: 1. Energy does not Displace Air suffice to suggest \u2018Energy Moves through Air\u2019. Instead, Transfer indeed occurs, and you are Correct in your Terminology. Transfer is onsetting that The Next Molecular Group Emit to the Next, etc Until Full Distribution Occurs by: Spectral Deconvergence. 2. Had Spectral Deconvergence not atall involved in the Distribution of Energy, the Equations that much advanced electrical engineers utilize on a day to day basis would not ever use \u03c0\u03c0 in those equations. 3. The actual Notation for that Spectral Deconvergence is based upon my own Studies per the Radius of the Sphere, and Circumference as follows: (SP\u00d7D)e=(SP\u00d72r)e=(CO\u00d7C)e(SP\u00d7D)e=(SP\u00d72r)e=(CO\u00d7C)e And are Estimably Equal: SPE=2.933884=2+2\u03c0\u22121SPE=2.933884=2+2\u03c0\u22121 COE=.933884=2\u03c0\u22121COE=.933884=2\u03c0\u22121 And Reads as: Spectral Diameter=Converged Circumference ",

            "answer_text": "For current to flow, there must be free electrons in the medium through which electricity is to pass. Metals have a kernel of free electrons in their structure which enables the flow of current. A material which is non-conductor of electricity will not be having free electrons to conduct the electricity. Air is a non-conductor of electricity because it does not have free electrons to carry the current. But when there is high voltage, as in case of lightening, the molecules of air get ionized and electrons are available to flow to make the current and conduct electricity through air. This is called \u201cdielectric breakdown\u201d of air. When the molecules of air get ionized, sound and light is released which we can see during lightening. So, coming to your question, yes, we can conduct electricity through air if we apply sufficiently high voltage to cause the air to ionize. But we cannot conduct electricity through vacuum where there are no molecules to provide the electrons. ",

Other methods under consideration are electromagnetic radiation in the form of microwaves or lasers and electrical conduction through natural media. In these all methods energy is transferred in to some other form like magnetic or radiation then it travels through air,received  at other end and transferred back to electrical energy. ",

Lightning is preceeded by a stage where the air is conducting charged ions that might keep conducting and reducing the charge on the clouds until it has leaked away. This is what lightning rods are designed to do. If the charge on the cloud is too high or the cloud too close to the ground the current is greater, causing the resistance of the air to break down and conduct more readily, the resulting flash is lightning. Deliberate conduction other than across small gaps is highly undesirable as the air is unpredictable and people, animals and objects in the vicinity would be likely to be hit. ",

Because we already transmit electromagnetic signals wirelessly, so a wireless power transmission system would ideally be an identical thing except for the fact that in case of the later, the EM wave would be expected to have higher power and the process would be expected to be much more power efficient. Currently we have some cell phone models charging wirelessly. Wireless power transfer ",

Air is an insulator - it has no unfastened electrons to permit conduction. Even with the undeniable fact that, if the sector gets too severe than the molecules interior the air ionize and an arc of electrical energy can leap for the duration of a spot, as a results of fact the ions enable conduction to ensue. It relatively is what happens in a lightning strikes. ",
