            "answer_text": "Well, nowadays the SAR values of all the smartphones are below the specified limits. So, mostly no issues. Still, if you talk too long via the earpiece, it may affect your cerebellum (part of the brain responsible for balancing and locomotion) directly. Radiations are emitted by the device which move in all directions. You should take following precautions if you talk too long on phone. 1. Use a headset or the loudspeaker as it keeps the distance of the device far away from the body and head. 2. If on the earpiece, try to cover minimum possible area of the phone with your hand so as to minimise the intensity of radiations. 3. When on earpiece, switch the phone frequently (say, every 2 minutes) between the two ears. Usually, keeping the device on the left ear is comparatively safe. If you use an old phone to talk too long, you must take the above precautions since the SAR values used to be significantly higher in the old and feature phones. ",

Heated ear unless you switch the phone time to time between left and right to balance the heat or you use a quality earphone 3. Radiation issues if you are using a phone with high SAR value 4. You might feel the days shorter as you wouldn't have time to manage other activities you wanted to do. 5. Addiction - you couldn't manage to live without phone and network. ",

Addiction to anything is bad. Whether it\u2019s calling , texting or browsing. ",

Higher the SAR rating the more radiation that is absorbed into the head. So check if your phone has low SAR rating. Talking for long time will start damaging your brain tissue, memory loss, having problem in sleeping, increase chances of cancer. So start using a ear phone and keep your phone away. Don\u2019t use your before going to bed, always keep your phone away especially while sleeping, use your left ear while attending call. ",
