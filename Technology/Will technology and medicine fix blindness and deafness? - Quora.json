            "answer_text": "I have written this comment on similar questions about deafness.Deafness are divided on two categories:1 - 5% of the deaf people have organ deficiencies.2 -95% become deaf because of hearing capacity troubles. The second category of 95% can hear the sounds but not clearly, the words are overlapping and intelligibility is reduced, this category can be programmed in maximum 20 times (seances) by hearing live de-correlated acoustical patterns in the spectrum that is deficient.Intelligibility is between 1500 and 6,000 Hz.Multiple De-correlated temporal patterns of longer than 5 msec. will activate and program hearing intelligibility, In children, this programming is efficient in 5 seances.In old persons of more than 80 years old, 20 seances is needed.In 40 to 60 years old persons, 10 seances is needed. In complete deaf people with physical hearing organs deficiencies, we need a seance of 2 hours just to activate the brain to hear just the sound, distinguishing and understanding the words and recognition of the words needs programming like the new born babies. WE HEAR BY OUR BRAIN, our physical ear is for directing the acoustical vibrations to our hearing nerves. The vibration captured by our cranial box are very well hearable and the words can be intelligible by training (Brain programming). ",
