            "answer_text": "It never hurts to test your hard drive. I recommend using WD Data Lifeguard (the bootable DOS version preferably, but the Windows version is OK) or SeaTools.  These tools go beyond chkdsk (a file system utility) and will actually  tell you if your hard drive has an issue which would require you to  replace it before it dies completely and you loose everything. The short  tests, in my experience, are typically 95% accurate, therefore I  usually run that test first. If it passes the short test and I still  suspect the HDD to be at fault, I run the extended (and usually the  extended test will fail well before it is 50% complete). Once  you verified the stability of your hard drive, check out some utilities  in  Sysinternals Suite . I  would particularly recommend running the autoruns and process explorer;  these tools will tell you every item that runs when your system starts  up and allow you to examine every running process on your system.  Also,  if you suspect malware, an offline antivirus scan with a rescue disk (Bitdefender Rescue CD)  is the best method. ",

            "answer_text": "First use CCleaner and clean up your PC. If it\u2019s still slow, test your harddrive with a drive testing utility. If your harddrive or SSD is about to blow it will make starting Windows take forever (if it loads at all without hanging). If that\u2019s good, then test your RAM with a RAM Checker utility. If the RAM\u2019s fine, install Malware Bytes and check for more junk. If your PC is clean and problem persists, then format your hard drive then reinstall Windows. Sometimes nuking is the best option. If that still doesn\u2019t fix it buy an iPad and forget trying to use PCs.  ",
