            "answer_text": "There are multiple reasons for this to happen No 1. Disc damage This is easy to test, put another disc on your DVD player or play this disc on another player DVD player or on a PC with DVD drive. If it\u2019s the problem of the disc, then it might be it\u2019s damaged or it\u2019s not properly burned. For a damaged disc, there is not much you can do. But if it\u2019s not properly burned, you can try burn your disc again according to this mp4 to DVD tutorial and try play it again. No 2. Player glitch If it\u2019s not the disc, then it\u2019s most likely that your DVD player is broken. In this case, you have to either fix what\u2019s wrong, or convert your DVD or convert blu-ray to mp4with some ripping program to just watch it on your PC. No 3. Display problem If you can hear the sound but not see the picture, consider there might be something wrong with your display. These are the most likely reasons for your DVD not playing disc. ",
