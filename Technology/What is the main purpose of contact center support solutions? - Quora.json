Day-in-day-out they have to handle numerous calls related to product/service queries, complaints, confirmations, and more.

            "answer_text": "Every contact center is capable of providing the means for customer support across the channels, such as live chat, email, phone calls, or text messages. In order to create your own contact center, you should rather choose a single omnichannel support solution (this way, you don\u2019t need to pay for more than one tool) or pick a few dedicated tools that can be integrated with one another. In both cases, you will be able to keep all the important details in one place and serve your customers in a fast & efficient manner.  Contact centres can serve the following purposes: Omnichannel customer service - modern contact centers offer an \u201cintegrated\u201d experience & support across many communication channels,Personalized self-service - with comprehensive contact centers, customers can perform routine tasks (i.e. checking account balance or scheduling an appointment) without the need to interact with contact center agents,Task automation - contact center tools often leverage automation when it comes to ticket creation, updates, assignment, and time-based triggers. These tools have to take into account all available information on every customer who is reaching out, and \u201croute\u201d them to the agent that can assist them best, based on this information. This way, contact centers are able to reduce the resolution time and increase customer satisfaction,Shorter wait times and more flexibility for customers - since customers have various communication channels at their disposal, their queries are more distributed among different channels & agents, and thus, wait times can get shorter than with a single point of contact.If you\u2019re looking for a powerful contact center solution, I highly recommend the following duo: LiveAgent & CloudTalk. I hope that helps! ",
