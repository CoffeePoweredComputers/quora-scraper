            "answer_text": "As debit cards replace cash for welfare and other social service payments, the level of street crime is declining, according to a new study.  See As Cash Use Drops, Do Crime Rates Follow?  Since street crime disproportionately affects the urban poor, this would seem to be a quality of life benefit. New apps that allow users to time their mass transit journeys - for example, showing when a bus or train is on the way - allow more efficient use of transport, particularly important for people who use mass transit to travel to work, as many of the urban poor do. Less expensive communications technology, including inexpensive smartphones, allow the poor to document and share their circumstances. They also allow for easier monitoring of authority figures, particularly the police. Online education - everything from YouTube tutorials illustrating simple tasks to MOOCs from high-level universities - are universally available, although at this point MOOCs are more likely to be used by those who already hold a high educational level. That said, information that was once expensive or restricted is now available to anyone who can access an internet connection. ",
