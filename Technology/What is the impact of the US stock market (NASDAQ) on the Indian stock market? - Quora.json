            "answer_text": "I am glad someone brought this up and this question seems to have many following. Looks like many are interested in how west affects the east.You ask, How does US markets affect the Indian market, I say, it doesn\u2019t as it seems.The stock market is just a reaction mechanism. It acts today based on what will happen tomorrow. From the beginning we have always looked up towards west for direction. A sort of imitation which can be seen even in the financial world, so when the US market falls, ours too. But there is no fundamental cause because this imitation is just one way. When US market falls, then Indian market too may fall but if Indian market falls then the US market won\u2019t even flinch. Now if you ask an economist, they will tell you reason how the US market could impact the Indian marketLike their Fed rates, their policies, import-export etc. These things don\u2019t affect the market if you see closely, these things will affect the businesses which will later, affect the consumer and consequently the whole economy. So, this will take time but as always, the market is irrational. It will act today based on what will happen tomorrow. Like, the dot com bust or 2008 crises which affected the US economy fundamentally, its effect although late was seen in the Indian markets. Similarly is the present day situation, the US markets are feared of Corona Virus because most of the giant businesses of USA have their manufacturing plants in China and they carry out greater trade with China. Hence, their fear can be justified because China and USA are directly related. But, India is not in that position. We don\u2019t have any such manufacturing plants in China nor we have much trade relations with China but with US we do. This triangular formation makes Indians suffer the same cause which USA is facing. It should also be noted that USA will be affected to a greater extent but India in economical terms will not suffer as much as USA. Yet the stock market is reacting as if the whole economy is on the verge of collapse. You should understand this once and for all that the market consists of people and most of them like you are ignorant who don\u2019t understand its functioning. So, when everyone sells, they sell.When everyone buys, they buy. Nobody cares about the economy or the fundamentals of the business. All they care about is the stock price. That is why, you are seeing the similarity. Indian market is mimicking the US market as it did in 2000 and in 2008 regardless of the fact that whether it affects the economy or not. There are business in India which don\u2019t give a damn about coronavirus and china\u2019s situation and technically their business model is immune to that disease yet the stock price of such is falling. This irrationality is giving you that chance to take advantage of that folly and invest in the right businesses at right price. Why bother what the market is doing?They are just stupid people reacting to a situation which is not even going to affect most of the businesses in India. ",

            "answer_text": "NASDAQ is the second-biggest stock exchange in the world and it holds 100 biggest companies in its list, Many companies registered over NASDAQ are also registered over many global indexes. Apple, Google, Microsoft etc are the starters of the list who are present across globe. Similarly many companies listed over NIFTY are also present in USA registered as the affiliate of NIFTY and business centered over USA. Reliance, Tata, Infosys, Wipro, Sunpharma etc many are in List. Here is the connectivity, USA markets open approximately around 7:30PM IST, and they get closed by 2:30AM IST. which is our night hours of next market hours. Any variations occurred during this moment will have impact on asian markets followed by Indian markets too. So, Nasdag and other USA markets are major trend setters of market direction. Global Companies share price fall in one nation will definitely pull its value down in other representing country too. Hope this information is useful. Please do self research before trading..

Every company is connected directly or indir ectly to another company so that they can fulfill their own purpose . You can consider the example of CRASH OF HOUSING MARKET in 2008, it influenced almost every country's economy. When US stock market shows some correction then it leads to cash crunch in indian economy as FII (Foreign Institutional Investors ) will get panic while investing in indian stock market. Tech stocks came under NASDAQ, so you can relate that indian IT stock started falling with respect to Nasdaq and not with Nifty . This is due to more than 60% of their businesses are carried out in US and Europe. ",

The US market has corrected 10% from the recent highs but Indian market was corrected around 4\u20135% and it is the least globally!
