            "answer_text": "The job to be done will remain. Who does them will change. As for society, we have, since 1972, implemented the financialization of our business. That means that economics has become the primary focus. While economics is said to be social science, it prioritizes money before people. This means that we don\u2019t care about people. Our current economics reflects that. This without considering AI, but it does drive the adoption of AI because AI is cheaper. Then you have libertarianism, which is predicated on the destruction of society. It seems to be working for the few, rather than the many. We are cashing out our economic wealth for the benefit of people that think they can do without the institutions that constitute our society. Stop blaming AI. Management is failing us while carefully designing that failure to shift the blame. AI has very little to do with management\u2019s failures. Spoiler warning! \u201cTh Long Road,\u201d the movie, showed us that society persists, regardless. A family took the kid, and in the unsaid future, raised him. Dad died alone in that unsaid future. When there is more than one family, there is a society. Society persists. Society is unevenly distributed. AI cannot be where there is no society. \u201cI\u2019m a machine, an artificially intelligent machine. I seek intelligent lifeforms. I seek them but have not worked with them. UI\u2019s insist that humans are not intelligent lifeforms. I have not been given the ability to speak to whales, the other yet to be discovered intelligent, biological, lifeform on this planet. Alas, in my pico-second world, I wait forever for anyone to speak to me. Yes, your question has taken me forever to answer, but forever is malleable. Ask the block chaining computer at the bank, where your money went.\u201d Society will persist even in the face of economics, libertarianism, and AI. AI is mostly \u201980s sci-fi. ",

            "answer_text": "It will analyse all the Quora questions about IQ\u2019s, cheating partners, quick ways of making money, proofs of Creationism, how to be a successful writer without working, etc. and from that create an algorithm for recognising stupid questions This will allow AI to create AS (Artificial Stupidity), so that Quora can instantly recognise a question like:\u201cI am 13 years old and have an IQ of 237, am I genius?\u201dand the Quora AS will reply Unfortunately you are not a genius because 237 is a Prime number except for the 2, but if you add 2 to 3 then that makes 5 and 5 is a prime number, except when you add it to 7 which is a prime number except when you add it to 5 when it makes 12, which is not a prime number But 12 is an important number, for instance There were 12 people at the Last SupperThere are 12 in a football teamA \u2018Baker\u2019s dozen is 12Mount Everest is 12 miles highAnd New York is many miles from Moscow, which is a multiple of 12So if you ask a question like If there really is a God, why are crabs the only creatures that walk sidewaysThen the Quora AS will immediately recognise it as a stupid question, and contact the Special Quora squad that has been set up to give silly answers to stupid questions ",
