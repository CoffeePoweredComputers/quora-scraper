            "answer_text": "It means that the microprocessor has a data bus of 8 bit which implies that it can process 8 bits of data in one clock cycle. (2^8 = 0\u2013255). Every microprocessor has an address bus and a data bus. Say, your microprocessor has a data bus of 8 bit and address bus of 16 bit. Say what?!  Okay, so bus is nothing but a collection of wires through which data is transmitted from one part of a computer to another. Address bus of 16 bit means that it has total of 65536 (2^16 = 0\u201365535) memory locations which can store data. Now the next quest question that comes to mind is how much data can these memory locations store? That is where data bus comes into play. The data bus of 8 bit means that each of these locations can store data of 8 bit (2^8 = 0\u2013255). So the specifications of your microprocessor tells you that it has 65536 number of memory locations each of which can store 8 bit of data. When someone refers to as a 8 bit or 16 bit processor, they are referring to the size of the data bus (The amount of data it can process in a clock cycle). ",
