You may buy light bulbs of all types with various color ratings from 3,000 (warm) to near 8,000 (cool). Pick what you like for the situation/environment you are in. Women generally prefer lower values, men higher values. Note there is no temperature symbol associated with Kelvin temperature. X < > Y, Sonoran desert Richard ",

            "answer_text": "My brother was very keen on halogen bulbs as natural light sources. Certainly he did not like the low energy (miniature flourescent) lamps. They have some weird wavelength chatacteristics. Now we have a new generation of economical LED lamps to choose from. These have some realistic appearances and also have the bonus of extremely low current operation. The downside of all these low energy systems is that they flicker. The flicker may not be very obvious. If you try to take photographs using low energy lighting the camera (mobile phone) can display light and dark bands on its screen. This indicates that the AC mains frequency, or its harmonic, is still visible. This could be an issue for some people who are affected by flicker. ",
