Leveraging data is a bit more longer game than automation, but can be invaluable in terms of improvements for a business.For example, as a store/supermarket, you could identify the periodicity of the sales of your products, to restock them only when they fly off the shelves. Pushing this example a step further, you could implement a model predicting your stock variations based on your stock history.",
