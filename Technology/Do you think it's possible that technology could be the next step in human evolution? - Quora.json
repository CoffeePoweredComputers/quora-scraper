            "answer_text": "In science fiction, yes, but in the actual world, despite many technological aids being used in medical situations and even despite Artificial Intelligence developments, all this is outside the actual living entity. Many years ago I read a book which depicted a future age when sports people would routinely have their legs amputated in order to be able to jump or run much faster with artificial limbs. They could not win or even compete unless they had had this procedure, seen as perfectly normal, but the implication was that it was actually a ghastly development. Of course, for people who have lost their limbs this is an important and vital development of modern medical technology. In fact, each living entity (including an oak tree, a worm or a human for example) is simply a cell (sometimes the cell has multiplied trillions of times to make a body or plant). A cell is the chemical process of combustion within a membrane. Fuel (food) and oxygen are imbibed, energy is made by digestion and waste is eliminated. The energy created is used to get more fuel and to split to make another cell. A car's engine is similar - it uses fuel and oxygen to carry out combustion, producing energy which is then used to do the work, with exhaust gas emitted. Human bodies are always the same. They are apparently not evolving because, like gorillas, they are well-suited to their environment. Technological adaptations will only be extraneous. ",

            "answer_text": "No. But it\u2019s definitely the next step in memetic evolution. That\u2019s the coolest thing about evolution I think; every successful organism inadvertently creates a whole new niche for evolution to exploit. (I suspect that GM people are the next step in human evolution.) I suspect that our brains are best understood as microcosmic ecosystems in their own right. Evolved to host a peculiar sort of \u201cliving\u201d information we coarsely conceive of as knowledge or understanding (or memes) and that literally compete for cognitive bandwidth by wisely guiding us to do things that feel successful (impresses others, accomplishes goals, resolves queries, etc.) ",

            "answer_text": "Not, to any great extent, in human evolution. Or biological evolution. But as the next step in evolution on the grander scale it is almost certain, judging by the evolutionary track record of our universe and in the light of current trends, that a new non-biological cognitive entity with skill-sets and data processing capability far beyond our own will soon emerge from the technological phase of evolution. The present spearhead of which is the Internet with all its peripherals The behaviours of this new \u201clife-form\u201d will of course be very different from our own. We can further fairly safely extrapolate that this entity (I like to call her Netty\u201d) will subsequently spawn rugged inorganic progeny which need no longer be bound to the environs of this nursery planet.

I do think that synthetic humans of some form will be a reality at some point in the future, however I wouldn\u2019t call this a step in human evolution but rather the start of a line of a new species. For it to be a step in human evolution, current humans would have to slowly become synthetic humans through genetic mutations. However, what you are describing (I assume) is synthetic humans which are designed and created by humans. ",
