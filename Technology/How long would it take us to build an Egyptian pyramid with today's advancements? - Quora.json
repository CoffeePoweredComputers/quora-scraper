            "answer_text": "I have a B.S. degree in Heavy Construction Management from Fresno State University, California. I graduated back in 1978 and was one of only fifty graduates in the entire state with that degree\u2026And now I finally found a project where I can apply my formal training\u2026finally\u2026 The time it takes to build something is a function of money and time. More money, less time. Less money, more time. Your question presumes that today we would put a maximum effort into building this, this, monument. Throwing money at a huge project will speed it up, but it will reach a condition of diminishing returns where more money no longer speeds up the building process. Also, building too fast increases the probability of making a mistake. Don't forget the Hubble Telescope that was sent into space with great expectations only to find a seemingly inconsequential flaw in the optics that wrecked the whole enterprise. So the planners must find a equilibrium where the most speed could be reached at the most economical cost all the while trying to minimize mistakes. And in this case the accuracies are so precise that craftsmen must be utilized to match the incredible tolerances of our forbear builders. Craftsmen are hard to come by\u2026 Then there is the question of what we are building. How can we recreate a building for which we do not know its purpose? To merely copy something without knowing its true purpose is a road to disaster. For all we know there are secret rooms all full of exotic equipment inside the pyramid that would explain its purpose. Hydrogen generator, water induced magnetic field generator, space ship, observatory, tomb, or entertainment park\u2026All these things change the characteristics of the building and would affect the length of time needed to build it. I mean, after all, it is sort of important to know what we are building\u2026 Next we have to find a flat place on which to build this very heavy building. We need a place that has something around fifteen acres of uniform rock that can withstand the weight of the building for what? 10,000 years without any settlement. And then that location must be somewhere relatively close to civilization to facilitate access to all the supplies and manpower needed to build this thing. So places like Antartica and Iceland are not likely locations. And then are we going to match the materials originally used or are we going to use modern materials like concrete. Presumably the specifications would require that the building have a life expectancy of at least the original. So the exact age of the pyrimid needs to be determined. The accepted age by the Egyptologists is approximately 4,500 years but one must remember that these dates are determined by questionable sources. A few lines of text written in a subjective location is used to definitely date the project. These proclamations expect me to ignore the evidence I see with my own eyes. I believe the pyramids are far older than the establishment proffers. I think it's closer to 10,000 years back when Egypt was green and had seasonal rainfall. So one must ask the life expectancy of modern concrete verses stone? For the purposes of this exercise I will choose stone because natural material will allow a better comparison instead of using a concrete pump and some spider forms. It's not as if we're building a freeway overpass or something. These pyrimids are \u201cArt.\u201d So now we need a flat plat to build and it must be near a quarry that can supply enough stone for the project. There must also be a quarry to supply any special stone for the unusual rooms. Soooo, we have to cut and transport several million 2,000 pound stones and install them in precise locations. Using helicopters or balloons to move material all sounds sexy until one of them gets tangled up in the lines, or crashes into another helicopter and kills a bunch of workers. I doubt OSHA would allow too many helicopters to work together in such tight proximities and the speed necessary to place a block every few seconds precludes using dangerous equipment. 2.5 million blocks divided by 20 years equals 125,000 blocks per year, divided by 365 days per year equals 342 blocks per day, divided by 24 hours per day equals 14.2 blocks per hour. Or about one block every 4 minutes or so to get the whole job done in 20 years. And in the old days they could only work from sunrise to sunset so this number would double to 28 blocks per hour or one every two minutes. For twenty years\u2026And every stone is a slightly different size\u2026If you have ever tried to organize a crew of say twenty men to maximize labor and then scale that up to say\u2026several thousand men needed to drag the stones up the ramps without causing a traffic jam, it's not an easy job. Time is money so when we have several thousand men all standing around waiting to unsnare some ropes it costs someone a lot of dough and slows down the project. The strength of will that is necessary to have a multi-year job is phenomenal. To work at a manual job for twenty years with primitive tools wears a person down. Both the workers and the job site supervisors will experience job burnout if they are not treated well and get some time off. Quality work requires men who can think straight, not a bunch of burned-out zombies. It's not enough to have a work force, you must have enough to rotate fresh men in to prevent job burnout, plus you must plan on the guys who get hurt, sick, or the deserters. In my professional opinion I don't believe the Great Pyramid could be built in twenty years, neither in the old days, or today. We may have the technical expertise to build it sooner, but I doubt we have the money or the strength of will to do it any sooner. Hell, it took 3 years to build a highway overpass on the local freeway, hardly a big project. I could visualize the engineers as the last few stones were to be installed and they found out everything was out of plumb\u2026The rising sun shines for the first time on the eastern face and the blocks don't line up? Now we gotta take the whole then apart and start over\u2026Should have studied the Hubble Telescope a little closer\u2026 And we haven't talked about strikes, cost overruns, and changes in the plans\u2026twenty years? In a pig\u2019s eye! And lastly, the most important thing that makes everything happen; why do we need to build this building? What overpowering need propels us to want to invest so much time and money in such an unusual building? When we answer that question then many other questions will also be answered. ",

            "answer_text": "So you want to build a pyramid... I'm assuming unlimited budget, but even then it may only be in the tens of millions. Which pyramid are we replicating? There are 118 related to Ancient Egyptian rule. I'm assuming \"The big one\" aka The Great Pyramid of Giza because it is so ubiquitous.  Are we replicating the pyramid in it's entirety, including tombs and passages, or are we just building a big stack of bricks in the shape of a pyramid? Structural design for tombs and passages may add a week or two to the end schedule. When are we building this? Laying mortar in the hot summer heat is much more difficult than laying in autumn, due to the evaporation rate of water in the mortar. The hotter, and because this is a desert, drier it is, the faster the mortar will harden. Where is the pyramid going to be located? If this is going on sand or soil, pilings need to be put in with a foundation on top. If it's going on bedrock, we need to level the top of the bedrock so the stone blocks will stay level. Where the stones are quarried is important too. Transportation distance is a factor in how quickly we can lay the stones. Since we're using heavy lift helicopters for most of the stones, this shouldn't be too much of a problem.    Sikorsky S-64 Skycrane Getting the heavier capstones used in the aforementioned tomb design, weighing anywhere from 20 to 50 tons, will need a semi trailer. Making sure the road to the quarry is solid enough for a 18 wheeler truck requires a special type of plastic composite matting to evenly distribute truck weight across sand. Are we designing the pyramid with the white finish stones that it once had (a la a white version of the Luxor Hotel)? We'll need to source those stones as well and quarry, transport, cut into shape, polish, and lay them.  Quarrying the stone isn't too difficult if we already have permits. It may take years to get government approval, especially with all that is going on in Egypt. So assuming we already have permits, all we need to do is quarry 4,000-6,000 pound stones. Which is already done on a daily basis around the world using a combination of diamond wire cables, drills and high temperature torches. We also need several hundred thousand pounds of mortar. That needs to be sourced, quarried, transported, mixed, and hoisted up the side so workers can apply on the next level of stones. So depending on all these factors, and with as many workers as necessary, I'd say 16 weeks for the unfinished pile of stone in the shape of a pyramid on bedrock to one year for the finished pyramid, with tombs and passages, on a concrete foundation with pilings built on sand.
