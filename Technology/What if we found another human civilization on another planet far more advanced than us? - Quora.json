            "answer_text": "You have asked a hypothetical question of \u2018what if,\u2019 and since we can not get our butts beyond the moon, there is no one except for astral-travelers who can; however, you have asked someone who can because my psychic seer has traveled far and wide through time and space. There are millions of inhabited worlds within our universe that contain humanoid life. Even though we can not travel to them physically in the Pleiades, we have communicated with many of them often. The Brotherhood\u2019s intergalactic fleet has been on Earth many times throughout the centuries; once to deliver life pods, also to transport Prince Calagastia plus all the supplies to construct the city of Atlantis. They also escorted the seraphic transport of Adam and Eve, and there is an intergalactic reclamation fleet presently standing by just outside our galaxy. Additionally, the many recently sighted and reported UFOs are the science vessels of the reclamation fleet from the Pleiades. They are presently working to repair the many holes we ignorantly tore through the seven protective veils of the ionosphere. To learn the entire story of the creation and destruction of Atlantis, you will have to access the Addendum to gain some of the divine knowledge we earthlings have been deprived of because of our loss of Atlantis. ------------------------------------------------------------------------ I realize that when you posted your question on Quora, you did not expect an answer from a Melchizedek teacher. I am a spiritual realist, not a Bible-thumping religious fanatic, and sharing divine information is what I do. Jesus is the creator of this planet, and I have been working on his behalf for eons, so this answer is not designed or intended for immediate understanding. The absorption of this information may require some time to digest. -------------------------------------------------------------------------Addendum: Rather than spending hours reproducing documents to respond to your question, I have prepared a two-part webpage containing information that will enlighten you to some celestial facts you never knew existed. You need to learn some fundamental divine truths about creation from the first part. It is also essential in comprehending the information of the second part, that discloses the facts of alien existence, intergalactic space fleets, and the entire Atlantis story aided by the use of my past life experiences as an alien astronaut plus much more. You are about to learn some celestial knowledge that everyone on this planet has been deprived since the fall of Atlantis. That too will be explained. ",

            "answer_text": "What if we found another human civilization on another planet far more advanced than us? At that point, the wheels come off the bus of reality. Seriously - it\u2019s quite possible that we\u2019ll detect another civilization. but it almost certainly won\u2019t be human, because evolution. Let\u2019s think this through - if the aliens are humans, that would mean that they branched off from us at some point. Now how and when did that happen? We know that we didn\u2019t get dropped on this planet by aliens, because the fossil record is pretty clear all the way back to the first mammals, which were small tree-dwelling rodent-like creatures. Similarly, the aliens can\u2019t be a long-lost tribe descended from an early human super-civilization that had space travel, because there\u2019s zero evidence of any human civilization other than hunter-gatherer tribes before 20,000 years ago or so - and more importantly, a distinct *lack* of the evidence we\u2019d expect to find if Denisovans or other early humans had space flight - no signs of cities, of mining, or anything else like that. So the only way this works is if some *other* space-faring species kidnapped enough early humans to create a viable colony, and transported them to this other planet, *and* gave them a kickstart on technology.
