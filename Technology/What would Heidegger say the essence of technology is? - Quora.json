            "answer_text": "Well, first he says in his essay Question Concerning Technology that the essence of technology is \u201cnothing technological\u201d, which basically means there is no machine, technique, or artifact that we can point to and say \u201cthat right there encapsulates what technology is.\u201d By bracketing the technological from the essence of technology, Heidegger intends to setup a free relation to technologies essence I.e what technologies essence does to us, for us, with us, etc. (A brief caveat: In the essay, Heidegger is talking about the essence of modern technology which is markedly different for him than the essence of technology for the Ancients) Contrary to other answers, the essence of Modern technology, for Heidegger, is very much a mode revealing (\u201crevealing\u201d for Heidegger means revealing of truth). For one, it is a revealing of the natural world as something that can challenged by us to procure energy, resources, and other things of utility. One might think of damming a river in order to power turbines that produce electricity that can be used to power tools to excavate mines to extract ore for the very same types of tools that were used to extract it. In this example, we see that the very mode of revealing nature as something to be challenged forth only shows the truth of modern technology as this capacity to further order its own instruments for the sole purpose of continuing to challenge nature to produce energy, resources, and things of utility that can stored and called upon to repeat this whole process we call technological development. Heidegger\u2019s worry is that the essence of modern technology\u2014 as this mode of revealing nature as something that can be challenged forth in order to further order develop the technological\u2014 is a mode of revealing (of truth) that excludes all other modes of revealing. Simply put, our obsession with technique, utility, and nature as this storehouse of energies and resources, blinds us to any other mode of revealing the truth about the world\u2026 such as the poetic, aesthetic, or ontological.

            "answer_text": "Heidegger was a member of the Nazi Party \u2014 even after they collapsed. Heidegger was thus a reactionary of a special degree. Thus, Heidegger was not an authentic Ontologist \u2014 on the contrary, he used Ontology as a rubric to support his reactionary politics and his support of Adolf Hitler. One of Heidegger\u2019s positions was about technology \u2014 he was against it. The truly \u201cauthentic\u201d life for Heidegger, was to go \u201cback to Nature,\u201d as far as the family farm. This \u201csimple life\u201d was how people were meant to live, in his ideal. Nevermind that this entailed the right of the first-born to own the land that the rest of his family \u2014 and outside community \u2014 would labor for the rest of their lives. This was normal, natural and \u201cauthentic\u201d life for Heidegger. In the same way, for Heidegger, every nation should have a Fuhrer, a leader whom everybody follows without question, and for whom everybody must be willing to sacrifice everything \u2014 including life. Where does technology fit in? Heidegger, wrote about the Essence of Technology in his late article, The Question Concerning Technology (1977). There he says that the Essence of Technology \u201cis by no means anything technological.\u201d This is his typical Nazi double-speak. He continues: Everywhere we remain unfree and chained to technology, whether we passionately affirm or deny it. (Heidegger, 1977)Heidegger then defines technology by referring to the ancient Greeks: (1) technology is a means to an end; and (2) technology is a uniquely human activity. Period. He concludes that all technology is merely instrumental in human life. The key, then, is to use technology \u201cproperly,\u201d and \u201cspiritually\u201d and to \u201cmaster it.\u201d What do these terms mean in 1977, however? He balks. In the Nazi period he was direct \u2014 \u201cproperly\u201d meant \u201cin the service of the Fuhrer\u201d. Heidegger will delve deeper into Greek and Latin terms about technology \u2014 without changing his conclusions. The Essence of Technology always came down to the demand to \u201cuse the instrument properly, \u201c without describing \u201cproperly\u201d in any detail. He ends his essay by asking the question again. ",

            "answer_text": "I will try to pass the general lines of the concept by Heidegger. Diferent from Isaac Espinoza or Thiago Novaes, \u201cman\" \u2014 concretely saying \u2014 does not exist. So, once Science works with universal values, like H2O (instead of water), or a quantitative of substances, it works with nothing of concrete. Even though, Science, that, in its nature, is descritive, calculates \u2014 so Chemistry, for example, manipulates things and refuse to lives it. Indeed: what is Chemistry? Or water? The specialist couldn't say, because is from the nature of his activity to don't think in this or like this. This logic applied to Modernity results in the concept of realm of technique. In other words: the prevalence of objectivity over anything that contributes to a vision of world, like tried since Antiquity untill Einstein, on the limit. So, fragmentation substitutes amplitude. Associated with Capital, this results in a game of interests. So, technology builds a weapon of large range, a remedy for helping to cure the consequences of the usage of this weapon etc. In this sense, \u201cthe progress that can't be stopped is a backwards that goes on\" \u2014 Adorno and Hokeimmer wrote. Because of all this, Heidegger insisted that Science does not think. Even though, it constitutes a force above even the Capital. The metaphysics of not only the Occident, but of the Orient too. ",

            "answer_text": "In a word, concealment. For any given thing; what it is is concealed in favor of what use it can be put to. The problem with technology is that it conceals its own fact of concealment. Every unconcealment is at the same time a concealment and every concealment is at the same time an unconcealment. If technological thinking conceals its own concealment, it conceals the very possibility of other kinds of unconcealment. So, your hand has two sides, if you put it face down you have unconcealed the back of your hand, while concealing the front of your hand, flip it over and vice versa. Now, what if you flipped your hand in such a manner that it showed you a way of handedness that at the same time prevented you from even thinking about the other side of your hand? What would it take to show you this forgotten aspect of Hands? The real danger of technology is that we then begin to apply technological thinking to ourselves and our fellow human beings this is one of the ways in which we become technologized. ",

            "answer_text": "Those who play with words are played by words. So any understanding in the \u201cessence\u201d of Heidegger\u2019s perception can only be obtained when one goes beyond meanings of superficialities by words. The fundamental debate re \u201ctechnology\u201d concerns its instrumentality in the perpetual conflict of man\u2019s quest in the duality of means and end. The conscious minds hence seek to analyze such an instrumentality so as to institutionalize either means or end for their functionality. That division of the intent introduces however unconsciously to the very departure from its true essence. The essence perceivable in realm of consciousness must be in upright agreement with that of man, from which man acts from without to within. In Heidegger\u2019s great depiction of Greek Temple, man in the state of being without finds his outlook in the state of being within in the vast emptiness that gives shapes and form, thoughts and ideas, and meanings and values. In between being and becoming lies that which enables this undefinable subtlety of finesses that finds man\u2019s entirety. So in this timeless making perphas seeds the creation of technology which instrumentality is of man in finding his outlook from within the emptiness of Greek Temple in no being nor becoming. ",
