The lens does affect the actual quality of the image (sharpness, clarity, contrast,) and yet it doesn\u2019t as all of these are also to an extent dependent on the sensor (size and type,) and on post production. Rule of thumb though is to get the \u2018best\u2019 lens you can afford with the widest aperture. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes - to a much larger degree. The lens is the very first part of the camera that interacts with light - if that process itself is not done well - no matter how well the rest of the camera is - the outcome would be quite poor. If there are budget constraints - try to invest in a good lens and make concessions in the camera. A good lens with a good medium to receive that light - typically your Image Sensor - would usually result in a good quality image. ",
