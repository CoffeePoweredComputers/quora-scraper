            "answer_text": "The single most POWERFUL technology is warp drive \u2014 we\u2019d be able to colonize the universe and even potentially leave earth behind \u2014 but it would require dozens of other secondary technologies to harness and make proper use of it. Doesn\u2019t matter if you can travel faster than light if you can\u2019t actually LIVE out in space. In terms of dropping ONE technology into 21st-century life, I feel like replicators would be the big one. World hunger\u2026 basically ended. Since Trek mentions \u201cindustrial replicators\u201d that can replicate construction materials and finished products, you wouldn\u2019t need exploitative factory labor and the carbon footprint it creates (though presumably those individual replicators would draw from the energy grid). Entire markets would be disrupted by the ability to create goods at home. Good luck charging $1100 for the new iPhone if you can just replicate one. Teleportation has more of a \u201ccool\u201d factor, and would also blow up a lot of the transportation industries, but I think replicators would have more wide-ranging impacts. ",

            "answer_text": "Self-replicating Replicators. There are other big ticket inventions in Star Trek that are fundamentally farther away from what is plausibly possible to us. And some of them could be used to cause Everyone Dies\u2122. Self-replicating Replicators could cause one too, and it could be a lot more interesting (in a horror SF kind of way) than any of the others. But they can radically transform life right now in basically any other direction we can imagine. It\u2019s not clear when replicator technology advanced to the point where a replicator could make an identical copy of itself. But they were available for the self-replicating minefield deployed by Sisko to defend DS9. ",
