            "answer_text": "In psych, you only have a few directions you can go without getting creative. The first seems to be the academic push which is clinical work. Usually you have to get into a masters program, do a lot of research for a couple years and then transfer into a company (usually) where you continue to do professional research. I will also add clinical work can lead to an academic track. You can also do therapy which is what I was considering, but it usually requires medical school if you want to prescribe medication, which most professional therapists do. The final is education. I do not necessarily mean professor either since it is more competitive than ever, but teacher or counselor level. A lot of people I graduated with went into teaching lower grades and doing that sort of work. Not what I wanted, but I do appreciate my friends who are teachers for it. I am a firm believer of social skills being important for handling people in any workplace and you can learn a lot from it. Being creative, you can do what I have done and use it to work in tech or other related fields. I will also advise you in the tech community I have run into a few very pompous people. If you do not have a CS degree there is a level of arrogance when you are starting out, so try not to let them push you. ",
