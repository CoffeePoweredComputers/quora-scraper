Big CPU box, and cathode ray monitor, so a 21\" screen meant a huge, hot box. Desk real estate could be a big consideration in making a purchasing decision. Windows 95 and Mac OS worked pretty much like present UIs, but slower and a lot less reliably (Windows 2000 was the first really reliable version of Windows).Graphics were a lot slower. Internet bandwidth was a lot lower, and it was still a bit unusual to be on a WAN. CPUs were single-core, and quite a bit slower. Memory was more expensive, so you had less in a machine; same with disk storage. We had these funny things called floppy disks. All of the points in the last para mean that, even with a windowing UI, most computing was textual, with pictures only for special purposes. Professionally, I used a computer for writing, for email, and for bibliographical search. For these purposes, I could use software from 1996 perfectly happily today (I'd rather have a modern OS, but maybe a 1996 word processor would be more comfortable, for what I do). Recreationally, I could not use a computer for my music library, my photography, my television viewing, looking at lolcats, or being on Quora. ",

            "answer_text": "I bought my first computer 20 years ago. My family had a Commodore 64 when I was younger, but I was recently out of college and this was the first one I'd bought myself. I can't remember what brand it was now (probably Packard Bell), but I do remember a lot of the specs. It came with a blazing fast 19.6 modem\u2014better than the 14.4 baud most had at the time. The hard drive was a humongous 3.1GB\u2014surely I'd never use up all that space! It had a standard 15\u2033 CRT monitor, CD drive and floppy drive, too. It had a 486 Pentium chip and maybe 250 or 500 MB of RAM. All for the bargain price of $1399 (compared to a lot of other competitors, that was low). My desktop then looked pretty much like they do now, only it laid horizontally, not in the more familiar vertical tower most go with now. Of course, not long after I bought it, faster modems came out, MP3s arrived to suck up all the memory I thought I'd never fill up, CD drives became DVD drives, processors got so much faster, RAM and hard drives grew, monitors got much bigger and eventually flatter and prices went down, down, down One thing that was great, though, I learned a lot about doing my own upgrades\u2014RAM, video cards, hard drives and more. It was much cheaper to do your own upgrades than to buy a new system. Now the opposite is often true. ",

            "answer_text": "Anyone could own them who could afford them, but they were not terribly expensive, depending on you wanted. In 1996 I guess maybe I was using an Acorn RiscPC, so something like this:  Not long after that, I was able to get a used Sun Ultra 1, so something like this:  In terms of hardware speed, things have changed a lot in that time, in terms of the overall experience, it\u2019s not changed all that much. In 1996 you could be programming Python or Java, and in 2016, you could be doing the same, and both language haven\u2019t changed as much as some may have you believe. In 1996 or before, a teenager with part time job could afford a computer, maybe not brand new (certainly not a new Sun Ultra 1!), but computers were available, attainable, and less different to today\u2019s computer than you might think.

Anyone could own a PC if you had the money to buy it, of course. Even laptops, but they were VERY heavy and VERY expensive! Windows 95 was out in full swing. I think I actually already had a cell phone by 1995. It was cheaper than using the landline for long distance phone calls, but I had a 2nd phone line installed at the house for business use since I was supporting folks in Europe and Asia. Baud rate was slow (33.6k modem). No wifi of course, all wired into the house phone line. I was on AOL. Still have my account that I created I think in 1990. ",

It was a perfect tool at that time - compared, for instance, to calculators and typewriters\u2026 I cant remember the price in relation to my salary, but it was an affordable expense. Processing of voluminous data was a bit slow. A few years later came the internet and the windows concept. Much more software, much higher memory year after year. What shall the future bring ? ",
