            "answer_text": "Technology is a tool. A tool that helps achieve something. A product is something you sell. A product provides an experience with benefits. That experience and the benefits is what a person derives value from. A product can utilize technology as a tool to alter the experience you provide. The product team is focused on what experience the product needs to provide and why. They create the strategies and \"blueprints\" for the other teams to follow in how they build the actual product. They also design the tests to prove their assumptions around the product in the market. The technology team is focused on what technology to use and how to integrate it into the product. They reference the \"blueprints\" to understand context around the answers to those questions. They work closely with the product team to know what tech is best suited to achieve to goals laid out in terms of capabilities and performance and other such things. Essentially. ",

            "answer_text": "Ah. Yes. I think more importantly than answering the question directly is talking about the likely context. I sometimes play startup doctor. When a VC friend asks me to look at a start up and offer an opinion. And one of the diagnosis I sometimes get is that the team has a technology but not a product. What does this mean? That the team has been focused on building something. And that something is cool and different and novel. But the focus has been inward, towards the engineering, and not outward to the users. There could be a deficit in the product marketing. Which is easier to fix. Meaning the message isn't out. Or there could be a deficit in that the product isn't shaped. There's a technology but not a product. Some of the other answers describe this situation. The difference to me has to do with the lens you use to see the world. A product is focused on users and how they understand the world. And you're giving them a tool that fits well in their hand to accomplish their tasks. A technology is something that works. But that probably users need to figure out how to use it to solve their problem. It's not obvious. ",
