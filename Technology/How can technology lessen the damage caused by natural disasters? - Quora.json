            "answer_text": "Sadly, even with the best technology in the world, even if we could predict large-scale disasters like a supervolcano eruption or a massive earthquake like another big one on the New Madrid, the real issue would be where would the safe places actually be? If Yellowstone were to erupt today, the immediate eruption would spew enough ash and debris to bury the whole of Texas under five feet of ash and debris. Everything within 100 miles of the caldera would be completely vaporized in an instant. Everything within 250 miles would face the wrath of the pyroclastic floes, and everything within 1200 miles, including Kansas City, would be choked by a cloud of microscopic glass particles. The fallout would be on a global scale, with the supervolcano spewing so much ash and sulfur dioxide gas into the atmosphere that it would block out the sun\u2019s rays and cause a global cooling. The next \u201cbig one\u201d on the New Madrid Seismic Zone, would cause total or catastrophic destruction to everything within one million square miles of the epicenter - which would be near or just north of Memphis Tennessee. There are 11 million people who live in that one million square mile zone. Even with the best technology in the world, and even if we could predict the next big one on the New Madrid, it would severely overload the nation\u2019s infrastructure, having to evacuate that many people, and that\u2019s assuming there would be enough time to do so. The New Madrid is not a strike-slip fault like the Cascadia or the San Andreas. The New Madrid is the leftovers of a failed rift from when the continents split apart. Known as the Reelfoot Rift, it lay invisible under the vast alluvial plains of the central and eastern United States until one unusually warmer-than-average day in December 1811. The tremors were epicentered 50 miles northwest of Memphis Tennessee, but did damage as far away as Detroit Michigan. They were felt as far away as Washington DC, where then-President Thomas Jefferson was woken from his sleep. It rang church bells in Boston Massachusetts. Even with all the research that has been done, and even with the miracle of modern technology, it is not known why the New Madrid is as active as it is, nor is it known why it can produce such massive earthquakes. What is known is that another big one WILL happen. The question is, when. ",
