Link To The Original - Ayushman Singh's answer to How do I increase my thinking speed for new problems during JEE preparation? Well, I guess this is something that every IIT aspirant would like to know. The thing is however, that there is no exact method to do so but there are some tips that will definitely help you. When you're studying try and keep a water bottle handy or a glass of water. An occasional sip will only serve to keep you hydrated and help your brain feel less more agile instead of foggy.Always get atleast 7\u20138 hours of sleep. It has been scientifically proven that if you sleep less than 6 hours in a day your brain is not able to achieve optimal performance for the next 3\u20134 days.Get regular breaks and intervals during you studies. Focus on quality of study hours rather than quantityKeeping your concepts clear will make it easier to attempt new unconventional problems rather than just mugging up a certain method. (Before you begin your studies for the day do a quick revision of whatever you studied the previous day, it helps a lot)Whenever you're stuck on a problem/question just move on to the next one. Return to it sometime later with a new approach. 90% of the time when you return after some time rather than just remaining stuck on it for hours to an end you will end up solving it successfully!Oh, and also practice makes perfect. Try and solve a wide variety of questions rather than practicing many questions of a similar pattern.Getting a hobby or just exercising for 1\u20132 hours a day helps your brain to get some off time from the constant barrage of questions and as such will help it in being fresher to take in new concepts while you're studying.And finally, All The Best for JEE ",
