            "answer_text": "Yes, but it is getting less and less every year. NGMOs (Natural Genetic Modified Organisms) are the norm. GMOs are man made. Gene modification is a standard operating procedure for Mother Nature. It has been being done since the beginning by what science calls exosomes. Although they weren\u2019t discovered until 1986, they have been doing their job the whole time they were unknown. A special case of the exosome is what science calls a virus. Although it was discovered first and has been around just as long as the exosome, it has RNA in it that causes the cell it penetrates to replicate the virus. Science hasn\u2019t examined why as it assumes the virus is a thing in itself totally separate from an exosome. Science refuses to consider it even though the two are essentially identical.  The message (in case you missed it) is that exosomes are the way cells communicate in order to modify the genes of the nucleus in real time. Genes are not once and done. Modern doctors will tell you it is one of the \u201c3 Gs\u201d when you ask them about the disease you have been diagnosed with. It was caused by a germ, your genes or God. What they fail to account for is a germ (bad bacteria) can only take up residence in your body if you have done something to provide a place and a source of nourishment. Germs are opportunistic, they only go where there is an opportunity for food and shelter. The assumption is your genes are the same since you were born. The reality is your genetic make up is changing on a day to day, minute to minute basis over your entire life. If it isn\u2019t germs and it isn\u2019t genes, the only thing left is God and science only recognizes His existence when there is no other choice. The correct answer should be, \u201cWe don\u2019t know.\u201d Our problem is these people are convinced they know what they are doing and they have most of the population of the planet convinced as well. We are going downhill in a full bus with no brakes and a bozo at the wheel. If you are thinking we are all going to die, you are right, it is just going to be sooner than anyone figured.

            "answer_text": "The question specifically stipulates that the modification has to come from human production. If we grow it, then it has been modified due to human intervention by the selection of desirable traits. Compare corn to teosinte or the modern beef cow to an auroch and you will quickly get a grasp of what we have been up to. As other answers suggest, anything wild caught or harvested has probably undergone only slight modification due to the harvesting techniques. These would be primarily behavioral adaptations. Whether it is a wild persimmon, field cress, pawpaw, perch, catfish, crab, deer, turkey or wild duck it is basically the same organism that existed prior to human hunting and gathering\u2026..which by the way really isn\u2019t considered production.

People who use \u201cgenetically modified\u201d to include normal selection of the best plant to replant are usually trying to defend artificial gene manipulation. Selection and hybridization have probably been used on most crops grown on a large scale. Many foods are still wild-harvested, animals, plants, and fungi. Some people then cultivate these wild-harvested foods. ",
