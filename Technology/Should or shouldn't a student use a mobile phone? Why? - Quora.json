            "answer_text": "5 Reasons Why Students Should be Allowed to Use Cell Phones in School 1. In Preparation for a Real World Job Most working people benefit from having their cell phones on them. They can access their email, call clients, check inventory, read the news, use software applications, and more. Students need to learn how to use their cell phones responsibly (see next tip!). 2. To Teach Responsibility Students know they shouldn\u2019t use their cell phones in school to play Angry Birds, or listen to music, or text their friends about the quiz they just took. Phones and tablets should be used responsibly and for educational purposes. Students could do research for English papers, or download an app that provides extra information on one of the chemical elements in the periodic table. When necessary, teachers could combat cheating by making students put their phones on \u201cairplane mode\u201d or any mode that will not allow them to send/receive any messages or use the Internet. Whenever there is a test, teachers can make students put their mobile devices in the front of the classroom until the test is over. 3. To Avoid Double Standards Administrators often take notes on their phones as part of teacher observations. Some teachers, coaches, and counselors use their cell phones in school settings, too. It may not be permitted, but they are allowed to do so without the same consequences as students. Why shouldn\u2019t students be able to do the same? 4. In Case of Emergency If a student forgot his homework or calculator on the day of a calculus test, he could call his parents and ask them to bring it to school without causing a scene. In more serious emergencies, like a school threat or shooting, cell phones could help students connect with worried parents. 5. As Learning Aids Many phone apps offer visual representations of difficult-to-grasp subjects (like astronomy, science, or anatomy) that can assist visual learners and/or students who have dyslexia. Tablets offer the same services, but may provide a better user experience because of the size difference. ",

            "answer_text": "A student could be anyone from a 5 years old to someone over 21. So lets start with a 12 year old, at that age they should be able to use, and keep safe a phone. Also at that age, they will need to use the phone, to look up information relating to their studies. Now as to using the phone in the classroom, that should be left up to the teacher. You would, of course, not be wanting your students to look up correct answers on a test! ",
