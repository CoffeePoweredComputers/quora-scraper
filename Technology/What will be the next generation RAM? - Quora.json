            "answer_text": "Only 3 days back JEDEC (Joint Electron Device Engineering Council (JEDEC) Solid State Technology Association has just released final specifications for the next genDDR5 RAM. This has some very significant upgrade over last-gen DDR4 RAM. There are improvement in Capacity, Bandwidth coupled with lower power consumption. The DDR5 standard quadruples the maximum die density from DDR4, going from 16 GB per die to 64 GB. While the data for DDR5 shall be 6.4 GBps, doubling the data rate of the existing DDR4 modules at 3.2 GBps. Although the initial DDR5 RAM to hit the market will be capped at 4.8 GBps. Hynix has already spoken about its plans for launching DDR5-8400 modules, they would deliver 134.4GB/s of memory bandwidth. DDR5 modules will operate at 1.1 V instead of 1.2 V of previous-gen which should result in enhanced power efficiency. How much, is yet to be determined. Moreover, every DDR5 DIMM stick will work in dual-channel on its own. As the memory banks are now addressable on two independent 32-bit sub-channels. So you don\u2019t need to buy 2 sticks for dual channel benefits. Only one stick would suffice. For quad-channel, instead of 4 sticks, you can buy 2 sticks only. Which will save some money and latency even. ",

Here are a few points to consider about: 6400 Mhz is going to be available for servers by the start of 2021 but will be very expensive.Consumer PCs will see DDR5 implementation in 2022\u201323 (this was shown in the AMD ryzen future release road map meeting) but it will be very expensive.By 2024\u201325 DDR5 prices will be dropped enough for midrange PC to start using them.",
