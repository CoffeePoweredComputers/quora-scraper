            "answer_text": "The premise of this question is based on a falsehood that does not bear up to scrutiny. We do not know any such thing, unless your expectations are that it was supposed to be a \u201cone thing that fixes everything\u201d situation, which is something I don\u2019t believe there is anyone with intelligence who has made such a claim. IF INSTEAD the meaning of your question was more along the lines of what technologies are being developed that will help to contribute in moving us out of the downward spiral that is destructive man-made climate change, along with a more widespread introduction of electric cars, then there are many many possibilities that are being explored. Electric propulsion for vehicles having been proven for a long long time to be more than merely viable. Think diesel trains and submarines, these are all electric propulsion. Better battery technology, including better Lithium variations, Sodium, Iron/Nickle, Aluminium (and yes I spelt it the right way), Sugar Enzyme, etc. Many alternative Power Generation options such as the Solar Tower, Tidal, Wave, new tech Geothermal, waste heat energy harvesting, etc. As the generation of electrical power is one of the greatest contributors of the problem. Notable dead ends are Nuclear - capacity from available source material could only address a very small part of the need, without even considering the other nasty issues of employing this option. Hydrogen - there may be future breakthroughs to bring this back to the table, but currently the issues of storage - cryogenic or high pressure - take so much away from the ability to use hydrogen to generate electricity, the net benefit is barely worth it. Fuel cells have also been less than spectacular, with high costs and the need for rare minerals. Carbon sequestration has also seen very little progress from original promises, so we really should stop burning coal, sooner rather than later. Other options that have been investigated are things like using a huge automatically operated kite on large ships to reduce fuel consumption, or the use of tall solid directional masts for the same reason. Which , if any, of these will prove to be commercial viable options longer term, only time will tell, but one thing that is certain - there is no such thing as a silver bullet that will fix the mess we have made. Instead co-operation, commitment, innovation and a diverse approach will be needed. ",

            "answer_text": "The Johnson-Su Composting Bioreactor. It was invented around 2005 and has had over 10 years of field studies. I'm 100% serious. A farmer can build one with $50 worth of materials they can buy at a local hardware store. Every farm in the world needs to have one. A single bioreactor can support about 1,000 acres, so a large 50 square mile [32,000 acre] farm would need roughly 32:  [Note the shipping pallets as the base. That allows for easy movement by forklift if needed, but more importantly it allows airflow to the bottom of the compost stack.] The resulting compost is highly fungal spore dense. It is important the microorganism population reflect the local environment, so you would not want compost from New Mexico to be used in North Dakota, as an example. Unlike traditional compost, this compost is an inoculant that can be applied at extremely low rates. The biggest effect is when it is applied directly to the seeds or seed rows. In limited studies, fields using the inoculant and BEAM have averaged 10 tonnes carbon/hectare/year of soil carbon sequestration. BEAM - biologically enhanced agriculture management There is 1.6 billion hectares of global cropland, thus a potential for 16 billion tonnes [16GT] of soil carbon sequestration per year. Human fossil fuel CO2 emissions is about 10 GT carbon/year. Research is ongoing about how best to inoculate established pasture and rangeland. There is about 3.6 billion hectares of global rangeland.  === Jan 9, 2020 edit === In a comment, someone asked what I was even talking about. Here\u2019s some more detail: A Bioreactor is a tool for growing biology. In this case fungi. By letting the compost sit for a year, the fungi first flourish, then starve to death. The starvation step is critical. When they starve they produce large amounts of fungi spores. Globally, agricultural land is highly beneficial fungi deficient. This compost acts as a inoculant to restore the fungal population. There are 2 other key steps: Farmers have to quit plowing their fields. Beneficial fungi aren't robust enough to live through the soil being turned over. 35% of US cropland is no longer tilled, so plowing is not critical to farming. If you look at this, the oldest cropland in the US was around the Cheasapeake Bay. It is the most degraded from plowing, so it has been the first too move away from plowing and to more sustainable farming practices. California on the other hand still has rich, deep topsoil; the farmers there haven\u2019t had to face the fact that decade after decade of plowing fields degrades the soil: 2) it is optimal to grow a cover crop in the fall [seed immediately after harvest]. The cover crop isn't meant to be harvested. It's job is to perform photosynthesis and exude roughly 50% of the liquid sugars resulting from that into the soil to feed the microorganisms during the fall and spring. Cover crop species are selected based on their ability to increase soil health and feed the fungi via root exudes. For gardner's, they can buy winter cover crop seeds already pre-mixed from Amazon: Amazon.com : No-Till Farm and Garden Cover Crop Mix Seeds - 1 Lbs - Blend of Gardening Cover Crop Seeds: Hairy Vetch, Daikon Radish, Forage Collards, Triticale, More : Garden & Outdoor This cover crop seed blend is great for either fall or spring. Planting rate is about 65 lbs per acre or one pound will cover about 600 square feet. 23% - Austrian Field Pea Seeds21% - Winter Wheat Seeds19% - Triticale Seeds8% - Collards Forage Seeds8% - Hairy Vetch Seeds8% - Driller Daikon Radish Seeds3% - Crimson Clover3% - Berseem Clover2% - Yellow Mustard SeedsSome Seeds Inoculated with Nitrogen Fixing BacteriaFarmers would likely buy their seeds in bulk and mix them together themselves. The cover crop seeds should be covered with the compost. 1 liter whole milk, 0.125 liter molasses, 1 kg mature compost to cover a hectare worth of seeds [2.5 acres worth]. Just before seeding the main cash crop in the spring, use a roller-crimper to terminate the cover crop:  How to Build Your Own Bioreactor Once mature [365 days later, but you can store it for years]: For a seed coating or seedling root dip: Make a slurry 1 liter whole milk, 0.125 liter molasses, 1 kg of compost. Either dip in the seedling roots, or coat your seeds before drilling/planting. As a seed coat, used 1 liter of slurry oer hectare worth of seeds [2.5 acres worth]. For an injectable liquid you can put into the liquid fertilizer reservoir on a commercial seed drill/planter: 70 liters of wate mixed with 1 kg of mature compost. Shake extremely vigorously to dislodge the fungal spores into the water. Drain off the water and put it into the liquid fertilizer reservoir. Apply 70 liters of fungal spore dense water per hectare [2.5 acres]. Inject the liquid into the seed rows when you seed. For pasture, it doesn't go near as far: Spread 400-500 lbs of compost per acre. That's a light dusting.
