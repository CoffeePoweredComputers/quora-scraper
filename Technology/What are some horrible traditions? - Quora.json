I can think of several horrible traditions, although most of them are from countries outside the U.S. Consider the following, which are \u201ctraditional\u201d in several countries: Clitoridectomy.Suttee.Stoning.Decapitation.Keelhauling (no longer practiced in America; but, who knows about other places)Ritual scarification (see the Chambri tribe, Papua in New Guinea, Africa).Slavery (still going on today in Africa).These are just a few off the top of my head; there are far more than I could list if I went on all day.

At least one person mentioned that he or she would give him nothing but a Christmas stocking with a piece of coal in it. I think that another person mentioned that he or she had received that one time. Talk about Christmas spirit! What an ugly tradition. ",
