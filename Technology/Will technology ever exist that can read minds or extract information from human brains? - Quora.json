            "answer_text": "Technology has actually arguably already accomplished a crude form of reading minds and extracting information from human brains! And it\u2019s existed for quite some time now. Exhibit A: The Mind-controlled robotic arm I learned about this a few years ago in one of my classes and I was blown away. I remember looking around at my friends with an astounded \u201cis-this-actually-real???\u201d sort of expression on my face. When I first learned about this concept, scientists at the University of Pittsburgh had succeeded in implanting an electrode array in a monkey\u2019s brain which would pick up electric impulses, called action potentials, sent out by neurons. The electrode was placed in a way that it would be able to differentiate between signals from different regions of the brain\u2019s motor cortex that control the movement of different parts of the arm. The brain actually has a pretty consistent, well-documented map of these regions for both motor and sensory function.  The signals were sent via wires to a computer, which would interpret and translate them into guided motion of a robotic arm. So, in this way, the monkey could be trained to control a robotic arm using just its thoughts! This technology existed in the 2000\u2019s! And in fact, the monkey was even able to pick up pieces of popcorn and put them into its mouth! Their work was published in Nature. Pretty amazing stuff. Here\u2019s a link: Monkeys move robotic arm using brain power. Today, the technology has progressed to where just this winter, a man from Florida became the first person to live with a mind-controlled prosthetic arm, developed at the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Lab. Check it out! Florida man becomes first person to live with advanced mind-controlled robotic arm. I was amazed years ago when I heard about this, but technology has progressed a great deal since then. Today, machines that can actually understand complex, language-dependent thoughts are being developed. A lot of these machines use a similar basic method as the mind-controlled robotic arms. However, there are multiple ways to go about doing this, including but not limited to the following: -Analyzing fMRI scans to predict what a subject is looking at (Purdue: Researchers demonstrate \u2018mind-reading\u2019 brain-decoding tech) -Implanting an electrode in the auditory cortex to detect what people are hearing (UCSF: http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1741-2552/aaab6f/meta) -Analyzing EEG results from electrodes on the surface of the brain to reconstruct visual memories of faces (University of Toronto: Do you see what I see? Researchers develop mind-reading algorithm to reconstruct what we perceive) -And, most interestingly to me, using a face-mounted device which can detect impulses from peripheral nerves, also using surface electrodes. The device can follow thought commands! (MIT: AlterEgo: A Personalized Wearable Silent Speech Interface \u2013 MIT Media Lab)  There are probably many, many more examples, but these are some that stood out to me! As you can see, technology has already started to venture into mind reading territory. It\u2019s really fascinating stuff. The potential applications are many, but research into this tech certainly needs to be approached with respect and a great deal of ethical consideration.

            "answer_text": "Yes. It's already been being developed in crude forms to some people's ideas of this type of technology, and we have some individuals developing much more aesthetically pleasing looking forms. Personally, I'm interested in the ways with which individuals are learning how to read the information and stimulate in ways the minds of individuals. For some, it's obviously more than a placebo effect, especially when a paralyzed individual can learn to type by thought, use of an artificial limb for an amputee, or many more things. ",
