            "answer_text": "I\u2019m not sure what you consider mid-price for OLED TVs, since they start at expensive and go up from there. But my choice would be the LG CX in your choice of size (48, 55, 65, and 77 inches are available), because in addition to all the TV goodness it has 120 Hz inputs and has a low latency mode and variable sync (both G-Sync and FreeSync) for gaming. (Most TVs that advertise 120 Hz or 240 Hz only use it for motion smoothing, but those LGs can actually receive and display a signal at that refresh rate.) That\u2019s one step up from their BX, which doesn\u2019t have the 120 Hz input capability, but below their fancy ultrathin models. ",
