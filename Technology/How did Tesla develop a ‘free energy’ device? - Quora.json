            "answer_text": "There is simply no evidence Tesla was even attempting to do such a thing. Tesla was trying to build a wireless transmission system. Wardenclyffe Tower was going to be a prototype for a method of sending messages and media content and broadcasting electrical power. The electrical power was going to be produced by generators purchased from the Westinghouse Electric Company. The construction of Wardenclyffe was designed to make money. A lot of money. Tesla wrote to JP Morgan (his major investor) \u201c\u2026 I could not report yacht races or signal incoming steamers. There was no money in this. This was no business for a man of your position and importance. Perhaps you have never fully appreciated the sense of this obligation.\u201d (Nikola Tesla: The Lost Wizard) If so, why didn't this technology spread around the world? Tesla was relying on other people\u2019s money and that ran out. The money ran out at least partly because Tesla was not producing results. But it was never going to work.

            "answer_text": "The same way many people have developed free energy devices, Tesla didn't develop one and wasn't an scientist. Basically he believed there was a energy field around the Earth and that he could tap into it. However, he was wrong on both accounts. While you can say that the energy field is the earth's magnetic field, Tesla certainly didn't know about the magnetic field and you can't get any useful power out of it. The man was brilliant in one field, but went crazy towards the end of his life, and that combined with his lack of knowledge outside of his field led to him hold bad ideas which have been promoted as perfect because they sound good and Tesla had some of his good ideas stolen which has led to a movement that all his ideas were stolen.
