How would you expound that statement by Martin Heidegger by giving real time example based on the society that we have today?\u201d A discussion of the origin and influences on Heidegger's understanding of technology would be incomplete without an account of his mature view of technology. Now there is no single major text in which Heidegger develops his mature conception of the technological phenomenon. Rather, there are a number of works of varying size in which technology is a theme. These texts culminate in a four-lecture cycle, titled \"Insight into What Is,\" given at the end of 1949 and repeated in 1950. [68] Of these lectures, one remains unpublished and nearly inaccessible. [69] A second one, which is published and available in English translation, is only minimally connected to the problem of technology. [70] Both of the remaining lectures are directly concerned with technology. [71] Both address the same, or similar material in related ways and both are from the same period. Since Heidegger subsequently reworked his discussion of \"The Question concerning Technology,\" since it is more substantial, and since it concerns the \"essence\" of technology, it is representative of his mature understanding of technology. The essay to which we now turn is difficult, even in comparison with Heidegger's other writings. For whatever reason, Heidegger's considerable capacity to communicate his meaning seems suddenly to have been bracketed, placed in parentheses as it were. He has further not been helped by a translation into English which is often even odder than Heidegger's frequently odd German text. [72] This is especially regrettable since Heidegger's thought, which normally depends on the analysis of language, is even more than usually dependent on etymological commentary in this essay. One difficulty in presenting Heidegger's theory of technology is that it seems to follow squarely from his claims about the German language. We can start to describe his view by pointing to the parallel between this essay and Heidegger's persistent concern with the problem of Being. As in Being and Time , where he inquires into the meaning of Being, so in this essay he raises the question of the meaning of technology, or more precisely its essence. Here, after his turn away from the philosophical tradition, he claims to understand \"essence\" in a supposedly nonmeta-physical sense. For Heidegger, the essence of technology is different from technology and not itself something technological. [73] This assertion depends on his understanding of \"essence.\" Heidegger clarifies his understanding of \"essence\" and the essence of technology by pointing to the Latin words \"quidditas \" and \"genus. \" \"Essence,\" or we can say the essence of essence, is something which, to reproduce his own terminology, endures, holds sway, administers itself, develops and decays. In this connection, he calls attention to the etymological relation of the term \"essence\" (\"Wesen \") to the verb \"w\u00e4hren \" and to Goethe's use of the \"mysterious\" word \"fortw\u00e4hren .\" [74] Perhaps what he has in mind is the distinction between something that just is, for instance a fixed property, and the Aristotelian concept of energeia , which denotes that which not only is but is also in act. [75] Heidegger's strategy is to insist that an approach to technology that is not squarely based on Being\u2014in a word, any approach other than his own\u2014falls short of the phenomenon. Heidegger does not deny that technology is partly instrumental, although he denies that instrumentality is central to it. For Heidegger, everyone \"knows\" the \"instrumental or anthropological statements about technology,\" that is, that technology is a means to an end and a human activity. [76] Whether or not everyone believes these statements to be true, certainly some observers, for instance Spengler, accept roughly this approach. [77] For Heidegger, the usual instrumental or anthropological conception of technology picks out something true about technology but misses its essence, which is neither instrumental nor anthropological. His solution is to address the noninstrumental, nonanthropological aspect of technology through a reflection on a concept which, in his view, is presupposed by both instrumental and noninstrumental, or essential, views of technology.

            "answer_text": "Philosophers generally pose problems, very few give solutions. The quote in question reveals a misunderstanding of the issue. Technology is actually a method of manipulating what is revealed through the senses and thinking. The remarks on the language barriers mentioned in Caroline Ben-Ari's answer also apply to English. It is not for nothing that in the church Latin is still used today as a means of revelation because with its help superior concepts of this kind can be better explained. ",
