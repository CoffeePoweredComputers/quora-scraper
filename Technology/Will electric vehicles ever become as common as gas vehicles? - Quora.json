            "answer_text": "Not at all. Plenty of gasolene cars are being sold right now. Even in Norway which is an EV hot-spot, EVs are \u2018only\u2019 at 50% (or maybe just a bit over). Now a regular car has a typical life span of 15 years (that\u2019s a guess but it seems reasonable) So it would take something quite major to get rid of these cars en-mass. Some people are pro-EV, some anti, and many people right now are interested in the development, but nowhere near spending that much money on something they are not sure about. Indeed, the rapid development puts people off - next years model will be way better, and I\u2019m going to be left with a worthless asset. So we are a few years away from sales parity, a few more from say 80% EV sales, and then there is the time frame for the fleet of cars on the road to reach the end of their lives. Towards the end, fuel stations may get fewer and fewer, and range issues for gas engine cars will be a problem - but not anytime soon. But here\u2019s the thing - its better for things to happen over time. Don\u2019t want refinery or fuel station workers to be laid off all of a sudden. The economy needs notice to adjust. Nobody wants to see coal works laid off with nothing to replace the jobs - so a good few years notice, take the hearts and minds of the people with you, allow new jobs to come replace those that are going.

            "answer_text": "Sigh\u2026. Tesla\u2019s have but a fraction of the number of parts in them as a gas vehicle yet the two types have basically the same functionality. it is on an industrial scale much simpler, with much less labour per vehicle and with a lower parts count a higher gross margin opportunity to build an EV over an ICE powered car. But the matter remains of building the battery pack\u2026 To do this efficiently dedicated factories that take raw materials in and generate finished battery packs out need to be constructed. Right now only ONE such factory exists in the world, the joint venture between Panasonic and Tesla in the Nevada Dessert known as Giga-Factory1. There is a dispute going on between Panasonic - the worlds largest producer of Lithium Ion Batteries and Tesla as Tesla is favouring another vendor in China to supply their factory in Shanghai and this is understandable over the proprietary nature of Panasonic\u2019s batteries and the intellectual property issues involved. Panasonic does not want China to be given what they created. The Chinese government provided the Capital to Tesla to produce this factory in record time to pump out Model 3\u2019s and probably Model Y\u2019s as the two cars share full platforms and most parts. But to produce cars in real volume dozens of such battery plants will be needed and no one else has broken ground to do so. The other related technology are super charging stations - rapid charge stations and a network of them needs to be constructed as Tesla has done\u2026 to a standard on a commercial basis\u2026 So yes the economic reasons are there to do this - but realistically to do it in massive volumes will either take Government involvement and incentives as was the case in China or it will take decades to accomplish and I am unfortunately betting on time as I do not se action on the part of the major conventional vehicle producers to make the moves required to be in the business.. They are all waiting on the availability of massive government involvement in terms of laws, provision of financing and more to be in the business\u2026 It is going to take a lot of time\u2026 or huge HUGE amounts of money to do it faster.. Like what was done with war production during WWII\u2026 that is the sort of money and dedication required to do the job. ",

            "answer_text": "In a word no. There are 263 million registered vehicles in America alone. Current world wide sales of E.V.s are around 2 million last time I checked. Now that IS improving obviously, but lets be generous and say we can instantly multiply that by a factor of 10 to be able to sell 20 million E.V.s a year. Lets assume that we can manufacture E.V.s that are direct usable replacements for every I.C.E. vehicle in use currently (we can\u2019t) We import that entire production into the U.S So, we FORCE people in the U.S. to buy ONLY new E.V.s, and force them to take old I.C.E. vehicles off the road. It\u2019s still going to take 13 years to replace EVERY vehicle in the U.S. alone. And that's assuming that we can some how manufacture that many each year, sell those only in the U.S., and make people buy them buy law or something. Just not going to happen. There is also ALOT of infrastructure to think about, charging stations, service centres, Sales. I believe that in the U.S. a lot of this is in place. However, there are many, places where this just wont be economic, or even practical. Africa, South America, Russia, Australia, are examples of this. There are towns and even cities in Australia for instance that are well isolated by distance, and you can\u2019t just carry a spare jerry can of gas or two to fill up the E.V. \u201ctank\u201d and extend your range. Even WHEN they start manufacturing E.V.s in the quantities needed to replace the current I.C.E. fleet, it\u2019s likely to take 20 to 30 years to replace all the vehicles currently on the road. And even then, I\u2019d be surprised if there aren\u2019t many die hard I.C.E. fans out there that just wont let go of their pride and joy. ",

            "answer_text": "Will electric vehicles ever become as common as gas vehicles? Speaking strictly as a consumer - with virtually no technical expertise - I would say \u201cYes, but\u2026\u201d. Electric appeals to me because of quiet operation, not having to take the vehicle in as often for routine maintainance like oil changes, not having to visit fueling stations except on trips, and a certain hoped-for increase in reliability. It you have ever toasted a crankshaft sensor or had a timing chain jump a few teeth at 10 pm on a Friday night in the middle of nowhere you will know what I mean about reliability. The \u201cBut\u201d being range. Given comparable costs of ownership, I think we are waiting for some future generation of batteries to push real-world driving ranges up to the vicinity of 500 miles. .. .. Either that or hydrogen instead of batteries as the energy-storage medium. Given a certain availability of fast-charging stations, a 500-mile real-world range would allow for normal driving/break times on trips My understanding is that, for the sake of long-term battery life, batteries neither be charged to over 80% capacity nor drained beyond 20%. That gives RealWorldRange = (AdvertisedRange * 60%). Chevy claims 238 for their Bolt, which I would extrapolate to a real-world 140. .. .. Not enough for my 180-mile round-trips to the New Jersey shore and probably not nearly enough towing my itty-bitty 650# GVW boat trailer. So: eventually, yes - but not next year or the year after that. Metallic Lithium? ",

            "answer_text": "Most of the electric vehicle adoption is either due to the government trying to ban new gas vehicle sales or because there are people who have already given up on the combustion engine despite the fact they have many years behind them. The truth is who really knows. I can guess that they will not be as common as gasoline vehicles or rather exceed the sales of gasoline vehicles. They can try to ban the sale of new gasoline vehicles but there is no guarantee that people would all rush out to buy an electric vehicle. People are trying very hard to make it seem like EVs are really the future rather than they are just pushing people to get one. You see it on social media and even on here people are trying to convince others that combustion engine vehicles are dying. In reality the vehicles are lasting a lot longer because more people are maintaining them well (or its just because they have a maintenance/change oil light come on and its easy to keep a car running well that way). I just dont see it happening. Mainly because it makes no sense to buy a vehicle that you dont really have a method to charge it with and it's going to cost you money to get your home EV capable or you have to wait for the vehicle to charge. I have a ton of personal reasons why I wont buy an EV and eventually the EV craze may die out because there are only so many enthusiasts out there. They can keep buying new Teslas but even then it's like you have to eventually call it quits when these cars approach 15 years old and an apartment resident can only afford a $500 vehicle that he needs it to work. It'll be interesting how it turns out, but I don't think the government should be involved because it'll then be a problem for those who don't have a lot of money to spend and being able to replace a few parts vs an entire battery wouldnt be worth it to that apartment resident. The fact is there will be a dramatic shift of who can afford to own a vehicle and its generally the poor that suffers these changes. Certainly though the less fortunate need a way to get around and public transportation is horrible at best. Who wants to sit and wait in the weather? I always hated it growing up because it could be cold and rainy and your winter jacket gets soaked making it a health hazard for you. Then dealing with creepy people on the bus? No thanks. The bigger concern is that society isnt ready for electric vehicles. ",

            "answer_text": "I think there are two answers to this question. The urban answer and everywhere else. And for both the answer probably is a modified no. But for different reasons. In the urban environment. The electric car certainly will eventually have advantages such that once price becomes reasonable it should predominate. To the extent people need a car to go to work or buy groceries they will do the job just fine. However in this environment it will eventually be recognized that cars themselves are the problem. Our priorities in supporting a car culture will collapse ultimately and in the urban environment population densities are high enough to render other non car modes effective. Like public transport and bicycles. The use of vehicles weighing a ton more than the humans needing transport will eventually be replaced where efficient. Which in the urban environment will be relatively easy. So all car use should decrease there. Probably dramatically. Including electric. In the non urban environment the electric car just won\u2019t be able to replicate the functionality of an ICE. Cargo capacity and weight capacity and distance travel are not likely to be competitive for electric. Take towing for example. You can tow a trailer with a Tesla, if you want to stop every 80 miles or so. Go on any interstate running in between cities and ask anyone at the rest area whether they would be willing to make that trip. You may want to drive an electric but if you are worried about getting to the doctor from 50 miles away on a storm tossed wintry highway, you won\u2019t want to worry about your charge making it. Or having to stop for more than a minute or two to fill up. So for long as we don\u2019t have any options for this scenario other than cars and trucks, a lot of them will be powered by some sort of fuel in the tank. Not a charge in the battery. I think there are a lot of things that should be powered by batteries. Not gas fumes spewing machines. But I also think that electric cars are not a solution to the problem that there simply shouldnt be so many cars at all. ",

At the low end, they are still an expensive option.

A Tesla is too expensive and the current crop of smaller electrics don\u2019t have the range if she gets called out to an incident. However, there are a whole raft of new smaller electrics coming out early next year, she has her eye on a couple of the new VWs. We have a Volvo V70, a diesel estate car, as our family car, but my new contract means I no longer cycle to the station and get the train into London, so I was looking for a small quick second car when the weather turns and my wife no longer fancies cycling to work 6 miles each way and it gets a bit cold/wet for the kids to cycle across the village to school.

            "answer_text": "Good question. Tony Seba thinks by about 2026. Look him up on YouTube he gives quite an interesting lecture about the current changeover to EVs and sustainable energy from an economics point of view. He\u2019s not an eco warrior but a futurologist who gets stuff fairly right. Find his latest lecture. He tends to up date his talk as time goes on. If he makes a guess about when something is going to happen, if anything it happens faster than he thinks. My guess for what its worth is 7\u201310 years time, most new cars will be EVs. As the price drops on batteries (about 15% pa) it won't be long before EVs are the same price as ICE cars, and their much lower running costs (fuel and maintenance and lack of repairs) will make them the cheaper option. In fact some are already a cheaper option if you consider total cost of ownership over say 6\u20137 years. As an example: I lease a 2016 LEAF at \u00a3250 month + fuel at about \u00a330 and servicing at \u00a310. So in total about \u00a3290 a month. No road fund tax and petrol/gas. Insurance about the same for both. To lease a comparable ICE car would cost me about \u00a3500 a month inc. fuel etc. Now I did well as it was old stock and new ones were about to arrive, but a new one is about \u00a3400 a month to lease.

BUT governments are going to loose out hugely on fuel taxes so the cost of electricity will likely be pushed up to compensate. Roads will get busier as driving electric much more pleasant. Think how far you would go on a horse to see a friend compared with how far you would go in a super quiet car. The main points of convergence are growth of fast charging points with standard min 200 miles of range. The only real barrier is \u2018range anxiety\u2019, thats gonna be gone within 18 months. Once you have had an EV for 1 month plus there is no going back. It\u2019s a one way street. Additional contributors to tipping point: Influencers such as James May on board. Battery costs coming down. VW thundering in this direction. Only Masarati saying no to EVs out of all manufacturers. Ability to routinely share cars better with less \u2018key\u2019 requirements. I think we may see Hydrogen/Battery hybrids develop which will be soooo sweet. ",
