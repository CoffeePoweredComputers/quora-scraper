            "answer_text": "I am not a teacher or professor by training. I worked in IT in education for 11 years. A funny man about 6\u20138 years ago made a statement that said roughly:\u201d technology will replace all humans in training humans in the future, it is a matter of time and technology.\u201d The man who said this was Steve Wozniak. He explained that AI with enough power will become the best teacher because it will be able to read your individual body language, blood pressure, attention span, etc etc. So it will be able to adapt to your learning style as well as know when to both push you and slow down depending on your response and through body metrics. So instead of a classroom of 10\u201330 kids or more, it will always be 1 on 1 and moving at exactly the pace to maximize your education. BUT he also said even at the rate of technological innovation this is a decade or 10 away. The point he was making is that with AI and enough data it will be the pinnacle of education without delving into science fiction where computers could just write information into your brain like a memory device.
