            "answer_text": "Not really, I would say that there are much more important things especially in rendering, like color quality (best indicator is how many sRGB and Adobe RGB it covers). You can get pretty cheap monitors with 99% sRGB coverage. I would also recommend an ultrawide monitor, as you'll get more space to work with. I personally use a 99%+ sRGB LG 21:9 (2560x1080) monitor with 5ms and 60hz. I even game on this monitor and while it's not as ideal as a 144hz 1ms monitor, it's manageable. Of course, if you want to play games, it would be better to get a monitor with a better response time. ",
