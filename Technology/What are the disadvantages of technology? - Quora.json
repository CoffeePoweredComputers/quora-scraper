            "answer_text": "My two cents on this, With the advent of technology, our quality of life has significantly improved at the cost of making people lazy. However, I do not see that as a major disadvantage because laziness and similar issues can be worked with firm resolve. To support my statement, one area, technology fails miserably is at replicating human ethics (in context of AI and auto driving etc). Even we find, Ethical Thought Experiments challenging to answer, but for a machine to arrive at in the spur of moment is extremely difficult. To give you an idea on what such thought experiments are, here is quick one. It\u2019s commonly referred as Trolley Problem. The general form of the problem is this: You see a runaway trolley moving toward five tied-up (or otherwise incapacitated) people lying on the tracks. You are standing next to a lever that controls a switch. If you pull the lever, the trolley will be redirected onto a side track and the five people on the main track will be saved. However, there is a single person lying on the side track. You have two options: Do nothing and allow the trolley to kill the five people on the main track.Pull the lever, diverting the trolley onto the side track where it will kill one person.Which is the most ethical option? With a bit of a thought you might vote to save the five and kill one. But hold on, this single choice is easy to code onto a machine. There are in fact , endless variations to this, Variation 1: Say that, the one man is a young kid with a very bright future. The other five are very old, give or take 4\u20135 years to live. Now did you change your mind? Well, lets make it a little more complex. Variation 2: Similar situation, but now you are on a foot-over bridge and you see five tied up people below you and a trolley fast approaching them. The only way to save them is by pushing down a very fat person standing next to you onto the track and stop the trolley from hitting other five, killing the fat man. Now would you push the man to death saving others? What if he is your dear friend would you still do the same? The other thought experiment is Plank of Carneades, here you and a stranger are in a shipwrecked, you both see a wooden plank which can only hold one, but the stranger reached there first, you being hefty can overpower him off the plank, would you? and save yourself? Failure in such situations leads to grave consequences, especially now where everyone is keen on AI. (I know I get carried away and digress, Thanks for reading.) ",
