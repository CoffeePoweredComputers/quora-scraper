            "answer_text": "Okay hang onto your hats cause this one\u2019s a doozy. Hey All, Let\u2019s get this tsraight, I am going to be answering from the point of view of the MCU and I know people are going to hate me for it, however it is the version of Marvel that is now grossing the most money and will be easier for the non-comic readers to understand. Essentially. as told in the 2018 Black Panther movie, which just came out three days ago in the US, Vibranium first fell to Earth (by way of Meteor) back before mankind existed on the planet. It\u2019s radioactive (deus-ex-machina magic) properties influenced the vegetation and wildlife around the crash site, producing a very lush landscape full of vibrant flora and fauna. Eventually mankind came about, and the five tribes that settled down onto the site of the meteor determined that it was best to protect the secret of the world\u2019s strongest metal. Now I am going to get a bit less Marvel historian (nerdy) here. Essentially, the people of Wakanda were given a leg up in the race when they settled upon the Earth\u2019s largest depository of the strongest metal in existence. There\u2019s probably some proper theory name but I\u2019m calling it the Prometheus theory named after the Greek mythological titan who kick started the human race in terms of technology by stealing fire from Olympus and giving its secrets to humanity, allowing us the ability to create metals and fires and mine the elements of the Earth to get to where we are today. Pkay enough greek geeking, back to Wakanda. Essentially Vibranium is the biggest flame of the fire and Wakanda had it all to themselves. Thus they were able to advance at a much quicker rate. Think gemmers in Clash Of Clans vs. non gemmers (is that too old of a reference now?) Anyway, we do a fast forward from the tribes who have the world\u2019s strongest metal in large quantities in the ground and we advance to the modern day, where some people outside of Wakanda wear rare and expensive suits made of Kevlar, which are susceptible to knives, while every fiber of clothing in Wakanda is able to withstand tank fire due to the kinetic absorbent properties of Vibranium which is weaved into it. They use it to make their vehicles, their armor, their trains, their mines. How does that even work? How does one mine the strongest element on Earth? Oh well IDK. Anyway that\u2019s why. OH AND DON\u2019T EVEN GET ME STARTED ON THE HEART SHAPED HERB. ",

It\u2019s woven into clothes, fashioned into tech, whatever you need, put vibranium in it, and it\u2019ll be advanced. And since Wakanda has a shitload of vibranium, they can put it everywhere. That\u2019s why they\u2019re so advanced. ",
