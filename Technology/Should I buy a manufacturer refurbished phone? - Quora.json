            "answer_text": "Yes and no. There are certain circumstances that justify buying a refurbished phone for example if you\u2019re on a tight budget or you want to save some money then it\u2019s okay to buy. From my personal experience, there\u2019s nothing wrong in buying refurbished products as long as you buy them from a reputable seller with long manufacturer warranty (not seller) cover. Some manufacturers like Apple, HP, Dell, Epson, and the like sell refurbished goods on their own with complete warranty cover and service. So, you can take advantage of it. This way you can get access to latest products without paying their actual cost. Note: There\u2019s a bit of risk associated with refurbished products but if you know how and from whom to buy refurbished ones then there should not be any problem. If you\u2019re going to buy a refurbished phone then I strongly recommend you to read this guide \u201c8 Things You Must Check Before Buying Refurbished Electronics.\u201d Here I\u2019m listing advantages and disadvantages of buying a refurbished product. First let me clear there\u2019s nothing like brand new product, however, as mentioned earlier, you can also buy refurbished. Advantages of Buying Refurbished Electronics You get huge discount on such products sometimes more than 50 percent.Most of the refurbished goods come with warranty as new ones. You get the same tech support as you would get with a new product.Such products also come with easy return policy; which lets you return the product in case you don\u2019t like it.They are like new ones just someone (manufacturer) has checked its functionality and fixed some issues.You can get access to latest products without spending actual product cost.Disadvantages of Buying Refurbished Electronics Everything pertaining to reconditioned products is not good. Here are some disadvantages of owning a re-manufactured product: Though you get warranty but its period is very limited say 15 to 90 days. Some prominent companies give complete warranty as you buy new product such products are good to buy.You would not be able to understand what was fixed or reconditioned in the item.You may find some dents on the products.If product is coming with seller warranty then you cannot visit brand store for repair.",

            "answer_text": "Refurbished phones are a buzz these days. In simple words, a refurbished phone is a used phone that has been returned by the original buyer due to some defects or because the buyer changed their mind. After it\u2019s returned the manufacturer rectifies the defects and the phone is then made available for resale under the refurbished category. In my personal opinion, it is absolutely fine to buy a refurbished phone as long as you buy it from a trusted seller within their warranty. A refurbished phone will allow you to enjoy all the latest technologies at a much lower price.
