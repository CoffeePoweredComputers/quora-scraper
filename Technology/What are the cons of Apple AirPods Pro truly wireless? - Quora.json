            "answer_text": "Hey Benudhar thanks for the A2A . Airpods pro are the state of the art technology devices brought out by apple . With there seamless design and comfort fit it is also the first airpod to sport the active noise cancellation and the first earphone to provide audio transparency. Let me tell you some of the pros. Pros : Audio transparency modeI if you are planning to buy the AirPods to help you in making calls, they will also help improve call quality and transparency mode. As a user, you can now hear what\u2019s happening around you while the AirPods are on your ears.This happens because there is an audio on the external microphone. It combines that with what you are listening to.Active noise cancellingNothing is better than having ear buds that block external noise that might interrupt what you are trying to listen to. The Air pods pro have active noise cancelling feature. This is possible through a combination of a microphone, hardware and software that monitor external sounds and blocks them. There is a secondary internal microphone that also cancels internal sounds by listening inside your ear. Wind-proofed micThe reason why this AirPods Pro cancel external noise is that they have a microphone located outside. The mesh microphone is expanded, and this improves its quality. You can now use it when going out without with ease. Harsh weather shouldn\u2019t be an issue any more as they are wind-proofed whether it\u2019s going to be a sunny, windy or a rainy day. Apple H1 ChipThe Airpods have been baked with Apple H1 Chip. This system can handle everything. It also has ten audio cores to ensure noise cancellation and low latency. Through the H1 Chip, you can set it up with a Mac, iPad and iPhone. Force sensorThe original AirPods had a tapping gesture, and they were rather strange. Fortunately, current AirPods have a force sensor that tends to replace the tapping gesture. You don\u2019t need a lot of pressure to activate it. Squeeze them once to play and or pause music. Long holding it changes the mode to transparency from noise cancelling. You can as well squeeze them if you would like to move to the next song. If you press it three times, it will go back. Sweat-resistantYou can actually wear them in a gym work out or even running out side in rainy/humid conditions . This is because it has ip x4 which makes it resistant to accidental water spills , sweat . So you can use them as you like .Now The question arises ARE THE NEW AIRPODS PRO ACTUALLY WORTH 22,400RS ? some of the Cons: Incompatibility. the fast pairing benefits only work for those with Apple devices. If you have other devices, it will pair, but like the way, it does with different Bluetooth ear buds.From a technical point of view, airpids pro were built to run mainly many of the built-in apps run partially on the iPhone. That is, code is executing on the iPhone (utilizing pretty much any core iOS APIs that it wants), which then updates the airpod user interface over wireless. You have many different processors and different hardware to worry about. Additionally, this would have the unintended side-effect of allowing people to natively run iOS apps on their Android phones, potentially undercutting the iPhone marke. This is also the reason you must have seen that many functions that the airpods pro can be used to perform on iphone or any apple device cannot he done on the android .like changing songs ,increasing decreasing volume .Fitting. Now just like it predecessor the airpods pro come with an issue of fitting as well . The switch to silicone ear tips led Apple to add an extra step to its initial setup process, an Ear Tip Fit Test designed to ensure you\u2019re getting the best possible seal. It plays a short chunk of music, and uses the microphones inside and outside of each earbud to check for sound leakage. If too much of that is heard, it\u2019ll suggest switching from the pre-installed medium tips to the small or large that Apple . It\u2019s worth noting that Apple\u2019s test only takes into account sound leakage for active noise cancellation (ANC) purposes, not the comfort in each ear. (I have, I\u2019ll be the first to admit, problematic ears when it comes to in-ear buds. Often they just won\u2019t fit me properly, or if they do they feel uncomfortable after a while. )Moreover if you lose the silicon tips then\u2026. It's just a big loss.Active noise cancellation. Now how that's an issue you may ask . If you don\u2019t like the sound profile, you\u2019ve got a problem. There\u2019s no EQ for adjusting sound quality for music, nor any sort of adjustment over how the active noise cancellation works. Rival ANC earbuds and headphones allow you to adjust the levels of cancellation versus ambient sound Like the Beats solo pro but with different algorithms o use the external microphones to create an inverse waveform to balance the ambient noise. As you\u2019d expect, active noise cancellation takes a toll on battery life. Leave it turned off and each earbud is rated for up to five hours of music; turn it on, and that dips to 4.5 hours. With the charging case at over 24 hours in all. Airpod pros batteries aren\u2019t designed to be replaced and, over time, how long they\u2019ll last on a charge will dwindle.Price. At 22,400 these are most expensive airpod. You might expect more from them at such a great price.

Even my 2,970rs noise shots groove provide better and than the airpods m pro .

This simply means that the airpods pro are not able to perform many activities which we expect them to . Like increase decrease volume accept or make a call and summon siri at the same time .this Is becauseWhen you set up your airpods pro you choose what function will twisting them perform. Now when select active noise cancellation on one and audio transparency on the other there is no way you can use them to change music either forward or backward .As there is a limited function that these can perform they do not keep us completely hands free . Like of we select it for changing music or changing the volume you have to use your iphone to manually select toggle between Active noise cancellation and audio transparency.Small size. With there convenient fit but a ridiculously smal size it actually becomes a toll . If you keep it some where and forget it . If it goes some where .
