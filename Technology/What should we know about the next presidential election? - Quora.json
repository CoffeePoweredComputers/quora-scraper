            "answer_text": "You should know that you may not be able to vote; your right and civic duty has been under attack for decades and it has culminated in an election year in which many states have put obstacles in place intended to discourage you from exercising your franchise. This is especially true if you are African-American or Hispanic or attending college out-of-state. If you live in an area with a high percentage of the aforementioned categories, you may be inconvenienced with long lines, or you may get to the head of the line only to be told your name has been removed from the list because it's similar to someone who spent time in prison or just because some minor functionary in an office you've never heard of didn't think you would turn out because you didn't vote in the last election. Oh, of course they'll be terribly sorry and allow you to fill out a provisional ballot: a polite way of saying \u201cGet lost. We're going to shred it as soon as you walk out the door.\u201d You should know that most of these can be avoided if you're willing to be persistent. You can register right now if you're willing to spend a couple of minutes online. Of course, that gives the state months to take your name back off the rolls; that's one of their best tricks. You should check again within a week of the deadline for registering. You should know to keep your voter registration in a safe place -- preferably with your photo ID. A driver's license is best; a college ID is probably worthless. You should know that not every election day is bright and sunny. If you have to stand in a long line in the rain or during a pandemic, you will probably give up and go home. That's why they close down polling places or shorten their hours. You should know you can avoid this by voting early or by mail. Finally, you should know that even though these precautions are annoying and may even be unnecessary, you should do them anyway, for the single reason that this election year is crucial for the health, well-being and survival of America. We've seen all too vividly what happens when we blow off our duty to elect competent leaders. ",
