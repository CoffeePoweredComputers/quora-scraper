            "answer_text": "Well I am confused from which perspective the question is being asked but still I will try my best to answer this. So being an Analog Engineer in the largest digital company in the world I got the best flavour of both the world. It's true that as technology node is shrinking, it's getting more and more difficult for analog designers to make pure analog blocks so now all the analog IPs are made as mixed signal IPs which is called digitally assisted analog. But that doesn't mean that analog is loosing out but analog designers have to have strong digital base as well. He/she should be able to code RTL along with making circuits. Now coming to the question, is the significance of analog blocks coming down? The answer is NO. Infact as high speed digital is coming up, the supporting analog infrastructure needs to be very accurately designed.. for example high speed analog circuits like data converters, clock generators are gaining more importance. Each and every analog block design has become more challenging and critical... To conclude, the job of analog designers have become difficult so industry needs skilled analog designers who have good understanding of both analog and digital in both IP as well as system level.. and as VLSI industry will continue to grow, the requirements of analog designer will be growing.. so there is no question of loosing out to digital as to support good digital infrastructure, we need good analog support and vice versa. Hope this answer your question ",
