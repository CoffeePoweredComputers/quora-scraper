            "answer_text": "You are saying that intelligence is \" the ability to face problems in an unprogrammed  (creative) manner\". That excludes every computer program from being intelligent.  However, I don't think that definition makes sense. Imagine that a computer would come up with a possibility to get a solar cells to an efficiency of > 80%. The A.I. did come up with this by analyzing thousands of physics papers, deducting facts and asking for experiments being done. Humans programmed it, but the A.I. did a whole lot after it. That would be a nobel price for sure in physics if a human did this. I guess everybody would say that the work that was done to get a physics nobel price was \"intelligent\". Nevertheless, your definition says it is not intelligent. So your definition is flawed. What can A.I.s do today? Learn how to play computer games:   See A.I. in Computer Games for more. Play Jeopardy better than any human:   Fly quadcopters better than any human ever could   See Awesome Robots for more Other amazing A.I.s are: Improving search (I guess Google and Quora would be examples; however, I don't have a source for that)Recommendations (Amazon)Find credit card fraud automatically, fast and hopefully reliable. What will A.I.s be able to do in near future (I guess not more than 20 years):  Drive cars better than any human in traffic (See Google Car)Find possible illnesses and treatments for a patient better than any human (Watson)",
