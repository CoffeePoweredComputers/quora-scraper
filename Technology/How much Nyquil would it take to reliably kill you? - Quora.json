            "answer_text": "The active ingredient in Nyquil is diphenhydramine and you simply cannot drink enough NyQuil to get enough diphenhydramine to kill you. NyQuil also contains alcohol and you will get so stupid drunk long before the diphenhydramine poisons you that you won't be able to drink any more NyQuil that and you Will puke your guts up! It would take about a half a gallon. I know people that have tried to get high on NyQuil. They ended up getting so sick after drinking a bottle of it that they thought that they were going to die. Well that's the way NyQuil has designed the stuff if you abused it you get sick you puked your guts up and you won't be stupid enough to try it again. ",

            "answer_text": "NyQuil is a terrible choice for suicide, see my answer on: Can you die from taking too much Tylenol?. Also, the overdose of the antihistamine means that you'll be jittery and freaking out more than the alcohol will make you lethargic and dreamy. Ugh. Again, I think that if suicide seems the only available solution, I suggest processing for additional solutions. What do you do when you have to make a decision that will end badly no matter what you pick? ^This is based on my personal experience with feeling this ideation, and solving for otherwise. Have you ever felt that you are dying, Nothing left for you, and How did you recovered from it? Perhaps these expansions will help. ",
