            "answer_text": "Yes, but not for the reasons you think. A DVD is made up of a plastic polymer with a reflective layer on the tp of it. Repeated usage will scratch the plastic, making the disk unusable after many scratches or a deep scratch (the laser will not be able to go in s straight line to the reflective surface and would get scattering as well). The DVD player will not get damaged, but because it has 2 moving parts (the electric motor rotating the disk itself and the small electric motor moving the laser head) they can wear out. Plus, if you insert the disk several times, you get dust in it as well. However, if you put a disk in the player and leave it there and play it every day, only the DVD player\u2019s moving parts will wear out in time and the reflective surface on the DVD will wear due to repeated exposure to heat and light, but that would take years anyway, so I would not worry about it. Worry more about the scratching od the disk as that is the first thing that will happen out of all the above. ",

            "answer_text": "Assuming the drive in the game system is fully working properly, it should not. The DVD is read by laser so it never physically contacts the disc itself. However if you open and close the tray a lot, and if the disc ever gets warped and crashes physically into the tray. They can warp over long period of time. Anyhow, it does not depend on as much of the number of uses. Most damage to media involves the care and handling of the disc outside the drive. Dropping it onto a hard surface, floor, will cause problems. Scraping it while removing and replacing to the jewel case, will ruin it.Inger prints on any optical media, will cause the laser to crash into the surface, damaging both media and laser lens. Mostly not putting it back into the jewel case. ",
