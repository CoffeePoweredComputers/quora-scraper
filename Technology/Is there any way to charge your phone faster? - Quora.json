            "answer_text": "Here is what you need to consider when charging your phone: Your phone has a battery that can store a certain amount of charge. This is represented by mAH (milli ampere hour). Let\u2019s say you have a phone with a 3000 mAH battery.Your phone supports a certain amount of incoming charge. This is represented by Amperes. Most phones support between 1 to 3 Amperes. Let\u2019s say your phone supports 1.5 Amperes (this is the most common in phones made in the last few years, unless you have a Quick Charge 3.0 compliant phone or a phone that supports the OPPO VOOC standard or the OnePlus Dash standard).Most manufacturers provide original chargers that support the optimal charging current. It\u2019s best to use your original charger to get the maximum charging speed your phone can support without damaging the battery.If your phone supports any of the fast charging standards I mentioned, get a charger (wall plug + cable) built to those standards, and that will work just as well.If your phone does not support fast charging, you have one of two problems. Either you don\u2019t have your original charger or your phone has always charged slowly. So let\u2019s look at both cases. Replacing Original Charger (non-fast-charging) If you don\u2019t have your original charger, get a good brand wall plug with a USB adapter. This usually supports between 1 to 3 Amperes of current. The good brands detect the phone\u2019s capacity and send out the right amperage. (For example, this one)Get a USB 3.0 standard cable. This supports 1.5 Amperes of current, or higher, for fast charge phones. (For example, this one)Both together will get your phone an optimal 1.5 Amperes of current. With your 3000 mAH battery, this means your phone can be charged from 0 to 100% in 2 hours. (3000 mAH = 3 Ampere hour, so 1.5 Ampere charge will fill it up in 2 hours)Phone Always Charges Slow Check out your phone\u2019s listing on a site like www.gsmarena.com. Check out the battery capacity and your connectivity standard. See if your phone has at least a micro-usb 2.0 standard. In that case, the charger replacement solution should work, unless there\u2019s a circuitry problem. In which case, you need expensive repairs or (ideally) a new phone. If you have an older phone where you can\u2019t locate the charging standard or a proprietary connector (not micro-USB), it\u2019s probably time for a phone upgrade. If you have an iPhone, then you\u2019re out of luck. It either means your phone is slow or there\u2019s a charging problem. If you\u2019re within warranty, you might get lucky and get it repaired. If not, get a new phone. Hope this was helpful! ",

            "answer_text": "Here are some ways to charge your phone faster: Turn on airplane mode. Receiving SMS, WeChat or application reminders will consume power. In airplane mode, the phone will stop receiving signals, which is equivalent to being in a dormant state, so it is easier to fill. The flight mode can be found in [Settings]. In the case of tight time, if you want the phone's power to be fully charged, be sure to turn this button on! Of course, it will be faster to shut down and charge! Turn off Bluetooth and GPS. Bluetooth and GPS also consume batteries. When you don't need them, it's best to keep them turned off and turn off when charging. Do not use the USB interface. The current output of the USB interface on computers and cars is very small, usually only 0.5A. Nowadays, the standard charging current of many mobile phones is 1A or even higher, and the current is unstable, so charging is much slower. When you are in a hurry, give up the USB interface. Plug in the charging line of the mobile phone with the charging head of the mobile phone, and charge the mobile phone together to save the charging time to the utmost, and not to hurt the mobile phone. Charge with the original charger. The charger is not only safe and reliable, but also has higher charging efficiency. Non-original chargers are likely to have low charging efficiency due to different specifications, and there are also safety hazards. Clean the charging port. Many times, the phone does not charge or the charging speed is slow, not because the battery is broken, but because the charging port is blocked after being dusted. At this time, you only need to take a toothpick or a paper clip, wrap the tip with toilet paper or cotton, and then put it into the charging port to clean up the dirty things. ",
