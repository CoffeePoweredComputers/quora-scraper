            "answer_text": "As any HAM licensed operator will atest, cell phones, radio transmitters and internet routers all radiate electromagnetically. The FCC actually requires HAM operators to assess the exposure of humans to the radiating attena(s). This radiation is less damaging to DNA as it is non-ionising and is below the frequencies for x-rays, cosmic-rays, gamma radiation and the like. Cell and microphone emissions, however, do disrupt animal tissue. Flesh is most sensitive at 50 Mhz. You\u2019ll note a cell phone of the 5G evolution is transmitting at 60 GHz, routers emit at 2.4GHz or 5 GHz. Every time your phone rings near your skull you are disrupting cells inside. That much can be demonstrated in the lab which is why you shouldn\u2019t keep your cell in proximity to your skull, jean pockets (males) or in your brassier. It is not yet empirically established the radiation will lower IQ. However, prolonged use in close proximity could lead to brain cancer, testicular cancer or breast cancer. Hip bone cancer has also occurred. Of course, folks with high IQ to begin with will take protective measures and a correlation between IQ and cell phone use should therefore be harder to establish.

            "answer_text": "It might, it depends too much on what you\u2019re doing. If you\u2019re watching educational documentaries online and learning about science and biology or psychology, it may increase your IQ. If you watch click bait style videos that focuses on the person trying to annoy people to get YouTube views, your IQ will be lowered (such as Logan Paul). Some people rely on their smartphones for email, documents, and many other office tasks.. smartphones are literally mini portable computers.. with some smartphones being more powerful than a smartphone. It all depends what you\u2019re doing on the phone.. if you\u2019re senselessly spending hours browsing Twitter or Instagram, maybe your IQ is lowering, or maybe not. Again it all depends. ",
