            "answer_text": "Nikola Tesla tried, but big capitalists always made it impossible for him to use his gifts regarding technology for the good of all living creatures on planet earth. Elon Musk is a totally evil Nikola Tesla, and really not very intelligent. Musk's \"genuis\" is in self promotion and making billions of dollars, under the guise that his technology is useful for all living on earth. To Musk, those whom benefit from his technology are very wealthy, and do not believe in God, but believe in \"science\". And so on. So pray the Holy Rosary daily and proceed from there. ",
