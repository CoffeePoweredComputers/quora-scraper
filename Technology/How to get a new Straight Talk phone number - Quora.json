            "answer_text": "It Depends. Is your cell a GSM (International & US access) or CDMA (US only networks) type? If it\u2019s a GSM, then you have options. If CDMA, you\u2019re screwed for the most part. BUT, some phones on the Verizon network (CDMA), can get a SIM card, from a local MAIN store (IF they have them) or order On-line. You may just buy a New GSM - SIM card (AT&T, T-Mobile, STalk, others) with a new number on it. Wally-world offers SIM Card Kits. Then, you select your Plan. Also, How old is your phone, is it a Smartphone? Sometimes it\u2019s Cheaper to just Buy a New one, at Wally-World or AMZ. ",
