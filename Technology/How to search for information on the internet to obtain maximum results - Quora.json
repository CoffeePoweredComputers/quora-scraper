            "answer_text": "One of the big challenges with search on the internet is finding what you need among the thousands if not millions of results. Often, if you're clever enough with the keywords, or if you're searching for something not particularly specific, what you need will be at the top of page 1. If you're doing things more challenging, however, then following the other answers here is a good start. Additionally, you might want to consider trying Surf Canyon. We develop a browser extension that automatically digs into Google's search results for you to find relevant results that might otherwise have remained buried.

We offer another option that has demonstrated some amazing results: Evaluating Surf Canyon\u2019s Technology (Part 2) - Surf Canyon. ",
