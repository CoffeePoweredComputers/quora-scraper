            "answer_text": "I\u2019m currently using Redmi Note 4 since April 2107. To be frank, it is such an amazing phone in this price range when compared to other brand phones like Samsung/Nokia/Apple/Motorola etc. Redmi Note 4 comes with various new features like 4K camera, various sensors, 5\u20325 display, 4100mAh battery, 4/64GB ram and storage etc. Defenitely these are the best qualities of Redmi Note 4. Although, the most satisfying phones has some drawbacks. Indeed Redmi Note 4 has its own drawbacks. Here I explain all of the draw backs I felt personally. But all of the drawbacks I listed here is not at all a big problem. They are only some of the minor mistakes of Redmi. None of the bad features affect the performance of this phone in any manner. Undoubtely the Redmi Note 4 is really awesome and I enjoy this phone alot. I\u2019m highly satisfied and plan to update to MIUI 9.0 stable Rom. Ok lets go through the drawbacks; 1. Unable to Block IP adress This is a most hateful feature of Redmi phones. Phone shows the IP adress of wifi stealers, but there is no option to block the IP adress from stealing wifi.  2. Comparatively less details in Photos! Eventhough the back camera is 13 MP, it does not giving much details in photos when compare with other chinese phone like Huwei. Only day times are better for taking photos otherwise the photo or video would be low quality. But in the case of Huwei honor, it gives much more details in photos, because it uses two primary camera (one for photo and the small pixel one for depth measure). This feature is really good while in the case of zooming or dual focusing. This feature can be included in Redmi Note 4 also, it could make Redmi the most awesome phone in this price range. Captured with Redmi Note 4 ( at 1:30 pm)  Zooming shows low details  3. Headset volume issue All Redmi Note 4 users feel this trouble with internal volume control. When using earphones or head set, the volume can only decreased to level 1. This is most hateful because the level 1 is annoying and high audiable. Taking phone calls with headset in Redmi Note 4 is literally damage to ears! I think the developers must include more lower volume levels. 4. Force closing apps! This annoying feature is not often. But this is still a worst feature of Redmi Note 4. Some apps stucks all of a sudden and force closing with permission. This would cause loss of data in the app. I think the update to MIUI 9.0 stable ROM could solve this issue But force closing is not often and only for some 3rd party apps ,so dont worry! 5. New themes taking control of apps! This feature is worst when it comes to the case of Whatsapp. Most of the themes from mi official theme store are able to take full control of the apps in the phone. Whatsapp officially use white background colour, and green or blue ticks in chats, but some of the themes from mi store changing it to other colours. This is annoying because it makes the user confused while chatting. 6. Touch screen issue while charging! This problem is due to the inbuilt mistake of Redmi Note 4. Touch screen becomes hard to recognize user input while charging. This is a somewhat helpfull in battery durability, because typing problems would make the user to leave phone while charging. Using phone while charging can reduce battery durability as officials said. But it is still an annoying feature because urgent typing while charging most often misspell words.

            "answer_text": "The only drawback of the Redmi Note 4 is that it runs MIUI . The phone has kinda grainy camera once the lighting goes a little dusky.And the screen is lightly vulnerable to key/pocket scratches. I have faced issues like Moisture deposition in headphone jack if the phone is used in humid areas like steam room, bathroom etcYou might face issues with network if you cover the antenna lines.Honestly the phone is super insane.I have been using it as a power user for about a year now and it has given me uncompromised performance for the price.
