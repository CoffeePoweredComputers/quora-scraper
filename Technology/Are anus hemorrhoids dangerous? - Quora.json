            "answer_text": "No they are not dangerous if you take proper care of your diet and follow proper medication. Hemorroids could be painful and may also bleed. They can make you feel uncomfortable and itchy. From my experience I can suggest you something ayurvedic which can help you to cure it permanently.  These herbs helped my father to get cured. I found about this on quora and we tried reaching them on 8708768154 and they told us how to take diet and medicine. It proved like a panacea for him and within 3 months he got cured completely. You can try reaching them and request them if they could help you. ",
