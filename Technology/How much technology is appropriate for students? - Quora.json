            "answer_text": "We teach middle school. All of our students use Google Classroom, which means no one forgets about an assignment, no one ever loses an assignment, and the teacher can fan through a batch of work very cleanly. So all that\u2019s good. Yet, there\u2019s research suggesting that all the screen time is changing our kids, and it\u2019s easy to find evidence that the changes are in many ways negative. Read Richard Louv\u2019s Last Child in the Woods for a moving description of what we\u2019re losing. That said, my instinct is that the horse is utterly out of the barn - this stuff\u2019s endemic, and that\u2019s the way it is. Given that, I think we are actually creating a new kind of person and we only dimly see the outlines of the new world we\u2019re hurtling into. What to do, then? As a science teacher, naturally I harness these kid-skills and make my job easier and more effective. So on a day-to-day hands-on basis, the tech permeates and we roll with it. The deeper issue is limning their world to them - that is, \u201cHey, you have all this tech. It facilitates X, Y and Z. But now, let\u2019s discuss the natural world. Let\u2019s discuss how you are a techno-fish and have difficulty seeing yourself separate from all the tech. \u2018Fish, meet Water. Water, this is Fish.\u2019 So how does tech separate you from your human-ness, and above all, how can you maintain your humanity with all the screentime?\u201d Get them thinking meta-cognitively, thinking about their thinking. Get them to see two world-possibilities: one, that \u201cI am in all this tech; it works - what do I do to remain kind, thoughtful, aware, and capable of original thought?\u201d And two, for some kids \u201cOh - everyone sure is in all this tech. What support is there for me as an outlier, consciously ordering my life to less tech than my peers, and possibly inhabiting the creative edge as a consequence?\u201d \u201cFish, meet Water.\u201d Tech\u2019s a done deal. So let\u2019s see where we are, where we\u2019re going, and how to consciously be aware of our surroundings, even though virtual. Metacognition\u2019s the key. ",

            "answer_text": "What a great question! The facts are that there is no way to say too much technology is \u201cbad\u201d. The challenge being sure if you use technology, that everyone has access to said tools. There are many advantages to using computers and such. For instance, a teacher using Google.doc chrome can have students working on a written assignment and watch all students working in real time on the assignment, keep students on task and offer corrections or encouragement. But if your classroom does not have Wi-Fi or there are only a few computers to share amongst 25-30 kids\u2026. well no time to get work done. And considering in day-to-day life, most people will be working on computers to one degree or another, it behooves us to educate our kids o technology ",
