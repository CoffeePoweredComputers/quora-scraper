A: Wait for the iPhone 13 The iPhone 6S isTremendously powerfulStill perfectly usable with all current appsStill getting iOS support from AppleIts so powerful that it might even last until iOS 15 (i.e. it might run iOS 15)I would continue to use it until it is announced that it no longer qualifies for the newest version of iOS, then I would get the iPhone 13 or iPhone 14 at that timeApple iPhone destroys Android in new smartphone depreciation report",

            "answer_text": "You can always wait. The question you have to ask yourself is : are you happy with your iPhone 6s right now ? Does it feel fast enough for the things you do ? Is the battery still good enough ? Are you really missing functionality ? 5 years on a phone is a long time, but your iPhone is still supported so if you can keep it, keep it. The iPhone 12 will be a great update from an iPhone 6s but at the end of the day, your phone is a tool and the only thing that matters is that this tool serves its purpose. It\u2019s reasonable to upgrade and it\u2019s reasonable to keep your current phone. ",
