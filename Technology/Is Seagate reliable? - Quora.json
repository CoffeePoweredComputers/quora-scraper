            "answer_text": "I run 4 4TB drives a couple 350 gb drives and one or two 500 gb drives. I have had no problem with them. But, I also have Western Digital drives and Toshiba drives that have performed equally well. Many of my drives have no case, they are used in a BRICK, or a drive port, you just plug them in, so these drives are getting unusually hard treatment and still stand the test. Hope that was helpful.
