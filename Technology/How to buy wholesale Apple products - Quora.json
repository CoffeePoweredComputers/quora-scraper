            "answer_text": "If you\u2019re looking for wholesale prices for your personal use, you\u2019ll be better off just going to the Apple Website and getting an education pricing (all you have to do is say you work in education or are a student; there is no verification). Education pricing for Apple products tends to be cheaper than actual wholesale prices. Apple resellers who match Apple\u2019s wholesale prices lose money on every sale. If you\u2019re wanting to buy Apple products at wholesale prices and resell them, you likely need to become an Apple reseller. It\u2019s very difficult to do and you have to accept that you will likely make no money on Apple products. Rather you will make your money (f you\u2019re successful) selling other high margin products and services along with Apple products. People will come to you for Apple products and then buy other things. The Apple products are loss-leaders. Apple sells to resellers at about an 8% discount on average. Once you take overhead and costs into account (credit card fees alone will wipe out your margin) you\u2019ll end up losing money. The only Apple product a reseller can actually make money on is the iPhone. That\u2019s not because they get a big discount from Apple but because carriers attach a bonus for every iPhone sold that ends up making money if you sell enough and meet your goals. Most resellers went out of business around 2010 and the ones that remain stay in business because they have a reputation and services that can\u2019t be matched elsewhere. ",

            "answer_text": "When you're buying 50 Macbooks, each costing $1300, the total investment may jolt you a little bit. Then there are maintenance costs, setup hassles and software costs to add to the bill. To make it easier for businesses to buy Apple devices with added benefits, Apple has appointed Authorised Resellers that help you more than just the purchases. They offer business-specific advice, understand your purchase needs and then offer you the best price available on the market. What's more, you can also skip buying the devices upfront and get them on a renewable lease, which will make it much easier for you to use Apple at your workplace. The reseller manages your contract and also offers on-demand support services to keep your devices healthy. This is one of the best ways possible to obtain iPhones, iPad, Macbook or any other Apple device that you'd want in a wholesale way. Know more about the process by contacting a reseller now. ",
