            "answer_text": "I agree with Rob Crenshaw that it\u2019s the transporter (and its cousin, the replicator, assuming we\u2019re talking about the replicator as a device based on the same basic technology), but for somewhat different, or at least additional reasons. Deconstructing (and storing the \u201cpattern\u201d of, at at least the atomic level) any object larger than your Galactic Standard Gnat is absurd. Supposedly, all of the matter in that object you\u2019re transporting gets converted to energy - but run the numbers, per the Gospel According to St. Albert, and you\u2019ll realize that the amount of energy released would be significantly greater than what we in the engineering biz refer to as a Whole Freakin\u2019 Lot. Basically, we\u2019d expect the Enterprise to be converted to a large, expanding cloud of plasma the instant you tried to \u201ctransport\u201d anything. In addition, the \u201cpattern\u201d of any object of any size at all would be an ENORMOUS amount of data; storing and/or transmitting and receiving that data would be virtually impossible. (And why is it that no one ever seems to think about the fact that if you can store someone\u2019s pattern, you could easily crank out as many identical copies as you like? Yes, I know what happened to Riker - and before that, Kirk - but both of those were supposedly very unfortunate and highly unlikely accidents. I call BS on that.) You COULD possibly get around the energy problem by saying that the transporter really just scans and disassembles the original, with no actual matter-energy conversion going on; the original matter could be stored for later use, perhaps, or maybe in winds up going into the food replicators (\u201cSoylent Green is REDSHIRTS!!!!!\u201d). But then, why destroy the original? Just scan them and materialize a copy on the planet; no muss, no fuss, and no risk to the \u201creal\u201d crew. But then is it murder if you do away with the copy after their mission is completed? If so, what do you do with them? Equally unlikely is the holodeck, from ST:TNG on. That\u2019s just not how holograms work, and we again have the problems of the amount of data involved, how you could replicate solid objects in great detail, etc., etc., etc.. In comparison, such other ST stalwarts as the warp drive and the tricorder start to look reasonable\u2026 ",

            "answer_text": "Wow, there is a lot of Trek tech that is frankly just magic recoined as future tech, but the worst and most common offender is probably the transporter. The physics of how transporter technology works just don\u2019t make sense. Not so much the disassembly of matter into energy, and reassembling of energy into matter\u2026 provided you have the means to essentially 3D print a person or other item down to the subatomic level and the memory capacity to store that kind of information, I think that part\u2019s relatively feasible. But then you get to the actual transport part of the transporter. So you\u2019ve deconstructed your landing party\u2019s atoms into energized particles\u2026 now what? How do you conceivably aim a particle stream at a planet with no receiving equipment and reconstitute each object in perfect detail down to the last quark? Not only is there no mechanism that is doing the reconstruction, there would have to be a certain amount of energy loss in transfer through media such as atmosphere, ionic changes, and actual solid objects such as rock. \u201cWell, 70% of the landing party\u2019s atoms made it here intact. Good enough!\u201d Nope. It\u2019s cool and useful from a narrative point of view to beam a landing party down into a subterranean cavern, but how the hell would you make it work? Beaming people up makes a little more sense - you can essentially just scan them to get their blueprint and then disintegrate them, only to be re-printed on the ship. But beaming down to a planet makes no sense. ",
