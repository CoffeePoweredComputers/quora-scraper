            "answer_text": "If you have formatted your SD Card & are not using since then, you can easily recover the data from a data recovery tool. In case you have saved some files (Partially Overwrite) on the SD card, then also you can restore the data. It would be difficult to recover the data if the SD card has been overwritten. So, I would suggest you to stop using your formatted card further to retrieve your data back. ",
