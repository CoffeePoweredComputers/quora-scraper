            "answer_text": "Solar and wind are complete unreliable bull crap. However other renewables like hydro, geothermal, bioenergy, solar thermal, and tidal are reliable especially hydro because hydro makes the most energy out of all energy sources. Like the Three Gorges dam makes as much energy as 20 nuclear power plants, that is a LOT of power. In the future we should use the other renewable\u2019s as well as nuclear to meet our energy needs. I also have an idea to use chemically unstable metals like magnesium and sodium as energy sources. I posted a question about this it\u2019s \u201cCan we use metals like magnesium and sodium as energy sources?\u201d You may want to check it out if you asked this question. Honestly I think why solar and wind are increasing worldwide even though they are unreliable is just because there cheap and easy to build so they can act as a tool to quickly cut emissions before catastrophic climate change gets started and it becomes even harder to undo.

            "answer_text": "According to a woman reporter in CA Sunrun lied. (as i remember the name). They told an elderly home owner that the panels would pay for themselves in X number of years because the cost of utility electricity would increase at a high % rate (something like 4 1/2 % a year). The couple, she a reporter, bought the house and discovered that the panels would not pay for themselves. As i remember they had the system removed because the panels Decreased the value of the home. About 12 years ago i was called to a house in a development where panels were installed on the buildings to heat water. Long story short, they weren\u2019t worth fixing & had other problems, so most home owners abandoned them. Politicians either lie or are too stupid to understand the issues. Some, if not most don\u2019t want to hear the facts because if the truth be known, people would see and not vote for them. Recent costs to \u2018get off the grid\u201d for an average house here is about $65,000. Another installation that we reviewed showed a Return On Investment of about 19 years, assuming that their cost of utility electricity, taxes on solar panels & insurance would not increase. (also didn\u2019t include making investments in other dividend bearing accounts.) Here in New England the \u201ccost of electricity\u201d has INCREASED, while the \u201ccost of electricity\u201d has DECREASED. How\u2019s that ? Definitions of terms. People have been lead to \u201cbelieve\u201d that it\u2019s the Utility Companies that \u201care ripping people off\u201d, when if fact it\u2019s the government, the scam-artists, including the Greens. The COST TO PRODUCE ELECTRICITY (nat. gas fired power plants) has actually decreased from about 4 cents to about 2 cents/kwh over the last decade, while the cost of electricity AT YOUR METER HAS INCREASED, due to TAXATION. In NH there are about 8 different programs the Leg. has forced the Utility Co\u2019s to collect money from the ratepayers. Then there is the Federal bureaucrats that need their cut. We all need to look at each State producing all it\u2019s own power + 20 % contingency (micro grids) and get off the Interstate Grid, thus eliminating the high cost of Interstate Transmission Lines & losses. (interconnected local grid also improves security) We need to have the U.S. President Kick - Start the manufacturing of the GREENHOUSE GAS FREE, ECONOMICAL, FACTORY BUILD & LOAD FOLLOWING (see the term \u201cdispatchable) Generation IV power plants. (see Transatomic Power, Terrestrial Energy & ThorCon). We need to quickly move away from Gov. funding to private investing by having the Gov. PURCHASE on the open market (as opposed the Gov. investing) several units for the military. Can\u2019t argue with the uninformed & emotional. Ask them how many panels, wind mills & batteries are needed and the cost to eliminate fossil fuels. The \u201ccost is coming down\u201d is not an answer ! ",
