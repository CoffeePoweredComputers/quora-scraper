            "answer_text": "It depends on what location tracking type system you are using. In general on a phone it will use the wifi, cellular, and GPS to send signals respectively to pinpoint where you are. It will continue to send signals as you move to keep a position of where you are for as long as you use it. In inactive mode they will use the cellular location tracking like the triangle of three separate nodes or towers where your signal is coming from to observe your position. This isn't as accurate as what the GPS can do but in the general area. As your device pings the towers as it does regularly it will send the server your position away from the closest tower(s). Your phone pings them constantly always looking for both you and a better signal if one is available. The different types like iOS and Android of smartphones for example also go about the storage and use of that data and you're privacy differently. That is for another discussion. ",
