            "answer_text": "This phenomenon is explained through Gravitational Time Dilation. Basically, what that means is that Gravity and Time are inversely proportional to each other.Say for example, a man stands on the surface of 2 planets, A and B. Planet A's mass is greater than Planet B's mass. Therefore, when he stands on Planet A, time seems to run slower as the gravitational pull of the planet is greater due to it's mass. On Planet B, time seems to run slower as the gravitational pull of that Planet is lesser. This particular relativity is better explained here:@Gravitational time dilation ",
