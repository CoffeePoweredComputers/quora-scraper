            "answer_text": "It works on the detection of sound waves. So whenever there is a contact of the ball with anything near to the stumps, the mic on the stumps catches the sound and produces the waves on the Ultra-edge app. It helps the umpire to judge faint edges off the bat. In fact the technology has made it a lot simpler than it is actually seems to the eyes. I hope that describes it all. ",
