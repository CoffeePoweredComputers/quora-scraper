Coal based thermal plants could not be obviated completely.Only Germany of late declared that by 2038 their 85 plants will be replaced by renewable sources.The disadvantages of this old technology are : low efficiency,high pollution. The advantages of all the 10 mentioned above are encouraging their continued use .They have economy, adaptability, ubiquitous use,These are being taken care suitably to keep in place till today. ",

            "answer_text": "In a nutshell, old technology gave us more independence by allowing us to be able to fix things and be more self reliant. New technology has allowed us to touch the world digitally and be current in real time. It\u2019s been a tremendous catapult in education for everyone. To be able to network the globe has expedited our information. But to be totally reliant on it has setbacks because when it breaks down we can\u2019t fix it ourselves. Our electric and towers govern our lives and if they go out so does our communication and everything digital. But if a person makes back up plans they can get by if need be. I love the technology, just not the total reliance on it. ",
