            "answer_text": "A Bluetooth device works on radio waves instead of wires or cables to connect to a phone or computer. A Bluetooth product (headset or watch), contains a tiny chip with a Bluetooth radio and software that makes it easy to connect. When two Bluetooth devices want to talk to each other, they need to pair. Communication between Bluetooth devices happens over short-range, ad hoc networks known as piconets. Bluetooth is essentially a networking standard that works at two levels: It provides agreement at the physical levelIt provides agreement at the protocol level, where products have to agree on when bits are sent, how many will be sent at a time, and how the parties in a conversation can be sure that the message received is the same as the message sent.Bluetooth sends and receives radio waves in a band of 79 different frequencies (channels) centered on 2.45 GHz.
