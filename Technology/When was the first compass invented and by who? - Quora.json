            "answer_text": "According to Joseph Needham, the lodestone compass was mentioned in the \u201cBook of the Devil Valley Master\u201d in the 4th century BC and in the \u201cbook of the Master Han Fei\u201d in the third century BCE. As for the compass usage in navigation, Shen Kua mentioned it in his book\u201dDream Pool Essays\u201d in 1086. There were other recorded Chinese usage of the compass for navigation in 1124, 1126. However Needham thought the compass was first used for navigation in the period from 850\u20131050. This is about a century before the compass was mentioned by Alexander Neckam in \u201cDe Naturis Rerum\u201d in 1190. The compass did not reach Europe by way of the Arabs. The Arabs may have acquired the compass later than the Europeans. For extended voyages, magnetized needles of good steel is desirable to prevent the lost it\u2019s magnetic property. The Chinese were ahead of everyone in quality steel production at that early period. The Chinese called the compass the \u201dsouth pointer\u201d for the Chinese compass points south. The early use of the lodestone compass is for geomancy in conjunction with their system of \u201cfung shui: An object was discovered in Olmec excavation dated to 1000BCE was found in 1967 at San Lorenzo, Vera Cruz, Mexico. Some thought it was a compass. Needham disputes the interpretation of the object as a compass. ",

            "answer_text": "A question of interest. Discovered? Or used for practical purposes? Who Discovered the Very First Magnet? Who Discovered the Very First Magnet? How long have magnets been around, and who was the first person to discover this amazing material? Good question, and the answer depends on who you ask and what you mean by \u201cdiscover.\u201d You see, magnets make the world go \u2018round, and stories about the discovery and use of magnets seem to come from almost every corner of the world. Read on for some enticing tales about the evolution of the modern magnet. In Greece  Roughly 4,000 years ago, a Greek shepherd named Magnes is said to have been tending his sheep in a region of northern Greece called Magnesia. He took a step and suddenly found that the nails that held his shoe together and the metal tip of his staff were stuck fast to the rock he was standing on! Intrigued, he began digging and discovered the first recorded lodestone. Lodestones were henceforth known as \u201cmagnetite,\u201d probably named after Magnes or Magnesia. In Rome  In the early A.D. years Pliny the Elder, a Roman author and naturalist who conducted significant scientific research for the then Roman Emperor Vespasian, documented a hill that was made of a stone that attracted iron. Pliny attributed the powers of magnetite to magic, launching years of superstitious theories about the material, including the possibility that ships that had disappeared at sea had actually been attracted to magnetic islands. On an unrelated but interesting note, Pliny died in the eruption of Pompeii. In Scandinavia  With a large lodestone deposit in Scandinavia and not enough light to navigate ships by in the winter, the Vikings had plenty of incentive to put the magnetic properties of lodestone to practical use. As early as 1,000 B.C., the Vikings are said to have been using a compass-like tool made of lodestone and iron. History tells us that Viking sailors utilized a magnetized iron needle placed into a piece of straw\u2013and floated in a bowl of water\u2013to indicate north and south. In China  The Chinese may have developed a mariner\u2019s compass even earlier than the Vikings and with similar construction. The Chinese navigated using a splinter of lodestone floated on water as early as 800 A.D. Explorers like Marco Polo brought the magnetic compass back to Italy, finally enabling the Europeans to explore the oceans that the Vikings had already been navigating using their own version of the compass for at least 500 years. In France  In the 1200s, French scholar Petrus Peregrinus penned one of the first written accounts of the scientific properties of magnets. His report includes a drawing and discussion of the freely pivoting compass needle\u2013a key component of the first dry compass. Legend has it that Peregrinus wrote these works while participating in the Pope-sanctioned crusade/attack on the Italian city of Lucera. Talk about multi-tasking! In England  The first scientist to actually make a magnet was actually a physician\u2014Britain\u2019s William Gilbert. In 1600 he discovered not only that the Earth itself was a magnet, but also that magnets could be forged out of iron and that their magnetic properties could be lost when that iron was heated. In Denmark  Two hundred years later, in 1820, Hans Christian Oersted began to explore the relationship between electricity and magnetism. He demonstrated his theory by setting a magnetic compass near an electrical wire, derailing the compass\u2019s accuracy. Scientists continue to explore the amazing properties of magnetism and electromagnetism in labs all over the world. Will you be one of them? ",
