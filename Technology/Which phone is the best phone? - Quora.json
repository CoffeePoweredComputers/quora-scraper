            "answer_text": " I will tell you why. I am using iPhone 5s 16 GB which I purchased online from amazon for INR 21K (315 $) and some change. The most lovable feature of this phone for me is the iOS. iPhone 5s has now been discontinued, but you will get all the regular updates (maybe upto iOS 11) which you do not in case of all Android smartphones. Lets look upto some USPs of iphones Battery life is long enough to provide all day use for many.The ios is free from viruses! (Well not completely but considerably)The display is fantastic though and having a phone that is so pocketable is handy.The Google experience on iOS is arguably better than on Android.Unlike android phones it is free from hangs and freezes. I literally experienced a single unresponsiveness in 9 months which is quite awesome!This experience of usability is not reduced even after a prolonged use of 3\u20134 years as the constant updates rolled out by apple inc. keeps the phone new. When I was using android phones it felt like an old phone after a single year (whatever the brand)Iphone is cheap for me: Yes. I don\u2019t personally feel the need to buy a new phone for 2\u20133 years considering my needs which is easily fulfilled by this phone. So this costs me roughly seven thousands/year. Most android users tend to buy a new phone costing around 15k per year or every two years (and they are the same people saying iphones are damn costly!)Sync across other iOS devices is very awesome.Good point and shoot camera replacement. Well to be honest you don\u2019t need a DSLR (so i did\u2019nt get into the ever increasing mega pixels game of smartphones ). The camera of iphone does the job exceedingly well. The video captured are awesome.Iphone is quite secure. Well I am not someone having very sensitive data on my phone but still I like my privacy. The phone is very much secured compared to it\u2019s counterpart. Even FBI could not decrypt the data stored on an iphone of a terrorist! (apple obviously refused to do so).It's been a few months (nine to be precise). I am very pleased with the touchscreen performance, speed and responsiveness of the device, speaker volume and clarity, camera functionality. Apart from all these features I personally love the feel of this compact phone in my hands. ",

            "answer_text": "Each smartphone operating system, and manufacturer brings their own unique set of features (pro's and con's). With that said, I personally feel the iPhone 5 by Apple, Galaxy S III by Samsung, the Nexus 4 by LG, and the Droid Razr Maxx HD Motorola are the best Smartphone devices on the market right now. A few things to note:  Android is by far the fastest growing mobile operating system, at over 1.3 million daily activations (Eric Schmidt: \u201cThere Are Now 1.3 Million Android Device Activations Per Day\u201d | TechCrunch)  - to put into perspective, apple sells approximately 400k new phones a day. This stat is particularly important because the major smartphone manufacturers continue to invest more heavily behind the OS that proves to be the most successful. The more these manufacturers invest, the faster the rate of innovation, and ultimately, in most cases, the better the smartphone. Right now Samsung is the most successful and fastest growing manufacturer of Android smartphones. Samsung has also over taken Nokia as the largest mobile phone manufacturer (by market share) Technology -  Samsung is top 2012 phone brand, ousting Nokia @ Wed Dec 19 2012 iPhone has arguably the best cross platform integration right now. Hence, if you already own a Mac lap top/desktop, an iPad, and/or iPod, the iPhone might be a good fit. Apple has done a fantastic job with their product ecosystem, and made it very easy to share data/files/media across their various devices. Microsoft has recently made large investments in this space, with their new Windows 8 being utilized across tablets, smartphones, and PC's. Android is also very strong in this department.  Ideal functionality also depends on what you're looking for in a phone. If you don't find yourself using many apps, and love using a keyboard for instance, than I would argue that Research In Motion's BlackBerry is the best device for you. If you are looking for the fastest, biggest, and highest performing phone, than I think the Samsung Galaxy III/Galaxy Note 2 and the new Nexus 4 by LG are your best bet. In conclusion, the \"Best\" smartphone manufacturer will depend on what your definition of \"best\" is when it comes to a phones performance, functionality, cross platform, integration, and price. As it stands, the two most influential smartphone manufacturers today are Apple and Samsung.  I hope that helps add some additional insight into your question. Lastly, I've included below a chart from the Lucid Agency that compares Android and iPhone, hopefully this helps as well:   ",
