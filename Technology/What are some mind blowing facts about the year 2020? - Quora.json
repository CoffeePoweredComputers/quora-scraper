            "answer_text": "Personally for me is to vote Donald out of the white house. For the country it is very important to remember the murder of George Floyd and the thousands of protesters of all colors and especially to the brave youth that protested knowing they could get the virus but still wanted to take a chance to have their voice spoken and to make our country better. I do believe our country will remember this as long as they live. I do hope and pray something will be done to our laws that will not discriminate against who we are. We must remember the thousands of lives that have been lost to the virus. It should be remember to know that we are in a recession that will take many years to get out of. Many jobs that will never recover, This year will be written in history books for the next generation. These 3 things will be remembered. ",
