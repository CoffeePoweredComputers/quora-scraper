            "answer_text": "Medical imaging coverss a broad category of diagnostic and therapeutic procedures. It includes the services that fall under radiology and some that are outside of radiology. Echocardiograms are sometimes not part of the radiology the probably belong in the cardiology department but hospitals have little turf wars over echocardiograms. Diagnositic ultrasound uses the same technology and is squarely in radiology departments. Other than echoes, radiology covers the interpretation of the images. Some images are generate during procedures, interventional radiology uses cine XRays, so does cardiac catheterization. You will see them done in operating theaters as well. Those images are read by the physician who is doing the procedure. Dentists, oral surgeons do medical imaging but there is no radiologist involved. All imaging is medical imaging but not all medical imaging is radiology. ",

Technically ,Radiology is the use of xrays but is sometimes used in place of the words Medical Imaging. ",
