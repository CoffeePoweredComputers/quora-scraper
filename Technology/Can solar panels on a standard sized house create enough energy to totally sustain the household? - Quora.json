            "answer_text": "It depends on what you means by \u201ctotally sustain the household\u201d. Back during the Enron debacle, I got angry at power prices like most other Californias and I got solar quoted out for my house in Silicon Valley. A lot of this still predicated that EVERY INCH of my house roof would be covered by solar panels. Like most California houses, I had no yard to speak of so this was the only option. There were a lot of standard engineering \u201cWhat If\u201d to the specifications, such as \u201cdo you want to include your oven, your dryer, your air conditioner?\u201d Depending on the answer, the viability of \u201ctotally sustain\u201d went from from 100% doable to 0% doable (completely not going to work). It mostly became unviable when I included these major appliances and it become viable when I left the out of the equation. In general, high power appliances are a no-go for solar. That includes any major electrical appliance such as stoves/ranges, clothes driers, heaters/air conditioners, etc. These have such high power consumption they can easily \u201cbust the power budget\u201d even with battery storage. This strongly suggests that BEFORE you consider solar, you should re-examine all your power consumption loads and seriously ask if you really need to include them or if you can substitute an \u201cenergy-free\u201d option. For example, hanging your clothes out to dry instead of using an electric dryer or possible switching to natural gas (which I did). 99% of the world outside of the US hangs clothes out instead of using dryers! I know this from persona experience living outside the US. Clothes dryers are bizarrely entitled extravagances! Similarly you could switch to other types of stoves/ranges like natural gas which is also more energy efficient than electricity. Heaters and A/C energy consumption is reduced by good insulation and better architecture. So did I go for solar? No. Because the payback time was 30 years and 30 years is about the time when solar cells in the solar panels reach both failure and 50% generation capacity which usually signals replacement. Additionally the fees to \u201cinter-tie\u201d were non-trivial so the return was substantially reduced. And it was going to cost $50,000 essentially as a flat added cost to all my expenses without a commiserate return. The fact I would have to be spent again in 30 years, while probably NOT my problem, still meant that financially there was no real advantage - the $50,000 would never actually \u201cpay for itself\u201d. So instead I attacked by high energy appliances by replacement all them with natural gas versions which significantly reduced by monthly energy costs. The NPV was far better than actually going solar. ",

            "answer_text": "Well actually, the \u201cno\u201d has been gradually changing into a \u201cyes\u201d for a decade, and recently, the \u201cgradually\u201d is changing into a \u201crapidly\u201d. It is in the nature of pretty much all things technical that they grow at an exponential and not a linear rate, and this makes it very difficult to notice or prepare in the early stages. Ray Kurzweil was one of the first to notice this in his \u201cThe Singularity is Near\u201d like this graph respecting the growth and cost of computer calculations. Note that the sharp curve of progress shown with linear/linear x/y scales flattens out to a more predictable curve when one of the scales is changed to the logarithmic. The y axis is log while time on the x axis is linear.  A principle aspect of this is the cost of the silicon panels. They are of course subject to this logarithmic rate of change in development, cost and use. Note the article September 2014 by Zachary Shahan, 13 Charts On Solar Panel Cost & Growth Trends showing this trend of rapid change. This sample uses Kurzweil\u2019s presentation of data using a logarithmic scale on the LHS for $/gigajoule. Notice how the cost of electricity (in 2014, 5 years ago) has met the existing cost of production and continues to fall.  So it is this dramatically reduced cost of creating solar energy that is behind the changes. But there has been a continued evolution of solar engineering generally as well, as these combine to make it better than break even in about a decade. It is important to note a further cost. Not only is the solar equipment paid off in a decade, but afterwards, there is little cost at all for electricity. It is also not a matter of solar panels alone, but of the system. Solar panels alone are quite useless for domestic house power since the use of power poorly correlates with the cloudless daylight generation. Also, a full roof of solar might typically provide 10 kW or so, due to their efficiency, and peak household useage can be about 30 kW. However, solar systems (and not just the panels) are another matter entirely, and it is systems that are being installed. There are 2 types, and they have different voltage and inverter requirements. A small LV battery to supply the home at night, and a small LV inverter to handle smaller loads. Batteries are installed to receive the solar power, and inverters to power the house as it is. When the days are cloudy, the utility supplies the power. Even so many users report close to a yearly break even on utility billing.But when little or no sunshine for a few days, a large HV battery and a large HV inverter are used to supply the home. These are sized first to provide the peak electrical useage of the house, so you can continue to cook your supper and clean your laundry at the same time. This still gives a good ROI though much more expensive. People in remote areas or where the grid is unreliable, make this choice.Utilities are rising in cost and solar is dropping in cost. The curves have simply recently crossed. Here\u2019s a video blogger who\u2019s been constructively critical as a user of solar with some videos of assessment on the subject.

            "answer_text": "Define standard sized house! Define the loads! It\u2019s bad design to just throw out answers to such open ended questions. For example\u2026. Ma and Pa live in a \u2018standard sized\u2019 home of 2200 square feet. Their kids are grown and moved away. They\u2019re retired. They sit at home at night reading by the light of two 60 W light bulbs. Dave Kelly on the other hand lives with his wife and three teenage girls in a 900 square foot house. The girls have three computers on 24/7. They run the washer and dryer constantly, and then each one of them has there own hair dryer and curling irons. Dave like to tinker with old cars, so there\u2019s a welder running most of the time, and don\u2019t forget all those shop lights burn until the wee hours friday and saturday night. So, as you can see, one needs to specify the amount of loads they\u2019ll be consuming and for how long. it\u2019s not hard to do, but there is no cookie cutter take on a standard sized house when it comes to solar array sizing. And then there is location. And let\u2019s not forget about exposure to the sun, can it be done or does a large building or trees block the sun from hitting the solar panels. DO you have the land to hold the panels? OR a rooftop that is pointed the right way? Live in a HOA allotment? Good luck with solar panels there. As you can see, there are too many loose questions to be asked first before anyone can tell you the answer to your question. ",

            "answer_text": "Solar panels on a standard sized house can definitely create energy to totally sustain the household\u2026. With solar panels you are able to generate enough electricity for the home based on the system size of your solar panel array. You are able to come up with the size of your solar panel system through some basic calculations, which assess your system size. This is based on some factors like the average price of your electricity bill, and the square feet of your house. The biggest mistake you can make when it comes to paying for your solar array, is paying too much, because if you are not able to justify costs then there is essentially no reason in investing in solar panels.  However, if you are able to find good prices, then you are able to qualify that purchase the solar panel arrays really is worth the money you are paying, because if it does not offset your current balance negatively, then you are paying less and essentially saving money on the solar panel system array. Here's a good link where you can find lowest prices on the solar panel system products, by getting the same prices that people buy for wholesale, sort of like going to a wholesale food store that restaurants use for personal use\u2026 Plus you\u2019ll find some of the best solar panel installation companies in the nation, which will give you low prices, not ripping you off\u2026 Frequently even if you find some good prices on the solar panels, and the solar panel supplies that you need to get the solar system off the ground and on the roof, you might not find good enough installers, that are either uncertified or simply ones that charge too much.

            "answer_text": "I\u2019m seeing more negativity here than is warranted. Solar power works and works well and is able to completely power a house with some exceptions. Obviously, the sun does not shine at night so there must be energy storage in the picture. At some point, depending on where your are located in the country, you could have more sunless days than it is practical to have batteries for. Those systems will have to have a backup generator, or be able to use grid power for backup. In my area we typically see about 10 to 15% output from solar panels even on rainy or cloudy days. So, by installing additional panels in split arrays facing east and west I can get that rainy day power up to about 20 to 25% of normal and spread out for more hours, even on bad days. The way these systems work this marginally increases the cost but greatly enhances the usability. The only down side is the inverters will clip some of the excess power at mid day so the AC output is never as much as the installed DC power would suggest. Bottom line, there are many, many ways to make solar work. Heating water directly from solar thermal or from DC power directly is the same thing as storing energy in a battery also. Just without the cost of the battery. A second water heater is way cheaper than a battery. ",

The only electricity usage is to cover peak loads (such as turning on the electric kettle to make tea) where the grid tops-up that generated locally, and night-time consumption. The panels are tied into the hot water tank so surplus energy is diverted to the immersion heater to provide hot water. Summer usage is low enough that the utility company called me a couple of times to inform me that there may be a fault with my electricity meter! During the winter months, the solar energy helps a bit, but with less sunshine and greater consumption, it\u2019s not enough. You\u2019d need either a very large array or a very high-capacity battery to store energy for use over the winter. ",
