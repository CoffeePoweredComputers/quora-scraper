            "answer_text": "Thanks for the A2A. You asked: Are more cameras on smartphones, like the triple-camera iPhone Pro, the reason they can take better photos? Go not unto the elves for counsel, for they will answer both yes and no. My answer is one of those sorts of answers; both yes and also no. In 1916, American photographer Ansel Adams, age 14, and his family went to Yosemite National Park in California. It was there during that trip, that his father, Charles Hitchcock Adams, gave Ansel his first camera, a Kodak Brownie No. 1 model B. A simple box camera. According to the Wikipedia article on Adams, he took photos with his usual hyper enthusiasm. The following year, Ansel returned to Yosemite on his own, with a tripod and better cameras, and learned darkroom techniques during the winter of 1917 and 1918. I\u2019d say that Mr. Adams was likely a photographer that you could hand him any sort of camera, and he\u2019d be able to make great photographs with it. So no, the camera isn\u2019t the reason for the better photographs, it\u2019s the photographer. Now, Adams is known for taking photographs with large format (think negatives of 2x3\u2033 and larger) cameras. He could do things with sheet film that would confound a 35 mm or even a digital photographer. He was that good, and the large format cameras, with their interchangeable lenses and the fact that it uses sheet film instead of roll film meant that Adams could customize his settings and the ISO (then called ASA) of the film from shot to shot, and capture much more detail than even the best of today\u2019s digital cameras on a sheet of B&W film. He wouldn\u2019t have been able to do this sort of thing with his Kodak Brownie No. 1 model B camera that his father had given him. So yes, the camera can make it possible to get better shots. I suppose the triple cameras on the iPhone 11 Pro would also make it possible to get better shots. But, the camera cannot control what it\u2019s pointed at, neither can it control the moment the shutter is released, so at least some of the quality of the photograph is up to the photographer. ",

            "answer_text": "I think the answer to your question is yes, smartphones do take better photographs than ever. Lets keep a sensible perspective on this issue though. I get lots of questions about smartphones replacing DSLR\u2019s. This is not about to happen. I am not suggesting that you are asking this question, I\u2019m just expanding on your question a bit. Smartphones are wonderful for a lot of reasons. First, they are in your pocket and available. This is great for many obvious reasons. Smartphones can make very nice photographs in many different lighting conditions, and they produce reasonably sharp photos. They can be completely silent. This is both a good and not so good thing, also for obvious reasons. The glaring difference between DSLR\u2019s and smartphones is the build. A DSLR has a large sensor, hundreds of ways to configure the camera body, and precision glass lenses, all make for a professional tool. Also, images made with a DSLR, tend to get printed, images made with a smartphone tend to exist in digital form and most do not get printed. This is an important distinction. ",

            "answer_text": "No, that just gives you more lenses to use. The sensor size and density is part of it, the AI behind the camera is most of the other part. The main part, though, is the finger on the button. If you know photography, you take better pictures than if you don\u2019t. You want a camera that does good bokeh, open the lens as far as it will go. (And turn the speed up or the ISO down to compensate,) Want to get a picture of a speeding car without blur? Either take a picture of the car coming toward you or aim at the car, follow it and, at one point, while still following it, take he picture. Want the car to look like The Flash? Aim directly across the street. and take the shot as the car passes right in front of you, without moving the camera. Want to get 3 blocks in a single shot? Shoot down the length of the street with a deep telephoto. There are photographic tricks, they have nothing to do with cellphones. But knowing them makes better pictures with a cellphone (or any camera). ",

            "answer_text": "Yes. It depends on you and on how you define good photos though. The most important aspect of a photo is not sharpness, noise, or some other technical quality, but what you see on it. The decisive moment and the way it\u2019s translated into an image, with all aspects of composition in the broadest sense of the word. A device with several lenses (be it a phone or a camera) helps a lot since it enables you to choose the right frame for your composition and to choose the right distance and perspective. A lens is, after all, a way to show the world, it\u2019s a way to tell a story. The problem with almost all other smartphones is that they use one lens and that is, in fact, a moderate wide-angle lens. It\u2019s good for some landscapes, group pictures, street photography (with some limitations). But for portraits, the focal length is too short. That\u2019s the reason most selfies make your nose look larger and make your face, in general, look weird. The more you are conscious of images, the more it will start to irritate you (and the persons on the pictures). Some new phones have what the manufacturer calls a telelens. It is, in fact, a short telelens, almost a standard lens. Despite that, it\u2019s a lot better suited to make portraits than the lens most one lens phones have. Some new phones have an ultra-wide-angle lens as well. That is a welcome add-on since it enables you to make more impressive landscapes and cityscapes, e.g. The extra lenses don\u2019t change your phone into a mirrorless camera or DSLR, but as far as the choice of the frame of your image is concerned, you\u2019re less limited and that helps to make better photos.

            "answer_text": "No. The three cameras are there to allow you a choice of three fields of view for the shot you wish to take. Let\u2019s call them wide, medium and telephoto. The reason there are 3 cameras is because a single lens that can deliver all three shots would be to long to fit, hence 3 cameras and 3 lenses to keep things so they will fit in a thin smartphone. The quality of the photos are a result of the quality of the camera used for the shot and the complex processing that takes place before, during and after you shoot the shot. ",

Any camera or any number of cameras on a phone is inferior to an actual camera designed for the single purpose of making photographs in the hands of persons skilled in the art and craft of photography. That many snapshots are very good does not negate the primary use for phones which is communication - cameras are a marketing hype add on. ",
