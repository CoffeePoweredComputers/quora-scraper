            "answer_text": "I understand you to mean that a very large percentage of humankind would have had instant access, 500 years ago, to a vast amount of knowledge on nearly every topic (never mind the practical problems with where would the computers, electricity, etc. come from.) Information is the key here. In a sense, the invention of the printing press is a simpler version of what you are suggesting. It made books far more accessible to thousands of people, and books traveled well. Through books, ideas and information became available to people who would not otherwise have had access to them, and the world\u2019s technological and social advancement accelerated as a result. It has never stopped accelerating. It the internet itself had been available, the transformation of society from the Middle Ages to modern times would have happened within only a couple generations. The social advancements in societies traditionally seem to happen only with the application of time, as older, more conservative folks unable to accept change die off, and the younger ones who are more adaptable take their places. So social progress would have been slower than technological progress, and there would quickly be a sharp divide (even as there is today) between those who use the internet and absorb the new ideas, and those who lack access or inclination to do so. My guess is that, despite the uneven move to the future, our world today would be 350 years or more ahead of where it is now. Since I am an optimist who believes the world is slowly getting better, I find that to be a good thing! ",
