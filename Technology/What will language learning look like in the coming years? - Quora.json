            "answer_text": "Good question worth deep elaboration. First of all let's differentiate use cases of language learning and see how they will be addressed: Pragmatic (everyday communication, tourism, business negotiations)Intellectual (linguistics, extension of worldview, hobby)Note that learning of native language can be classified both as pragmatic (babies learn language to communicate to their parents) and intellectual (human intellect is strongly shaped by language). As for pragmatic use of language learning won't be required at all. Even today Google Translate app in smartphone is sufficient to ask for directions while travelling and interpret answers (if they speak slowly and clearly enough). So, a little bit trained cloud service will serve as universal translator for basic communication. Today it seems that the quality of translation has objective limits without understanding of context, but technology is developing too fast for us to be able to assess its upcoming abilities. For example, the translator may be deeply integrated with the brain to get contextual suggestions directly from neurons. Intellectual use of language evidently requires brains to be trained by intensive use of language. Unless some wonderful technology arises growing any skill within a brain by copy-and-pasting its neural representation into human brain (like Trinity got helicopter driving skills in Matrix movie), the only way will be old fashioned drilling of language patterns for brains to grow neural connections corresponding to language chunks. Anyhow, technology may be of help here too. Drilling may use alternative channels to communicate to the brain - instead of using real sounds and ears as hardware to perceive them, future devices may trigger corresponding signals directly into brains playing specific \"language courses\" directly into brains with well-calculated intensity. The most Utopian scenario is absence of language at all. At some point human brains may become analogues for smartphones responsible for motor functions while consciousness will be moved away to centralized cloud service encapsulating legislation, economical and demographic planning and other social aspects. Human brains will get an implant triggering signals dictating decisions. In this case people won't need any communication via sounds and letters at all - the communication will be performed by \"thoughts\" via centralized servers. So, humanity will become a well organized anthill without any conflicts, wars and thus any necessity to communicate at all. ",

            "answer_text": " People will just be able to insert language  chips into our brains and know it instantly.  But in the nearer future, it looks like the Internet is becoming the main source for more and more language learners. There is so much free content online with more being added exponentially. Besides content, it also allows you to connect with people all across the world. You can have a conversation with a German  who is traveling in Indonesia one minute, then another one with Korean backpacker in Uganda the next. I think more and more applications are going to take advantage of and enhance this connection.  ",
