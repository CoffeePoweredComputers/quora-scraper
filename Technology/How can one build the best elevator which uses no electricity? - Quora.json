            "answer_text": "Historically there have been a few successful  non electrical methods for powering lifts.   Some early Funicular railways, used water (in the case of my neighboring seaside town, sea water) to counter balance load of lift carriage/cabin, then releasing water to reverse.    In London, municipally supplied steam pressure has been used.  The one I always liked was the water tank at the top of the building, with a heavy iron \"cap\" pressing down on the water, to provide a \"hydro\" powered lift. This was controlled by a rope that ran from top to bottom in the shaft, passing through the lift car. By pulling the rope one way or the other would open and shut a directional valve.   Counter weight and muscle power would also work, there are still many \"dumb waiters\" that use this system.   I realise you said no electricity, but for a serious modern day, practical solution. There are a couple of manufacturers that have designed battery powered lifts. I have supplied such a lift and powered the chargers for the batteries by solar PV panels.  ",

            "answer_text": "It was already done decades ago! There are many hand powered counterbalanced man lifts in feed mills and similar facilities now that use no power. The process works like this: Add or subtract the portable weights to the car to approximately balance your body weight plus weights to the counterweight.Step on the pedal in the car to release the brake.Pull up or down on the stationary hand rope that goes through the car.Coast to your desired floor.Release the brake pedal to stop and hold the car.These units are really quite fun to ride, but can only carry one person at a time ",
