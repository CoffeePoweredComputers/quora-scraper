            "answer_text": " 4 Best Trending Eye Makeup for 2020 by Heer Nayyar updated on October 5, 2020 The beautiful blend of shimmer and matte: In this look, you start off by using a neutral shade of a brown that suits your skin tone, not a shade that overwhelms it, apply it in the crease line area and to the outer-v of your lid & blend. Then for the inner lid, you can pick a gold/rose gold shadow that is shimmery yet subtle. Apply it from the inner-v of the eye to the mid \u2013 lid & blend the brown with it so that it looks seamless. You can then use a smudger brush to apply the same brown to your lower lash-line. Put on a coat or two of mascara. You could also do a winged liner its optional but definitely adds beauty.  The golden olive look: This is a simple yet sultry makeup look. You pick a dark shade of green from your palette, something close to olive green (don\u2019t have a dark green \u2013 blend some brown with the light green) and apply it to the outer-v of your eye and blend it across your crease line. Then pick some gold glitter or a moderately heavy gold shimmer eyeshadow and apply it to the inner and mid lid. Blend in the olive green slightly with the gold and apply some green to the lower lash line as well, to add more definition to the eye. Apply some mascara and you\u2019re great to go!   Power Colour below the Eyes: This is a super easy & very chic look. You begin with a neutral to dark shade of brown applied to your upper lash line and then blend it upwards to the crease, creating a blown-out effect. Then pick a coloured eye pencil or some bright colour from your palette that is heavily pigmented. You can use colours like Electric blue, Magenta, Fuchsia, Yellow, Orange or Purple \u2013 just make sure the colour stands out when applied to your skin tone. And apply it all across your lower lash line & then two coats of mascara. Adding some glitter/ highlighter to the inner-v is optional but if done will definitely make your eyes brighten up!  The cut crease chic look: This look is for the beauties that are ready to go bold with their eye shadows. Once, you have concealed your eyes make sure you powder them so that the eye shadow blends well. Then pick a bright, powerful colour like purple or blue or green or shocking pink. Place it only in the crease line area and blend it well. Take a neutral brown to shade the lower lash line. And apply two coats of mascara. Applying some subtle shimmer to the mid lid is more suitable for an evening look and is totally optional. Otherwise, just let the mid lids remain bare and the crease bold!   #makeup #makeuptrends #makeup2020 #heernayyar #makeuptrainer #makeupartist #professionalmakeup #eyeshadowtrends ",

            "answer_text": "Summer 2019 is just barely winding down in the regular world, but in the fashion world, we're already looking ahead to S/S 2020. Yes, that's right. This past week's New York Fashion Week showcased the latest fashion and beauty trends we can expect to see when the weather warms up\u2026 next year. Although the sartorial offerings are the biggest reason for the shows, it's the beauty we were scoping on the runways. The beauty trends we saw during the fashion month kickoff in New York were absolutely epic. Color, embellishments, and texture were abundant in both makeup and hair design, from the structured, architectural vibe of Helmut Lang to the more whimsical energy at Jeremy Scott. Before you switch your focus to runways across the pond, take a look at your ultimate guide to the beauty trends that dominated in New York. Ahead, the five you're about to see everywhere. Off-Kilter Winged Liner For the eyeliner-obsessed among us, this is such a treat. More subtle eye makeup has taken center stage over the last few runway seasons, but this time around designers seem to have embraced bold, exaggerated, edgy eyeliner looks. Libertine  Jeremy Scott  Helmut Lang  Color-Burst Lids We saw vivid, monochromatic statements, as well as subtle gradients of color popping on many lids that went down the runway. Makeup artists carried these colors all the way up to the eyebrow and, in some cases, out onto the cheekbones, too. It was an all-out color party. Marc Jacobs  Jewel-Adorned Hair Hair accessories are nothing new, but this fashion week we noticed a decidedly ornamental style of hair decoration. From delicately placed jewels to full head-pieces and everything in between, the jewels were on full display. Alice and Olivia  ",
