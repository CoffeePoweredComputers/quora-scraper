            "answer_text": "I looked into it in the 60s and little was left. It was in Alaska miles from roads or rail roads. You were required to live on the land and clear it so a lot of hard work. A number of years maybe 5 before you could claim it. You would need to build a cabin, cut firewood, grow or kill food, protect yourself from bears and try not to go stir crazy being alone. So you would want chainsaw, gas, oil, guns, ammo, traps, clothing, boots, coffee, shoelaces and a million other things like dishes that all need hauled in to the middle of the forest. Then build a cabin and cut firewood before winter and preserve enough food for winter. You would need to be young, strong and healthy to even attempt it and know how to build and repair everything you own or might want. You would also need income to make an annual trip into the city for supplies like coffee, flour, sugar, boots then you need to haul it all back to the homestead. The program was ending in the 60s when I was young enough to consider it but not rich enough to try it. ",

            "answer_text": "US Homesteading law of the federal government was ended in 1976. Each individual state has their own homesteading laws, and you\u2019d need to look up the individual states rules. Most it\u2019s simply buying property, have a home, filing paperwork to declare it your homestead, and you typically get things like a minor property tax break on that property and maybe some protections.
