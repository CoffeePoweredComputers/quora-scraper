            "answer_text": "Yes, a 32 bit software can be run on a 64 bit Operating System. When a 32 bit software is launched, in Windows for example, an emulator is launched. The emulator 'tricks' the 32 bit software and makes it think that it's running on a 32 bit system. Any system calls are intercepted by the emulator and runs 32 bit variations for system calls that differ b/w 64 and 32 bit operating systems.  However, it is best recommended to use the 64 bit version if it is provided to you. EDIT: The 32 bit applications will be installed into the 'Program Files (x86)' folder in your System Partition. And the 'SystemWOW64' has all the 32-bit dlls and system files. ",

Both of these instruction sets add extra instructions to an existing 32-bit instruction set (x86 and ARMv7 respectively), but the 32-bit instructions are still valid, so an OS can fairly easily run 32-bit software. And, since most operating systems place a high priority on compatibility, most of them provide support. ",

Ie: you can run 32 bit software on 64 bit environment easily. Basically 32 and 64 is a type of bus which is used in motherbord to make communication betweeb memory and processor if you have a 32 bit bus than you are not able to run 64 on it (its similer to run an volvo bus on small street so..). Another thing is that whenever 32 bit cpu builded at that time we dont have much processing power so thats why we make 32x wider bus to transfer data between HDD to RAM, RAM to processor etc. But right now we have much better CPU power. I say we have now CPU, GPU,TPU to process complex algorithms. Thank you, Viral parmar ",

The main downside of 32-bit applications is that they can allocate only 4GB of RAM. This is because the maximum integer value of 32-bit binary is 2,147,483,647 bits, so it can\u2019t look up memory addresses past that. In the case of Windows, it simply emulates a 32-bit system so the app that doesn\u2019t support 64-bit architectures thinks it\u2019s running on a 32-bit architecture. Unfortunately, some OSes have chosen to not support 32-bit apps anymore. With the latest version of iOS, you can\u2019t run apps that are designed for 32-bit CPUs. Canonical came under fire recently when it tried to drop support for 32-bit binaries. They got so much pushback that they reversed the descision, but in some distributions, support has been dropped.
