This will enable us to launch a world-class 5G service in India, using 100% homegrown technologies and solutions. This Made-in-India 5G solution will be ready for trials as soon as the 5G spectrum is available and can be ready for field deployment next year. And because of Jio\u2019s converged, all-IP network architecture we can easily upgrade our 4G network to 5G.  Once Jio's 5G solution is proven at India-scale, Jio Platforms would be well positioned to be an exporter of 5G solutions to other telecom operators globally, as a complete managed service. ",
