            "answer_text": "As all the previous answers have suggested, when it comes to patents and innovation, it's a mixed bag.  However, the case against patents, and software patents in particular, is often over-stated.   I'm currently a patent attorney and litigator, but I've also spent time working with the EFF's Patent Busting Project, and have experience working with those asserting or defending against patents. (I'm also a software engineer by training, and while I'm currently based in Chicago / Boston, I once lived in the valley).  Patents in the software space can play an important pro-innovation role.  As internet user experience is dominated by a small number of large players who can easily, if they choose, copy the developments of smaller entities, patents provide an attractive way for a small company to hedge the risk that they're ideas will just get copied.  It's probably true that often a large company would prefer to buy out a start-up rather than copy their technology even without a patent, but the value of patent protection will always inherently play a role in calculating how much they should pay.  Also, the looming threat that the larger entity could just copy your product if you don't want to sell puts extra pressure on the small entity to sell.  In the end, if patent protection means a higher valuation for your start-up, it's pretty clearly creating an incentive to innovate. This effect is even more important on the internet, and especially if you're offering a service that piggy-backs on established platforms offered by some of the leading tech companies.  Platform providers are in a better position than most to take a third-party service and incorporate it into their offerings.   To be sure, the patent system has problems, and there are clearly some bad/stupid patents out there, and getting one asserted against you can be a frustrating experience.  Many of the issues could probably get resolved with some reform (legislative or judicial) to damages law, but that's an answer to a different question. ",

            "answer_text": "Interesting debate here. As a named inventor on several patents, I can see various points. One point I haven\u2019t seen is cases where an invention truly is novel and a contribution, but is implemented primarily in software. One of my applied-for (but not yet granted) is in exactly this category. If I say so myself, it\u2019s extremely clever, to the point where it\u2019s hard for very smart people to understand even when I explain it\u2014that\u2019s partly my fault for not figuring out how to explain it better. This involves finding the distance to a non-linearity in a cable used for high-power cellular signals, so it\u2019s pretty esoteric. Now that I\u2019ve invented this, how do I make money from it? If I (or a company I\u2019ve sold the rights to) implements it, it will be fairly easy to copy\u2014we\u2019ll have to explain how it works to customers so they know how to use it, when it works, and when it doesn\u2019t. It would then be easy for competitors to copy it. If I couldn\u2019t get patent protection on this concept, why would I bother to come up with it? Maybe I could make a few bucks off of it before someone copied it, but that\u2019s a long, expensive, risky path\u2014and the path to copying it is very short. This is especially true as we would have to get at least part of the system (the generation of the test signals) standardized, or at least implemented inside other companies radio equipment. I agree that there are lots of problems with the patent system. NPEs are probably the worst problem, but if you own IP, why can\u2019t you sell it? If an NPE wants to buy it, what\u2019s wrong with that? I once saw a patent that claimed \u201cany method\u201d to do something. That isn\u2019t really an invention; the rest of the patent was a method to accomplish something, but precluding other methods seems ludicrous to me. However I haven\u2019t seen anything here that talks about how to fix the problems while keeping the benefits of patents. So my claim is that just because an invention is (or can be) implemented in software doesn\u2019t preclude it being a significant contribution. Perhaps the vast majority of things claimed to be software inventions really aren\u2019t, but I believe at least one is. ",

            "answer_text": "They help innovation. It makes no sense to treat software differently than any other technology. If you think the patent system hurts innovation for all technologies, I respect your opinion but disagree. If you think they patent system helps innovation for all technologies, I respect your opinion and agree. However, if you think the patent system hurts software innovation, but helps innovation in all other technologies, I do not respect your opinion. It\u2019s nonsensical harmful hogwash. Anybody remember Stac Electronics - Wikipedia ? An innovative start up figures out how to make the most out of small hard drives by on-the-fly compression and decompression. Microsoft steals the technology, incorporates it into their operating system, and eliminates the market for Stac\u2019s software. Without software patents, the history of the software industry would be this sequence of events playing itself out again and again. Innovative start ups would have no chance. There would be a few huge players (e.g. IBM, Microsoft and maybe Apple). The rate of innovation among these huge players would be slow, since they already have monopolistic market shares. New start-up competition would be immediately squashed when the big players reverse engineer and copy their competitions\u2019 innovations. Thank goodness that is not what has happened. Innovative start ups like Stac are able to protect their innovations with patents, and force the big players to pay up if they try to steal their technology without paying for it. (That is in fact what happened with Stac). Note: It should be no surprise that the Shark Tank investors always ask software companies about whether their technology is patented. If it isn\u2019t, it can easily be stolen so nobody with half a brain would invest in a company that relies on unprotected software to give them a competitive advantage. ",

            "answer_text": "Allow me to re-phrase your question: If the US government created an office in which thousands of bureaucrats assigned tens of thousands of monopolies on abstract algorithms to private interests each year, would that help innovation ? No, it's insane. Consider: Examiners cannot possibly judge what's \"non-obvious\" in countless specialized algorithmic subjects and application domains.You cannot write any significant commercial software today without violating many patents. Nor can you even know which ones; patents are written in an intentionally vague and legalistic manner, making them difficult to find and understand. And over 50,000 new software patents are issued each year by the USPTO alone.In 2011 Apple and Google spent more on patents and patent litigation than on designing products [New York Times technology section, Oct 7 2012]Most software professionals would like to see software patents abolished (94% in the case of a 2012 New Zealand IIT survey).But don't software patents encourage innovation ? No. They add financial risk to the creation of any new product or feature. Massive financial risk if you are a small company; a typical patent lawsuit costs millions of dollars - regardless of merit. They do of course encourage patenting, but the most effective strategy is a land-grab of trivial incremental ideas. But without software patents, can't someone just copy your software product ? No. Software is protected by copyright. Any company that literally copies your software and tries to sell it as their own can be sued. This almost never happens among law-abiding companies. Further, software is usually distributed in 'compiled' form, meaning that it's very difficult to reverse engineer complex algorithms. In almost all cases a competitor will find it cheaper and better to design their own algorithms and source code from scratch rather than reverse engineer a competitor's product. This point is usually not understood by non-programmers who think software patents are a good idea. What do you care ? I started a small company which develops algorithms and software which are then licensed to other, larger, firms. In other words we\u2019re \u2018inventors\u2019, something the patent system purports to help. By far the biggest threat to our existence is software patents. If one of our large customers is sued for infringement (related to our tech), they will immediately attempt to push costs back to us and I\u2019ll lose my investment of life savings and many years. Regardless of the merits of the patent. And of the various threats we\u2019ve had, the patents in question have all been merit-less; trivial, not novel, and in one case not even intelligible. Nor have we applied for patents. For the reasons described above, they are not necessary in software. And even if we did want to block competitors instead of creating a better product, this would require millions in legal fees. Because of software patents, I would never start another business based on this \u2018software invention\u2019 model and would advise anyone else to avoid it as well. And yes, I am a software patent \u2018inventor\u2019 from work for a previous employer. What's the evidence ? There is lots of evidence.

            "answer_text": "My own intuition is that the answer is software patents hurt innovation, and many others share that view. There is a well-known paper by James Bessen and Eric Maskin from 1999 that argues that patents don't help innovation and may hinder it.http://www.researchoninnovation.org/patent.pdf Abstract: How could such industries as software, semiconductors, and computers have been so innovative despite historically weak patent protection? We argue that if innovation is both sequential and complementary\u2014as it certainly has been in those industries\u2014competition can increase firms\u2019 future profits thus offsetting short-term dissipation of rents. A simple model also shows that in such a dynamic industry, patent protection may reduce overall innovation and social welfare. The natural experiment that occurred when patent protection was extended to software in the 1980's provides a test of this model. Standard arguments would predict that R&D intensity and productivity should have increased among patenting firms.   Consistent with our model, however, these increases did not occur. Other evidence supporting our model includes a distinctive pattern of cross-licensing in these industries and a positive relationship between rates of innovation and firm entry.  Chris Dixon argues here that they don't help anything: http://www.cdixon.org/?p=1090 The gist of his argument is:  Ask any experienced software/internet/hardware entrepreneur if she wouldn\u2019t have started her company if patent law didn\u2019t exist.  Ask any experienced venture investor if the non-existence of patent law would have changed their views on investments they made.  The answer will invariably be no (unless their company was a patent troll or something related). Another article that echoes many of the same points can be found here:http://www.feld.com/wp/archives/2010/02/sawyer-weighs-in-on-intellectual-ventures.html The two arguments that I've heard in defense of software patents are from Paul Graham and Nathan Myrhvold.  Graham's is here:http://www.paulgraham.com/softwarepatents.html He says basically that: If you're against software patents, you're against patents in general. Gradually our machines consist more and more of software. Things that used to be done with levers and cams and gears are now done with loops and trees and closures. There's nothing special about physical embodiments of control systems that should make them patentable, and the software equivalent not. The simplest argument against this point of view is probably that we should be against patents in general, except for possibly a few specific fields like biotech. The other argument that is referenced a lot is from Nathan Myrhvold.  He has a company called Intellectual Ventures that gets tons of patents and then licenses them for money to companies who do similar things.  There is a NY Times piece that presents his firm in a fairly positive light; http://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/18/technology/18patent.html?emc=eta1 Mr. Myhrvold ...  is trying to build a robust, efficient market for \u201cinvention capital,\u201d much as private equity and venture capital developed in recent decades. \u201cThey started from nothing, were deeply misunderstood and were trashed by people threatened by new business models,\u201d he said in his offices here.  Mr. Myhrvold presents his case at length in a 7,000-word article published on Thursday in the Harvard Business Review. \u201cIf we and firms like us succeed,\u201d he writes, \u201cthe invention capital system will turbocharge technological progress, create many more new businesses, and change the world for the better.\u201d  The HBR article mentioned can be found here: http://hbr.org/2010/03/the-big-idea-funding-eureka/ar/1 Most people who are against software and technology patents see IV as just a massively scaled up patent troll that just increases the tax on innovation that the current patent system creates. My personal experience has been that patents have only deterred me or companies I've worked at from embarking on new things that would be innovative.  In general, my experience has been that medium-to-large companies patent everything they can think of that might be relevant to their business and then implement only a fraction of those things, which just creates a barrier to competition in the marketplace since market entrants are burdened by the threat of a lawsuit.  New companies or innovators that do actually invent valuable things aren't very well protected by patents since, even if they manage to patent what they do, and successfully sue a competitor for infringing on the patent, the damages awarded will be peanuts compared to the dollars that could have been made if the company had won the market.  Since technology companies tend to be really hit or miss, having a patent doesn't give much comfort to inventors. I haven't really heard a convincing counterexample where a technology patent has helped drive innovation (outside of biotech,) so  I think that patents in general are pretty bad for technology innovation. Another interesting point is covered by Mark Lemley from Stanford Law School.http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1856610He basically argues that most inventions aren't created by a single genius, but often created from a bunch of people competing and collaborating as the world changes, and the whole theory behind our current patent system is flawed because it is built around the idea that lone genius individuals need to be incented to make great leaps forward.

            "answer_text": "Most of the arguments against \u201cSoftware patents\u201d are really arguments against patents in general. However, there are several myths regarding \u201csoftware patents\u201d that are worth noting. Myth #1: \u201cSoftware can be patented\u201d Although the term \u201csoftware patent\u201d is widely used, in fact, software (computer code), algorithms, and data structures cannot (and never could) be patented. The Patent Office does not even classify any patents as \u201csoftware patents.\u201d Myth #2: \u201cSoftware is an application program\u201d Though usually not expressed this way, the mindset of many who oppose software patents seems to be to think of \u2018software\u2019 as being an \u201capp\u201d. This ignores the fact that software is ubiquitous today in all sorts of technology, such as kitchen appliances, medical devices, airplanes, communication networks, automobiles, etc. That is why almost all electrical engineers and mechanical engineers take courses in programming, and many code as part of their jobs. However, the software aspect of the invention cannot be divorced from the hardware elements. Myth #3: \u201cSoftware is distinct from hardware\u201d Again, much technology today is a combination of hardware and software. More so, the software component is often the most innovative aspect. Consider a device such as a computer-aided tomography (CT) scan and the exquisitely complex control mechanisms used to operate this device, much of it software, as well as the software-related imaging technology used to interpret and analyze CT images. There is no logical reason to single out the \u201csoftware\u201d part of these inventions. Myth #4: \u201cSoftware patents are easy to obtain\u201d This is actually false. Patent applications involving methods that use software running on general purpose computers are among the most difficult to obtain. They take among the longest to get examined, and it is difficult to receive broad patent claim on such patents. Now, back to the reason to have patents. A prime reason is to protect against what is known in economics as the free-rider problem. As a widely used microeconomics textbook explains: There is a great deal of hard work, research and investment behind an invention of a new product or production process. A patent is a legal tool that empowers the inventor to enjoy the monopoly power over its use. It helps to check the free rider problem. No one can use the invention without prior permission of the inventor at least over its patent life. To illustrate, suppose a scientist invents a mosquito repellant. The know-how of the device suits its commercial production and sale to consumers. If it is not patented, many free riding producers will use it to manufacture the device and make profits out of its sale to the consumers...What causes concern is that the research, investments and efforts made by the inventor go unrewarded while those wh contributed nothing (free riders) make fortunes out of it. This goes a long way to to discourage scientists and researchers from making similar efforts in the future. [Microeconomics: Theory and Applications, S.P.S. Chauhan, PHI Learning, 2009; p. 276] ",

            "answer_text": "As somebody who has filed numerous patents, I would suggest that patents are just not meant for software.  Patents take way too long to prosecute (2-3 years) and are just too slow to keep up with demand.   And yet, as one investor told me, nobody has ever successfully sued anyone over a broken NDA contract.  Nobody is too big or too important to not steal your \"measly little invention\" and people have ideas stolen all of the time.  So we need protection and yet there really are not any good options.   Innovation comes from people seeing products/services and dreaming up better ideas.  With inventors constantly afraid of having their IP taken from them, the flow of ideas into companies stagnates and can be very detrimental to innovation. Third party trade secret companies have some promise but, again, I have never heard of anybody even going to court over trade secret violations - much less winning.  Further the new patent \"reform\" act really stacks the deck against independent inventors and makes it much easier for large corporations to get away with taking your invention. It is funny but I think that perhaps software needs to innovate a way to protect itself from theft.  Perhaps a large social network of inventors and investors backed by some scary large law firm just aching to go after an investor dumb enough to steal an invention off of the website...just a thought...

            "answer_text": "\"If i had seen further demurred Newton once\".   Invention process has always grown from from strength to strength. At times, exponential growth has also been witnessed in some departments. However, a new NBER working paper by Alberto Galasso of the Rotman School of Management and Mark  Schankerman from the London School of Economics has found that the  patent system is curtailing this tradition of progressive innovation. The authors take into account what happens when a court invalidates an already existing patent. Their finding is simply impressive. What they have found is that when a patent is removed, cumulative growth in innovations are recorded attributing to the original idea. This in a way opens up the scenario in the bargaining market. When a downstream inventor is unable to get access/permission for the foundational idea, no one can cash in. But, when a patent is invalidated, the original idea becomes free and a lot of inventions arise on which inventors cash in dollars. But, on authors critical judgemnt, they report that this effect widely differs in various fields. For complex fields which includes electronics, IT, whose product relies upon plethora of patents, invalidating patents has witnessed three fold increase in innovations. Although, in non complex fields, the rise in innovation is not too dramatic to notice.   What do these results suggest? When a innovation requires access to a large no patents the risk of failing in negotiations is huge. Furthermore, the authors were able to compare the bargaining effect with bigger firms and small scale innovators. Since, bigger corporates own a chunk of the patents, small innovators face a rather difficult time in bargaining. This could be due to the fact that bigger corporates see little light in licensing their patents to smaller people. The patent system is designed to encourage innovation by granting  property rights to the inventor. However, finding the right strength for  these property rights is a delicate balance. Too weak and there may be  insufficient monetary incentive to innovate, too strong and they may  impede the development of future innovations The authors shy away from making any definitive suggestions for patent  reform, in part because the paper only attempts to measure one side of  the cost-benefit ledger: the gains from overturning a patent, as opposed  to the positive incentives it generates to innovate in the first place.  However, it does suggest that the potential costs of the current system  are larger than had previously been thought. It also shows that  constraints on innovation are concentrated in specific markets. As such  it may be more efficient to target reforms at these fields specifically,  as opposed to trying to reform the patent system en masse.  That way  the areas of the patent system which are broken can be fixed, without  reducing the incentive to innovate in fields where the patent system is  already working well. ",

            "answer_text": "As this question is directed to software patents, it seems that the first place to start is what differentiates software from other classes of technology?  While there are undoubtedly many differences, my experience is that the \u201cissues\u201d of software patents really comes down to two.  The first is that software is not necessarily physical in nature, such as a hammer, a drug, a new solvent, etc.  Rather, software controls a physical construct, such as a computer, an automobile engine, etc.  The second issue somewhat unique to software patents is that the field of software engineering is relatively new; while fully programmable computers have existed since 1941, the field of software engineering has really only existed since the 1960s.  As a result of the relative youth of software engineering, fundamental patents are still in force; i.e., the Amazon \u201cone-click\u201d patent, or the Priceline \u201creverse-auction\u201d patent.  Compare this with fields, such as mechanical engineering or chemistry, where fundamental \"building block\" technologies are centuries old.   Addressing the \u201cnon-physical\u201d nature of software, a few preliminary points should be made.  First, the patentability of a construct with no physical embodiment is still in doubt - while the Supreme Court, in Bilski, indicated that, while there are other tests than the \u201cmachine or transformation\u201d test formulated by the Federal Circuit, it did not state what those other tests were.  Accordingly, if a software program is not tied to a particular machine (a general purpose computer does not pass the test), or actually transform matter in some way, its patentability is highly questionable.  Second, it should be noted that \u201ccontrol processes,\u201d such as those used to control chemical processes or power plants, have long been patentable.  See, for example, USPN 4,200,864, which controls a chemical process with a number of hardware electronic circuits. It seems that the questioner does not quibble with the value of patents for controlling chemical processes or power plants using hardware circuits.  It therefore seems that a patent directed to a microprocessor performing the same processes would provide the same benefits to innovation that the patent utilizing hardware circuits would provide.  Accordingly, as long as a software patent is embodied within a physical construct (which is more or less the present law), it would appear that there is no fundamental difference between software patents and other patents. Turning to the relative youth of the field, the fundamental problem appears to be, as I stated above, that fundamental patents that are essentially \u201cunavoidable,\u201d are still in force, and some are even still being granted today.  For example, in my practice, I have come across a patent, now expired, that appeared to cover an Internet link.  See, for example, USPN 4,873,662 (I note that certain limitations may have proven problematic in its enforcement - as the patent is now expired, that issue is now moot).  And this seems to be where the real problem of software patents arises - put simply, most companies with active Internet presences likely infringe hundreds, or even perhaps thousands, of valid patents.  There are similar issues with other fields within IT.  Outside of IT, I know of no field where this is the case.  Most of these fundamental patents will be held by larger, more established companies, who may have an interest in preventing a new technology from displacing their older products.  Without citing any specific examples, this is not a \u201cfantasy\u201d issue.On the other side of this is the legitimate interest of a company protecting the large amounts of money that it spends on developing a new product (or the large amounts of money that investors routinely sink into startup companies - patents have a large role to play there as well).  So the question becomes how to craft a patent system that protects legitimate investment by companies, individuals, and investors, while still allowing for meaningful competition?   I actualy think that this is exactly the point behind the Federal Circuit\u2019s \u201cmachine or transformation\u201d test.  By tying a software patent to a particular machine, it effectively restricts the scope of claims that can be obtained.  And of course, the particular machine must be described in the specification, so that puts a boundary on the number of particular machines that can be claimed.  This also works well with the revised standard for obviousness:  a software construct may be non-obvious when used within a particular type of system, but obvious when used within another - if a claim drafter is too greedy, than many different types of \u201cparticular machine\u201d will be available as prior art, and the claims of a patent will be more likely to be invalidated.   Given the above, I believe that the Federal Circuit (and the Supreme Court) have seen this problem and are modifying the law to address the possible issue of software patents restricting the ability of startup companies to succeed.  And as this framework becomes more developed, I see software patents as no different than other classes of invention.  Accordingly, I would expect that, going forward, software patents will provide the same benefits to innovation that other classes of patent are well-known to provide. ",

            "answer_text": " We have many answers and majority of people believe that they do hurt innovation which is quite correct. Today, we can see there are too much of software patents. Also, the trend of filing patent has been increased too much if we compare to some decade ago. The last one million patents granting time took just 4-5 years. Top companies of software patent are IBM, Qualcomm, Intel, Microsoft, and Samsung etc. These companies file most patents. And you know the position of these companies in the global market. Each company is a pioneer in a particular field because of their innovation. So, it totally depends upon a company whether they hurt or help innovation. After the famous case of Alice v CLS Bank, rejections of software patents have been increased. Today, companies file patents according to quantity rather than quality. Moreover, there are many patent trolls who file patents just to eat litigation or licensing royalties. That\u2019s why today 90% patents are considered valueless. Because patent trolls don\u2019t make any products nor it lets anyone to use it until a company will not pay a high amount of money. The condition is legitimate to a big corporate but what if you (as a single person) want to make something (on you own) and your invention infringing one of the troll\u2019s patent. Neither you can pay huge money nor you are able to develop that innovative invention anymore. In the end, you have to end with paying or killing the innovation. There are several cases like that. You just can\u2019t make a simple mobile app because there will be 90% chance that your creation must infringe one of the trolls or major companies patents. Today, a mobile app\u2019s every aspect, however minor, are covered by patents. So, the probability of hurting your innovation is almost 1. So in my opinion, I think software patents hurt innovation but only for those entities that cannot pay a licensing fee. A person like you and me cannot afford to pay for licensing or face a litigation. But a big organization like Google, Apple can pay a licensing fee or even acquire those patents for helping innovation. ",

As a holder of an issued patent (USPTO 7130885), I have an added perspective on this issue... simply this:  I have no idea what my patent is about. I can describe in detail the \"invention\" that lead to my former company wanting to apply for the patent.  I can tell you about how it actually worked because we built it in production.  I can show you screenshots of its (now defunct) functionality.   But I can't for the life of me decipher what the lawyers wrote up (at a then cost of $15k per app) that led to the US Patent Office issuing said patent.  This is the primary flaw in Nathan Myhrvold's logic -- the false implication that patents are representative of the actual invention, that someone could actually purchase a patent and begin creating/using the invention. The idea of structured intellectual property protection is valid.  But the system that has developed around patents -- the obfuscation, the fear-mongering and the enforcement-through-bankrupting-litigation -- serves to entirely discredit the idea that patents can help innovation, let alone be turned into a \"marketplace\" that is used for anything more than extortion at scale. Oh, and I worked for a company that is a major investor in Intellectual Ventures:  Google.  (And they don't like that fact anymore than I do.)  ",

            "answer_text": "I have always found it strange that those who argue for a return to the pre-software patent days conveniently ignore the fact that when copyright was the sole form of legal protection available for software, it was commonplace for the innovations of small software companies to be flagrantly copied by larger companies (who shall remain nameless), who would then assimilate those innovations into their products without any compensation to, or opportunity for recourse by, the innovating startup. Any of us can run down a very long list of software companies in the 70s and 80s who were driven out of business after their pioneering efforts were copied in this way.  If those companies could have obtained patents (and I am referring to legitimate patents on true innovations), they would have stood a fighting chance to remain independent, or they could at least have demanded a fair price to be bought out before being assimilated. For those who would eliminate software patents entirely, I ask: in a software patent-free world, what would happen to a small software company who had developed a truly innovative piece of software, that was difficult to invent but easy to copy after the fact?  First mover advantage and other market-based mechanisms are small comfort to such a company, since in pure market competition the small company will, almost by definition, lose out to the bigger, established company that can throw its greater resources into producing a competing product in a month. Note that I am not arguing that every kind of software should be patentable, and I certainly am not defending the actions of every software patent owner.  But the case of innnovative software that was difficult and/or expensive to produce but easy to copy is quite common, and is precisely the case in which patent protection is most needed. ",

They give anyone who really invents something new a lever to the economic rewards inherent in their invention for a limited time. The tricky part is that in order to collect on an invention the inventor must publish the critical details of the invention.  This makes it available to anyone who is interested.  So the general public gets the details of any invention for use however it wants.  There is a delay in the public use as mentioned above.  Without the patent process there would be no reason for any inventor to enlighten anyone except his own internal employees and aides about the details of the invention. This clearly applies to software just as it does to any other form of invention.  The big problem with software is it is so complex that the notion of really  advancing the art is hard to determine.  That is a problem for the patent office and intellectual property attorneys to work out.  The principles still apply even if the application is messy. ",

            "answer_text": "After engaging in an interesting comment thread on Ari's answer, I realized this topic probably deserves an answer of my own for those who might not delve so deep into the debate. Here's my take on how software patents hurt innovation: After spending 14 years as both in-house and outside counsel, representing scores of technology startups, large corporations, VCs and angels, my personal belief (resorting to legal jargon) is that software patents are complete bullshit. There's a reason US courts resisted the patenting of software for decades, and most countries on earth don't permit it. As a matter of public policy, the modest amount of value creation they might incentivize at the margin in edge cases is outweighed by orders of magnitude in the value they destroy by (1) wasting billions every year on pointless litigation and (2) deterring others from innovating. In the real world, their value is almost 100% defensive, meaning they become an insurance policy of sorts, a \"nuclear deterrent\" to dissuade competitors or larger companies from suing on their own patents. As in all arms races, everybody loses (except patent litigators). Accordingly, their value for startups is minimal, consisting primarily of marketing/PR bragging rights. Most professional VCs understand this. As head of legal at eHarmony for three years, I was on the receiving end of FIVE patent suits, where in every instance the validity of the patent, its infringement, or both were in serious question. Every suit was brought by a \"non-practicing entity\" or NPE (colloquially called a \"patent troll\"), not a competitor, represented by a contingent fee plaintiffs' firm. Without divulging any privileged or confidential information, I can assure you their willingness to take those cases had nothing to do with the merits; it had everything to do with a broken system, defendants perceived to have \"deep pockets,\" and a pure financial shakedown. This kind of patent litigation is a tax on true innovators like eHarmony (and our co-defendants in these suits, including Yahoo!, Match.com, JDate, FriendFinder, PlentyOfFish, Classified Ventures, Date.com, AutoTrader, SinglesNet and others). Software is patentable in few places outside the US. India's parliament voted it down a few years ago. China offers weak IP protection on all fronts. In the EU it's extremely difficult to patent anything related to software, and even if you succeed, EU member countries' courts will often refuse to enforce them. Even here in the US, software patents didn't exist for the first 20+ years during which computer science blossomed as a new discipline. As a general counsel, I've had my outside patent lawyer -- who stood to gain financially from us doing more rather than less with our IP portfolio -- counsel me not to bother with software patents anywhere outside the US because of their minimal value and dubious enforceability. As one who counsels entrepreneurs every day, I would never start, join or invest in any software startup that relied on patent protection for any part of its business plan other than for its PR and investor relations value. Just one man's opinion, but it's informed by many years of relevant experience. ",

            "answer_text": "Probably hurt. Here's why: There are many reasons to think that software patents hurt innovation. Some of those are reflected in this thread. But what are the reasons to think that software patents help innovation?  The old standby, the idea that innovative activity needs and is helped by external incentives, is a popular notion, but it is one that has never been adequately supported. The evidence suggests, on balance, the contrary. That is the argument I make in my latest law review article, Intellectual Property and the Incentive Fallacy (available on SSRN: http://ssrn.com/abstract=1746343).  The truth is, it is very difficult to know as an empirical matter whether patents help or hurt innovation in a particular industry category. But what I can say with confidence is that it is fair to place the burden of proof on persons arguing that software patents help innovation. Absent some compelling showing that software patents spur innovation, the answer should be assumed to be that innovation is better achieved through an untampered-with free market. ",

            "answer_text": "Patents are simply a long term monopoly granted to you by the Federal Government on an inventive idea that you can either choose to defend or not defend. Patents are the foundation of many companies offerings. For example the iPhone has the \"Slide to Unlock\" feature on their device that they have the right to defend and ask that Android phones cease to copy. The \"value\" of that software patent is it differentiates the iPhone from the Android. So, I contend they are of value and if YOU have an inventive idea then I STRONGLY suggest that you work QUICKLY to file a provisional patent on your inventive idea so YOU can enjoy the rewards of licensing, selling, or providing your inventive idea to the open market. To see how to file a provisional patent application just go to Youtube and look up videos related to \"provisional patent video\" and get educated to see how easy it is. ",

            "answer_text": "Short answer - no. Explanation: I often feel like patents have the potential to limit, or slow down innovation. Some entrepreneurs get very emotionally attached to their patents and often hesitate to move on with even better ideas because of this. The truth in 99% of cases is that an idea is worthless - it is all in the execution - so if you know you can build and sell a product better than anyone else, there is no use in patenting your concept. However, and because of what I just explained above, patents can also be used in a very business-savvy way. Let me explain - some ideas are truly genius, they have mass appeal and could potentially disrupt one of the large corporations (Google, Amazon, Apple etc.) In those cases (they are rare), it can be a smart move to patent the product/technology and then to reach a licensing deal with one of the giants. Sit back, relax, and pocket the cash. But like I said - ideas like this are rare! The patenting process is long, tedious and costly, so consider all its aspects before embarking on this journey! This answer was originally posted somewhere else but I thought you would find it beneficial. Hope it helps! ",

Also, try competing with Microsoft or Facebook with no patents - I doubt it would work very well. Also, you have an idea and want to sell it, no one would pay for it, if you do not have a patent. In contrast without the patent no one finds out about the idea, because what\u2019s the point - the idea will just be stolen anyways? Additionally, software is not different than other areas of technology, good patent protection is likely to be helpful in generating innovation. As an aside, for those that think of software as abstract ideas, trying running your computer without software. For that matter, try removing the software from your car, airplanes, tanks, etc. and see how well they perform by comparison. ",

            "answer_text": "I think the fundamental irony of the argument that patents inhibit innovation is the lack of faith the proponents of this view seem to have in the rest of us to innovate.  As @anon points out, the fact that there is a patent does not mean that we cannot devise new innovative solutions to problems that do not violate patent rights.  Consider it a challenge.  Surely this will result in more true innovation as opposed to rehashing of something that someone has already invented?   I should note that I am aware of a rather problematic shortcoming of my own argument.  The problem that would be innovators frequently seem to have is not that they are incapable of innovating but that they are just unaware of the need to innovate away from an existing patent and so they end up violating it.   I strongly suspect that just as we need a better app discovery process so do we need a better patent discovery process. The scenario whereby an inventor files a patent, which is valid because at the time of filing there is no prior art and it is not obvious, but which addresses an area which in time demands innovation, in which people duly innovate unwittingly violate existing rights because the solution which was not obvious then is now an obvious solution, is disturbingly common.

            "answer_text": "I agree with Robert Plotkin that those against software patents often overlook the nuances of how best to protect software intellectual property. Patent protection gives another dimension to protection that is not available through copyright alone and by and large favours smaller players. Another point that is missing here is that patents offer a strong incentive to collaborate. The trend today is towards open and distributed innovation and it is rare that one company has the resources to create a new product from scratch without needing to incorporate technology from outside.  Patents make it easier to do this, both by providing a publicly available source of available inventions and also by being a currency for technology acquisition through licensing and cross licensing. Microsoft identified this trend and their patent strategy is well documented in Marshall Phelp's book.  Therefore, in my view, software patents are an incentive to innovation. ",

This does not necessarily mean a guaranteed profitable venture, but rather, provides a higher chance of recouping the investment placed into developing the newfound innovative software solutions.Providing an avenue to protect a software based idea for a period of 20 years, give or take, depending on when the patent was filed. The patent then expires, which makes the protected concepts and ideas free for public use after that period of time.In general, software patents help to convince companies to put forth the effort to develop and innovate newfound solutions that they normally would not bother to develop because of current methods that may not be the most ideal or efficient.

This happens more often in the case of software patents as a simple improvement in software could end being used in many different industries. Similar problem is faced with business method patents. Therefore, the US courts have restricted the grant of software patents. Now inventors need to restrict their invention to a specific type of computing machine, for example, a handheld device, a car, a robot.  Patent offices around the world still grant software patents, just that their scope has been restricted. This is a win-win for everyone. ",

That is why most software patents could not resist a court challenge based on establishing prior art and obviousness.Another problem is that the patent system favors deep pockets, not innovation.
