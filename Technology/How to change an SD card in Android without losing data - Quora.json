            "answer_text": "If you have a laptop or computer, just copy and paste everything from your old micro SD card to the desktop\u2026 then insert the new card into the phone and then copy all of the old data from the computer back into the card\u2026 the time it takes to do this depends on how fast your micro SD card write speed is. If you have a card reader, I suggest you use that instead because it's faster than from the smartphone.. but if you don't have one, just put the card into the phone and just plug the phone into the PC. If you don't have a laptop or desktop PC, if you have enough space on the smartphone, just copy your data to the internal storage of the phone and then move the data into the new micro SD card.. you will need to use a \u201cfile manager\u201d app to do that (if you don't have that app, just download one from the app store). If you do not have enough internal storage space for that, then I suggest you get an OTG storage drive or adapter which you can plug into the USB C port of the phone. ",

            "answer_text": "First thing is the data like photos, videos, audios etc will not delete and will remain in SD card when you remove. It's safe Second thing is the phone data or the data that is or that can be associated with phone like apps data etc it will remain in device when you will remove the card because the phone stores data in sd card in only case when you select sd card or exti storage as phone storage so before removing your sd card just select the phone.storage as.main storage and all the data will remain in the.device. And if you select sd cars as primary storage in phone the apps do not install in the card, all apps install in phone storage always whether you select or not card storage as primary so the apps will also remain in the device.
