            "answer_text": "No i dont think OnePlus Nord 12GB ram is worth the price because it is priced very high at 29,999. And at that price you can get better processor and faster charging speed with either realme x3. But if storage or ram is more important to you and if you prefer OxygenOS instead of ColourOS then you may buy OnePlus Nord Hope you like \ud83d\ude0a ",
