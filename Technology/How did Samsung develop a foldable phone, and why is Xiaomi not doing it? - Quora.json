            "answer_text": "Thank you for A2A. Just a small correction to your question, Xiaomi has actually made a folding phone but it is still under prototype phase. The big difference is that Samsung actually has a phone that is foldable and available to purchase. To answer your question, why is Samsung ahead of other companies when it comes to folding phones? The answer is Samsung itself, you see Samsung is an absolute behemoth of a company. They have their arms spread in many businesses one of which is mobile components. Many companies like Apple, Oneplus, Xiaomi and others source various components from Samsung and that includes screens, camera modules and others. Samsung because it already manufacturers screens invested in R&D and created first prototype of folding screens years ago. As folding screen is a new technology and Samsung has a first mover advantage because it also manufactures them why would they source their new technology to their competitors? That's the only reason we aren't seeing alot of folding phone's yet because Samsung has a monopoly with the most important part of the folding phone and that is the SCREEN! ",

            "answer_text": "Samsung in comparatively a very big company. Xiaomi doesn't have that huge amount of money to put in research and development of screens. Alao Samsung has been a display manufacturer for years now and is seen as Gold Standard for displays. Xiaomi clearly cannot catch up to it. Also Xiaomi juat has to wait a couple of years till the technology becomes mainstream and then they can put it in their phones. ",
