            "answer_text": "The tuners inside the vcr will not work anymore as analog cable and tv has been discontinued and gone, the timer only works with the tuner which a vcr has and when you program the timing and the channel the tuner would automatically change to it but as analog cable is gone it will not work anymore and your only best try is to get a rca to rf connection device, then when you wanna record the show firstly go into the vcr menu, then go on timer program, then set the clock and date, then set the time and date you wanna record and for channel set 3. Then the day you record it just leave the tv channel on and insert a blank tape with enough recording time, then it will do its job and record the show! ",

            "answer_text": "How about reading the manual. Note that as there are no analog broadcasts you need to record from an eternal source like a set-top box. Set it to the proper channel and leave on and record from the source. If you need to record from several channels you need to program the set-top box also (if it can be programmed). There is a reason why people do not use VCRs anymore. ",
