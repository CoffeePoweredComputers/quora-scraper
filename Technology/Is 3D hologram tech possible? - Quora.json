            "answer_text": "As much as we\u2019d like to believe that all the holographic projections in the Marvel superhero movies, live concerts & branded marketing shows are real, they are in fact, not. No matter how realistic & believable they may seem, the holograms we witness are, for the large part, just digitally manipulated virtual graphics effects. For starters, probably the most famous example will be the Tupac hologram on stage at Coachella 2012. As many in the audience as it got excited, the hologram was in fact, just a two-dimensional image projection using what is termed by scientists as the Pepper\u2019s Ghost effect. Pepper\u2019s Ghost effect is a well-known & widely used 19th-century optical illusion, which magicians often used to startle their audience. Unlike traditional photography, the Holographic tech is the presentation of a three-dimensional object in space, or at least, gives the viewers the impression of watching a three-dimensional object. Various light manipulation techniques & digital lasers are used to create an aptly formed holographic effect. Pepper\u2019s Ghost effect, which we discussed just a few lines before, is one of the most widely & successfully used 3D Holographic technologies in the modern world. From Coachella 2012 to the appearance of \u2018ghosts\u2019 at haunted mansions & spooky houses, it\u2019s been used by people & industries of all kinds to give guests a real-life holographic experience.  Another technology that is used to present holographic projections is called the Holographic Smokescreen. It is similar in implementation & procedure to the Pepper\u2019s Ghost hologram effect, with, however, one significant difference. The holographic projections made from the Holographic Smokescreen are somewhat translucent in nature, as compared to the solid projections made by Pepper\u2019s Ghost effect. This helps them carry along important information in the text or through images. Holographic Nets, which consist of a transparent curtain of LED lights arranged in a specific manner to create a holographic projection, is also a widely used holographic technology. It\u2019s used in a lot of branded holographic projections & in world sports livecasting. 3D Hologram fans, a new Holographic technology that consists of a fan rotating at high speed to project holographic visuals in the air, is another widely used & successfully implemented branded holographic technology. It makes an appearance in branded experiential events, birthday celebrations, wedding parties & lots of other events.

            "answer_text": "In a normal camera, light reflected off a subject is passed though a lens to focus the light onto the sensor or film surface. The light, containing all the spectrum's frequencies records each photon in the direction it came in through the lens. When you see the resultant image, the light you use to see the image reflects that single direction back to your eye, so no matter what direction or angle the image is seen at, it will always appear the same, or 2D. A Hologram uses diffused laser light, split into two beams to illuminate the object at different angles. Laser light is essentially a single frequency of light, or coherent light. It is reflected back onto the sensor or film but not through a lens. The sensor/film sees the reflected light from all angles off the object. However the reflected laser light from multiple angles off the object interfere with each other, creating a moire effect on the film/sensor. It is not an image the eye can recognize, but an near infinite series of non concentric circles. Now if you create a transparency or picture with that laser image and project a diffused laser through it/off it, you will see a 3D image, because your two eyes see slightly different angles of light passing through the transparency or reflected off the image. If you move your head the image will seem to be seen from different angles. That is the essence of a Hologram. There is more to it than that. How Holograms Work Ignore the video on the first page, it will only confuse you. ",
