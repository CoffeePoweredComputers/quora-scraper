            "answer_text": "Here is one type of vehicle I operated in the Army. To get in the driver\u2019s hatch, I crawl up onto the front deck, then down into the hatch. The 578 even has a handy little step on the front.  If I was getting in the turret, I used the step to get on the deck and then the side door to get in.  It\u2019s similar with tanks. You climb up onto the front armor. If you\u2019re the driver, you squeeze into the driver\u2019s hatch.  If you\u2019re the gunner, loader or TC, you climb further up onto the turret and step down into the hatches on top of the turret.  While climbing up, don\u2019t smack your shins on the front armor, trust me, it hurts like hell and will leave a lump on your shin for a week. APCs are a little easier. You open the back door or lower the ramp and step in.   The drivers on APCs occasionally have to climb up the front to get in the hatch, or they can enter the rear door and get in from inside the track. The same with SP artillery.  Armored wheeled vehicle often have regular doors, but heavily armored.  ",

            "answer_text": "There are hatches on top of the turret and above the drivers seat. The M4 Sherman tank had a position beside the driver called the bow gunner and he had a hatch. Hatches can be a bit tight for big men, especially when they are wearing winter clothing, NBC suits or body armor. I was a weight lifter so I had a 48\u2033 chest. My M9 pistol and gas mask snagged on the hatch if worn around my chest I carried my pistol in my pants pocket, with a lanyard and hung the mask by my station when I was in my M901 anti armor APC. ",
