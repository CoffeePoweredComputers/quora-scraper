            "answer_text": "We cannot know that much but still something we can. The way how it works is that we capture the star\u2019s light which comes through the exoplanet\u2019s atmosphere. We then analyze the spectrum of this light. Since every element, gases, etc. absorbs and reflects different kind of colours, from that spectrum we can figure out which elements are present in that planets atmosphere. From the elements and the proportion of them we can draw conclusions about some characteristics of the that particular planet. ",
