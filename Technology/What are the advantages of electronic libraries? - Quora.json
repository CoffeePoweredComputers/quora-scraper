            "answer_text": "Early Modern and modern libraries were built around the codex  The codex is a wonderful bit of technology. It\u2019s an incredibly tough, reliable and accessible tool for accessing information. Because the codex is an analog form, one tool that was built into the codex is the index. Prior to computers, and index was assembled by an experience,detail oriented person who went through the book and identified each section that was of interest and listed them in alphabetical order. That took a lot of time and a lot of expertise. When a codex is digitized, a computer can go through and identify every single time a word shows up. With a little bit of work, stop-words like \u2018the\u2019 or \u2018and\u2019 can be eliminated and the result can be served up to the user so that the user is the one who is using judgement to determine what is important. The killer technology in electronic libraries is keyword search. It causes it\u2019s own set of problems, but the removal of the intermediary of the indexer is the core advantage of electronic libraries. ",

            "answer_text": "It would be a boon to the shut-in, those in hospital or care facility, those who live in often cut-off settlements (e.g those in rural Alaska), and those too busy or far away to get to a local library. If the library were truly international, it would be of history-changing importance as it would open the combined knowledge of human beings to everyone on the planet even in lands without free libraries or those who try to censor knowledge. Log on and download to your device any book you wanted to.(This answer assumes you mean that the holdings of the library were in electronic form, not just the search engine of the library.) ",
