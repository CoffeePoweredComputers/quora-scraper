            "answer_text": "there have been a few blue-tooth exploits in the past. Blue-tooth is definitely a vulnerability if you don\u2019t use it properly. Make sure you reduce it\u2019s usage as much as possible and avoid having your device visible all the time. From my understanding most smart-watches and other blue-tooth devices have an authentication feature. Make good use of this feature. Also I\u2019m pretty sure most data sent over blue-tooth is encrypted. I also imagine security and encryption improve with the latest blue-tooth technologies. The latest now is Blue-tooth 5.0 so having the latest decreases risk. ",

            "answer_text": "It could. They\u2019re bluetooth devices that have somewhat privileged access to the phone they\u2019re paired with. It\u2019s another entry point to potentially compromise the phone if that\u2019s an attacker\u2019s goal. Not having a smart watch is more secure than having one. However, in the grand scheme of things it is a negligible concern. I\u2019ve had my LG Urbane smartwatch for a long time now. It hasn\u2019t resulted in a compromise of my phone yet (as far as I know anyway). ",
