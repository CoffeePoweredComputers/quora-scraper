            "answer_text": "No. Whenever were talking computer performance, there are a bunch of ways to approach the problem. Peak performance, sustained performance, single threaded performance, multi threaded performance, and of course all of this is impacted by the task in question. As it stands though, a phone cannot hope to beat a PC in any category save for a possible exception of peak single threaded performance in extremely specific usage scenario\u2019s. In every other usage instance, the difference in cooling ensures the PC wins out. Phones can achieve their maximum performance for maybe a minute if your lucky. Usually they will top out at around 70\u201380% of their theoretical maximum for a few minutes, and then keep throttling down until they final hit a thermal equilibrium point. Even the handful of actively cooled phones just do not have the ability to sustain this, because there isn\u2019t enough thermal mass to allow a fast enough heat transfer. I mean, I have a stock Ryzen 2400G CPU cooler on my PC. Aluminum fins, fan, and the copper puck in the center weight about as my phone does all together. It supports over four times the TDP, and permits continuous operation at the CPU\u2019s design limits. Heat is a cold hearted bitch, but it gives us the performance reality of the matter. ",

            "answer_text": "Q: Are phones more powerful than PC? A: Yes Think about it this way:The Apple Silicon A14 SoC (CPU/GPU) feature in the iPhone 12 delivers 11 TeraFlopsThe fastest supercomputer in the world in 2001 was the ASCI White, which only delivered 12 TeraFlopsSP Power3 375 MHz, IBM Lawrence Livermore National LaboratoryThat means that the iPhone 12 is faster than all the supercomputers built before June 2001Let that sink in for a while",

You can see lots of apps are available on phones but when we need perfect result and user friendly and professional works we have to work on the computer. ",
