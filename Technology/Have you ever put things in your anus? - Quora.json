And as of this year, I\u2019m also double anal only, which means my two boyfriends always fuck my ass together at the same time. That happens at least daily, often more, since we\u2019re all working from home all the time. When I don\u2019t have cock in my ass, I often have a big dildo or two up my ass several times a day for an hour or more at a time\u2014sometimes just sitting with them in me, sometimes actively masturbating if I have the time, and I wear a large butt plug if my ass is otherwise unoccupied while at home, or a smaller one if I\u2019m out.
