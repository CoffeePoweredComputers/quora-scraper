            "answer_text": "That happens all the time to me. And I am supremely relaxed about it. The thing to keep in mind is that: having an idea is not unusual; thousands, maybe millions of people will have the same idea;the race to the patent office may be in vain, as only 3% of all patented things actually turn into marketed products;even if you are among those 3%, you are most likely going to be a large company with its own marketing and manufacturing capabilities;and you\u2019ll have paid through the nose to get that product to that stage. We are talking a good half million to twenty million Dollars if it\u2019s really supposed to be something.So, before you spend your life savings on a doohickie\u2019s patenting process and set up a micro factory in your garage, think twice whether you really can pull this off.
