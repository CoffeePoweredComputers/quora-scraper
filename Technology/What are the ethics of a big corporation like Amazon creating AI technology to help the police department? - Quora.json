            "answer_text": "Amazon typically doesn\u2019t start by creating a technology for others. What does happen though is that Amazon creates new technologies that it uses - then they make it available to others so they can use it, and Amazon can make additional revenue. I think what you are asking about is AI + facial recognition, and that is quite useful for a broad range of purposes. As for licensing them to the police, there isn\u2019t any ethical problem at all. Ultimately, warrants are authorized by humans. The AI + facial recognition software is going to be far from perfect, but what it effectively does is no more unethical than using a search engine. Depending on what the parameters are, it will find matches and near matches. What follows that is 100% up to human decision. An ethical problem would arise if this AI + facial recognition were being used without any human authorization, and your computer system was issuing arrest warrants on its own. Otherwise, the ethical issue I see are those that complain about it using fallacious and deceptive reasoning for unethical purposes. ",
