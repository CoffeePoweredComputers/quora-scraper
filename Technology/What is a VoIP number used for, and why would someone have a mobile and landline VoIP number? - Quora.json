            "answer_text": "Most people don\u2019t have premise or office based phones run by their cell phone company. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve seen any call queues or auto attendants hosted by a cell phone company. I get why people want everything to run on their cell but having experience dealing with my own cell phone company, do you really want them handling your business critical communications? VoIP systems are generally a replacement for the incredibly expensive telephone company or the extremely expensive and often dated premise based PBX boxes. VoIP is a cloud service and everyone loves the cloud right? Imagine this use case. You get an emergency call forwarded to your cell phone late at night because you\u2019re not in your office and you need to take emergency calls. This call was forwarded from your office so your customer does not have your personal cell phone number yet. But you\u2019ve got to call him back! Now it\u2019s Saturday at 2am and your customer has something that he thinks is really important and needs to wake you up in the middle of the night on the weekend. YOU don\u2019t think it\u2019s that important though. You didn\u2019t answer the main number he had but he remembers that one time you called him back\u2026.. I\u2019ve had something similar happen to me so I know it happens. With VoIP you can load up an app on your cell phone and make calls using the company number and company name never exposing your lazy Sunday sleep-ins to disturbances by customers short circuiting your system. So VoIP is not only for landlines and has lots of uses and doesn\u2019t tie you into a $50K PBX box that no one is going to know how to run in 5 years. ",
