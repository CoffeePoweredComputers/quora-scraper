            "answer_text": "The technology is everywhere. Just take a look around and think about it. Actually, take a look at your pocket or at this screen, you\u2019re looking at right now. Technology has brought many great things to us! Most of the times, technology helps us things quicker and easier. Smartphones, tablets, personal computers, video games and so on\u2026 our life is surrounded by technology and our children are also using it at home, at school, everywhere. Our children will learn many things we have not even dream about it right now. We know this is an important positive impact of technology. But there are some negative impacts from technology overuse too, having serious consequences into our children\u2019s life. To get the best of digital devices, parents have to consider its downsides and prevent them. We sorted five negative impacts of technology you have to pay attention: 1. Relationships and Social Skills Issues Kids are using mobile devices more and more, and they can become addicted to this, not spending enough time with their family and/or friends. They are more likely to be virtually connected with friends, sharing photos and texting online than actually meeting them in person. The new generation is growing up playing games online, accessing websites (sometimes harmful websites), chatting online on Facebook, sharing photos on Instagram and Snapchat and so on. It doesn\u2019t mean that spending time online is a bad thing, but spending too much time online can really weaken the bond between the parents and the child, and also private the child to improve several social skills. 2. Health Problems The overuse of mobile devices can be harmful to children\u2019s health. The more they use mobile devices, the less physical activities they do. The problem is that playing games online is combined with snacking, substituting the balanced alimentation. As children spend more time in front of those screens, most of the time in the couch, less time they spend outside playing, running and burning off calories. Over time, those habits can lead to a significant weight gain. To prevent it from becoming a habit, parents can talk with their children about parental controls and use ScreenGuide App to balance screen time. Remember: it's important to balance the quality and quantity of the time they spend on digital devices. Teach your children that there is time for everything, even to play games online. But it\u2019s also important to balance it, otherwise many problems come along. Check out tips to have \"The Tech Talk\" with your children here. 3. Browsing Online Can Be Dangerous While browsing online we often face harmful things such as phishing, virus and other dangers disguised as advertising. Most of the adults know it and can easily avoid them, but what about our children? Sometimes even the advert can be harmless to them. A study from 2005 says that 70% of teens aged between 15-17 have accidentally stumbled across pornography online. What about nowadays? The children can go online and search for anything. But with the right monitoring, they will not access dangers websites, avoiding to meet dangerous people. Keep in mind that you can always guide your children to avoid those dangers. One way to help children to be safe online is to use parental controls and Internet filtering tools to select the content they are able to access or even block browsers for as long as you consider it is appropriated. 4. Mobile Device Overuse Reduce Sleep Quality According to the article \u201cKids Are Being Kept Awake by Their Phones Even When They\u2019re Not Using Them\u201d over 72% of all children have at least one device in their bedroom. JAMA Pediatrics published a study with the big question: Is there an association between screen-based media device access or use in the sleep environment, and sleep quantity and quality?. Well, they found out that there is a strong and consistent evidence of a link between mobile devices overuse and reduced sleep quality. Our children are sleeping less than they should, but what\u2019s the matter with it? A lack of sleep can have serious consequences on our brain. During the sleep, the brain does some \u201chousekeeping\u201d tasks, clearing things that aren\u2019t important and restoring the nerves networks to wake up again ready for a brand new day. But sleeping less means that we\u2019re depriving our brain of its essential needs and we will struggle on our activities during the day. To help your children to get a better sleep, you can talk to them about the dangers around it. Also, work on reducing the screen time balancing it with ScreenGuide Parental Control App. A balanced screen time can improve children\u2019s sleep quality. Check out 3 tips for your children to have a better night of sleep! 5. Is Your Smartphone Affecting Your Relationship With Your Kids? Take a time to think about it, have you checked your phone for notifications how many times? How many times did you open WhatsApp, WeChat, Facebook, or Instagram when you\u2019re with your children? Well, most of the people we know, do this many times, after all, mobile devices are great to overcome boredom. But checking out mobile devices for notifications when we\u2019re around children has its downsides. According to a study published by University of Michigan Health System, \u201cParents\u2019 use of mobile technology around young children may be causing internal tension, conflicts and negative interactionswith their kids\u201d. Children see, children do. Dr. Jenny Radesky, says that children \u201c\u2026learn by watching us how to have a conversation, how to read other people\u2019s facial expressions. And if that\u2019s not happening, children are missing out on important development milestones.\u201d. Some of the plans of making family time even better are to get the time to reconnect with children. UseScreenGuide Parental Control Appto balance your child\u2019s screen time and spend more offline time with them. Take the time to be with them, and do the stressful tasks later, when you\u2019re not with your children. Fir more details ScreenGuide ",

            "answer_text": "Advantages Advances in technology allow children to have Internet access through computers and cell phones. Even if a parent is diligent in limiting a child's time on those devices, TV, iPods, MP3s, DVD players and video games are waiting in the wings, vying for your child\u2019s attention. Parents, teachers and health workers are questioning the physical effects that technology has on children\u2019s lives. Disadvantages Even though children might be engaging their mind on a computer, the active participation of their body is limited. Some kids are prone toward obesity because of a combination of technology activity and physical inactivity. According to the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, 10.4 percent of preschool children and 19.6 percent of children ages 6 through 11 are obese. Some kids act out inappropriately physically, especially when watching violent games on TV. According to Craig Anderson of the American Psychological Association, \u201cHigh levels of violent video game exposure have been linked to delinquency, fighting at school and during free play periods, and violent criminal behavior.\u201d Social Skills Not only does technology have the potential to turn children into couch potatoes, it can inhibit developing social skills, too. According to a study conducted by the Kaiser Family Foundation in 2010, multitasking has enabled today\u2019s youth to pack a total of 10 hours and 45 minutes worth of media content into the average 7 1/2 hours spent engaging with media devices. While kids growing up before the 1950s were encouraged to get outside and play with friends, children spending 7 1/2 hours a day on media-driven devices lack outside contact with peers, especially if they are already shy. Occupational therapist Cris Rowan states in the article, \u201cThe Impact of Technology on Child Sensory and Motor Development,\u201d that \u201cAs little children develop and form their identity, they often are incapable of discerning whether they are the 'killing machine' seen on TV and in video games, or just a shy and lonely little kid in need of a friend.\" Healthy Technology Habits Developing a balance between technology use and physical exercise is an important habit from the time a child starts walking. According to the American Academy of Pediatrics in the article, \u201cMedia Education: What Parents Can Do,\u201d the best role model you can provide your child is yourself. Make a habit of turning the TV off when eating dinner, eliminating computer use after a certain time each day, limiting the daily time spent video gaming and engage in some form of physical exercise together. Many parents find that signing up their child for a gymnastics class or recreational soccer team helps him take a break from the media devices available at his fingertips and also develop friendships with other kids. Show your child it\u2019s OK to disengage from technology. Using Technology to Help Exercise Technology is here to stay unless you want to move your family to a cave. A healthy balance of technology with physical activity can be a bonus. Online videos provide instructions for just about any sport a child would want to participate in. Kids can watch the fundamentals of basketball and then go out and shoot hoops. Wii offers active video game participation in sports such as bowling, soccer and dance. Perhaps there\u2019s no problem getting your child to exercise, but he won\u2019t bike down the block without his favorite tunes playing. Maybe his passion is running and Google Maps offers him treadmill routes through exotic locations. Discover ways to match the best of both worlds. ",

            "answer_text": "Only in the fact that it gives kids more options. Options for good or bad is mostly based on the ideas stuck in their heads. For the most part, it affected parents the most. Made them much more whinny. I\u2019d even go so far as to say weaker and lazier too. For some unknown reason, I often hear parents tell others that they ONLY let their kid(s) do this or that or something else involving technology and they\u2019re in bed WHEN I say so. They NEVER disobey me/us or do anything unacceptable. I\u2019m sure by now most have heard this or something similar. Acting like they\u2019re the greatest parents of the all time in trying to do these things!! I definitely call \u201cGreat Buckets of BS\u201d. Often right to their faces. Of course, the part they leave out is that when they\u2019re asleep, the kids are doing whatever they want with that technology. Chances are, they know EXATCLY how already. Yeah, such great kids and skills ya got there!! \u201cBut the technology has a child lock and/or parental controls\u201d. Sure!! Let\u2019s go with that!! Them kids have friends, Google, and YouTube!! Your locks/controls stood zero chance. Kids have this funny tendancy to learn especially when they want something. Has it made kids lazier, dumber, or somehow \u201crotten\u201d? Not entirely. That depends on the kids and how well they know what consequences they\u2019re facing. By the same token, has it improved them or made them smarter? Same thing. It depends on the kids. ",

            "answer_text": "Unfortunately, I have been at the apex of the changes in education since 1987 and I have been a part of the 30 year failed experiment in e-learning. I even have a YouTube video that talks frankly about the failures of the industry. So, the US is now 42nd in the world in education behind Latvia and Bulgaria despite spending 3x-5x more than other countries per kid on education. It is sickening. As to how kids are different now, it is making them less social and more dependent on access to information retrieval rather than actually having to learning anything. Why memorize the date that the War of 1812 started if you can simply look it up on Google. Also, have you been out to dinner and seen how a table of 28 year olds interact? If you were to confiscate their phones, not only would they not be able to look anything up or post anything, but they likely would have no idea what to talk about. It is terrible. ",

They are exposed to cyberbullying, they can say mean and hurtful things and never be able to take them back\u2026 so, yeah. They also stay holed up in their room, chatting away with their next-door friends\u2026 on their mobile device. When did walking hurt anybody? So, yeah, technology is changing kids\u2026 for better or for worse. ",

They are learning new things faster as they are getting more exposure. Due to tech stuff children are stuck indoors and they don't carry any intrest outdoors which in turn genrates introverts, less social activities. But on a brighter side they are learning things at an early stage. So we can say that there should be a proper balance which should be provided by their parents for their overall growth. ",

Too many to discuss due to the vagueness of the question, but my two main observations from my family are; First the good The level of day to day contact now everyone has a phone. One example is one of my nieces chats on her phone to her grandpa every morning whilst they drive through different towns to their work and school. It results in a close and supportive relationship that's great for both. Now the bad. Lack of imagination. Kids are never bored now they always have a device to entertain them. This means they never know the joy of daydreaming, or starting conversations with new people. I think we'd have a lot less stress in teens if there was more time for them to just sit and think and be. ",
