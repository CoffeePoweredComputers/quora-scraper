            "answer_text": "Well, before the internet also pretty much means \u201cbefore cell phones\u201d, and it\u2019s hard to tease out the effects of one vs. the other. But a few thoughts on it\u2026 Shopping generally meant \u201cgoing to the store and looking at merchandise\u201d instead of looking it up online. Maybe you looked it up in a paper catalog, like the Sears catalog, and made a phone call to order it.Comparison shopping \u2014 magazines regularly ran issues that were pretty much nothing but product comparisons and \u201cnew products\u201d. If you were into photography, for instance, Popular Photography typically had one \u201cnew cameras and equipment!\u201d issue and one \u201cbuyer\u2019s guide\u201d issue per year. Same for cars and \u201cCar and Driver\u201d or \u201cRoad and Track\u201d.Magazines and newspapers! When I lived in South Florida, I subscribed to two newspapers. The Miami Herald was the morning paper and the Fort Lauderdale Sun-Sentinel was the afternoon paper. Yes, there were papers with different publishing schedules that got later news. (This was in the 1990s, by the way). You could go to a newsstand and there were dozens of magazines, everything from general interest to literary to special interest.News \u2014 you got news through broadcast TV, with a limited number of outlets. Even after cable and CNN, if you were interested in a particular story you\u2019d have to tune in and wait for them to get around to it. Before cable, it was even worse. Short of a huge event, there was the news at 6pm then the news at 11. You might be able to get more off the radio in between. Ah, the teasers with the classic line \u201cfilm at 11!\u201d when they\u2019d cut in briefly around commercials to say what was going to be on the news that night!Life before email/Instagram/Facebook \u2014 if you wanted to communicate with somebody, you had to pick up the phone and call them. If they were home and not busy, they had to put down what they were doing and talk to you. No grabbing Facebook messages as you flip back and forth between that \u201cdiscussion\u201d and three other things.Music \u2014 If you wanted music, you either took what was on the radio or bought your own. And everything you had was physical media. Left your cassettes in the car and they melted? Buy (or record) new ones. Your record got scratched? Buy a new one.Sex \u2014 It\u2019s amazing to look back and see how accessibility to porn has driven technology over the last 50 years. 900 numbers? Phone sex lines. Cable TV? People wanted to see tits on HBO. VCRs? People wanted to watch porn in their own homes. Video cameras? People wanted to make their own porn. Before the Internet, if you wanted porn you had to go to an \u201cadult\u201d store, usually in a sketchy part of town, and buy it. If you lived in a small town (or in the wrong part of the country) you were pretty much out of luck altogether.You could, quite literally, write a book about this and I\u2019m sure people have. But hopefully that gives you a bit of food for thought. ",

            "answer_text": "Well, when you say before the Internet, before what time of the Internet exactly? Before the time of the Internet when people used to look up when they were outside- and would see other people looking up too, instead of down at their screens? Before the time when Facebook/Instagram/etc. had little to no advertisements, and was a platform mainly used to view and express sentiments with people online? When most parents pushed their kids to play outside in a world without Wi-Fi or unlimited data plans, instead of handing them a smartphone to push off the responsibility of sating their curiosity of the world? Before the time of the Internet, when students had no choice but to interact with each other in class, since teachers used to confiscate phones at the mere sight of them? Before the time of the Internet when we would make eye contact and talk with the waiter/cashier/barista, instead of to the waiter/cashier/barista while we look down at a screen, because we\u2019re wondering if anyone wants our attention? Before the time when we used to look into the eyes of our date during a moment of sharing our vulnerabilities and connecting through that moment, instead of pressing the home button to check the time on the screen, a habit we acquired when we felt feelings of uncomfortability? A habit that may make you seem disinterested and cold, instead of nervous. Before the time when the first proclamations of love were shown through a gut-wrenching and passionate kiss- the memory of that experience kept in the most private corners of only those two minds, rather than the screenshot of an emoticon, sent through one touch of a screen, that could be shared by anyone else through another touch of a screen? Or are you talking about before the time of the ENTIRE existence of the Internet, when children, students, parents, people all ALIKE had no choice, but to push through awkward first encounters, to be delighted to have made a new friend or share a funny/disappointing/intense/scary/exciting/invigorating/present/HUMAN experience? Before the introduction of the internet, there were still opportunities to connect. To share. To learn. People still endured bouts of loneliness, experienced excitement, were prisoners of obsessive thoughts and worries. People still had distractions. The introduction of the Internet merely gave us\u2026 more opportunities. more choices. more distractions. So, how was life before the Internet? Life was the same. Is the same. Life will continue to be about living and how we choose to go about living. The one thing that we\u2019ve always had and always will have with or without the Internet, is the power to choose how we want to live our lives. We just live in a time where more people spend time on distractions, rather than opportunities. ",
