            "answer_text": "What\u2019s it like to only use Google products and services? It\u2019s quite amazing, actually. Here\u2019s why. Let me start off by reiterating one of their slogans. One Account. All of Google. I use Google products because they are convenient. I use Google Docs, Google Drive (1 TB of storage), Google Play Music, YouTube (+YouTube Red), Gmail, Google Calendar, Android, Google Keep, occasionally YouTube TV, I\u2019m going to start using Google Fi, I currently use Google Voice in conjunction with my T-Mobile plan, etc. It\u2019s so convenient to simply log into one account and have your world and all of your work at your fingertips, instead of thinking: \u201cOh, right! I have these documents on OneDrive, my calendar on Google Drive, my favorites and bookmarks on Chrome, etc.\u201d I\u2019m not saying people only have to stick to one product, in fact the phrase usually is \u201cdon\u2019t put all of your eggs in one basket.\u201d Here\u2019s the thing, though. Google has dominated the market and leads the cloud. A very growing and important part of the tech industry, and life in general. 92% of the world\u2019s data was created in the last two years alone and Google is really resourceful. This is why I trust Google with my data, if anyone. This is what they do. Whereas with Microsoft, it\u2019s not really what they focus on, they\u2019re more about software and Enterprise software at that. With Google, they do just about everything Microsoft Word, Excel and PowerPoint can do, but they do it in the cloud and remove the extra features that \u201cmost people\u201d don\u2019t use. Now, if you need them, by all means, Microsoft is here for that. Google\u2019s focus is bringing the most useful but also used features to the cloud \u2014 and no one can touch them on that. Dropbox only offers 1 TB of storage and if someone shares a folder or file with you, it counts against your storage too. I can purchase up to 20 TB of storage on my personal account without paying for a \u201cbusiness\u201d I don\u2019t even have on Dropbox. Laughable. When it comes to productivity and cloud with convenience, Google is the one I go to, trust and use. I love all of their products. One thing I will say? I love Microsoft\u2019s design of Word better. Google has always been about usefulness, not so much about the UI of their services, but they\u2019re slowly changing that, as I see. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I love Microsoft services and do work better when the UI speaks to me. But Google is just so convenient, I find myself rarely ever using anything outside of what Google offers.  Useful sources I like (I also give my thoughts to the two Quora questions below): What I learned using only Google productsWhy I Love Google so much?Should Google be trusted to respect our privacy?",

            "answer_text": "Pretty damn nice, actually. I\u2019ve gone for weeks at a time with nothing but my Chromebook and my Nexus 5x. Easily. Happily. I can\u2019t claim to be a 100% Google ONLY user\u2026 because I professionally support Windows machines, MacOS machines, IOS, Linux\u2026 Lots of things. Also, I\u2019m a gamer. A top-end Windows desktop is a requirement for serious gamers - and I don\u2019t see that changing soon.  That said\u2026 I want to emphasize something. I use Google Products by choice. I have every conceivable alternative at my fingertips. The Apple ecosystem is no stranger to me. I own a MacBook, and I used an employer supplied iPhone for 2 years before going back to Android. I could easily be using almost all Apple - if I wanted. I have several Linux boxes in my various offices, humming away, reliably doing the jobs I ask them to do. I started in this business supporting Windows and Microsoft networking. I have supported MS Office products and users for many years. I own 3\u20134 versions of Office, and only God knows how many discrete Microsoft boxes I deal with in a year. See\u2026 I have choices. Pretty much all the choices there are, in fact. I don\u2019t use Google stuff thru ignorance of or inexperience with alternatives, and I didn\u2019t choose to use Google offerings because they are cheap/free. I use Google products and services because they are the best there is.  Whether I\u2019m using my Windows desktop or my MacBook or Chromebook or Android phone or tablet\u2026 My daily routine is quite similar, no matter what hardware or OS I am on. I check my Google calendar. I look at my Keep notes. I check/dispose of my Gmail and Tasks. I text people or make video calls using Hangouts. My Calendar and Reminders pop up now and then to keep me on track. If I have time, I may work in my Drive on an ongoing project. All the people in my life are in my Google Contacts. Phone numbers, email addresses, physical addresses, birthdays, important details\u2026 I would be SO horribly lost without my Contacts!!! If I have an appointment in my calendar, my Android reminds me when I need to leave to get there on time. When I get in the car, I use Waze or Google Maps to help me get where I need to be. Any picture I snap or video I take is automatically saved to Google Photos - and I can edit them there, too. They don\u2019t sit in my phone storage, or clutter my PC hard drive. As soon as they are synced to the cloud, I\u2019m free to delete the local copy. If I need a new doc or slideshow or spreadsheet I create it in Drive. I use Google 2 step verification, so my Google account is fairly hackerproof. All my irreplaceable data is on Google cloud. All Google data is backed up so many different ways and locations that it\u2019s pretty silly to imagine losing it.  So here\u2019s what computing in the 21st century can really be like: It doesn\u2019t matter what device I use, I can and do use all the same Google products and services on everything I touch. And it wouldn\u2019t inconvenience me much if every device I have right now disappeared in a single \u201cpoof!\u201d Short of the Apocalypse, I cannot lose my data. As I said at the beginning\u2026 It\u2019s nice. ;) ",
