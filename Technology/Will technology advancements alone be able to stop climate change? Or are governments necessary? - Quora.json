            "answer_text": "Try reality. Here\u2019s an article I penned for the local paper: Sir Isaac\u2019s Corner The county of Newton, MS was named in honor of Sir Isaac Newton. This column likewise honors his memory but is, what I believe, would be his thoughts regarding the poor observations and impossible theories made by so-called scientists, both of today and centuries past. Much ado is made of climate change. The plethora of graphs and charts are mind-boggling and are difficult for the average person to grasp, so let\u2019s get to climate, itself. Gravity is reality. You can\u2019t get away from it. Weather is likewise real. It, like gravity, occurs every second of every day, week, month, year and century. Climate, on the other hand is perception; a gradient or averaging of weather events within particular areas and is not a fixed or genuine event. It\u2019s not real. The easiest way to understand this, I believe, is to consider the oven in your kitchen. The automatic setting is 350 F. Why? Most recipes require baking/broiling at that temperature. Sometimes you will have to exceed or decrease that temperature because of circumstance but most of the time you will simply allow the oven to automatically heat to 350 F. If each time you used the oven and recorded the temperature, over a long period of time, the average would be 350 F. Those other settings are insignificant blips. It\u2019s the same with climate. Temperature and weather conditions within a given area, in given seasons, are fairly consistent and the average is rather predictable. But just as with your baking requirements there are modifications that do not fit the norm. These mere blips do not change the overall climate. You\u2019ve felt it get cold when it should be warm; hot when it should be freezing; rain when it never has before rained; wind for days on end when it is generally calm; \u2026 but, overall, everything pretty much remains the same. After all, climates are based on centuries of observation and data. This notion of climate change has but a few decades using selected data and virtually no observation. The question you need ask is: How can I believe in the reliability of a recent theory which undermines centuries of observation and data? 364 words \u00a9 2019, DL Turner ",

            "answer_text": "Climate always changes. It's a simple fact. But CO2 accumulation in the atmosphere can be stopped. The key actors are likely to be farmers and ranchers. A few facts: 4.5 billion tonnes of carbon is currently accumulating per year in the atmosphere.12 billion acres of global crop and range land. If every acre of that sequestered 0.35 tonnes/year, CO2 accumulation would stopScientific studies show the use of green manure can sequester 2\u20138 tonnes CO2e/acre. That's about 0.5 to 2 tonnes carbon/acre.A ranch in Georgia was just documented as sequestering a little over 3 tons CO2e/acre, or about 0.8 tonnes carbon/acre. They did no farming, just ranching. They've been ranching the same way since the 1990s.A ranch in Australia was recently certified at 11.2 tonnes CO2e/hectare. That's a little over 1 tonne carbon/acre. They farmed the pasture land in the fall to increase soil health and make more profit from the sale of the fall crop.But the grand prize winner is Gabe Brown. He is aggressively pushing carbon into his soil using every technique he can find. A recent study said one of his bigger fields sequestered 3 tons of carbon/acre per year over the course of 7 years.Ranchers and farmers aren't sequestering carbon to save the world. They're doing it to increase the health of their soils and the profits they can make. It also increases the nutrient density of the foods they produce. General Mills is buying up companies that package and sell products sourced from \u201cregenerative\u201d farms and ranches. One example is Epic Provisions. A husband and wife sold a minority position in their 3-year old startup (Epic) to General Mills for $100M. Interestingly New Mexico just passed legislation funding a new \u201chealthy soil\u201d department with $5M/yr to educate, encourage and measure soil health. So maybe gov't is part of the solution.
