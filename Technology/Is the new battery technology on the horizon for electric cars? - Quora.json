            "answer_text": "Always. Battery technology improves at doubling rate of every 10 years. This is similar to Moore\u2019s law of computer performance doubling every 18 months. But what actualy doubles? With Computers it was original the number of transistors in a CPU. Today its more the relative performance. What is performance? MHZ formally defined performance, today its often defined by the number of cores and simultaneous threads. Another big metric is Watt and energy use. All of these factor into computer performance doubling. When it comes to batteries we look at Charge time (C Rating), energy density by weight watt/kg(usual) or volume watts/kl), Cycle life, and safety. All of these are improving gradualy. But because the time scale of 10 years is so long we fail to realize how much better our tech has already become. For example EV batteries are C-rated 2\u20133, we can now get 180 miles of charge in 15 minutes. And technicly the battery is less of a limiting factor then is the current delivery system. eg to get that previous mentioned 180 miles in 15 minutes we need to start using liquid cooled cables. Energy density wise the average daily drive is 30 miles, The least expensive tesla and several other models all get 210 miles on a single charge. Which means only one fill up per weeks is required if you do not charge at the convene of your own home. As for safety, have you heard of even one Tesla Model 3 of Chevy Bolt fire? Yes there have been fires in Model S and X but even adding them all up the cars are 7 times less likely to have fires the internal combustion vehicles. Finaly cycle life, the larger the battery the fewer cycles you need. Todays large batteries in Tesla and Chevy bolts for example will last 20 years on average with the likely hood of many having useful life spans of up to 40 years. Small batteries such as the ones in hybrids last only 8 years at best, dispite being the exact same design. ",

            "answer_text": "Is the new battery technology on the horizon for electric cars? Tesla acquired Maxwell, its technology will improve Tesla\u2019s batteries by 20% in a couple of years. Solid state batteries are a heavy contested research, those should offer even a bit more, but until those are actually tested on every aspect (capacity, charge/discharge speed, cycle life), produced in high amount and and a competitive price, this will take a decade if not more. I won\u2019t hold my breath.A battery can have 50% more capacity per weight, but if it lasts only 500 cycles, it\u2019s not on my shopping list. You get my idea. Graphene super capacitors are more like science fiction. A great idea, but nothing more. Yet. So yes, solid state batteries are on the horizon if you climb on Mt. Blanc, the highest mountain in Europe. For super capacitors Mt. Everest wouldn\u2019t be enough. I think you\u2019d have to take a rocket and fly to the ISS to see it on that horizon. ",
