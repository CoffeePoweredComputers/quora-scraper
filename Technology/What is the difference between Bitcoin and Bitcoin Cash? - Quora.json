            "answer_text": "Bitcoin is the original and dominant cryptocurrency. Bitcoin was the invention of blockchain technology and it is rapidly becoming a new asset class for investors and possibly the future of digital payments and peer2peer transfer of money. Bitcoin Cash is a recent offshoot of Bitcoin when a Bitcoin mining company and a few developers and investors in the Bitcoin community decided to make their own coin, but brand it with the \u201cBitcoin\u201d name for legitimacy. The branch off of Bitcoin Cash from Bitcoin occurred when Bitcoin underwent an upgrade called Segwit on August 1st. Segwit both closed a security hole in Bitcoin and also changed the format of the transaction data which results in about a 2x increase in Bitcoin\u2019s transaction throughput capabilities. As I understand it, the creation of Bitcoin Cash came about because a major Bitcoin mining called Bitmain has been covertly and illegally using a mining efficiency called ASIC Boost to gain an advantage over the rest of the network and make more money off of mining Bitcoin, but Segwit would make covert usage of ASIC Boost incompatible with Bitcoin mining, which means everyone would be able to see they are using ASIC Boost illegally so they would no longer be able to do it and they would lose their (illegal) competitive advantage. Note that the usage of ASIC Boost is illegal because it is patented and Bitmain doesn\u2019t have the right to the patent. So in order to keep using it they had to create their own coin and mine that instead, thus rejecting the Segwit upgrade of Bitcoin and rejecting Bitcoin itself. Bitmain along with a few rich Bitcoin investors and a few developers created and support and promote their coin Bitcoin Cash claiming it is the real Bitcoin, despite it being a lightly-used clone of Bitcoin. In creating this new coin they implemented an 8x increase in transaction throughput. They did this because Bitcoin has been at capacity for much of this year, resulting in high fees and a congested network leading to slow transaction times, and Bitcoin could really use such an increase in capacity. So Bitcoin Cash has about 4x transaction throughput capabilities over what Bitcoin has once Segwit is fully implemented by all Bitcoin client applications. However since Bitcoin Cash is not Bitcoin and most of the time only has 1/10th to 1/20th the size of transactions happening as compared to Bitcoin at any given time, Bitcoin Cash doesn\u2019t actually make use of that 8x increase in capacity, and in fact only makes use of a tiny amount of Bitcoin\u2019s original capacity. In summary, Bitcoin is the dominant cryptocurrency while Bitcoin Cash is an offshoot of Bitcoin that was essentially concocted in order to allow a Bitcoin mining company to continue covertly and illegally using a patented technology. Bitcoin Cash has upgraded to have 8x the transaction capacity of the original version of Bitcoin, while Bitcoin itself upgraded with Segwit which gives about a 2x upgrade in capacity, as well fixing security flaws which will allow Bitcoin to adopt future off-chain scaling solutions that will far far exceed the 2x and 8x increases that the August 1st upgrades resulted in. This leaves Bitcoin Cash with more capacity in the short term but Bitcoin will have far more capacity in the long term once new scaling solutions are implemented on top of the Segwit upgrade, which Bitcoin Cash refused to take part in.

            "answer_text": "Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash In the early 2009, an unknown person or a group of person working under the alias Satoshi Nakamoto developed a mysterious digital payment system, Bitcoin that would allow you to make transactions without worrying about the middlemen \u2013 meaning no banks or no central authority. It was the world\u2019s first decentralized digital currency, a cryptocurrency and can be used to buy almost anything online anonymously. As a result, international payments got a whole lot cheaper as bitcoins are not bound to any country or subject to regulation. Soon bitcoins became the second biggest thing to hit the global market after the invention of currency. Bitcoins have come a long way since its inception in 2009. After much investigations and research i have made about how to earn more profit on cryptocurrency legitimately, I will recommend libraforex Investment Platform and cloud mining(www.libraforex.io) as it has been relatively on for a while now as it was launched mid 2016 but has become the largest Cryptocurrency Investment Platform right now with a volume of over 150 million dollars where you get different ROI\u2019s on your invested cryptocurrency after every 10 days. It supports variety of cryptocurrency like Bitcoin, Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash and Litecoin and other Altcoins. By 2013, the Bitcoin market crossed the billion dollar mark which pushed the cryptocurrency\u2019s ecosystem into a whole new level. What started merely as a digital payment system soon became a global sensation and in the late 2014, bitcoins announced its partnership with the global leader in digital payment platform, PayPal. There were mixed responses regarding Bitcoin\u2019s future following a slow start in the year 2015 and the community suffered a major setback as $5 million worth of bitcoins were reportedly stolen. Plus there have been question regarding how Bitcoin should scale its protocol effectively. As a result, the Bitcoin network released a new cryptocurrency in 2017 called Bitcoin Cash. The new cryptocurrency was created as a result of the Bitcoin fork with almost same goal and to fulfill the original promise of Bitcoin but with a few upgrades. Both Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash transaction are conducted on blockchains \u2013 a digital decentralized pubic ledger used to record transactions across the Bitcoin community. Think of a block as a vehicle which carries transactions from one place to another and once the block reaches its destination, the transaction is completed and chain concludes. Larger the block, more transactions it can hold and eventually faster the processing time. Bitcoin Cash increased the block size from 1 MB to 8 MB and also removed the concept of Segregated Witness. Difference between Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash Definition of Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash Both Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash are an electronic peer-to-peer payment system, a cryptocurrency which can be used for performing transactions online anonymously. Bitcoin Cash is a new cryptocurrency emerged as a result of the Bitcoin\u2019s hard fork to avoid the protocol updates that the Segregated Witness brought about. Both are stored in a virtual back account, a digital wallet that allows you to send or receive bitcoins, save money, or pay for merchandise. The main difference between the two is the Max Blocksize Limit. Bitcoin Cash increased the block size which allows more transactions to be processed at a time. Block Size The maximum blocksize limit of 1 MB in Bitcoin has caused massive scalability issues which would make more difficult to manipulate the ledgers within the blockchain. While both serve same the purpose \u2013 to let the users sell or buy anything online anonymously meaning the transactions cannot be traced back to the users \u2013 Bitcoin can only process as much as seven transactions per second which contributes to longer waiting times. Bitcoin Cash solved the problem by increasing the size of blocks from 1 MB to 8 MB so that more transactions can be processed at a time which eventually results in faster payments. Segregated Witness Segregated Witness, or SegWit, is a scaling solution protocol designed to improve on the method of handling Bitcoin transactions. The idea of SegWit was presented by the Bitcoin developer Peter Wuille in the late 2015 aimed to change the way information is stored in Blockchain in order to solve the scalability problem of Bitcoin. The idea is to reduce the size of the Bitcoin transaction by removing the signature information from the Blockchain without affecting the transaction ID which allows for greater transaction volumes. Bitcoin Cash, on the other hand, does not support SegWit. Security and Stability of Bitcoin Vs. Bitcoin Cash Although, Bitcoin Cash is fast emerging as a global peer-to-peer electronic payment system designed specifically to promote faster transaction processing times and lower fees, Bitcoin has a much larger and distributed network and more infrastructure behind it which accounts for better security and stability on the long run. Additionally, Bitcoin is more profitable to mine than Bitcoin Cash. Plus Bitcoin excels in strength of hashing power which accounts for greater network stability. Bitcoin vs. Bitcoin Cash: Comparison Chart Summary of Bitcoin Vs. Bitcoin Cash Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash are two cryptocurrency borne out of the forks from the Bitcoin blockchain meaning anyone holding Bitcoins at the time of fork would now have an equivalent amount of Bitcoin Cash. Both are similar in many ways except with a few technical differences such as mining algorithm. The main difference between the two is the Max Blocksize Limit which is limited to 1 MB in Bitcoin, whereas the block size is increased from 1 MB to 8 MB in Bitcoin Cash which accounts for faster transaction processing times and lower fees. Bitcoin is still the legacy cryptocurrency we\u2019ve known for years and considering its network is widely distributed throughout, the community is growing at an unprecedented rate with no signs of slowing down ",
