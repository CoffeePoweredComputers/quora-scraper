Wasn\u2019t that what Doctor Octopus was trying and failing to do in Spider-Man 2?  Even tiny, they would produce heat and energy through the process of fusion.  \u201c10 trillion years\u2026\u201d Batman: \"I can shrink down entire red dwarf stars, bring them to Earth and contain them safely, and yet the only thing I can think to use them for is brass knuckles to hit Clark with when he's Jokerized. To hell with solving the world\u2019s energy crisis.\" ",

            "answer_text": "Bat-Shark Repellent:  In 1966's Batman: The Movie, Batman was hanging from his Bat-Copter on a rope ladder when a shark clamped onto his leg. At that point, Batman called out to Robin to hand him a can of Bat-Shark Repellent. That means, at some point, Batman thought to himself, \"There will come a day when a shark will bite me and I can't just punch or stab it. No, I want to spray it.\" That's when he came up with an aerosol can of Bat-Shark Repellent. What makes it even worse is that he didn't keep it in his Bat-boat where it would make sense, but rather on his Bat-copter, along with cans of other sea life-repellent like barracuda-repellent and whale-repellent. That took up the valuable room he could have used for something else, but it paid off. this is most ridiculous gadget in Batman's arsenal in my opinion. ",
