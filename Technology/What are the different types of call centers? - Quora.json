            "answer_text": "Call Centre is a set up by the service provider to assist the caller. There is a centralised office where a set of people will answer the call and provide assistance. It plays a vital role in terms of customer satisfaction because in today's age people don't have time and they need an immediate solution for everything. If a company has a good consumer base then the company must be having a department to handle the calls. For example, If you are using a sim card and facing difficulty while making a call then you will look for immediate assistance. You will dial a customer care number and speak to an agent for assistance. A call centre executive is your direct point of contact in most of the services. Most of the companies in the customer service industry offer 24*7 support. There are two types of Call Centre: Inbound Call Centre: Inbound means incomings where an agent will receive your call and deliver the requested information. Most of the companies mention their customer support number on their product so that you can call up them and ask for assistance.Outbound Call Centre: Outbound means outgoing where an agent will be making a call to deliver the information about their product and services. Outbound calls are mostly done for selling products, after-sale call and C-sat calling.",
