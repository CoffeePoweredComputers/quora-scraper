            "answer_text": "My understanding is that he was trying to create large electric fields through space that would provide for a potential difference from one side of any object to the other side of that object, as long as the said object was held so that the terminals which would take up the electricity were perpendicular to the source of the electrical field. Here\u2019s a short video on the great MIT professor of physics, Walter Lewin, demonstrating the lighting of a florescent bulb with a Van Der Graaf generator. The generator creates a powerful electric field which creates a potential difference from one side of the tube to the other (when held perpendicular to the field). Thus it turns on and off based on the orientation to the generator\u2019s surface.  Note: the experiment commences around the 4 minute mark. Now Tesla\u2019s White Whale, if you will, was nearly captured in his building of the Wardenclyffe Tower on Long Island, NY. He devoted all of his resources to building this massive tower.  This massive tower was initially intended (as least this is what Tesla told the financiers) send wireless telegraph and facsimile signals across the Atlantic. This was first built in 1901. Eventually Telsa decided that it would also be used to convey \u201cwireless power transmission,\u201d but this idea was met with derision by the principle project investor, J.P. Morgan. When Morgan pulled out as an investor in the project, additional funds were never found, and the project was scrapped in 1906. Now, Tesla was working for Westinghouse, the man who eventually provided AC current to the nation, in the 1880s. In fact, Tesla has a key invention and Westinghouse promised to provide a good commission on every kiloWatt produced, which would have made Tesla a very rich man. However, Westinghouse approached Tesla before his first large plant was operational, and utilizing Tesla\u2019s invention, and he told Tesla that he did not have enough money to move forward and prove Tesla\u2019s concept would work. Tesla agreed to forego the commission so that Westinghouse could complete the project. As we all know, AC beat out Edison\u2019s DC circuits, and Westinghouse revolutionized the world. Tesla was at the heart of this, and never received anything more than hourly compensation when working for Westinghouse. So, 1901 is like a decade or a decade and a half after he had seen this battle for electrical distribution, and the power it had to shape the country. He also saw the money that came with the power, and the money he was cheated out of having. He thought that he had a system that was superior to both those of Edison and Westinghouse, and it was his goal to deliver this to the world. Now, why would JP Morgan pull out of the project when he learned Tesla was planning on providing a new form of power to the masses? Because he had stolen Westinghouse\u2019s patten (that was taken from Tesla), and had formed a juggernaut in the world of electrical power supply and distribution called \u201cGeneral Electric.\u201d So, with Morgan heavily invested in General Electric, Tesla was threatening a core money maker for Morgan. But it is important to know that all of the success of AC power supply comes directly from a Tesla design, and that all the money Morgan would make from Tesla\u2019s design would be used, in part, to destroy Tesla\u2019s even more powerful inventions. Tesla remained in New York and died virtually penniless. He would feed pigeons on a daily basis, and believed one pigeon had been his wife in a past life. The passing of this pigeon sunk him into a great depression. Also, near the end of his life, the Wardenclyffe Tower is sold in foreclosure to help pay back some of Tesla\u2019s debts, and he had to wake up to see that his life\u2019s dream had been destroyed.  If you dedicate yourself to watching a documentary of the man\u2019s life, beware, the ending is going to be very depressing. Now you have asked whether or not it would have worked. I\u2019ll leave you with this clip of a larger article, and the notion that Tesla was not formally trained in high end Universities, and so, just like Faraday, although he was a genius, he did have a full grasp on the theories, like say, James Clerk Maxwell would have known. Perhaps this is why Morgan pulled out of the investment? Did he have advisors saying that it wouldn\u2019t work? So I leave you with this snippet from the article found here: Tesla\u2019s folly - why Wardenclyffe didn\u2019t work \u201cThe fact is, like many of the electrical engineers of his day, Tesla harbored ideas about electromagnetism that were if not fully wrong, at least partially so \u2013 radio transmission doesn\u2019t work like a telegraph circuit, electromagnetic waves are not like sound waves, and it isn\u2019t possible to create current waves that pass through the earth for thousands of miles unimpeded. Yet somehow, some of his ideas persist in people\u2019s imagination today \u2014 we feel the pain of Tesla\u2019s failure, and we seem to hear his voice traveling through the ether, asking us to give him one more chance. The fact that people are still influenced by Tesla\u2019s ideas today is testimony to his power to dream \u2013 and his powers to use his friends in the press to promote his dreams to the public (Carson, pg 408).\u201d ",
