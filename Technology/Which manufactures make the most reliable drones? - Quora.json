            "answer_text": "Currently, the most reputable drone company is DJI as they manufacture most of the drones used by professional drone pilots. Companies like Tello and Parrot make drones as well, but more for recreational use. There are companies popping up that have some innovative stuff, like Skydio, which has some great AI and flight sensors to help you create cinematic footage with very little practice. Swellpro makes a pretty neat air and underwater drone which can operate both in the air and underwater. This is pretty revolutionary because generally when a drone makes contact with water it dies a swift death. Best drone really depends on your budget and what you can afford. For the money, generally DJI will make a drone that sets the bar for other companies to beat. ",
