            "answer_text": "If you can take a concept or task and divide it up into a series of concepts/tasks of similar complexity, some of which get repeated and some of which are optional, you have mastered Jackson Structured Programming. If you can bake a cake or cook an omelette, you have mastered algorithms. There are other ways to write programs, but if you've got this far, you're a software engineer. Prefer something a bit more challenging? If you can wash a stack of plates, hand them to someone to dry and have them stack the dried ones, you've mastered abstract data types and semaphores. If you've checked your email repeatedly for something you're expecting, you've mastered polling. If you've answered the phone when it has rung, you're adept at event handling. In other words, software engineering is incredibly basic. You break something down into the trivial and then use common sense everyday stuff to figure out what each trivial piece should look like. ",

            "answer_text": "Of course it's hard, and that's a good thing. First, you seem to be talking about 3 different tracks here. Computer engineering is mainly about hardware. Computer science is mainly about algorithms (and thus software), and Software engineering is about managing large software projects (a mix between computer programming and business project management.) All three of these disciplines are difficult. You will need to work hard and spend some effort learning them. That's why these fields are rewarded well. They aren't easy to learn, and so people who can do these things are valuable. Don't give up. Take a semester or two to find out what you're getting yourself into. Then talk to a good advisor and see if what you're learning maps to what you want to do. ",
