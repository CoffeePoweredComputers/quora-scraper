            "answer_text": "Hmm, that\u2019s an interesting perspective. Yes, it does seem that autistic tendencies might precisely trigger the \u201cuncanny valley\u201d response, as proposed design principles for robotics confirm: \u201cReducing conflict and uncertainty by matching appearance, behavior, and ability. In terms of performance, if a robot looks too appliance-like, people expect little from it; if it looks too human, people expect too much from it. A highly human-like appearance leads to an expectation that certain behaviors are present, such as humanlike motion dynamics. This likely operates at a sub-conscious level and may have a biological basis. Neuroscientists have noted \"when the brain's expectations are not met, the brain...generates a 'prediction error'. As human-like artificial agents become more commonplace, perhaps our perceptual systems will be re-tuned to accommodate these new social partners. Or perhaps, we will decide \"it is not a good idea to make [robots] so clearly in our image after all.\"(emphasis added). The \u201cmind-blindness\u201d and \u201ctheory of mind\u201d explanations of autism (flawed in their uni-lateral understanding), are predicated on the differing norms of reactions and usage of behavior to convey information, and the ensuing breakdown in non-verbal communication. This effect is perhaps why sci-fi has made so much mileage out of \u2018autistic-esque\u2019 characters as alien (Spock, Data, C3-P0, Marvin). My personal experience further confirms confirms the general concept: socially isolated families tend to develop their own idiosyncrasies that strike the outside observer as \u201codd\u201d or \u201cuncanny\u201d (ie: the \u201cBrown family accent\u201d). I have also had issues with particular people mistaking nervousness for deception, based (I have to suppose) on this effect. ",

That\u2019s probably just because only about 1% of people are autistic - so 99% of the people I know and have grown up with were \u201cneurotypical\u201d. The reverse is harder to judge - but I\u2019m fairly sure that autistic people do seem decidedly \u201codd\u201d to neurotypicals - and in truth, when I meet other autistic people, I often find them to be weird, even though I know that I may be being judged the same way! I\u2019m not entirely sure this is truly an \u201cuncanny valley\u201d effect though\u2026that idea is that when something isn\u2019t remotely human (like a cartoon character) - then there is no feeling of weirdness - but when something comes CLOSE to being human (like an android robot), it actually seems weirder/creepier than a cartoon character. That said - I\u2019m also left-handed, and many right handed people find it REALLY strange to watch me do things like using wood-working tools or something. My father (who was right handed) always remarked on how he found it hard to watch me using tools to fix problems around the house because I always seemed to be using them wrong. But for sure, I don\u2019t find neurotypical people to be particularly weird - so if there is an effect, it\u2019s in one direction only. ",

My partner tells me that I am an 'uncanny valley person' in that I appear mostly human but am not totally. Bear in mind they aren't being insulting in calling me not human, they are merely trying to explain the reaction that they, and others, have to me. The response is very much reminiscent of 'uncanny valley' from people that take an instant... opposite of instant connection to me. People fall into two main camps - they either decide that I am a great person to know, full of boundless energy and great to get to know further or they decide that I am, well, in the 'uncanny valley'. Sometimes they will switch camps based on experience and meeting me more than once. My partner switched camps, toward 'uncanny valley' and, increasingly, finds me difficult to be around in any way. For what that experience is worth. On the reverse, no, I do not find NTs (or people without ASD) in the 'uncanny valley'. Like others have suggested, finding other people as not being people is... well, uncomfortably close to what I study and teach: History. When that happens there are... consequences. ",

It seems to exist in NT\u2019s regarding variously injured, wounded, disabled or disfigured humans, NT or not, and some are even repelled by prostheses that make a meaningful participation in society possible. The term was first coined in 1970 by Japanese roboticist Masahiro Mori in an essay that received little attention at the time, but has since exploded in popularity and relevance. He hypothesized that \u201ca person\u2019s response to a humanlike robot would abruptly shift from empathy to revulsion as it approached, but failed to attain, a lifelike appearance.\u201d (E.N. on orig. translation, MacDorman & Kageki 2012).

Although the phrase was originally applied to androids/robots and humans, I have seen it used in other contexts. Some people do seem to find some other human beings uncanny, eerie, odd, or disturbing in either appearance or behaviour, and are creeped out by it. This isn't restricted to autistics, but includes amputees, people who are badly burned or scarred, people who are blind, conjoined twins, people with various mental illnesses, and many others. However, I would argue that this seems a human response rather than an NT response .. and I suspect may even apply beyond humanity to other animal species, where Otherness or difference leads to being rejected or cast out. It's a hopeful sign, though, that we (humans) can often be trained not to react that way. And, indeed, not all of us feel that way in the first place. ",
