            "answer_text": "Quora. I use Quora of the most because I've always prided myself as being truthful and informative. I spent most of my life in intellectual pursuit, and find the exchanges I have writing greatly exceed the depths of those I have human to human. Quora is novel technology, and novel technology. Perhaps, if I write just enough, one day A.I. might develop enough to put my writings into a novel\u2026or maybe I'll learn how myself. I use Quora because it is therapeutic to myself. I use Quora to affect the world through memes. I imagine my wordplay incorporating itself into the greater good. I wonder how and if we could use my data alongside many others for the greater good. I wonder if I can prove them, the naysayers, wrong. I wonder if I write enough if I will ever come up with something new. I don't know the significance of this as of yet. Yet, I imagine. I write. I visualize and on very rare occasions say what hasn't been heard before, and derived a few new questions, if not but only one. I write here for the sake of humanity. ",

            "answer_text": "On the app side, Roam Research, Notion, and AI Dungeon. Writers either enjoy editing or need some tools to get them through it. These kinds of facilities will build up some knowledge over time as their value. To simplify, Roam has the concept graphs, Notion the content tables, and AI Dungeon the conversational models. Users tend to combine domains, build them up, or trim them down. These also provide features for novel writers. The reasons were to know how they were put together, and what that says about the users. They are more of a reminder of the early days of spreadsheets and editors like emacs and the lack of planetary code in the face of existential events than the ones immediately following the introduction of smartphones. The crowd is much bigger this year, so appeal to kairos. Whether the internet is how this period is celebrated in the future or itself is again about to dramatically morph, these enable keepsakes. ",
