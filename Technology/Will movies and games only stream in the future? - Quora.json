            "answer_text": "Thanks for the A2A. Movies, I could see, because we have a system that works for that. Games; not a chance. Not until internet is revolutionized, and far more powerful and affordable than it is today. With movies, you\u2019re only receiving the movie, there\u2019s nothing more to it. You get it, you watch it, it ends, that\u2019s it. With games, you have to account for user feedback every second, this requires a steady upstream connection that doesn\u2019t falter, because if it falter\u2019s even slightly, you get latency issues/lag, which will not work well for gamers at all. Internet connections for the vast majority, are not steady enough for that. That\u2019s why Stadia is going to fail, that\u2019s why we won\u2019t see all-streaming gaming anytime in the near future, and that\u2019s why I wouldn\u2019t buy it even if they did. You also have to account for the fact that such a gaming business model puts its survival on the shoulders of internet service providers; if the ISP fails somehow, so too will that game stream. Imagine if ISP\u2019s decided to restrict their users from streaming those games, until they pay more for an \u201cadd-on\u201d - they can do that now, thanks to net neutrality being a thing of the past. As a gamer, I can see it right now; that will be the final nail in the proverbial coffin, that seals the fate of modern gaming. Game market crash of 2020 has an interesting ring to it. Maybe 2021 at most. ",

            "answer_text": "I am not a gamer so I don\u2019t know how online providers price their streaming content, I believe that movie producers and studios would take a loss in the hundreds of millions if they just streamed their content. Profits But would plummet because most movie theaters charge on average $9.00 per ticket; and most blockbuster movies need to make at least double the cost of production to make it a hit. So if the cost of streaming a movie remains the same (average 6.00) and a family of five rent the movie for the 24 hour period so everyone could watch it, the producers are losing out on at least 4 tickets being sold. That doesn\u2019t include having friends over to watch the movie. In other words, instead of say a group of ten people paying at least 90.00 for a movie (not including confession stand snacks), they will pay a flat fee of 6.00 for the movie and probably get snacks much cheaper at the supermarket. So everyone but the consumer loses; the theater, the movie distributor, the producers, and the studios. Probably the actors who would have their fees reduced. So I don\u2019t ever see movies ever just streaming because the loss of money would be astronomical. As always\u2026In my opinion. ",

            "answer_text": "I would say yes. There are rumors that the next generation of consoles will be the last before everyone goes to streaming. Movies will be a different beast. I still see them being released in theaters. I think they will eventually stop selling Blu-Ray in favor of major movie companies making their own streaming services. The success or failure of Disney+ will pretty much determine this. ",
