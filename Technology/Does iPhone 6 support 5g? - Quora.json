            "answer_text": "Well, the iPhone 6 does support 2G. It however, does not support 5G because it is not out yet, as it is still in the earliest stages of testing a select few cities across the US. the iPhone 6 also came out before 5G was even dreamed of, further proving my point that it does not support it. It does support everything up through LTE, so that would include 1x, GPRS, EDGE, 3G (GSM/CDMA), 4G (GSM) and LTE (specific models support unique types of LTE, like Sprint\u2019s network) ",
