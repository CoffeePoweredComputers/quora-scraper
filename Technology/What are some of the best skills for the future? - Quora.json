            "answer_text": "Your ability to deal with people. This may sound like a soft answer but it\u2019s one of the most important, if not THE most important skills you can develop. If you can effectively get people to like you then they will go out of their way to do the things you want them to. Abraham Lincoln, Charles Schwab, Theodore Roosevelt, and the likes, were all great people. But what made them great? It was their ability to effectively deal with people. How do you deal with people? You make them feel important.  Charles Schwab didn\u2019t know nearly as much about the production of steel as those who worked for him. Why did Andrew Carnegie pay him over a million dollars a year then? He was so good at making others feel important that they did all the work he needed them to, and more. Schwab once said \u201cI consider my ability to arouse enthusiasm among my people, the greatest asset I possess, and the way to develop the best that is in a person is by appreciation an encouragement.\u201d He goes on, \u201cThere is nothing else that so kills the ambitions of a person as criticism from superiors. I never criticize anyone. I believe in giving a person incentive to work. So I am anxious to praise but loath to find fault. If I am like anything, I am hearty in my approbation and lavish in my praise.\u201d  Roosevelt knew the names of all the staff members in the White House. This included all the servants, and scullery maids. After leaving office Roosevelt would visit the white house and called each servant by their name. They loved him for it. His valet, James E. Amos wrote a book about Roosevelt, Theodore Roosevelt, Hero To His Valet.  Lincoln never criticized anyone either. After the battle of Gettysburg, General Lee was on the run and trapped between Union forces lead by General Mead and the high flowing Potomac river. Lincoln ordered Mead to attack at once and potentially end the war right there. Yet, Mead didn\u2019t. The river let down and Lee and his forces escaped. Lincoln was furious. Why, why wouldn\u2019t Mead attack and capture Lee\u2019s army? Lincoln drafted a scalding letter to Mead condemning him for his lack of action. However, the letter was never sent. It was found among his desk papers after his death. Lincoln realized after writing this letter that it would do no good criticizing Mead for his actions. After all, Lincoln wasn\u2019t there at Gettysburg. How could he have known the terror that they all experienced there. He figured Mead had his reasons for holding back and respected him for it. All three of these individuals knew how to deal with people. It\u2019s what made them great. These principles for dealing with people are outlined in Dale Carnegie\u2019s book How to Win Friends & Influence People. These are his 21 principles to do so:  ",

            "answer_text": "Specific future predictions fail mostly.  I mean, they have to. If they didn't, it means that we did not do something right in the years going into the future.  Therefore its safe to stick to generic, \"spiritual\" (as you refer to) answers which have more probability of being interpreted as relevant.  Personally, I find the generic answers more valuable than the specific ones because they allow me to add my own layer of interpretation on top and figure out how to achieve them.   But, I do understand the problem with those kinds of answers: They are very difficult to execute and prepare for.  Here's a list of skills that I believe will be important in the future:  Freelancing - Is it a skill? Yes, I think so. I think its necessary to develop this ability to freelance, dabble and contribute to lot of different things and get compensated in the process. This is because the future of work is going to highly unstructured, temporary arrangements to achieve immediate goals and it prepares you for that. Data Analytics / Problem Solving / Programming - I believe these are complementary and will merge more and more. We will have a lot of data - a lot more than we can handle going forward. An essential future skill would be the ability to process and sift-through data and come up with rapid decisions that are unique / different. Not just data analytics but also a level of comfort and ability to read data and intuitively spot patterns. Math, logic, problem solving, programming, etc. are all complementary skills and will be critical for success.  Designing - A lot of focus on the future will be on shifting man-machine interactions and designing completely new interfaces through which we can leverage the power of cloud and AI. Design will be one of the biggest skills in demand.   Story-telling - Yes, you heard that right. With so much information, the din of numbers, logic and marketing-speak will become so loud as to become irrelevant. People with ability to tell compelling, engrossing stories will catch attention and quickly leverage the power of the internet to build a following.  Managing Time - Its gonna get very chaotic. No stability in what you do on a daily basis. Your schedules will always change and your attention will be demanded a million times a day. Ability to manage time and achieve things will become more important than ever.  Science - Not computer science! Hard science. Yes. It will be a key skill in the future. Chemistry, physics and biology will all come centre-stage as we leverage the power of technology to achieve the next level of breakthroughs in these. Therein, lies the next big revolution. Scientists will be in demand.    ",
