            "answer_text": "Computer technology has certainly changed society. When I was young my parents had dial telephones. These were analog and not digital, party line phones, and occasionally one could hear the other party speaking in the background though it was impossible to tell what they were saying. Then came the smaller push button phones which were digital, which were later replaced by cell phones. I studied computer programming when the first Apple Computers showed up in universities, which was a vast improvement over punch cards or even dumb terminals. With puch cards, one would write out the program on sheets of paper, then go to a punch card machine which had to be typed out correctly with no errors. The punch cards had to be transported and delivered to the people at the window where the computer terminal was. Someone would take the stack of punch cards and these would be placed in a stack for the punch card reader to read them. The punch card readerwould read them and spit them out. These punch cards would sit in alphetized boxes awaiting the results. An hour or so later, the printout of the program would come out of the printer. These printouts were on tractor paper which was a continuous role of paper with perforated edges whose pages could be separated. The Computer Operator would observe where the printout to a particular program ended, cut it off, remove the printout that would be labeled with the person's name, then search for that person's name in the alphabetized boxes with punch card decks which were bundled with rubber tands, remove the punch card deck, wrrap the printout around it, then take it to the Operator's Window and call the person's name. If the person had been waiting with basically nothing to do in the meantime, it would be picked up from the window. If not, then it would be placed in an alphabatized slot the person would have to look through when (s)he returned to find the printout and card deck. Only then, reading this printout, would the person find any errors in typing out the punch cards or in program logic, which now reguired corrections to be made on the printout, and one would then return to the punch card machine to redo the particular punch card errors. These punch card stacks had to be maintained in proper order or else the program would not work. If one dropped a punch card stack it would have to be put back in proper order perfectly before resubmitting. Writing computer programs in those days was extremely tedious due to the long waits at the Operator Station for the computers to return the results. This is why anyone taking a computer science class would spend many long nights into the wee hours of the morning writing programs and delivering them to the Operator Station because the turnaround time was so much quicker. This was the only way to get any program done on time, and sometimes these programs could take a week or two to write even staying up all night every night. People did not have their own computers in those days, so there were no emails or text messages, and before cell phones came out there were digital pagers that would alert a person to a sent message. Remote communication as well as digital communications has certainly improved, and so has the size of electronic devices. Analog electronics were large and bulky, and that changed as transistors and etched wafer chips began to replace circuit boards with analog components.The old televisions and CRTs large, bulky and heavy. They all had an electron gun in the back that was aimed at the phosphorous coated screen whose pixels would light up as the electrons hit the phosphorous on the screen. The electron gun was aimed with large magnets that was controlled by the analog wave capltured by the receiver. Everything required more work in those days, and people had fewer possessions but people were still more prosperous and happier. The corrupt bankers had not yet stolen all of the wealth of the people yet. As work became easier the bankers just reduced workers to compensate and lower productive output, which has left more and more people with less work and lower pay. Supply versus demand. If the bankers do not need workers serving them then the workers lose their jobs. The bankers want only enough employment to keep everyone desperate and struggling except them, so corruption and evil has increased greatly and employment and jobs have become vastly less productive and more useless. more jobs today are there only to control other groups of people, not to accomplish anything truly useful. With the increase of individual productivity many fewer people are needed in productive occupations, so everyone's frustration and anger has increased. The same Luciferian witches rule over us today, but there are just more of them performing more wicked practices. Evil has proliferated as corruption and theft has multiplied, so there are also more evil people today promoting Socialist (Financial, Communist, Fascist or Environmental control by witchcraft and demons) tyranny. Evil's goal has never deviated from total control over humanity in order to kill us all with no recourse. You may find this amusijng.

            "answer_text": "Thank you, my friend, for asking me to reply to your question. Good Evening. I am an old man. I was potty trained in an outhouse. We had an ice box, not a refrigerator. Our first washing machine was a round tub with a flat bottom. It did have an agitator. But, it also had two rollers attached, so that the soapy clothing could be \u201csqueezed dry\u201d, before taking the clean clothes to the laundry sink, to be rinsed, then hung up on a clothes line, to dry. We had a party line. If we heard two short rings, and one long, we knew we had an incoming phone call. Every home had their own \u201csignal.\u201d We were introduced to flush toilets, when we started Kindergarten, and toilet paper instead of Sear\u2019s Catalogues. We had electric fans, but no air conditioners. We had wall heaters, but no \u201ccentral heating and air.\u201d We thought a thermostat was a car part. We had a perfectly square box that sat on a table. It was a black and white television. One dial changed channels. One dial controlled the volume. There was an on/off button we had to push, to watch the three or four hours of daily programming, on the three or four channels that broadcast. The rest of the time, it was just a test pattern, with a high pitched, continuous beep. Freeways weren\u2019t built, until President Eisenhower got the approval from Congress. The freeway through my home town was built when I was in 8th grade. Vacuum cleaners had just been invented, when I was born. Mom and Dad\u2019s first purchase, after they married was a sewing machine. Like everyone else, Mom made all our clothing. Fifty pound flour sacks were decorated with locomotives for the boys, and flowers for the girls. Each flour sack came equipped with a \u201cpattern\u201d, illustrating to the mother how to sew a pair of shorts, a shirt or blouse, or a dress. Sliced bread wasn\u2019t invented until after I was born. We had airline travel. We flew in airplanes with propellers. Passenger \u201cjets\u201d didn\u2019t come along until I was in junior high school. We listened to \u201cspacemen\u201d on the radio programs, like \u201cBuck Rogers.\u201d Rocket travel was all the stuff of fantasy. The Polio Vaccine wasn\u2019t created by Dr. Jonas Salk, until I was in elementary school. Every kid got the Mumps, the Measles, Chicken Pox, and Whooping Cough. Not all of us recovered. We were still burying lots of kids. There were no computers, when I was a kid, for anybody, much less a personal computer. There were no cell phones, no tablets,no blackberries, no video cameras, etc. We played pinball games, when I was a kid. The first \u201cpersonal game computer\u201d the Atari 2600 didn\u2019t arrive on scene until after I had graduated from university. Dad had a crosscut saw for cutting firewood, but there was no such thing as a chain saw. Dad had a hand saw, but there was no such thing as a circular saw, or a reciprocating saw. When I was old enough, I mowed the lawn. There were no gasoline or electric lawn mowers. Our \u201cpush mower\u201d was operated by \u201cone little boy power.\u201d With the advent of the computer, the information age has simply exploded in volume. Think of an upside down pyramid. Every year, we learn phenomenal amounts of new information. When I had a knee replacement this year, it was with robot-assisted surgery. The same thing held true when I had prostate surgery. We had no robots when I was a kid. We had no artificial joints when I was a kid. Technological advancement has been like a nuclear explosion. There has been nothing gradual about it. I am buying books, before they become obsolete. I hope you have a pleasant Evening, my friend. ",

The older generation have not only noticed the changes but some have been completely left behind without due consideration of them and the impact such advances have made on their lives. I have many examples but will give what I consider the most obvious. When I was 21 I started work in a global firm of solicitors. I was young and full of energy and absorbed the new technology eagerly and with ease during the two week induction training. The firm was the first firm in the UK to have a \u2018main' computer (I don't know the terminology!) so that everyone was connected to information. We had floppy discs and NO \u2018mouse'. I left at 23 to raise my family. After years of being a housewife and mother my husband abandoned us so I needed to get back into work. The technological advances during the previous 13 years were immense. I gradually worked my way back up the career ladder and when I was 44 I was once again working for a global firm of solicitors. I was older, I was tired with life's struggles and struggled with some of the new information during the two week induction training. The younger girls on the training were fascinated that I could use the keyboard for other things than typing and genuinely thought I was teasing when I said I learned computers WITHOUT a mouse, one girl flatly refused to believe it. I no longer work for a global firm but I still work in a firm of solicitors (part time) and I deal with very elderly clients frequently. Many of them when asked to produce ID (in line with money laundering requirements) have no photographic ID. Many do not know how to use on line banking. Many cannot keep up with how quickly things are dealt with. As we age, we slow. In today's world everything is fast. People talk fast, drive fast, expect everything immediately - TV on demand, overnight deliveries. Of course older people have noticed the changes. I am in my late 50s now and I have grown old whilst watching this world change so quickly, the younger generation being born into it. I feel as if I get slower whilst the world gets faster and I am gradually being left behind, cast aside. I feel for the younger generation. Not having the time to process their thoughts and more importantly their feelings. I am a specialist mental health mentor and more and more I understand why there is so much poor mental health, there is no time to process. Technology was apparently going to make life easier but instead we are now being measured against it. Humanity is struggling to be human in it's constant battle to keep up with technology. ",

Besides the obvious technological changes, there are also some more subtle changes that technology has wrought. For example: In 1955, kids from first grade on routinely rode their bikes to school if the school was within about 2 miles of home. Even when it was raining. Bikes then had fenders to keep the water on the ground from being pulled up by the tires and splashing the rider. Kids got plenty of exercise that way. Today, mom or dad routinely drive the kids both ways, since the kids can\u2019t be \u201ctrusted\u201d anymore to get to/from school on their own safely. And what with all the imagined predators lurking out there ready to pounce on them to molest and kidnap them. Many kids don\u2019t even have school recess anymore, and aren\u2019t even allowed to play dodge ball, because now it hurts their feelings when hit by the ball. In 1955, we 100% recycled our glass milk containers, and had our milk delivered to our doorstep. Today, we toss the cardboard or plastic containers in the trash and have to lug our milk home from the supermarket. We have literally gone backwards in terms of environmental protection AND customer convenience. In 1955, if we were out and about around town, we were always within virtual eyesight of a pay phone. Local calls were a dime. We didn\u2019t have to worry about charging our phone batteries, or lug around a phone. Today, good luck finding a pay phone if you forget to bring your cell, or forget to charge it. In 1955, drive-ins were where the family went on warm summer evenings. And where teenage lovers went to not watch the movie. Today, the family stays inside watching streaming TV while teenage lovers Skype each other when not playing video games. In 1955, no one questioned the need and importance of being vaccinated. Today, far too many are falsely believing that it will cause autism and then let their children be susceptible to contracting some awful diseases. In 1955 we didn\u2019t have microwave ovens, but there were a lot of nukes in the world. Today, there are far fewer nukes, but a zillion microwave ovens. Back then, people threatened to nuke people. Today, we just nuke our food. In 1955, Mom stayed home to watch the kids, maintain the house, do the laundry, and cook meals. Dad let her borrow the car one day a week to run to the grocery store and do other errands. On that day, he would carpool. Most families only had one car, and one-car garages in their homes. Today, most families have at least two vehicles, including an SUV or truck, homes have 2- or 3-car garages, both Mom and Dad work, and the kids go to day care or after-school care until the parents pick them up. In 1955, kids were mostly all lean and fit. The somewhat rare overweight child was (unfairly) ostracized. Today, over 1/3 of kids are overweight or obese, and are still (unfairly) ostracized. In 1955, when a student needed to do research for a term paper, they spent the afternoon in the library and looked up references on index cards in a card catalog. Today, they merely have to go online to have access to unimaginably vast amounts of information. But back then, they didn\u2019t have to plow through heaps of trash to find credible sources, since the librarians carefully curated their reference materials. No one curates the internet. It is still the \u201cWild West\u201d of the information world, even after 30+ years of existence. Seems we need to redeploy the librarians of the world from the libraries to the internet. Perhaps a new job category called \u201cInternet Librarian\u201d. They could organize all that content along the lines of the Dewey Decimal System. In 1955, we had to type our term papers using a QWERTY keyboard. Today, um, we still have to do that. At least we no longer need to use erasers and White-Out when correcting our typos. In 1955, people were \u201cold\u201d and often decrepit by the time they reached 60 or so. Today, they\u2019re not \u201cold\u201d until around age 80. Thank goodness for modern medicine! ",

Yes, indeed, I keep up with changing technology, and we are soon to undergo some stunning changes once again. \u201cOld People\u201d are not all in dementia, and a helluva lot of us are way ahead of many younger people due to longevity, learning, experience, and knowledge of human nature.

I have since spent the vast majority of my life making money using, repairing, or programming computers. The internet could really only be accessed by people who had at least two brain cells to rub together. In that way, it was a lot better than simplifying it down to where every idiot in the world is online. I was kind of aware when phones changed from simply portable phones into tiny internet machines. I detest phones. I love my tiny internet machine. Want a really stark example? My grandmother rode in a covered wagon as a child. She lived to see the Space Shuttle Challenger explode. Now THAT\u2019S technology change. Do you think she didn\u2019t recognize that simply because it all happened incrementally? I often wonder, though, if she felt uncomfortable living in a world that is so dissimilar to the one she grew up with. I mean, you\u2019d have to, wouldn\u2019t you? Which leads me to a pet theory of mine, started off as kind of a joke, but the older I get, the more I feel it might just be a truism: Q: Why do old people die?A: Because they want to. ",

I still wrote letters by hand and posted them; spent a lot of time in libraries reading books; spent a lot of money on paper, and my main communication system were my house and office telephones.

If they switched over, whenever there\u2019s a new development, the change will seem more gradual. Although it\u2019s easier for young people to keep up, older people do have trouble and also because their peers often do not change over do they get stuck if they want to talk to their peers. For example, I am sixty eight. Most of my peers switched to email, because they had to for work, and they are stuck in email. Texting not so much and many find it rude. They\u2019d rather call on the phone. Some are into Facebook, some never got into it. Despite all the criticism about the President\u2019s tweets, I have to admire that he tweets because of his age.
