            "answer_text": "You\u2019ve apparently swallowed a sensational lie. Apple doesn\u2019t force older model Apple devices into obscurity by making them unusable. In fact Apple often puts more expense into ensuring their products remain useful for a longer period of time than most of their competitors. I know because I\u2019ve owned and developed software for Apple products as well as competing products from other mainstream platform vendors since the 1980s. I make a living developing enterprise software for Linux, Windows, macOS, etc on a daily basis. And I\u2019ve owned iPhones from the iPhone 3GS all the way to the iPhone X. And guess what? Every single one is still working just fine today. My 2009 iPhone 3GS is in daily use by a family member, and still takes photos and runs all of the apps on it just fine. It still syncs with their iMac without issue. And it works as a phone as well. My 2010 iPhone 4 is mounted to the windshield of my car as a dedicated dash cam, where it dutifully records all of my trips in case anything interesting or unfortunate happens on the road. All of the other apps on it work just fine, and if I wanted to I could hook it up to any cellular plan and use it for phone calls as well. I bring it into the house occasionally to sync it and transfer video recordings to my Mac Pro. We replaced the battery on it years ago. And Apple replaced the home button on it under warranty. Other than those two repairs, it\u2019s original. My wife\u2019s 2009 iPhone 4 is in use by a family member and works well too. It still works like new as a camera, phone, and whatever else they want to do with it. We replaced its battery a long time ago. Other than that it\u2019s all original. Works great. No problems to report. My 2012 iPhone 5 is in daily use by my mom at the moment. She chats with me almost daily on it, uses it to surf the web occasionally, takes photos, runs apps, etc. She has no problems to report, other than \u201cthe screen is so small I sometimes have a hard time reading things\u201d. Apple replaced the sleep/wake button on it under warranty. We replaced the battery ourselves when it started to bulge due to old age. My wife\u2019s 2012 iPhone 5 is in use by her parents as well. We replaced the battery on it before giving it to them. They love it. Before it, they had the iPhone 3GS. So this is an upgrade for them. No problems to report. And on it goes\u2026 My Macs are the same way. I even have the first Mac SE my father bought in 1989 long long ago still running fine (http://zippy.kicks-ass.org:9997). Apple hasn\u2019t done anything at all to make these devices less useful over time. In fact just the opposite is true. Apple has supplied updates to them to address security flaws and add new features to them far longer than most competing products on the market, breathing new life into them. And they are built really well so that as long as you take care of them and change the battery when needed, they will keep working indefinitely. There is such a thing as organic or natural obsolescence which occurs naturally to all technology as it gets gradually dwarfed and replaced by newer, faster, and better technology. But there is no nefarious intent with that natural phenomenon - it\u2019s just the way of the world and a fact of life we have to deal with. \u2026 The whole Throttle/Battery Gate \"issue\" is a sensational line of nonsense from people who don\u2019t have a good understanding of the engineering challenges involved, nor how the solutions to those challenges are actually implemented. The facts: Apple introduced the CPU throttling feature in iOS 10.2.1 (not iOS 11 as many erroneously claim) on January 23, 2017 and stated in the release notes that the release contained \"general bug fixes and performance improvements\", which is true since the feature improves (extends) the runtime of devices that have batteries that are unable to supply required current.A few days later in February 2017, after obtaining real world metrics about how the feature was actually working on real world devices outside of Apple, they revised the release note to further explain the improvement saying it \"improves power management during peak workloads to avoid unexpected shutdowns\". Any reasonable person who is even just superficially knowledgeable about electronics can easily infer from that statement that \"power management\" can at times mean reducing power consumption, which naturally means reducing performance.The feature works by detecting a malfunctioning battery that cannot supply enough current to the device, and reacting by automatically applying what can be described as a sort of low pass filter to prevent spikes in resource usage (performance), which in turn prevents the device from spontaneously shutting down, extending runtime. Nobody wants a phone that spontaneously shuts down at a critical moment, like during a 911 emergency call because the battery is old and can\u2019t sustain the load anymore. That's a marked improvement, as anyone who has ever had their phone spontaneously shut down on them like me can attest.The feature does not have any effect on devices with well-functioning batteries. In fact the feature doesn\u2019t apply the throttle until after the device first experiences a spontaneous shutdown.Even on devices with failing batteries, the feature does not affect most users most of the time because most smartphone apps don't cause CPU usage to spike significantly on a regular basis. Certain apps do, like games and so on. But you're not going to see a huge spike in resource usage from a lot of the apps people use the most, like the Contacts, Messages, or Safari apps, for instance.But some people don\u2019t understand the facts or have an irrational hatred of Apple, and only see a grand conspiracy by Apple to somehow fuck over millions of their own customers, which is patently false. Actually, all smartphone designers do things like this to conserve power when needed - and many do a much worse job than Apple: In-depth with the Snapdragon 810\u2019s heat problems Thermal Throttling \u2013 Which SOC\u2019s are the Worst Offenders?

They\u2019re made with the best technology Apple can produce, it just so happens that the technology has traditionally improved a great deal year-to-year, and the software has kept up with those advances. This is starting to slow down, so you can probably expect a 6S or 7 bought today to last maybe 7 or 8 years, assuming you replace the battery every 3 years or so. The actual hardware is very unlikely to \u201cfall apart\u201d \u2013 my iPhone 4S, bought in 2011, still looks and feels fine (if rather small by today\u2019s standards).
