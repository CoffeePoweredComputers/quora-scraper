            "answer_text": "I suppose I\u2019d buy the 2020 iPad and make do with an older keyboard or possibly get the smart keyboard. Why? I view the keyboard as an accessory (because it is). It can be purchased or upgraded at a later date. While I don\u2019t have an immediate need for Lidar at this time, maybe in the future I will. The GPU upgrade is so minimal you\u2019d never see a performance difference. The extra memory (6GB in the 2020 vs 4GB in the 2018 - assuming it\u2019s less than 1TB storage) would also help future proof the device. ",
