            "answer_text": "it takes only a little more power to start a computer (mostly because there's a lot of mechanical disk activity associated with boot up) than to leave it running.  If you use power conservation to hibernate or sleep your computer and shut down the screens and disks after a few minutes you can save quite a bit of power. So theoretically if you don't use it for three of four minutes you are better turning it off and when you need it boot it up which takes one to three minutes depending upon your machine speed. But it doesn't really cost a lot to keep it running in sleep mode  -which can make it available in less than ten seconds when you need to use it, including running your applications with your current work loaded. Hibernation saves more power and might take 30 seconds to start it up. My feeling is my time is valuable and I don't want to wait one to three minutes for a computer to boot up more time to  load my current work.I'll willingly pays a couple of dollars a month to not shut it down and have my computer respond to me immediately. Think about it, your computer probably costs about a penny per hour to run so turning it off for a half an hour is going to save, half a cent. ",

            "answer_text": "A computer takes roughly as much power during shutdown & startup as it does when you're actively using it. So if it takes, say, 30 seconds to shut down and 90 to start up, the restart power is about the same as two minutes of using it. Thus if it's a choice of leaving the computer full on vs. shutting it down, then shut it down, unless you think you'll need it in less than a few minutes. On the other hand, if your choice is between sleep and shutdown- I do have a little device that measures power consumption in real time, it is fun to play with-   It says my laptop uses about 22W when it is on, and 2W when it is off. In that case, sleep is better turning off for under an hour's worth of work. A quick search tells me that other laptops use even less power when sleeping, 0.1-0.5W is common, in which case, sleep is better than turning off for overnight. ",
