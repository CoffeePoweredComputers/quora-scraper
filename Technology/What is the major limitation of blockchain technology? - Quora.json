            "answer_text": "A great deal of hype has surrounded the blockchain, but there is reason to believe that the enthusiasm surrounding this distributed ledger has gotten a bit out of hand. To that end, individuals interested in the technology may benefit from being aware of the blockchain's limitations. Before i continue, Incase you are worried about what all these cryptocurrencies are heading to, DON'T GIVE UP!!! I almost gave up too but after much investigations to fine a legit platform where i can safely invest my portfolios, i came across Multicoinhodler Cryptocurrency Investment Platform (www . multicoinhodler . com) where i get good returns of my invested cryptocurrency after 10 trading days. I also mine with them and most importantly store my bitcoin securely with them. Don't be left out. Be like me. I still believe in Cryptocurrency. Be careful out there for there are so many fake investment website claiming to be paying. Blockchain Is Not The Only Solution Blockchain technology has many applications, but it is certainly not the only option available for executing transactions and managing data. There are plenty of more traditional technologies that can be used for managing data, such as relational databases like SQL Server and Oracle. While blockchain has its benefits, this technology also comes with its costs. Another way of putting this is that blockchain technology, like everything else, comes with its trade-offs. Throughput Challenges One major weakness that users and technologists have identified in blockchain technology is its low throughput. The distributed ledger system can only move information around so quickly. Bitcoin, for example, can process a maximum of seven transactions every second. However, the bitcoin network's ability to process transactions has become far slower at times, requiring upwards of 45 minutes at one point in early 2016. In contrast, Visa's network can process more than 50,000 transactions per second. Security Concerns The blockchain is vulnerable to something called a 51% attack, where a single organisation gains control of the majority of a network's mining power, also known as its hash rate. For example, bitcoin's network depends on miners confirming transactions and using something called a consensus algorithm to determine which transactions have taken place. Therefore, if an organisation gained control over most of the network's hash rate, it could potentially spend coins more than once, and even prevent certain transactions from being confirmed. Theoretically, executing a 51% attack would give the attacker the ability to alter blocks that are already part of the blockchain. While this may sound troubling, there is no straightforward method to prevent one of these attacks from affecting the bitcoin network. Because this network is decentralised, mining pools could potentially team up, consolidating enough mining power to establish the hash rate they need. However, it is important to keep in mind that actually executing a 51% attack, and subsequently changing blocks in the blockchain, would require immense resources ",

            "answer_text": "Every technology has it\u2019s limitations and they evolve eventually or risk becoming obsolete. Blockchain has come a long way since it\u2019s inception in Bitcoin. The Bitcoin blockchain has Scalability problems, Latency issues and many more. But since this question isn\u2019t about one Blockchain technology in particular, I would answer it in a more general way. Desire to apply it in all domains without proper reasoning:  There is not much understanding of the Blockchain technologies and the advantages they provide over existing technologies. A lot of developers are trying to use Blockchain as a solution to every problem that\u2019s out there. Desire to ride the Hype :  Blockchain technologies aren\u2019t mature yet. They are developing and evolving every day. A lot of products that are being developed as a POC on a Blockchain aren\u2019t even Blockchain secure. For ex, they store the data on a database and store the hash on Blockchain. In this case the application will still have a single point of failure in the form of the database. All it does is add Blockchain unnecessarily to a already working application. Self certified experts and evangelists :  Talking about Blockchain makes people sound cool, and others give attention to anyone who knows anything remotely related to Blockchain. This has lead to a lot of experts who can\u2019t technically explain Blockchain, which in result hurts the future development of the solutions based on the technology. Lack of technical awareness :  This is an extension of the previous point. People don\u2019t actually know much about blockchain technologies. And this has a far reaching consequence. Most of them aren\u2019t able to ask pertinent questions. Due to the lack of question, the improvement in the technology gets delayed. Case in point, Bitcoin blockchain. They haven\u2019t increased the block size, even though it has been under discussion since past 2 years. But I think, similar to internet, all these limitations will be overcome eventually. ",

Quick example for the UX. Imagine you want to purchase goods/services through a dApp, which has their own tokens. And you are a completely non-crypto person. So, in this case you have to get to know the concept, then create a wallet for example, buy ETH, then exchange for the dApp\u2019s specific token, etc. The whole process is pretty much against end users, who are not tech or crypto savvy. So what is the solution? We are currently building an internal project at my company called LimePay, and it will allow direct payments with fiat through a dApp. The whole process runs in the background and is facilitated through smart contracts so it\u2019s completely secured. How it looks like? In general, the user pays with a credit/debit card, we then communicate this with an external payment processor. When the payment is confirmed, we send the respective amount of tokens and directly sign the transaction in the name of the user. So for the user, the UX is the same as in a normal eCommerce site. If you want to learn more about LimePay, you can contact me directly or find me in Linkedin ",

            "answer_text": "Blockchain technology has the potential to disrupt and improve many industries and traditionally centralized systems. However, before it can become a real, viable alternative to its centralized counterparts, blockchains must be able to scale and process transactions at speeds way above its current capabilities. The number one limitation of blockchains is scalability. Put simply, it is hard for blockchains to grow and support increasing numbers of transactions. To visualize this, Visa and Mastercard can process thousands of transactions per second while Bitcoin can only process approximately 7 transactions per second. Solutions must be introduced to further enhance the capabilities of blockchains. There are generally 3 main attributes that must be considered when developing blockchains; Security: A distributed network is resistant to a wide variety of attacks or hacks such as 51% attacks, Distributed Denial-of-Service (DOS) attacks, and Sybil attacks. More importantly, blockchains are fault-tolerant, meaning that the system will continue to operate even if a component of the network fails. Decentralization: Perhaps the core tenant of Blockchain technology, open-source decentralization allows for a censorship-resistant, inclusive network that enables anyone to participate without prejudice. Scalability: This refers to the capacity of blockchains in processing transactions in the network. A scalable system can cater to more transaction and activity in the network without suffering from network stress. A blockchain can only choose 2 attributes and perhaps sacrifice an attribute. For instance, Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) were designed to focus on decentralization and network security. As a result, the attribute of scalability wasn\u2019t a core feature since both blockchains have incredibly slow processing speeds. This is because full decentralization and high levels of security require distributed consensus on the state of the blockchain, which can take significant amounts of time. This trilemma is a major consideration when evaluating various scaling solutions later on. Bear in mind that an extremely fast blockchain would need to give up some form of decentralization or security. Caution must, therefore, be taken to not only focus on scalability and speed. Balancing scalability, decentralization and network security is an intricate act that requires tremendous considerations. Sharding could be the key to allowing blockchains to scale while maintaining the privacy and security features that make the distributed ledger technology so hot. Sharding is one of several popular methods being explored by developers to increase transactional throughput. Simply stated, sharding is a way of partitioning to spread out the computational and storage workload across a peer-to-peer (P2P) network so that each node isn't responsible for processing the entire network's transactional load. Instead, each node only maintains information related to its partition or shard. The information contained in a shard can still be shared among other nodes, which keeps the ledger decentralized and secure because everyone can still see all the ledger entries; they simply don't process and store all the information. Sharding is a type of database partitioning that separates very large databases into smaller, faster, more easily managed parts called data shards. Applied to a blockchain, it means that the system could scale as more nodes are added to it. Some projects are also working on the idea of the nodes being run independently in standard off-the-shelf hardware, thus achieving true decentralization while also solving the scalability problem. A project I know of that is working on the latter thing is Shardus, based out of Dallas, Texas. Shardus is building an All peer-to-peer networks built using Shardus will benefit from sharding and auto-scaling to provide high throughput, low latency, and immediate finality while maintaining the highest level of decentralization and security. The supporting technology that allows for these features is a unique Shardus Consensus Algorithm, which is based on Proof-of-Quorum, in combination with the Shardus Distributed Ledger, which addresses the problems of linear scaling and state sharding as the network grows.

Internet criminal is there and I don\u2019t believe that the authorities could handle or manage it like they do with the criminals from the streets. Also, some people in the blockchain tech industry have pointed out that the industry has become overhyped.  Anyway, with the right and appropriate research and development, success and failure - we've learned the current issues of blockchains because of its: ComplexityBlockchain industry involves an entirely new vocabulary. Network sizeBlockchains are not so much resistant and are defined as \u201cantifragile\u201d. Transaction costs, network speedBitcoin recently has notable transaction costs, unlike the first years of its existence  Human errorThere is always the possibility of human error. Unavoidable security flawSecurity comes with bitcoin mining pools that are monitored closely by the community. PoliticsPolitics is involved deeply in this industry, because blockchain protocols offer an opportunity to actually digitize governance models. By some calculations, blockchain technology firms and companies can expect revenue to top $6 billion by 2020. Also, there are bad news \u2026 bad news are that actual earnings may be crippled or impacted if blockchain security vulnerabilities persist a sidenote to the conversation on distributed ledger technology. Security vulnerabilities (risks)? You are asking yourself \u201cwhat security vulnerabilities\u201d? Endpoint Vulnerabilities - One of the most likely vulnerabilities with distributed ledger technology originates outside the blockchain itself Vendor Risks - We might expect to see 3rd-party development with these 6 areas within the blockchain ecosystem: Blockchain integration platformsPayment processorsWalletsFintechBlockchain payment platformsSmart contractsUntested at Full Scale - What happens at full scale? Well, mistakes are inevitable, and for those who make them then the price will be high, actually.  Lack of Standards and Regulation - One of the primary blockchain security issues and risks is the lack of regulation and standards. The lack of standard protocols means that blockchain developers can\u2019t easily benefit from the mistakes of others. Untested Code - For 8 years of Bitcoin history, blockchains are still heavily experimental. Conclusion Blockchain industry has proven itself robust and secure. But this doesn\u2019t mean that there are not blockchain technology issues or problems that can affect the security of the entire ecosystem. That\u2019s why you have to get a better knowledge and thus by to be well experienced in the tech area so that the material for blockchain to be surmountable. Blockchain may be a nascent technology, but the future of this industry is already decidedly bright! ",

            "answer_text": "Presently, there are two main parts of the technical threats on the digital currency exchange and cryptocurrency exchange. 1. TRADITIONAL VULNERABILITIES ON THE INFORMATION SYSTEM SECURITY Intuitively, digital currency exchanges are not much different from traditional financial institutions. The entire information system incorporates web servers, back-end databases, and other elements. Users use browsers, mobile apps, and APIs, which provided by exchange platform, to do the daily transaction. We can see that the security threats lie mainly in server software vulnerabilities, improper configuration, DDoS attacks, server-side web application vulnerabilities (including technical vulnerabilities and business logic defects), and malicious attack after social engineering. For those large-scale exchanges with a large number of users, there are problems that the attackers use a phishing website to obtain authentication information of users. According to the official statement, the attackers used fraudulent scams to defraud users\u2019 authentication credentials, and then use the credentials to generate a large number of transactions, and other kinds of cryptocurrencies in the user\u2019s account. The transaction became bitcoin, and the currency was found to be abnormal in time, and the coin-withdraw request was held. Interestingly, although, the attacker can\u2019t raise the coin, they came up with another clever way of profiting. Using a large amount of bitcoin controlled by them to manipulate the market, affecting the price of other currencies, and then trading in another digital currency futures. The short-selling operation resulted in a profit of even more than $100 million without withdrawing bitcoin. Theoretically, they did not steal the digital currency, only \u201cchanged the currency\u201d. Because a large number of short orders were scattered in hundreds of exchange platforms, hardly can they be detected. Last month, a security team said that they found a zero-day vulnerability, which is a logical loophole in the entire station of a cryptocurrency exchange application. There are hundreds of small and medium-sized exchanges using the application. Although the public generally believes that large exchanges will not buy and use the whole station program developed by third-party developers, the fact that the cryptocurrency industry has high profits and rapid development does attract a flood in. Actually, there are many people who want to enter the market quickly. In the digital currency industry, some individuals and teams engaging in this type of development have limited ability to guarantee product quality, which is not surprising. For the solution to this kind of security threat, it can be prevented through the penetration service, code audit, and other security services. By mining and repairing the security vulnerabilities in the system, you can greatly mitigate the threat. 2. SMART CONTRACT SECURITY VULNERABILITIES Ethereum is known as the \u201cblockchain 2.0\u201d technology because it supports the operation of smart contracts. Ethereum bases on the Bitcoin system plus a \u201ccontract\u201d that defines the rules for reward distribution. The emergence of Ethereum provides a ready-made network of underlying blockchains on which developers can use their programming language, such as Solidity, to develop and deploy their own smart contracts, including simulating a bitcoin-like product. Due to the fact that Solidity is a complete programming language, it can theoretically be used to implement various distributed systems. After finishing the smart contract code, the code is deployed to the blockchain system and the program is executed on the EVM virtual machine of the Ethereum node. After the code is deployed to the blockchain, each node performs the consensus and synchronizes the data state. Like traditional programs, there are inevitable security vulnerabilities in smart contracts. The difference is that due to the unchangeable nature of blockchain, once the contract is deployed, it is difficult to fix the potential problem on the blockchain. For example, when token distribution contracts with vulnerabilities such as integer overflow are deployed, the vulnerability is triggered to be exploited. In a short period of time, a large number of tokens will affect the market value, which will cause huge losses for both the exchange and the users. This part of the security threat is very different from the traditional information security loophole. Similar attacks have occurred in traditional financial markets, such as the operation of Soros against the Hong Kong dollar during the Asian financial crisis of the late 20th century. The difference is that in the traditional financial market, in order to launch such an attack, requires a huge amount of financial support to achieve. In the field of cryptocurrency, people with the ability to exploit potential vulnerabilities are theoretically able to achieve such an attack. The actual threat situation may be much more serious than this. The reason why smart contracts are \u201csmart\u201d is that once the chain is deployed, the execution process is transparent, can\u2019t be falsified, and no human intervention is needed, which naturally solves the trust problem in the execution process. This is also the fundamental problem we want to solve when blockchain technology appears. On the other head, if a smart contract itself has a loophole and is used after the execution is started, which deviates from the original intention, the excellent characteristics of the blockchain technology will become an obstacle to save the lost. In response to this kind of security threat, the smart contract security audit work should be carried out to prevent the possible attack threats.

            "answer_text": "Current state of Blockchain\u2019s issues While technology has problems and should not be used for many digital interactions, some influential factors in the blockchain industry claim that blockchain receives too much attention.  However, through trial and error methods, research and development, we have many clues on the current issues of blockchain. Blockchain technology, can be defined as a complex system that made cryptography well known to the public. This is because there are a number of explanatory and useful guides and articles online. Factor of human error Like all distributed systems, if blockchain is used as a database, the information stored in it should be of high quality. The database should record the events as accurately as possible because the data stored in it are not 100 percent credible. If false data entered in the system, and the false data will also get out of it.  Dangers regarding the security flaw Satoshi Nakamoto, when he first launched bitcoin, spoke of the 51 percent attack. In case when more than half of the computers serving (like nodes) tell the lie, then the lie will become the truth. In order to prevent this, the community closely monitors the bitcoin mines. Political debates Blockchain protocols can digitize management models. Also, miners actually form another kind of motivated management model. So it is natural that there will be public disagreements among the various sectors of the community.  These debates usually include the situation of \"falsifying\" the system. This is a process that requires a blockchain protocol update update when a large percentage of network users have agreed to this. These disagreements are often very technical. But also informative for anyone interested in managing experiments, the situation this technology is opening up. ",

            "answer_text": "Blockchain technology is a typical example of a technology that is misunderstood by a large population despite being a popular and widely discussed topic. It has translated a lot of business modules into a successful model and has enhanced productivity. Blockchain, a distributed ledger technology is often associated with cryptocurrencies especially bitcoin that has gained more hype than any other blockchain development services which are offered by a typical blockchain development company.  Attacks The Proof of work agreement algorithm that protects the Bitcoin blockchain has proven to be very efficient over the years. However, there are a few strong attacks that can be performed against blockchain networks and attacks are among the most. Such an attack may happen if a single entity manages more than half of the network hashing power, which would allow them to disrupt the network by excluding or modifying the order of transactions. In spite of being theoretically possible, there was never a successful attack on the Bitcoin blockchain. When the network grows bigger the security increases and it is quite unlikely that miners will invest huge amounts of money and resources to attack Bitcoin as they are rewarded for acting honestly. Leaving that, a successful attack would only be able to modify the most recent transactions for a limited period of time because blocks are linked through cryptographic proofs. Also, the Bitcoin blockchain technology is very resilient and would quickly adapt as a response to an attack. Data modification Another disadvantage of the blockchain system is that once data has been added to the blockchain it is very difficult to edit or to modify it. While stability is one of the advantages of blockchain, which is not always good. Changing the data or code is usually very demanding and often requires hard work, where one chain is closed, and a new one is taken up. Private keys Blockchain development company uses asymmetric cryptography to give users ownership over their cryptocurrency units. Each block address has a corresponding personal key. Where the address can be shared, the personal key should be kept secret. Users need their personal keys to access their funds, meaning that they act as their own bank. If a user loses their personal key, the money is lost, and there is nothing can be done about it. Inefficient Blockchains, especially those using PoW, is highly inefficient. Anyway, mining is highly competitive and there is just one winner for every ten minutes, the work of another miner is wasted. As miners are continuously trying to increase their competitive power, so they have a higher chance of finding a valid block, the resources used by the Bitcoin network has gone higher significantly in the last few years, and it consumes more energy than many countries. Storage Blockchain technology ledgers can grow very huge overtime. The Bitcoin blockchain currently requires in and around 200 GB of storage space. The current growth in blockchain size appears to be exceeded the growth in hard drives and the network risks losing nodes if the ledger becomes too huge for all the individuals to download and store.

Like in bitcoins the data is of transaction and no data can be altered or deleted. Its visible and all can know about new additions to the data. 2.Decentralized Database: First of all, with blockchain, you get a distributed system. It means that it gets rid of any middlemen from your system. But how is that an advantage? In reality, middlemen tend to be the third party source that connects you to your services. 3.Secure: Everyblock that enters after all nodes verify it. Secondly every block is encrypted with a hash value. And it is extremely difficult to hack it as block chain is chain of blocks so to decrypt hash of one blog and change it and so for chained paired blocks is not that easy man!! 4.Faster Transaction: So, in times of an emergency, many consumers can\u2019t rely on the slow-paced system of traditional banks. However, with blockchain, you can complete a transaction within a few seconds!That\u2019s awfully faster than any traditional means so far. 5.True Trackability: Even the first block to block added a milli sec ago is traceable as blocks are immutable!! You can\u2019t change the data everrr and its visible for all at once!! Top 5 Disadvantages of Blockchain Technology 1.Can\u2019t Edit Data in a Block: Since blocks in blockchain are immutable. Chances of getting errored data FOREVERRRR is huge!! And, its awful when you could see your mistake lasting a lifetime! http://2.It is not for everyone: Well ofcourse blockchain is not intended for everyone or to solve every purpose out there!! Block chain is complicated and you need to get the essence of it to be able to crack it well! 3.Data is visible to all: That is a major major limitation that you are making a decentralized and distributed system whose data is visible to all the users. Access is the biggest thing in a system to play with functionality and that here has limited the game altogether! 4.Lower Performance: In reality, the computation needs of this technology are more repetitive than centralized servers. It\u2019s because every time the ledger is updated, all the nodes need to update their version of the ledger as well. http://5.It is costly to host: Decentralized means it is hosted at all the hosts where nodes are! So, there isn\u2019t only one server but multiple and huge amount of data means it is a costly stuff happening!! -Engineer Diaries(Follow Engineer Diaries for latest tech, startup and career news in India!)

            "answer_text": " The introduction of blockchain technology was focused on supporting the most famous cryptocurrency, Bitcoin. However, when we look at this technology today, it is evident that a lot has changed. It is bigger and has more potential for mass adoption. The possibilities that the adoption of blockchain technology has for different sectors is well documented. So, it is essential to also look at what its limitations are. The previous answers have already addressed limitations such as complexity, network size, human error, the 51% percent attack, bureaucracy, among others. In this response, I will add two more limitations that have not been addressed. They are: The absence of language richnessThe absence of distributed executionThe Absence of Language Richness The support offered in the description of smart contracts is not rich in features when it is compared to the standard web or desktop languages. This limitation creates design challenges whereby intricate multi-source protocols need to be developed. In such cases, schemes have to be taken out of the confines smart contracts, run the multi-party protocols and then come back with the outcomes. Such a scenario is not ideal because developers end up designing two systems. The first one runs on the blockchain, while the second one runs off it. Therefore, there is a need for an improvement in the language\u2019s features to ensure that all application semantics stay inside the blockchain network. Absence of Distributed Execution In the implementation of smart contracts, designers either depend on the client-side execution or the off-blockchain server-side execution. This means that designers have limited to no support for peer-to-peer network side execution. The implication of this shortcoming is the introduction of possible weaknesses since some of the safety, verification, and privacy-linked execution tasks have to be done outside the blockchain network. Whichever way you look at it, such a scenario is not welcome in any respect. A possible resolution to this problem is designing the blockchain network in a way that augments block mining and distributed computing. ",

            "answer_text": " This is way to broad, each blockchain has it\u2019s own tradeoffs. It is not a magic bullet. I\u2019m going to answer this question in respect to Bitcoin \u2014 the most mature blockchain technology. Privacy I know every blockchain consultant out their says bitcoin is anonymous \u2014 resist the urge to believe everything they say \u2014 they either don\u2019t know what they are talking about or are misleading you. Bitcoin has a public ledger that indicates how much money everyone has. Anyone can look at this ledger and see what the balance of a specific address is. These addresses are pseudononymous \u2014 but once I transact with you I can reasonably guess what addresses are yours \u2014 and then reasonably guess how much money you have! This is bad! We need to encrypt the amounts in a transaction to make Bitcoin much more private. In an ideal world, a third party should be able to see a transaction on the network and look at a mathematical proof that the encrypted amounts are valid on the network \u2014 that is the proof tells us the user didn\u2019t create money out of thin air \u2014without seeing the original amounts themselves. To add these encrypted amounts in Bitcoin, we need to add more data to each individual transaction on the network. Right now each Bitcoin transaction is ~300 bytes in size. We have this new awesome technology called Confidential Transactions that would vastly improve the privacy of Bitcoin transactions \u2014 but it requires 1.5 kilobytes of data on a transaction \u2014 nearly 5x the size of a current transaction! Because of this, confidential transactions are unlikely to make it into Bitcoin in their current form. Hopefully some cryptographers smarter than I can figure out how to optimize confidential transactions. ",

            "answer_text": "Blockchain technology has become a hot spot in the industry because of Bitcoin. Its decentralized technology framework can solve some problems that cannot be centralized and managed across industries and across regions, and has broad commercial application prospects. However, due to the lack of killer applications, the market promotion is slow. At present, the technical problems of the blockchain itself have not been properly solved, and the large-scale use of the technology has also been limited. In addition, the lack of industry norms, the timeliness of the introduction of relevant national policies, and the uncertainty of industry regulation will increase the risk of investing in blockchain technology. a) Challenges: i. Technical aspects: Some of the characteristics of the blockchain technology itself limit the commercialization process. 1. Performance: The performance of the blockchain node determines the speed of the transaction. At present, the mature blockchain system can trade at a speed of up to 3000 TPS. If you want to do commercial large-scale, performance is not enough. 2. Scalability: The blockchain adopts distributed nodes. It is difficult to increase the computational power through traditional horizontal expansion (increasing the number of nodes). At present, companies have studied the use of logical nodes to increase the computational unit under the logical nodes. Improve performance. 3. Security: There are also 51% attacks in theory. For example, if more than 51% of the accountants modify the accounting records, the previous transactions can be overturned. 4. Many of the problems in blockchain technology have not been resolved, and there are no large-scale application cases for test verification. The number of nodes in Bitcoin, the most successful commercial case, is only about 20,000. ii. Application Scenario: At present, blockchain technology is very hot, but there is still a lack of killer applications on the market to promote the development of blockchain technology. The most successful application at the moment is Bitcoin. iii. Standard level: The current technical standards are missing, and no mature solutions have been formed in terms of storage, communication, transmission, and network security. iv. Policy regulation: The application of blockchain technology will also be affected by the regulatory level. Recently, domestic ICO-related token-issuing products have been characterized as suspected of illegal fund-raising. The policies and regulations related to the blockchain vary from country to country. With the rapid evolution of the blockchain and the development of business, policies and regulations must also be properly adjusted to better promote the business of blockchain healthy growth.

            "answer_text": "Recently, I answered an interesting question about the advantages of blockchain. While writing it, I was also thinking about the limitation of blockchain or, in simple terms, \u201cblockchain limitations.\u201d Blockchain, just like any other technology, is not perfect. There are of course limitations of blockchain. This can easily equate to the challenges of blockchain as well. So, what limits blockchain? Let\u2019s discuss this. 1. Excessive Energy One of the primary concerns with current blockchain systems is that they utilize excessive energy. Bitcoin, the first cryptocurrency, utilizes blockchain as the underlying technology. It uses Proof-of-Work(PoW), which needs computers to validate blocks by solving complex mathematical equations. This requires spending energy. Initially, the mathematical equations were not hard to solve, but with time, the complexity increased -- which means requiring powerful hardware to solve them, resulting in excessive energy utilization. However, not all blockchain solution or consensus algorithms uses energy as a way to validate transactions. In those cases, energy is preserved and utilizes only when needed. 2. Not the ultimate solution I know that blockchain can solve almost everything around us. But, it doesn\u2019t mean that it is an ideal solution for everything out there. Thee are other solutions such as SQL databases that do a better job when it comes to storing and retrieving data. But, why am I referring to this example? Well, it is common for industry people to refer to blockchain as a distributed database. That\u2019s obvious as it stores data in blocks and provides immutability. Another challenge of blockchain that limits it is the cost associated with implementing a blockchain solution. Not all businesses can start adopting blockchain due to the cost of implementation. 3. Throughput Blockchain might be one of the fastest ways to complete a transaction, but another aspect needs to be addressed before it is ready to be used in more mainstream applications. One such challenge is the throughput of the blockchain networks. Blockchain networks are not very efficient when it comes to carrying out tons of transactions at one given time. This is because of how the consensus method works and the time it takes to reach a consensus before the block is added to the chain. That\u2019s why you will see that Etheruem is doing 15 TPS, whereas bitcoin-only is able to do 4.6 transactions per second. Visa, on the other hand, is capable of doing 24,000 transactions per second. 4. Implementation challenges Even though blockchain has matured enough in 2020, it still has multiple implementation challenges with it. For instance, businesses need to think about the cost associated with moving their current business process to the blockchain. They also need to think about the platform they are going to choose and then source developers and experts to do the transit. As blockchain is a growing industry, fewer professionals can handle this kind of project. However, the landscape is changing as anyone can take professional blockchain certification and try their luck in the ever-changing landscape. 5. Security Concerns The last aspect that I want to share is security related to blockchain. There is no doubt that blockchain utilizes state-of-the-art cryptography when it comes to data encryption. But still, it is not 100% secure as it is vulnerable to the 51% attack. In this attack, if a person or organization holds more than 50% of the network resources, he can alter the block data and steal information or associated cryptocurrency that can be valued in millions.

            "answer_text": "Limitations are based on the lack of skill of some people who would find the technology a bit complicated and the number of people who are truly interested about the tech in the first place. Yes maybe blockchain may have been overrated at times, overhyped some may say but there is also truth within those information. Like with any technology, blockchain has its own limitations it isn't really the answer to all life's problems. Although we cant ignore the fact we are talking about its effect if the application is done right. We have seen platforms that provides convenience and security when it comes to finances and businesses. Let's take Symbol from NEM for example. We all know that NEM which was once one of the main cryptocurrencies on the market and today is among the top 50 in the crypto ecosystem have developed Symbol. What they intend to do is to reduce operating costs and at the same time provide new ways to create value. Making it simpler for companies to design private, open or hybrid blockchains with different level of interactions. By using Symbol, it is more functional, scalable and feature rich protocol, it will become the main engine of NEM fueling public and private blockchains. Now platforms like these needs people who knows the ins and out of the tech itself, if they hire people who wouldn't even bother learning it in the first place that's how you end up with that limitation. Other than thay blockchain is effective as it is just make sure it is being managed or produced by the right people. ",

            "answer_text": "When blockchain emerged, as any new technology, anyone was capable of implement it right away as there was too much work to do to make it an usable technology for all the people. That\u2019s what so many companies are working towards at the moment. But there are serious, concrete problems which aren\u2019t 100% solved at this moment in the crypto development world. One of those problems is the Limited Scalability problem. It means that the blockchain you launch will share infrastructure with the blockchain you\u2019re basing your app on (For example: if you launch an ERC-20 Token based on Ethereum) and with the other hundreds or thousands of blockchains who also share with you the main blockchain. The consequences of this is: Congestion, slow transaction speeds, and high fees, which will be a big disadvantage for anyone who wants to adopt your crypto. There are few projects that have proposed a real solution for this, one of those is Komodo Platform. They fix this problem providing independent and interoperable blockchains for any project based on Komodo, avoiding the limited scalability problem and without losing the benefits of being based on Komodo, as the delayed Proof-of-Work (dPoW) Security protocol, that would be the second issue that Komodo solves and most altcoins suffer. And it\u2019s the independent blockchain security issues, as most independent Proof-of-Work blockchain altcoins doesn\u2019t have enough hashrate (mining power) to make them less prone to be affected by a 51% Attack. Komodo also fix this problem with the Delayed Proof-of-Work Which is a security layer that will protect any coin with the Bitcoin hasrate while having a blockchain independent from bitcoin. ",

It is the same with Blockchain technology as well. When it was invented it became one of the most important inventions, however, as time passed, IT experts realized that there were limitations to the technology.  Here I am listing the five major limitations/issues of blockchain technology \u2014 1.Energy: Blockchain technology requires supercomputers or similar powerful hardware resources for each transaction, that can lead to heavy energy consumption. This is because miners spend a large amount of computing power to solve the computations to both verify and process the transactions. 2. Privacy: Despite the fact that the identities are anonymous, there are patterns to the transactions that can easily reveal the identity of the user with a particular address. An easy way to extract information about the user. 3. Risk of error: As long as there is a human element involved, there are definite of chances of errors happening. The risk of error increases when blockchain is being used as a database. One minor inaccuracy, the trustworthiness of entire stored data becomes questionable. 4.Lack of certified professionals & complexity: As blockchain technology gained popularity, industry experts realized that this technology is not easy to learn, as it involves complex mathematical calculations. In addition, there is a huge dearth of certified blockchain professionals who can handle this technology with a practiced ease. 5. Scalability: Another major limitation, as all the transactions have to be verified by each and every node in the network, it can limit the speed of the transaction process thus leading to scalability issue. These are just some of the major limitations that I have listed here, but there are others like \u2013 expensive setup cost, lack of technical knowledge, network speed and politics among others. ",

            "answer_text": "It is easy to get caught up in the hype surrounding Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, and many people have bought them with the thought that the blockchain has unlimited potential. Unfortunately, that is not the case. Here are some noteworthy challenge and limitations to the blockchain concept, and be aware of those limitations is critical. 1. Complexity- Blockchain technology involves a completely new vocabulary. It has made cryptography more predictable, but the blockchain industry is full of jargons & slang. The algorithm and the network of nodes, validate entries in the blockchain. These all are not understood by most people and it is not possible to have a trustworthy service without a trustworthy party. 2. Cost- At present, Bitcoin has a notable transaction cost after being recommended as \u201cnear free\u201d for the first few years of its existence. Each transaction in the Bitcoin network costs about $0.20. Apart from the transaction fees storing the information in the Bitcoin network is also chargeable. This is called bloating and is often questioned because it forces miners to perpetually reprocess and rerecord the information. 3. Safety flaw- Blockchain technology operates as a push-based settlement system. This means every individual in the Bitcoin Network holds power over the resource they want to verify on the blockchain. This is one prominent safety flaw in Bitcoin and different blockchain networks. A lie will grow to be the reality if greater than half of the computer systems working as nodes to service the community inform a lie. This flaw was highlighted by Satoshi Nakamoto when he launched Bitcoin which is known as 51% assault. And because of this, Bitcoin mining pools are monitored carefully by the validators, guaranteeing nobody unknowingly positive factors such community effect. 4. Human error- Like all distributed systems if a blockchain is used as a database, the information going into the database needs to be of eminence quality. The data stored on a blockchain is not instinctively trustworthy, so events need to be recorded accurately in the first place. The phrase garbage in and garbage out is valid in blockchain world record, just as with a centralized record. 5. Large energy consumption- The crypto miners network work with 450 thousand trillions solutions per second in efforts to authorize the digital transactions via wide amounts of computer power. As the blockchain technology is growing more computing devices are required to process even the smallest digital transaction. The system should support thousands of transactions per second and the blockchain size will be overstuffed in no time. Although the younger networks or small blockchains wouldn\u2019t experience the same problem, but there\u2019s no denying that this is a major limitation of the blockchain technology. ",

            "answer_text": "History has shown that innovations in various technologies spread at such a rapid pace among consumers and communities that the latter hardly paid a more serious attention to existing flaws and limitations of these innovations. Quite similar is the case with blockchain technology. Only through trial and error as well as through research and development experts in the field were able to understand its current issues and limitations. Check out the FinTech minig review of market to get the latest updates of market. Energy The blockchain has been heralded as a possible solution to global warming, by providing a transparent currency that isn\u2019t based on consumption. But the distributed ledger technology leaves a massive carbon footprint of its own. The computing power required to processes bitcoin dwarfs that of the world's fastest 500 supercomputers combined.  Network Size Blockchains require a large network of users. If a blockchain does not hold a robust network with a widely distributed grid of nodes, it becomes more difficult to reap the full benefit. Complexity First of all, blockchain technology is associated with tremendous complexity and an array of highly-specialized terms.  Fortunately for people whose expertise falls outside blockchain, there are several on-line glossaries and indexes, which provide a profound and easy to apprehend explanation of both basic and more specific terms related to that industry. Network growth Second, a blockchain\u2019s network of users is vast and constantly growing, which facilitates a stronger response to attacks. In case a blockchain does not have a robust network with well distributed grid of nodes, it may not be possible to reap the full benefit of such a technology. However, there still is a risk of internal defects occurring and let us also not forget that there are physical limitations, because all the data has to be physically stored. Risk of error Third, there is always a risk of error occurring, as long as the human factor is involved. In case a blockchain serves as a database, all the incoming data has to be of high quality. If all occurring events are not originally registered with accuracy, then the trustworthiness of the stored data could be seriously in doubt. In case unreliable, incorrect information goes into the blockchain, then unreliable, incorrect data will also go out from it. Speed and cost of transactions During the first several years following Bitcoin\u2019s launch, transactions in this digital currency were considered as \u201dnearly free\u201d. As of now, however, transaction costs associated with Bitcoin are notable. At the end of 2016, for instance, every single transaction in Bitcoin cost approximately $0.20 and allows users to store 80 bytes of data. As far as the speed of the Bitcoin network is concerned, currently only seven transactions per second could be processed.We should also note that for some time there have been diverging views regarding the use of the Bitcoin blockchain. Some of the opinions claimed that the blockchain should not concern transactions, but data storage instead. This leads us to another debatable topic \u2013 the so called \u201dblockchain bloat\u201d.  The latter has both positive and negative aspects. A positive aspect is the increasing number of transactions on the blockchain. This suggests a larger number of people using that blockchain and also speaks positively for the adoption of the particular digital currency in a long term. More users and more transactions are the major factors behind the accelerated growth in the size of Bitcoin and Ethereum blockchains compared to almost any other digital currency in circulation. However, increasing number of transactions equals increasing amount of data going into the respective blockchain. And, as more data comes in, this brings forth the matter involving the active storage of all that information. In such a case, the use of a hard drive with huge capacity is completely understandable, though it may turn out to be an issue for those who operate a network node. If Bitcoin and Ethereum blockchains keep on growing at their current daily rate, it may not be that long before we witness blockchains of a few terabytes in size. When it comes to the negative aspects of blockchain bloat, we should note that as blockchains grow larger, the size of each block has to increase as well. In case that does not happen, then fewer transactions will be processed with each block on the network. And, in order to address such an issue, experts in the field have already proposed \u201dscaling solutions\u201d. Thanks! FinTech Mining Review ",

            "answer_text": "Blockchain tech has a lot of disadvantages. The first one is performance. In general, blockchain networks perform much worse than a private database because all the data must be validated by all the participating nodes. The second drawback is scalability. Because of its immutability feature, blockchain is an ever growing database, do it can become very large and difficult to store. The third problem is that you need consensus on the network to change any data validation rule, so business process upgrades can be a problem. In some scenarios, data transparency is another disadvantage. By default, all data stored in a blockchain is freely available to all participating nodes. There are some techniques to store sensitive data like channels and cryptography, but they usually cause validation problems. In public networks, energy consumption is another concern, as large networks like Bitcoin consume a lot of energy in its proof of work to avoid Sybil attacks. It is not a problem in private blockchains where nodes are known. All these problems are active research fields, do expect improvement like sharding and proof of stake soon. ",

            "answer_text": "Blockchain has become one of the IT sector's most widely discussed technologies. Blockchain technology is already being used in large-scale industrial applications by companies only a few years ago. Although the technology itself is innovative, it has come up with some limitations. Such shortcomings of blockchain do not make the technology less innovative, but have raised questions about its efficacy and accuracy. The most important limitation of the blockchain technology are the security issues. Network security flaws The vulnerabilities associated with the entire blockchain often increase with the increasing number of nodes or blocks in a blockchain technology. There is one obvious security flaw among all possible security vulnerabilities that can affect the blockchain network. If something is validated by more than half of the computers working as nodes in a blockchain network then it is considered true. Do it follows that if more than half of a network's nodes tell a lie, then the whole blockchain network will consider the lie as fact. This is known as the fifty-one percent attack, which in blockchain and its implementations it is an intrinsic security flaw and may well be the most significant weakness of blockchain. The whole blockchain can be seen as a database, and each block can be treated as a storage unit, but people are still fed the data entering the blockchain network. Such data must be of good quality because there is no realistic method for tracking the information being exchanged in a blockchain network. Inherently, the data stored in a blockchain is not trusted. ",

            "answer_text": "Wastefullness Every Node runs the blockchain in order to maintain Consensus across the blockchain. This gives extreme levels of fault tolerance, ensures zero downtime, and makes data stored on the blockchain forever unchangeable and censorship-resistant. But all this is wasteful, as each Node repeats a task to reach Consensus burning electricity and time on the way. This makes computation far slower and more expensive than on a traditional single computer. There are many initiatives that seek to reduce this cost focusing on alternative means of maintaining Consensus, such as Proof-of-Stake. Network speed/cost Blockchain networks require Nodes to run. But as many of the networks are new, they lack the number of Nodes to facilitate widespread usage. This lack of resource manifests as: Higher costs\u200a\u2014\u200aas Nodes seek higher rewards for completing Transactions in a Supply and Demand scenario Slower transactions\u200a\u2014\u200aas Nodes prioritise Transactions with higher rewards, backlogs of transactions build up Over time, successful public blockchain networks will have to incentivise Nodes, whilst creating favourable costs for users, with transactions completed in a relevant timeframe. This balance is key to the economics of each blockchain. The size of the block Each transaction or \u201cblock\u201d added to the chain increases the size of the database. As every node has to maintain a the chain to run, the computing requirements increase with each use. For large public implementations of Blockchain this has one of two affects: Smaller ledger\u200a\u2014\u200aNot every Node can carry a full copy of the Blockchain, potentially affecting immutability, consensus etc. More centralised\u200a\u2014\u200aThere is a high barrier to entry to become a Node, encouraging a larger amount of centralisation in the Network, with bigger players able to take more control. Neither of these scenarios is desirable, without considering the full implications, as it will likely affect the use cases for blockchain variants Hard and Soft Forks Many blockchains and currencies decentralise their decision making. For example Bitcoin allows Nodes to \u201cSignal\u201d support for improvements to the core Software that run the network. This allows the blockchain to avoid centralised decision making, but also presents challenges when communities are divided about the best course. When Nodes change their Software, there is potential for a \u201cFork\u201d in the Chain. Nodes operating the new Software will not accept the same transactions as Nodes operating the old one. This creates a new blockchain, with the same history as the one it is built on. Forks create significant uncertainty, as they have the potential to fragment the power of the blockchain network into lots of variants. They are also likely to be necessary, as without the capacity to update the Software, the blockchain is unlikely to be future proof. ",

            "answer_text": "How Blockchain Is Transforming Businesses - Day One In my opinion, the biggest limitation which Blockchain technology has, is scalability. Blockchain transactions are sluggish in nature. In a world, where time is money (literally!) sluggish nature of transactions is a no-no. For everyone. From business owners to merchants to consumers. Blockchain transactions, in some cases, are even slower than traditional modes of transactions. According to Inc 42, while Visa has the capability to process 65,000 transactions/second, Blockchain can only process 7 transactions/second. The only way to overcome this issue is by having a centralized architecture, which can save time and speed. However, this brings in other issues as well. If there is a centralized architecture, the network should have an adequate number of users on the network which in case of Blockchain is a number more than >50 of mining power. If there are a lesser number of individuals on the network, then there is every chance of someone manipulating the data. Scalability issues can be solved if the model works on the Proof-of-Stake model, instead of the Proof-of-Work model. However, the Proof-of-Stake model is not regarded as an ideal model. Proof-of-Work though is secure but is extremely slow. Alternative models are still being developed, however, at the time of writing this, none of the models have been validated or have shown effective results. ",

How to overcome particular limitations has been, and still is, an area of active research and further developments. A detailed discussion of these activities is beyond the scope of this book. However, the following sections sketch how to overcome the limitations of the blockchain. Technical Limitations Overcoming the technical limitations of the blockchain may require interventions on all components and technical levels. One of the major challenges in overcoming technical limitation of the blockchain is the distinction between improving its technology and changing its technology fundamentally. The next step discusses this subject in more detail. Nontechnical Limitations The nontechnical limitations of the blockchain can be seen as social, economic, legal, and psychological aspects of adapting to a new technology. Education and legal initiatives can be seen as the appropriate measures to master the adoption of the blockchain. The example of the Internet and e-commerce has already shown that it takes time to answer legal questions that come with new technologies and that it takes time for users to understand, trust, and use them. Fortunately, the case of the Internet and e-commerce has also illustrated that educational initiatives about the functioning of a new technologies increase its acceptance and adoption among users and foster the solution of legal issues.

The Internet finally, however, became successful till today. But it isn\u2019t all a success. It is because of this same internet that many of the world\u2019s population is being monitored on their phones, laptops, and any other device we use around us. It\u2019s because of the internet that one can wake up and have their entire bank account or credit card balance wiped out. It\u2019s the same internet that enables intruders to get access to your files and let you pay a ransom for your own data. All happened because of \u2018the human being\u2019 We recorded almost every transaction with papers in the olden days. When computers came and later databases, we said \u2018wow\u2019, this is the right system. We adopted it and everything was going on well. These same databases have been hacked and organizations get their data sold out to those in need and deleted forever. It\u2019s the human being again. Cloud also came. Hackers intrude systems everyday. It\u2019s the same human being. So Blockchains are here. The technology will surely change a lot of things, but as many put it, blockchain technology isn\u2019t \u201cautomagic\u201d. It won\u2019t solve problems on its own. It won\u2019t create records on its own. It won\u2019t timestamp transactions by itself. Everything is coded by humans. So in the end, it is what these humans use the technology for that will determine its use and its impact, either in the positive or negative aspect on life. And I bet you, just as we think good, we should think bad as well. The blockchain could spark a new group of intruders. It\u2019s just a matter of time. After all, Blockchain isn\u2019t some \u201cbig bang\u201d theory out of the blue.

Whilst the underlying technology that Satoshi Nakamoto created has never been hacked, it is how we, as a collective voice, handle crytpocurrencies. Cryptocurrencies are designed to take the banks and institutions out the picture - but that puts the responsibility of holding on to our crypotcurrencies back on to us as individuals. Over $2bn of Bitcoins have been stolen, hacked or scammed since 2009 (around 20% of all bitcoins). This includes the $61m hack of the Bitfinex Exchange in Hong Kong and the DAO attack (c $53m) Try sitting in a boardroom and convincing a compliance officer the funds are safe with these sorts of numbers floating around. Security (and perception of security) are critical to the future success or failure of blockchain technology. There are a host other areas to consider also like scalability, but without security no scale will be seen - not commercially in any case. ",

            "answer_text": "The secret to Blockchain\u2019s success is certainly not its computational efficiency or its scalability in the consumption of resources. In fact Blockchains are one of the most inefficient form of data storage in terms of throughput. Blockchains are heavily redundant which makes them bloated and slow. Private Blockchains are very useful if we have multiple entities in a ecosystem where trust might be a concern. Blockchains provide a way to increase transparency and maintain tamper-proof data. Public Blockchains take it further by converting the above process into a decentralised operation. For Example, Bitcoins can be transferred from one entity to another entity across the world without the intervention of centralised third parties. Ethereum provides an option to run censorship proof applications through its decentralised platform. Without Decentralization, Blockchains become a yet another Transparent, Distributed Database. The biggest disadvantage in using Blockchain is relinquishing control. Decentralized applications are censorship resistant. They dont require Governments\u2019 approval to process. Governments cannot infuse Credit or terminate transactions on a Crypto-Currency based monetary system. Governments and Corporations if they embrace Public Blockchain, they lose their discretionary powers to make arbitrary changes into the Blockchain. Override is not an option with Blockchain. The code is law and smart contracts get executed when conditions are satisfied irrespective of the preferences of the entity that created the smart contract. Existing Smart Contract may have to be discarded and New Smart contract has to be created to process Exceptions that weren't thought-of initially. ",

Lack of Understanding Many of us only that Blockchain is just a disruptive tech which can take over many industries in future. However, little do we understand the primary objectives behind building Blockchain based applications. Less Technical Knowledge of Blockchain Blockchain is no doubt a revolutionary technology, but there still is a very low number of Blockchain developers in the market. It is not a new thing but it has just started to grip the market, so it is necessary for developers to get to know of this tech so that paper work can convert into real life examples. The special expertise in Blockchain is a must have tool for developers so that Blockchain can survive this early phase. Immutable Nature It is good to have immutable technology around your system but it could be the worst thing if you need to modify or reverse any process. Which in Blockchain is impossible. The immutability undoubtedly can be great in many ways but still, there will be a time when you would be needing to modify the content. Read More About Limitations & Benefits of Blockchain ",

It has made cryptography more mainstream, but the highly specialized industry is no place for a beginner. Thankfully there are blockchain and cryptocurrency courses and indexes being created for newcomers, but overall this is a very complicated industry that will not be soaked in and applied overnight. Network Size: Blockchains require a large network of users. If a blockchain does not hold a robust network with a widely distributed grid of nodes, it becomes more difficult to reap the full benefit. Human Error If a blockchain is used as a database, the information going into the database needs to be of high quality. The data stored on a blockchain is not inherently trustworthy, so events need to be recorded accurately in the first place. Unavoidable Security Flaw There is one notable security flaw in Bitcoin and other blockchains: If more than half of the computers working as nodes to service the network tell a lie, the lie will become the truth. This is called a \u201851% attack\u2019 and was highlighted by Satoshi Nakamoto when he launched bitcoin. Thanks! Mohsin Jameel ",

            "answer_text": "Hello. Blockchain, I believe you are already familiar with it, then I will not be specifically introduced here. Based on my personal past experience, after a lot of data summarization and analysis, in view of the understanding of the blockchain. Below I will summarize the shortcomings of the blockchain.  1. Blockchain is immutable and irrevocable Can not return in the blockchain, you can not change its data, it is mainly reflected in: when you fill in the wrong address, this will cause permanent loss and can not be revoked. I once had this experience. When I was making EOS transfers with other people, I misplaced the address. As a result, I lost a sum of money. Of course, this money cannot be recovered. In addition, if you lose the key, it will also cause permanent loss and be irreparable. This feature is not only the shortcomings of the blockchain but also its advantages, making people love and hate. 2. Its transaction book is public The blockchain is distributed. In the public chain, it means that everyone has a full booklet on hand, and since the blockchain calculation balance, verification transaction validity, etc. all need to be traced back to each account, the transaction data is Open and transparent, if I know someone's account, I can know all his wealth and every cryptocurrency transaction, and there is no privacy. 3. The larger the data comes with the performance issues As mentioned above, each person has a full book and sometimes needs to trace every record. Therefore, as time progresses, when the transaction data is oversized, there will be performance problems, such as the need to download history for the first time. All transaction records can work properly. Each transaction needs to trace every transaction in history to calculate the balance in order to verify that you really have enough money. Although some technical means (such as indexing) can be used to alleviate performance problems, the problem is still obvious, Bitcoin is the best example. 4. Blockchain delays There is a delay in the transaction of the blockchain. Take the ETC as an example. The effectiveness of the currently generated transaction is affected by the network transmission, because most of the nodes on the network are aware of the transaction and must wait until the next billing cycle (ETC control In about 10 minutes), that is to be recognized by most nodes in this transaction. Also affected by a small probability event is that when there are two or more nodes competing for accounting rights on the network, two or more blockchain branches will be generated in the network. If it is valid, it will wait for the next billing cycle and will ultimately be determined by the longest blockchain branch. So blockchain transaction data is delayed. These are the shortcomings of the blockchain that I have summarized. I hope this helps you. ",

            "answer_text": "Disadvantages of blockchain technology: 51% attack Even if the proof-of-work mechanism (PoW) has effectively secured the security of the Bitcoin blockchain for a long time, some potential attacks still exist, the most common being \"51% attacks\". If a single individual controls more than half the hash power of the entire network, this attack is likely to occur. Once such an attack occurs, it may eventually cancel transactions or change the order of transactions, thereby disrupting the entire network. Data modification Another disadvantage of the blockchain system is that once the data is recorded, it is difficult to modify it. Although stability is one of the advantages of the blockchain, it can sometimes cause some inconvenience. Changing the data or code of the blockchain is particularly difficult, and often requires a hard fork, that is, replacing an old chain with a new chain. Private key The blockchain uses public key (or asymmetric) encryption to give users ownership of digital currency (or other blockchain data). Each blockchain address has a corresponding private key. Because the address is public, the private key must be kept secure. Users must provide private key information in order to operate their digital property. The private key is like the key to open their private bank. If the user loses his private key, the property will be lost. Inefficient Blockchain, especially the main chain using the PoW proof mechanism, is very inefficient. Therefore, the mining competition is very fierce, and every 10 minutes, only one miner can get a reward, and the work of other miners is wasted. In order to be able to find the hash value of the block, miners have to constantly try to improve their computing power. In the past few years, the bitcoin network has consumed a significant amount of resources. Currently, it requires more energy than many countries such as Denmark, Ireland, and Nigeria. capacity The ledger of the blockchain will become abnormally large over time. At present, the Bitcoin network needs about 200G of the capacity to store its data information. The increase in the amount of block data significantly exceeds the increase in the amount of hard disk storage. When the amount of ledger information is greater than the storage capacity of the personal hard disk, then these nodes will no longer be useful. Despite the above shortcomings of the blockchain, its unique advantages are also the main reason why it has attracted much attention today. Although it is still a while before the blockchain is widely used, the good trend is that many industries have begun to study the advantages and disadvantages of the blockchain system. In the next few years, many companies and governments are likely to try to discover the maximum value of blockchain systems. ",

            "answer_text": "The biggest limitations with blockchains are, in my opinion, these 3: PrivacyScalabilityLack of efficiencyBlockchains are not private. In fact, that\u2019s the only way they seek to topple current systems that the world uses. If you\u2019re removing middlemen - such as banks - from transactions, you need to make the entire system public in order to prevent fraud. Fortunately, people do seem to have stumbled upon workarounds to this issue. Monero, the private cryptocurrency, manages to keep its blockchain private whilst ensuring that no rules are broken and that no fraud is committed. Scalability remains another rather large issue. Due to their very nature, blockchains require that every node connected to them run through the entire blockchain in order to verify details. Over time, this can mean having to download ridiculously large amounts of data even though you may only be concerned with a couple of transactions pertaining to you. If a blockchain is 50 GB in size, with over a million nodes, that\u2019s over 50 million GB being downloaded in order to keep the system secure. One solution to this is to use offchain solutions that don\u2019t burden the main chain so much, and help people avoid data they have nothing to do with. There\u2019s still plenty of work to be done in this area though. Efficiency is an issue commonly highlighted due to Bitcoin\u2019s Proof of Work algorithm, which requires miners/nodes to solve complex problems in order to secure the network. This is a first-past-the-post system, which means that the miner that manages to solve problems first, gets to add the next block to the blockchain. What this also means is that all efforts from the other miners is rendered useless. This cycle repeats with the addition of every block to the blockchain. We need to move to better models, such as Proof Of Stake, to combat this. ",

In any case, similar to any new innovation, blockchain is as yet youthful in its execution, so it can unmeet the desires for financial specialists. Thus, numerous blockchain new companies can be viewed as only an exercise in futility and cash. Bogus beginnings in blockchain arrangement will lead associations to bombed developments, careless choices, and even total refusal of this imaginative innovation. Without a doubt, blockchain innovation later on will influence each part of organizations, however this is a progressive procedure that requires time and tolerance. Gartner predicts that most customary organizations will watch out for blockchain innovation, yet won't design any activities, sitting tight for more instances of the best utilizations of the innovation. The explanation behind this is traditional enterprises require more change for blockchain arrangement than recently showed up organizations. As indicated by Gartner, just 10 percent of conventional organizations will accomplish any extreme change with blockchain advancements by 2023. Conclusion Blockchain later on will reform business forms in numerous ventures, yet its appropriation requires time and efforts. All things considered, sooner rather than later, we can expect that governments will at long last acknowledge blockchain advantages and start to utilize it for improving financial and open administrations. Despite the fact that some blockchain new businesses will fall flat, individuals will get more understanding and information on the best way to utilize this innovation. Blockchain will animate individuals to procure new abilities, while traditional business should totally rethink their procedures. With everything taken into account, by 2020, we can see more instances of fruitful execution of blockchain innovation. ",

            "answer_text": "There are quite a few: It is much more difficult to design and build a secure blockchain system than a comparable centralized system.Performance of the blockchain component will typically be much worse than a comparable non-blockchain system. You can mitigate this by moving things off the blockchain part, but that tends to negate many of the advantages.It\u2019s harder to compartmentalize information in a blockchain system. In a non-blockchain system, usually everything\u2019s secret unless you provide some way to get at it. Blockchain systems rely on people seeing everything to know what they can trust.Blockchain systems are harder to change. For some things, this is an advantage as it\u2019s important to rely on them behaving the same in the future as they do today. But sometimes that\u2019s a minus.Blockchain systems are harder to fix if they do the wrong thing. Their censorship resistance can be a minus when trying to correct bad behavior.",

            "answer_text": "Blockchain technology has its limitations which might be inappropriate for a lot of digital interactions. First, blockchains are not resistant to bad actors; on the contrary, they react to attacks and become stronger. If the blockchain is not a great grid of nodes widely spread, it is more difficult to get the full benefit. If you want to use the blockchain as a database, every information that you put in there has to be of very high quality. Not every data that you put on a blockchain can be trustworthy, so this is why it has to be watched carefully and put in place accurately. Another problem for the blockchain technology is politics. Miners eventually do form a type of governance model so this may lead to public disagreements between certain community sectors. Also, there is one thing security wise. Satoshi Nakamoto when launching bitcoin said that if more than half of the nodes working in service to the network tell a lie, the lie will become the truth and called it the 51 % attack. This is why the mining process has to be watched over closely by the entire blockchain community and make sure no one gains so much influence. Learn more about blockchain technology  ",

            "answer_text": "Blockchain Problems in 2019 The applications of blockchain are numerious. At the same time, the users are facing the issues with blockchain. There are a large number of blockchain problems that need to be solved. Around 2000 projects are listed onCoinmarketcap aiming to provide the world a decentralized internet. Let\u2019s discuss some core blockchain problems that need to be solved in 2019. Blockchain Scalability The core problem with blockchain is the issue with scalability. The bitcoin blockchain has a transaction speed of 7 TPS. Similarly, Ethereum has a transaction speed of 15 TPS.  Hence, bitcoin and Ethereum blockchain are failed to provide the users with scalability. The users need a more scalable blockchain that meets the user\u2019s requirements.  Sometimes, the user has to wait 4 to 5 hours to complete a cryptocurrency transaction. This can create a problem while implementing the blockchain in the real world. The new projects are entering the market to resolve the issue with scalability. We are entering into the era of 3rd generation blockchain where we will find more scalable, robust and efficient blockchain technology. Following projects are aiming to resolve the blockchain problems. CardanoZilliqaEOSAIONICONLet\u2019s discuss the blockchain problems in detail. New Technology One of the main \u2018blockchain problems\u2019 is the new technology. The blockchain is a new emerging technology. It will take some time for the world to completely understand the blockchain technology and its potential. The educational institutes around the world are adding the blockchain in their curriculum. The government of Pakistan has also launched a platform to provide the new generation with the knowledge of blockchain technology. That\u2019s the reason the companies don\u2019t have the required number of blockchain developer. Even the huge cryptocurrency exchanges like Binance and some others are still looking for blockchian developer to maintain their applications. There are still some issues with deploying the blockchain due to the lack of experts in this field. Now, as the world is adopting this technology and institutes are paying attention towards blockchain technology, we can say the future is really bright.  Lack of Blockchain Developers Being a new and innovating technology, there are few experts in the field of blockchain technology. We need more experts to meet the requirements. The companies are looking for blockchain experts around the world. This deficiency of blockchain developer lagging it behind. But recently, the new generation shows a lot of interest in this emerging technology. A large number of the institution are now adding the blockchain as a major subject to their course. In 2018, there was a huge demand for blockchain experts. Similarly, there is still a lot of deficiency of experts in this field. At the same time, the students are showing their interest in this new technology. We will witness the more blockchain experts around the world in near future.  Trustless System Another blockchain problem is the trustless system. Trust issue arises due to the anonymity of blockchain technology. As the blockchain based on a distributed ledger and no central authority can control the data. When bitcoin started the journey back in 2008, the internet giant label it scam. But the bitcoin continued its journey despite of negative news. In December 2017, it touched 2000$ and we witness the people who become billionaires within few weeks. The people are still confused as the bitcoin price is back to 3800$. The fluctuation in bitcoin price is creating the FUD. Actually, whales are playing around with bitcoin and altcoin to create the FUD. There are no proper rules and regulation to maintain the bitcoin price but in the future, we will witness it. Now, the market is more mature as compared to 2017. There is no huge pumping and dumping. We can say the stability cryptocurrency price will make it more trustworthy.  Blockchain Storage Problem Blockchain technology is based on a distributed database. The data is available on a peer to peer to the network. Hence individual can\u2019t handle the data management and storage. It\u2019s difficult to manage the data available on different computers around the world. The person who is storing data on blockchain doesn\u2019t know where the data is being stored. But we can expect improvement in data storage and backup in near future. The next generations of blockchain will be more scalable and efficient. The blockchain was built to provide the users with privacy and reliability. Now, as time is passing, the different issues with blockchain are arising and different companies are working to resolve the issues with blockchain. The next generations of blockchain will use the sharding and crosschain technology to help the blockchain in gaining user trust and scalability.  Regulation The blockchain technology is said to be the next internet. It\u2019s going to take over the internet in near future. The progress countries are already planning to adopt the blockchain technology. But not all countries are supporting the blockchain equally. The developing countries are still planning to adopt this technology. There are no proper rules and regulation to adopt this new technology. The G20 Conference is working to legalize the cryptocurrency and blockchain technology. At the same time Pakistan, Bangladesh, India, China etc have banned the dealing in cryptocurrency. The Governments are taking actions against the individual and companies dealing in cryptocurrencies. It will take some time for the Governments to understand the potential of cryptocurrencies. There is a need for proper rules and regulations to deal with cryptocurrency and blockchain based projects.  Cyber Attacks Hackers are trying to steal the user credential for hacking purpose. Have you ever heard? \u2018blockchain can\u2019t be hacked.\u2019 This is totally a misconception. Hackers can steal the data form anywhere and any part of the world if you are using the internet. No doubt blockchian is secure, but the user\u2019s security matters a lot. If you are not following the proper security guideline, your account can be compromised. The users should take some steps to secure their account from hackers. Use a Strong Password.Apply two-factor authentication to your account.Use Incognito mode while using the browser.Never click irrelevant links on any website.Always make sure to use a legit URL.Avoid using Public WIFI.Different companies are trying to make the blockchain project more secure. At the same time, the user should have proper training before using the blockchain base projects.  High Computing Power The blockchain is a network of the distributed database. The data is available on the different computer available on the network. Whenever a new block is generated, it has to join the chain. It costs a lot of computing power to approve a newly generated block. As the new block join the chain the miners have to prove that block as legit. According to a survey, blockchain technology will consume most of the power of the world in verify transactions. For example, in the case of bitcoin transactions, miners use the heavy system and ASIC miners. It costs a lot of energy consumption to approve the bitcoin transaction. The reason is the proof of work consensus algorithm behind bitcion mining. The bitcoin algorithm is not environment-friendly and it costs a lot of energy. We need a blockchain technology that has low energy consumption. Ethereum introduces the idea of proof of stack algorithm to lower the mining cost. But it failed to provide the users with scalability. The companies are working on the 3rd generation blockchain to provide the world with low cost and more scalable blockchain.

That level of openness isn\u2019t always a sufficiently secure approach to data storage. Then, I should mention throughput. Blockchain refers to a single-state database that disseminates the same information concurrently to all connected parties. Like any database, the processing power of a blockchain is based on how fast it can move data around. Right now, the Bitcoin blockchain technology is unable to process transactions at speeds required by banks. Ican\u2019t help mentiong the factor of the human error as well. Like all distributed systems, if a Blockchain is used as a database, the information stored in it has to be of high quality. The database should record the events as accurate as possible because the data stored in it isn\u2019t 100 percent trustworthy. If false data entered the system, false data also will exit from it. ",

            "answer_text": "Throughput and scalability. Blockchain\u2019s problem is that it is a distributed ledger. Nothing more. It won\u2019t cure cancer or transform anything if we\u2019re being honest. If you have a ledger of transactions, blockchain can help secure the authenticity of each transaction, but ONLY the transaction. So, for instance, if you put a fake transaction in the blockchain, it will accept it as if nothing is wrong. It will be almost impossible to alter the transaction, but it is not verifying the transaction at all, only the RECORDING of the transaction. Now, let\u2019s get back to your question. The biggest limiting factor is the scalability/throughput. And as the blockchain gets larger, scalability and throughput becomes more of a challenge. Blockchain advocates are typically also cryptocurrency advocates. They assign some \u201cmagical\u201d attributes to blockchain and somehow believe that blockchain will magically transform things. But it won\u2019t. They believe that bitcoin will somehow replace national currencies (which they like to call \u201cfiat\u201d currencies) but it can\u2019t because the number of transactions per second on traditional currencies in today\u2019s economies is hundreds of thousands per second higher than blockchain could ever handle. Blockchain may be great for managing the ledger of a single company or managing a supply chain, but the idea that it can scale to some economy-wide implementation is laughable at best and ultimately dishonest at worst. It just can\u2019t scale to meet larger needs and there is little on the horizon that will allow it to overcome that, primarily because the thing that makes it what it is (the distributed nature) is also it\u2019s most limiting factor.

When it was invented it became one of the most important inventions, but, as time passed, experts realized that there were limitations to this technology. Some of the major limitations of blockchain include excessive use of energy, privacy, and scalability. The first limitation of blockchain is the excessive use of energy. Blockchain technology requires some powerful hardware resources or supercomputers for each transaction, that can lead to heavy energy consumption. It is because miners spend a large amount of computing power to solve the computations to both verify and process the transactions. Privacy is another issue of blockchain. Despite the fact that the identities are anonymous, there are patterns to the transactions that can easily reveal the identity of the customers with a particular address. Scalability is another major limitation, as all the transactions have to be verified by each and every node in the network, it ",

Similarly there can be other scenarios where currently we see limitations in blockchain tech, but may be mitigated by other new blockchain solutions in future. As such, if we talk about the current mainstream deployment and use of the blockchain tech, following may be the factors which can be attributed to the slow adoptability of the tech: Lack of regulationsLarge network size needed for new deploymentsHigh transaction costs (attributed to the surge of cryptocurrency prices)Long transaction confirmation time in the currently deployed public networksHigh cost of storage",

            "answer_text": "Before talking about the limitations and risks of blockchain it is convenient to explain what this technology consists of. A blockchain is a chain of blocks, that is, a series of data records whose information is grouped into sets related by a timeline. Each of the blocks is secured and related to each other using cryptography and their uses are diverse, but currently they are focused on economic transactions.  6 major blockchain challenges Although all experts agree that the blockchain will be beneficial for a wide range of economic sectors (beyond finance and technology), this tool is still to be developed and is currently facing the following challenges: 1. Scalability The blockchain has four challenges related to scalability: limitations, block size, response time and high rates. All these problems must be solved quickly as the network grows by leaps and bounds, as well as the number of users. 2. Processing time and power Power consumption is another challenge in adopting this technology as it mostly follows the bitcoin virtual currency infrastructure using Proof of Work as a consensus algorithm. To keep the system up and running, mining will need a lot of computing power. In other words, mining will require your computer to solve complex equations for which it will need a lot of electrical power. If we translate this into daily processing of large volumes of data, this is quite expensive. 3. Privacy The public system that feeds the blockchain does not get along very well with privacy. This is a big problem for companies that handle sensitive data and need to have very defined boundaries because their customers trust them. But, if the data is stored in a huge public system, how can this be made private? It seems that the only solution is to change the records to limit access to the data, a challenge that has yet to be defined. 4. Sustainability In relation to the previous point on energy management. If mining requires a large amount of electricity it makes this system very unfriendly to the environment, urgently needing a new more sustainable power source. 5. Legal regulation Although many organizations are already using blockchain as a means of transaction, there is no specific regulation on this and this is a problem. Although this technology guarantees visibility as one of its great benefits, you will never know if it is safe or not for you. 6. Storage The blockchain eliminates the need for a centralized server to store transactions and device IDs, but the data must be stored on the same nodes, or it causes it to grow in size over time. In the end it will exceed the needs of the intelligent devices that exist today, such as sensors, whose storage capacity is very low. Risks of blockchain In addition to the challenges, the blockchain has the following three major risks: > Security of credentials Security is a crucial issue in this technology which, like any other IT chain, comes with some security loops. In fact, defects in the network cause more than half of the attacks, where hackers can take control of it and exploit it as they please, altering the transaction process and restricting the formation of blocks. To cope with this, the blockchain protocol layer needs more security and longer. > Legal aspects As indicated above, the lack of legality is not only a challenge but also one of its main risks because users do not know where the limits are. > Risks for suppliers As the blockchain becomes more widely adopted, the market for third-party solutions will experience tremendous growth, especially in areas such as: integration platforms, payment processors, fintech, portfolios or smart contracts. Providers who want to implement third party applications and blockchain platforms should be aware that security in this technology should not be greater than personal trust towards them. That is, having unreliable systems, faulty code or personal vulnerabilities can expose their customers' credentials and data to unauthorized persons. Avoiding these vulnerabilities requires thorough research of all vendors that are in this ecosystem. Experience and reputation are the key factors a customer must use to distinguish between those who can help them build their business and those who could ruin it. In conclusion, the blockchain is a technology that is set to revolutionize the industry worldwide, but it cannot be said that, today, it is consolidated since it still faces many challenges that involve risks, but that the advances in technology will help to overcome.

If a blockchain does not hold a robust network with a widely distributed grid of nodes, it becomes more difficult to reap the full benefit.

The first few years of it\u2019s existence, it was noted that transactions we\u2019re \u201cnearly free\u201d Now, as the network continues to grow, we can clearly see that at this rate using Bitcoin will NOT be the most cost effective option of transferring money due to rising transaction costs in the network. 4.Human Error If a blockchain is used as a database, the information going into the database needs to be of high quality. The data stored on a blockchain is not inherently trustworthy, so events need to be recorded accurately in the first place. 5.Unavoidable Security Flaw There is one notable security flaw in Bitcoin and other blockchains: If more than half of the computers working as nodes to service the network tell a lie, the lie will become the truth.

And, if we go about it the right way, the transaction-recording peer-to-peer network technology has the potential to give us the first truly decentralized monetary system. But the blockchain takeover of our banking systems is just the beginning\u2014we\u2019re likely about to experience major transformations in dozens of other industries from education to real estate by way of blockchain technologies. Of course, blockchain has received its fair share of skepticism and negative press. But it\u2019s almost certainly going to stick around for the foreseeable future. Here\u2019s the biggest risk associated with blockchain\u2019s impending takeover, though: The major players adopting blockchain including companies, governments, etc. can use the technology to maintain their economic power instead of moving toward decentralization\u2014unless we can commit to better regulations. Here\u2019s what I mean: People distrust centralized organizations (for good reason), but decentralized doesn\u2019t always mean trustworthy. We\u2019re currently experiencing historic lows in public trust in the federal government here in the United States. And, as history has shown, when people lose trust in one centralized institution, a domino effect occurs; they lose trust in virtually all centralized institutions. That\u2019s exactly why blockchain is so appealing as a solution to our economic issues\u2014it\u2019s decentralized and can\u2019t be controlled by the government. But just because a system or organization is decentralized doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s inherently trustworthy. Since its advent, there have been frequent hacks on bitcoin wallets, numerous scams, and other questionable efforts around cryptocurrency. And it\u2019s a trend that\u2019s sure to continue unless we stop it in its tracks now. Here\u2019s why: Major companies\u2014and even governments\u2014can use blockchain to consolidate power. Walmart, for example, has already created its own blockchain-based tracking system in collaboration with IBM and will begin requiring its produce suppliers to use it this September. This could enable Walmart to unethically control their suppliers if they chose to. For example, if you\u2019re a tomato supplier using WalMart\u2019s blockchain system, you\u2019re at risk of becoming unable to ever do business with anyone else. Because it\u2019d be incredibly costly to internally implement another blockchain system. At that point, it wouldn\u2019t make financial sense to supply to any other companies\u2014and WalMart could begin to offer less and less for your tomatoes. You\u2019d have no choice but to accept whatever price they set. And WalMart isn\u2019t the only company adopting blockchain. FedEx, Microsoft, Overstock, Mastercard, and others have also incorporated blockchains into their operations. Banks are getting in on the blockchain action, too, often demanding people use their blockchains for transactions. Of course, the banking industry had too-big-to-fail centralization problems before blockchain came around\u2014but the advent of blockchain could compound the issue because people won\u2019t have the money, time, and resources to reimplement their systems. Here\u2019s why: Most people don\u2019t run high-margin businesses (think farmers). They barely make much at all. So when a farmer has to implement a blockchain-type system they have very limited means to invest in it. This means most people will only be able to afford to invest in one, hopefully long-term, solution. In fact, it\u2019s not out of the realm of possibilities that the U.S. government and Federal Reserve eventually adopt a blockchain-based currency system. In that case, a digital ledger would reflect that the U.S. blockchain system contains X amount of money. And while you\u2019d imagine that information would be public, as is typically the case with cryptocurrencies, it wouldn\u2019t necessarily have to be. That\u2019s where the issue of consolidated power comes in. Companies, organizations, or even countries which have their own blockchain are more likely to misuse it to unjustly gain power. We have to be very careful about how we implement blockchain decentralization. Blockchain can be a great form of decentralization\u2014if used correctly and with regulations. For major decentralized platforms like Ethereum, there are strong protocols in place. But in the case of private companies building their own platforms with custom protocols, centralization often occurs by default\u2014as a user, you have to choose whose protocol to implement. And we\u2019re already seeing decentralization in places like cryptocurrency purchasing and banking platforms. As the Mt. Gox hack shows, that\u2019s not a good thing. We need standard protocols, not custom ones. Not enough to stifle innovation\u2014especially because private companies often create great blockchain systems with safe protocols. Just enough to prevent people from creating their own restrictive centralized systems. Standards allow for system interoperability. They also allow people to choose new systems to implement fairly easily and at a low cost. Ultimately, this helps prevent the centralization of power. Otherwise, we\u2019ll wind up with what I like to call \u201chard centralization\u201d\u2014for example, if Israel were using the United States\u2019 blockchain system and decided it wanted to switch to its own system, it might not be able to because it\u2019d be too costly. I\u2019d guess it\u2019d require $1-2 billion in tax dollars for a country like Israel to switch to its own centralized reserve currency. People are inherently tribal\u2014they want to be part of a system bigger than themselves. For that reason, humans are inclined to rules, protocols, and centralization. We don\u2019t want to have to choose between a bunch of options. For all we insist otherwise, we desire certainty above everything else. For this reason, I\u2019m unsure we will ever have a truly decentralized blockchain system. The problem within that, though, is the potential for corruption within companies and governments holding power over centralized systems\u2014and, in turn, the people within that system. Blockchain has great potential for good, but we need oversight. In our haste to create a decentralized world, we\u2019re actually creating a more centralized world. We as a society can\u2019t allow centralized systems with custom protocols to dictate how we use products and, ultimately, live our lives. It already happens when companies obtain monopolies use that to abuse everyday people. Instead, we need a series of decentralized systems allowing people to consume, use, and live freely. ",

As there is continuous system of consensus, data is constantly written and distributed across several machines / nodes, rather than working through a centralised machine / resource. This makes it impractical for several real world applications. For sake of comparison, blockchain and bitcoin transactions per second have been compared to VISA. Bitcoin processes 4.6 transactions per second. Visa does around 1,700 transactions per second on average (source:The Blockchain Scalability Problem & the Race for Visa-Like Transaction Speed | Hacker Noon No, Visa Doesn\u2019t Handle 24,000 TPS and Neither Does Your Pet Blockchain | Blockchain Bitcoin News The other major limitation is many people dont understand what blockchain is, and I am hoping places like Quora can help the spread the knowledge to more people.

In blockchain, possession of keys and ownership of content are totally synonymous. In all a hacker needs is the right keys to access your data once it is available to them, your data is at the highest threat of getting hacked. Other areas of concerns that are risky are: blockchain efficiency, vulnerabilities in smart contacts, underpriced operations, under utilised smart contracts and leakage of privacy while carrying out transactions.

There are various reasons for this, but probably the biggest culprit is how consensus is reached. The most common method is PoW (Proof of Work), which is difficult and time consuming (by design).Storage is expensive. If you plan on using a blockchain to store large amounts of data it will probably be very expensive, since every node must store a copy and this must be incentivized. Most don\u2019t store their data on the blockchain, but rather a hash of the data.It is not very efficient. Large amounts of energy goes into mining since every node participating must verify and store every transaction and block.From a business point of view it is pretty expensive to develop since blockchain devs are few and far apart.",

The number of transactions on the network is an exiting limit which has caused a lot of heated debate recently. Ultimately however, part of the power of blockchain is that as it encounters these limitations, the community which has developed it in the first place is able to propose solutions to the problems being faced so as to overcome them. The Blockchain has so far been able to survive every attack, evolution, crisis, and PR nightmare which might have killed off other new technologies, so I personally am optimistic about the technology and its community\u2019s ability to overcome any limitations.
