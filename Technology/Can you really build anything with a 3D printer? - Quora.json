And no, a 2D drawing with a perpendicular rig controlled by a computer isn\u2019t a 3D printer, is a plotter. If it moves things it is a pick and place, if it moves freely from a base it is a robot arm. And no, you can't call any kind of computer controlled additive manufacturing \u201c3D printing\u201d. Also printing paper is adding ink to paper, so it fits that definition. And all these things were made on machines designed, engineered and built just for that kind of tasks and nothing else. A 3D printer for houses can\u2019t make jet engines, or squishy organs and vice versa.Consumer 3D printers just use few kind of easy to fuse materials. But if you use \u201cmaking it with a computer controlled machine\u201d instead of \u201c3D printed\u201d, of course is way easier to see how it is possible to make everything. Every industrial process in modern times uses computers, and more and more flexible machines. Calling these machines 3D printers is very reductive about their capabilities and induces the idea that are magic replicators.  Even that, with affordable plastic filament 3D printers, everyone can make toys, model aircrafts, small robots, artistic shapes, some functional objects, replacement parts, or trinkets. Also images commonly found are often misleading.  Doable by switching from red to yellow to green filament during printing.  Lots of solvent or manual polishing here.  Expect to see small layer texture up close on this design. Perhaps this is a render.  This is a reasonable print to expect from a well tuned printer. ",

            "answer_text": "As they can 3D Print even houses, you would think 3D printers can print almost anything\u2026  But the reality is that most 3D printers are limited to the materials they can use. For example, 3D printers can\u2019t print in most metals at this moment, even though companies like Shapeways are offering 3D printed jewelry. (They use a 3D printer to make a mold, then use the mold to make e.g. a golden model.) Size is also a limitation as building a 3D printer for houses is going to be huge. Someone has to design and build those huge printers and then store that 3D printer somewhere. A 3D printer large enough to print a chair would be the size of a large closet and will also be quite heavy so you won\u2019t be able to move it easily. There isn\u2019t much that can be done about this size problem, except for printing objects in smaller parts like a puzzle. Even a 3D printed gun isn\u2019t completely 3D printed as some things like springs and screws are too complex to print in 3D and be reliable. As 3D printed objects are made from voxels, they are at risk of breaking a bit easier as the voxels need to fuse together. If the voxels are large enough, you will even be able to see them with your bare eyes. And the connection between two voxels are vulnerable places. So a 3D printed spring, for example, could break more easily than a spring that\u2019s made as a single piece. And did I just mention voxels? Well, there lies another problem. The voxel can be extremely small which would allow for some very fine details but it also means that it has a very small amount of volume. As objects have a specific volume, decreasing the voxel size generally means that you need to use more voxels. And information about voxels is just stored as data, which means you need to store a lot of information. The number of voxels needed increase exponentially when you decrease the voxel size. Say, you have a cube of 10x10x10 CM. If you use a voxel of 1x1x1 CM then you would need 1,000 voxels to make that cube. If the voxels are 0.1x0.1x0.1 CM or one cubic millimeter then you need a million voxels already. And while the voxels would barely be noticeable on a 3D printed cube, they might become visible if you printed something round like a 3D printed ball. A 3D printed ball made from voxels of 1 cubic CM each won\u2019t even feel round. Oh, yeah\u2026 Round. Another problem is assuming that voxels are cubes. That\u2019s not the case! Most 3D printers use spheres as voxels and that means that even a flat surface will have visible marks of being 3D printed because the voxels are round and thus generate bumps. Even 3D printers that use liquids or powders combined with laser beams or whatever have this problem, as the beams are generally round, not rectangular. In our 3D World, round objects rule the whole World, from atomic level to planets rotating around stars. It\u2019s all round. So to get smooth surfaces, the round parts need to be small enough to make it seem flat and smooth. Using sandpaper and polishing paste also works\u2026 Right now, most 3D printing is still experimental as companies are investigating if it provides a cheaper or better alternatives from making objects in the old fashioned ways. And for some things it is cost-effective while for others, it\u2019s just too expensive. The number of voxels needed for each project is often the biggest limitation as it determines the printing speed and the fine details. So, if you\u2019re willing to do all kinds of complex developments and experiments then you would basically be able to print anything you need in 3D. But in reality it\u2019s often not the most effective solution to get things done. ",
