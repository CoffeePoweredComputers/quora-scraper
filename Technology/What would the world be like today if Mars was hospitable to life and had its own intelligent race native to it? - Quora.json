            "answer_text": "Well\u2026If humanity was aware that Mars was habitable\u2026and had its own intelligent race upon it\u2026real \u201cMartians\u201d, we would probably be having the major nations of Earth building up our defensive capabilities to protect our own planet from attack\u2026as, to be prudent, that would be the safest thing to do\u2026should the Martians prove hostile. After all, H.G. Wells wrote his famous novel \u201cThe War of the Worlds\u201d about just that possibility\u2026a Martian invasion of Earth\u2026and several cinematic treatments of Wells\u2019 novel have been made since he wrote it\u2026further cementing that possibility in the popular mind. So there would be a massive build-up of Terrestrial spaceflight, and defensive, capability\u2026directed against the possibility of an interplanetary attack from Mars. Further robot explorations of the \u201cred planet\u201d would also be stepped up\u2026hoping to learn more about the planet\u2026and perhaps its inhabitants. A manned mission to the planet would, and probably should, be deferred until more is learned about the Martians\u2026their technology\u2026etc. The major religions would have some major \u201cre-thinking\u201d of their ideas and beliefs to do if extraterrestrial life is proven to exist on Mars\u2026and the major nations would have to step up their co-operative efforts to prepare the Earth to be able to meet with aliens from Mars in the near future\u2026which could be very dangerous if humanity is not better prepared to do so!

            "answer_text": "We would colonize it, get the vast majority of them killed with our germs, take their natural resources and land, take their women as wives and use the men as forced labor. Later they would rebel and successfully kick us off because the vast majority of humans will become sympathetic to their cause. Then later they would build up their military and we would be at war with them on and off for the next thousand years. Then later some interstellar aliens would invade our solar system and we would team up to fight them off. Up vote if you would like to see this made into a book. ",
