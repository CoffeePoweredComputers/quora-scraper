            "answer_text": "It looks like an older type of mini-AB. This was the first style of mini USB used with On-The-Go (OTG) devices - things that can be both a master and slave, like a camera that can directly control a printer but can also be read like a memory stick. At the time it was the only small USB connector so it found its way into a lot of things that weren't OTG, like your headphone. But for various reasons I don't understand, it was found to be unsatisfactory and \"deprecated\" by the USB standards committee in favor of the more familiar mini and micro connectors. If you have a cable that fits it, take great care of it. You won't get another.   ",

            "answer_text": "There was a window of time before USB mini-B and micro-B became standard when a few non-standard connectors were developed by vendors.  This was common on very old MP3 players, I have a few. For example: S1MP3 Wiki - Temp:USB cables Some other vendors insist on using a non-standard format to keep you buying their accessories.  A pox on those vendors. ",
