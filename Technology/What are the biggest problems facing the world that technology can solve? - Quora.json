            "answer_text": "Thanks for the A2A. I should start by pointing out that most world problems cannot be solved by technology alone. Most of the problems the other answers suggest, like world hunger, etc., are not problems with technology. The famous economist Amartya Sen has concluded that historically, famine was not caused by drought, poor farming practices, etc. It was caused by corrupt and incompetent governments. But there might be a few problems that are purely technological. I will list what I can think of. Certain medical problems are purely technological. For instance, many proteins in the human body have several different functions. They perform those different functions by folding into different configurations. That folding is extraordinarily difficult to analyze. But if we do manage how they fold, that might allow the development of new drugs that, instead of binding receptor sites for instance, would block certain folded configurations while allowing others. The drugs would be extremely specific and low in toxicity. So that is basically an enormously difficult math problem, and greater computing horsepower might address it. (Of course, there are still issues of how to make sure a profit-obsessed pharma industry makes it, distributes it, etc. And there might still be not enough doctors to prescribe it, pharmacies to stock it, etc.)Certain infrastructure problems are purely technological. One that comes to mind is how to increase traffic safety and density on highways. The solution that seems increasingly viable is self-driving cars. The big payoff would come when a certain percentage of cars become self-driving. They could create a \u201cphase-change\u201d in the \u201cfluid\u201d flow in highways. For instance, self-driving cars could \u201ccaravan\u201d - form long chains of cars spaced closer together than human drivers could manage, to save fuel and increase density.Certain governance issues may possibly be addressed technologically. One major issue the world faces, perhaps the major issue, is the corruption and lack of accountability in government. Some aspects of that may be addressable technologically. For instance, the I Paid A Bribe website allows Indians to report bribes they were forced to pay to petty officials. While those officials will likely not go to jail, the hope is that they will be shamed into correcting their behavior. Another issue, at least in the US, is \u201cgerrymandering,\u201d i.e., manipulating the boundaries of voting districts to create a desired income. It is the reason that while the US as a whole is mildly Democrat (i.e., mildly liberal-leaning), the majority of state legislatures and governorships are Republican (i.e., conservative leaning.) The US Supreme Court has indicated that it is open to challenging gerrymandered districts, but it needs an objective test to help it determine when and how much gerrymandering has been done. Various tests have been proposed, but they are essentially mathematical. If applied, they will help the US improve the functioning of its democracy.Those are a few I can think of. But I have to repeat that nearly every problem our world faces cannot be solved purely technologically. In nearly every case, 1) we already have the technology, and 2) the real issue is some other systemic issue, usually a corrupt or unaccountable government. For example, ten years ago the Grand Solar Plan proposed a step-by-step method to move the US to 100% sustainable energy sources by 2050, using then current technology at then current prices. There would be considerable cost, but it was actually feasible, and the total cost would be a fraction of what it would cost to keep going as we are (i.e., the costs created by sea level rise and the resulting population migration, economic shifts, disruption to agriculture and shipping, etc. etc.) It was possibly not the best possible plan, but it existed, and it was entirely feasible. And we have made absolutely zero progress on it or any other plan. We have no national plan. Whatever progress we have made toward renewable energy has been made by cities and states. And our current national administrations seems bent on undoing that progress as quickly as possible. None of that is technological. ",

            "answer_text": "The answer lays in convergence.  Someone invents an electric car. Someone invents carbon fibre sheets to make the car bodySomeone invents tires that never puncture or need inflatingSomeone invents LEDs or lasers that make car lights everlastingSomeone invents self-driving car systemsSomeone invents self-maintenance for cars so rarely need repairSomeone invents stronger materials so car engines and frames are much lighterSomeone invents better lubrication so cars are more efficientSomeone invents new safety features so cars have fewer accidentsSomeone makes cars that can change shape so meet more purposesSomeone invents automatic signal detection so cars move more efficiently with the trafficSomeone invents ways of tracking cars and protecting them, so fewer get stolenSomeone invents in-car detection of driver status, preventing drivers operating the car in unsafe conditionsSomeone invents an in-car information system that tells the driver what the traffic, weather, and road conditions are in real timeSomeone invents automatic safety and parking systemsSomeone invents a range on in-car entertainment for passengersSomeone puts all these converging technologies into larger vehicles enabling them to be virtually lived inVehicles that can be lived in can be used like small campersSuch vehicles will then be parked on roads where currently empty cars are parkedThis will effectively give thousands of acres of new living space that was otherwise wastedThe growth of such cars will entice carpark owners and garages to offer facilities to car owners such as washing/toilet drive-insThe use of vehicles for living in will reduce the need for housingThe electric vehicles and various safety features will reduce CO2 emissions, and accidents, as well as car crimeThe vehicles will also provide many office facilities, again reducing the need for spaceIn that all vehicles can be tracked automatically and continuously will enable traffic control to be much more efficientThe fact that cars will be almost ever lasting will mean less are made and less are scrappedThe in-built automation of vehicles will encourage road design to take advantage of this, and make roads suited to vehicles instead of the other way aroundThe cumulative effect of people living in vehicles with most of their necessities in-built, plus carparks, garages, and the like offering the items not possible in cars, will effectively change the face of society.So, once the critical stage has been reached of having the everlasting car, there will then be a rapid development of the infrastructure that will utilise the benefits of fully automated vehicles, which will be semi-homes. The aspect of full automation will extend to all forms of transport such as buses, trains, boats, planes, etc. This will allow linking of transport as a singular entity. From that stage virtually every other aspect of societies problems will be seen in terms how they relate to vehicles and the system that controls them. Remember, you read it here first. ",
