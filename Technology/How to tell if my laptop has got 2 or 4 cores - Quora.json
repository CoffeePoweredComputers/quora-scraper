You can find that right in the Task Manager. Just right click the Task Bar and select \u201cTask Manager\u201d. In the Task Manager, click the \u201cMore Details\u201d button and go to the Performance tab. Click the CPU tab, and it will tell you your processor information right there.  Inside that red oval. ",

            "answer_text": "You can check in device manager (if you\u2019re on windows) and under processors, you can see the amount of logical cores your processor has. Another way to find out is by using user benchmark to test your PC and your components. This will also tell you what processor you have and what speed it is and how many cores it has. Lastly, you can go to control panel, then system and security, then system, and it will tell you the processor you have. Search it online to find the specifications of your processor. I hope this helps. ",
