            "answer_text": "First of all there is a lot of difference in both the companies.Apple is expensive because it has its own R&D and produces it's own software and hardware which helps the devices to run smoothly and last longer where as Redmi is a Chinese company and it will not maintain the quality of apple products and also Redmi uses android os which is Google's and the integration of both software and hardware is not common like apple and by age these devices will get slower and slower and also they hardly get android updates whereas apple gives 5 years of software updates to all it's devices and all of these devices will work as smooth as they use to work on first day of purchase.Also quality matter most and apple maintain's it's quality like any other company provides you can feel the premium quality once to use any apple devices and lastly apple has its own chipset's which are way faster and power efficient than any other processor's available where as Redmi uses Qualcomm as well as mediately and they get slower by time and the performance of these devices will degrade when they get old.

            "answer_text": "Apple products are expensive because of the money they spend on Research and Development (R&D). Their engineers ensure that when their product goes in the market, there should be almost zero flaw to maintain the dignity of that Apple logo people crave for buying. It has its own class. Whereas cheap Chinese brands don't spend a single buck on R&D and just do copy paste of the trending products. They don't spend much on their engineers. This is why their phones are not capable of utilising their full strength of RAM which they tell us like 6 GB, 8 GB RAM and still sometimes their phone lags whereas Apple iPhone has max 4 GB RAM and their phone runs smoothly. We are paying for quality, to the engineers of Apple and motivating them to do R&D which is rare in this copy paste world. Hope you got your answer. Thanks for reading!!
