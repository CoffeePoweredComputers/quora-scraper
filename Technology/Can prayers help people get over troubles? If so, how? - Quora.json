            "answer_text": "\u00a00:00-0:30 Yes prayers can help people through troubles, absolutely yes! Thank you for asking the question. God did not design us to live on our own power. God intends for us to commune with him in relational, conversational ways through His Spirit. One way this happens is prayer. When we invite God into our troubles, asking for His help, admitting we need him, He is faithful to deliver, heal, and renew. He demonstrates His love toward us by the power of the Holy Spirit through the life of Jesus. Prayers are not empty words to a deaf God, they are conversations heard by a living God who desires to draw near you with compassion and deposit His supernatural life. We as humans need to learn how to invite God\u2019s presence, sit with Him, and meditate on His wonderful promises. In that prayer posture, He will supernaturally renew our minds and hearts and calm us with His eternal love. I pray you get to know Jesus. There is nothing more satisfying than a developed and matured prayer life with God! If you want to explore more, please visit a prayer ministry site- www.intothewaters.com. Blessings! ",

            "answer_text": "Short answer: yes! Long answer: For those who believe in Jesus Christ, the Bible promises us that our prayers will be answered. There are many passages that talk about the power of prayer - and volumes have been written about it (Stomie Omartian is my favorite). How do they work? One way is to focus on the One who is in control of the situation. The change in focus helps us get our mind off of the troubles. God will often give us insight through His Word as to what we should do in times of troubles. Philippians 4:6\u20137 says \u201cDo not worry about anything - but in everything, but prayer and petition, with thanksgiving, let your requests be known to God - and the PEACE of God will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus\u201d. We gain immeasurable peace from God when we connect with Him in prayer. There is no magic formula - there are no special words - just talk to Him. ",

            "answer_text": "Not if the person thinks they are using a sky intercom, to petition god, to rearrange things. Whereas (used in a sentence) praying, (talking) to self is supported by scripture. 'Go into your private place' etc. To stop smoking etc. Say outloud 'I will not smoke cigarettes' The words will leave the mouth, enter the ears and reach the subconcious. Creating a necessary conflict between the concious and the sub concious. Eventually one will prevail, 'to thing own self be true' Costs nothing. ",
