            "answer_text": "It depends on the hub, but I don\u2019t see why it wouldn\u2019t First, unpowered USB hubs can\u2019t be daisy chained, very few devices work on an unpowered USB hub to begin with, the more USB hubs you daisy chain, even fewer devices will work on the end of the chain As for powered hubs, as long as each one is properly powered, it should work just fine I think a USB controller can handle up to 127 devices each, being that most motherboards, logic boards and add on (PCI/PCI-e) cards typically only have about 1 to 5 ports per controller and most USB hubs have less than 10 ports, you would have to daisy chain USB hubs in order to get to that 127 devices anyway (not that we would use 127 USB devices at once anyway), so it would have to be possible ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, but ...Yes, it works, I did it several times, but it is not the optimal solution.Obviously, neither the power nor the bandwidth are \"infinite\", so if you connect two USB hubs in series, both supply current and transfer speed will be reduced ... Currently, I use a 7-port powered USB3.0 hub, where I connect mostly the external HDDs, and from it I connect a USB 1.1 unpowered hub, which I keep for low-speed terminals: printer, keyboard, mouse, charge the phone or the digital camera ...
