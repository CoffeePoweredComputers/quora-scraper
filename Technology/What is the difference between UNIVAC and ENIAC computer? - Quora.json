            "answer_text": "ENIAC (Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer) was one of the first, general purpose digital computers. It was primarily intended to calculate artillery firing tables, but its first use was actually to study the feasibility of a thermonuclear bomb. UNIVAC was the name of a line of computers that were originally developed by a company formed by the two men who helped design ENIAC, so there is a direct relationship. UNIVAC went through several hands, including Remington Rand, which was acquired by Sperry to form Sperry Rand, which then merged with Burroughs to form Unisys which still manufactures direct descendants of the UNIVAC 1107. In fact, my first computer was a UNIVAC 1110 (well, technically it belonged to the University of Alabama but it was the first one I wrote programs on). ",
