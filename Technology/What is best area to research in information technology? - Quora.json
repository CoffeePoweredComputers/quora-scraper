            "answer_text": "If you are very good in information technology then each area can be interested. But apart from this thought I want to put my opinion here. According to me ,if you want to do research then choose such field wherein work done till now is not too much. And this type of field in IT is AI(Artificial intelligences). Yes, this field has a lot of things to descover. And you fill definitely find it interesting when you will do your research in this field. This field has wide scope. Because this field is new that's why if you make your mind to work hard then you will definitely find something which will be enough to take your research paper at good level rather than you do research in an area which is already developed. Research in such type of areas demands a lot of hard work and doesn't guarantee that you will find something useful and worth for your hard work. Do research in AI, hot topic of today's science,work hard and contribute your research in this important field. ",
