For Android and a Windows PC, there is Microsofts \u201cMy Phone\u201d an app. Takes 2 minutes to set up and you can then make and answer calls, receive and answer texts, read the phone's notification on the PC, use the Android apps that are on your phone on the computer and view the phone's photos.  It uses WiFi or you can set it to also use your phones data plan if you wish. The screengrab is part of my PC display the rest of the display shows the content etc. ",

You need to be logged in with the same Apple ID on all of your Apple devices, and you need to enable WiFi Calling on your iPhone (and enable Calls from iPhone on the other devices). You can then make and receive phone calls and text messages from all of your Apple devices (Mac, iPad, iPhone, watch). ",
