            "answer_text": "No, there are microbolometer image sensors for IR heat images, like the Flir camera, or the Seek Thermal camera for your smartphone. There are the older tube type image sensors like the Iconoscope, used in TV stations up into the 1960\u2019s. Xray sensors are widely used (in the dental office instead of film), see Digital radiography - Wikipedia . ",
