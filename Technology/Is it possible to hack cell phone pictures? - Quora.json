            "answer_text": "Not sure exactly what you mean. But any phone can get hacked, although modern Android phones and iPhones are getting much more difficult to hack. Usually people get hacked either from fake email phishing (which has nothing to do with your phone or phone security) or they hack you through public WiFi, USB port, or Bluetooth. But in reality, it's not that easy to hack phones.. that's why hackers rely on email phishing or spoofing.. basically trick you into giving them your account and password.. So I guess if they stole your password, they can technically log into your iCloud account or your Google account which has your photos backed up over the cloud (usually Apple has it by default) and there they can see your photos.. this is exactly how most celebrities got their nude photos leaked on the internet (the hacker more than likely used the phishing technique which anyone could do, as long as you have their personal email address or other methods of contact.. or they used a password guessing software). But physically hacking the phone is not that easy and again, they would probably need to go out of their way to get to a close distance to you if they want to hack you through Bluetooth, public WiFi, or the USB port (or methods that requires being a close distance to you) which is sort of unlikely to happen.. so you're more likely to have your cloud accounts hacked so always use very strong passwords and don't fall for email phishing emails. If there was a data breach, then that has nothing to do with you or your phone.. the company you used got hacked and it was not your fault.. you just need to change your passwords and maybe seek compensation from the company if you got hacked We just learned about the whole TikTok and Apple security issue.. this is actually not TikTok's fault, this was Apple's fault.. there was a huge security flaw in iOS where the app developer could see what you have in your copy and paste keyboard cliptray.. so maybe don't copy sensitive information like your passwords or email accounts or other sensitive information.. I'm sure Apple is going to patch this loophole, but it's safer to be careful. ",

            "answer_text": "There is indeed , i would say plenty of ways to get your cell phone pictures stolen .One of them being the fact that users like to sync their phone to the cloud thus all someone has to do to access them is to bypass your cloud protection , you know this actually happens to a lot of celebrities , thats how they get their photos leaked , another way would be signging in to a public network , the network owner can see details and access the connected devices without you even noticing Last but not least pay attention the permissions of the apps u may be currently using , make sure they only use perms they really need and they should not have access to your camera mic or gallery unless you really trsut the creator of the product.
