            "answer_text": "The only technology that could be said to have been \u201cripped off\" was the sound of the Red Alert, which I believe was adopted by many hospitals, because it was designed to be as attention-getting as possible even in a noisy environment. The doors that opened automatically as soon as you approached them inspired engineers to invent them in real life; now they're everywhere. However, the makers of Star Trek didn't have a way of doing it, other than to have two pro guys behind the scenes to open and close the doors on cue. ",

There\u2019s also desktop computers. A third would be tablets like kindles and ipads. Star Trek always showed us a bright future with lots of gadgets. Some have come to be today and make our lives easier. ",
