            "answer_text": "The Best and the Worst Places to Make Money Let us consider various investment options. Bitcoins and other Cryptocurrencies: In December 2017, Vidarbha Industries Association invited me to deliver a talk on cryptocurrencies in general and Bitcoin in particular. Bitcoin was being traded at US$19,000 (\u20b912,35,000 at the prevailing rate of exchange). Experts were predicting a price of US$100,000. The auditorium was packed to capacity. The audience was eager to hear my analysis. I disappointed many when I said the true value of bitcoin was a big zero. I received a series of invitations from various organisations requesting my speech on the topic. I checked on YouTube and on the Internet. The dissenting voices were few, just two or three experts saying that cryptocurrencies were a bubble. All others agreed that bitcoin was a game-changer and predicted the price based on some matrix they used. Bitcoin has fallen to US$4,200. It is falling like ninepins. Speculative tendencies don\u2019t change. People are still speculating if this is the right price to enter since some of them missed the earlier rally. Since people don\u2019t understand bitcoins and blockchains and cryptocurrencies, they make great speculations about the fair market price of the currencies. As you can see from the headlines above, estimates range from $30,000 to $1 million. Read the following description to understand why they all are wrong. The true intrinsic value of any cryptocurrency is a cipher. Not a penny more. Cryptocurrencies in 2018 are what the Internet was in 1990 and what tulips were in 1634! Few understood the Internet in the 1990s, nor did many understand why tulips were so expensive in the seventeenth century. Few understand cryptocurrencies. People still invest. A fool and his money are soon parted. I googled to find the opinions of experts on bitcoin (as a representative cryptocurrency). Out of the top 100 results, 97 predicted the future price, differing with each other by a wide margin. Just three said that bitcoin is doomed to fail. When a bubble builds up, sane voices are seldom heard. Cryptocurrency is a robust medium of exchange that does not need the intervention of any centralised agency like a bank for transfer of money from one person to another. The blockchain technology it uses is a more secure method than the existing digital system of authentication of transactions. Still, that does not make a cryptocurrency a valuable asset because: 1. Cryptocurrencies have zero intrinsic value. They are a medium of exchange and not the currency. It is a folly to think that the medium is a currency. It is like putting a monetary value to a cheque used of transferring money from one person to another\u2014not only putting a money value on it but speculating on and trading the value of the cheque. Nothing could be more laughable. 2. If cryptocurrencies had value, they should have reduced the value of existing currencies. It does not happen. How could an alternative emerge and rise to $20,000 a coin with no effect on the value of existing currencies? The bubble is right in front of us to see. 3. Cryptocurrencies are neither gold-standard nor fiat currencies. Those advising you to buy bitcoins tell you that mining bitcoin is akin to mining gold and that the quantity mined goes down as more and more coins get mined, thus maintaining a good demand-supply ratio. Thus, they argue, bitcoin will always have value. What they don\u2019t want to understand is that while bitcoin will be mined at a reducing rate, bitcoin is not the only currency. There are 4,000 altcoins already in the market, competing with each other. Why would you prefer bitcoin over any other coin? None of them has the backing of the government, so all of them are at par. Thus, there is an unlimited supply of cryptocurrencies possible. It will fail in the demand-supply game too. 4. Cryptocurrencies are the new tulips. They are worse than tulips. When the tulip bubble crashed, you were left holding a tulip, and you did not know what to do with that. When the cryptocurrency bubble bursts, you won\u2019t even have a tulip; it will be a string of 0s and 1s sitting on your computer which will have to be trashed. 5. It is a great technology. The blockchain will have hundreds of applications that will change the way we do things. Perhaps it will also create the government-backed fiat currency of the future. Bitcoin will be dead soon, but the blockchain will survive and will prove to be one of the best innovations of the twenty-first century. They will write praises of the blockchain over the tombstone of bitcoin. To cut it short, real investment is all about buying assets at a price way below its value so you have a sufficient margin of safety. In cryptocurrencies, there is none since their intrinsic value is zero. Any price you pay above zero is the excess you have paid over the value. Gold The intelligent investor does not buy gold; it has no intrinsic value. The love for gold is so deep-rooted in Indian minds that whatever arguments you give, people feel gold is a worthwhile investment class. Let us debunk the myth. What we talk about gold here applies to all metals and stones. The traditional Indian view has a root in the times when the banking system was not developed and was not accessible to all and when there were not enough investment avenues. People trusted metal more than anything else. It was easy to store and carry and could be sold or pawned when you ran out of money. Women were happy to flaunt the jewellery. In the minds of most people in our country, gold has continued to be the most solid investment and that its value would never go down to zero. The reason gold is not to be considered as an investment is that gold produces no return. It has no intrinsic value. It fetches the price based on demand and supply. If the investors were to shift to gold as their favourite investment, its price would shoot up; but if the investors found another metal, say platinum, more attractive and sold gold to buy platinum, gold\u2019s price would plummet. Gold performs no economic function. It is static wealth. It, in fact, has a negative intrinsic value: the investor pays storage charges to safeguard gold. It does not contribute to the economy and building the nation. When you buy the shares of a company, you are transferring your savings to a company which will use the money to create value. It will generate employment, pay taxes to the government, produce goods and services which will be consumed by the economy, and so on. Gold performs no such function; your wealth lies static, producing no real gain. As for those who would still like to buy gold because it appreciates, it would interest them to know that as per a study, over 35 years in India, gold grew at a pathetic rate of 2.54%, silver at even lower than that at 1.35%, while equity had a double-digit rate of growth. If you have access to modern financial systems, never invest in gold. If you live in a village which is not yet electrified and where the mobile phone and the Internet do not exist, gold can be a great investment. Gold is a great alternative currency. Recall the demonetisation announcement on 8 November 2016, when the first thing people did was to run to the jeweller to convert unaccounted cash into unaccounted gold. But if you are a part of the formal economy and modern financial systems, gold is not for you. Gold does not generate cash; it is not a money-making machine. The Biggest Scam of the Century: The Diamond Industry Diamonds are no better than cryptocurrencies as an investment. The moment we speak of diamonds, \u2018Diamonds are forever\u2019 echoes in our minds. Engagement rings must be diamond rings. It was not so just a few years back. It all started in 1938 when De Beers ran a massive campaign in the USA, bringing diamonds into the culture. Public memory is short. Diamonds have not been forever, and they won\u2019t be forever. They have been creating a demand for diamonds the world over as the only stone that can express romance. A diamond is a depreciating asset masquerading as an investment. Diamonds have no intrinsic value. Try selling a piece of diamond, and you will recognise how illiquid it is. You may get a fraction of what you paid for buying it. Since diamonds have no intrinsic value, the sales are backed by heavy promotions and exorbitant retailer margin. The typical markup of a retailer ranges from 100% to 200%. (You should realise this when your favourite jeweller offers you a 30% discount on diamond jewellery.) There is a series of middlemen involved between De Beers and you, each adding to his markup. I am not getting into the unethical aspects of diamond trade here (blood diamonds, bonded labour, child labour, unhealthy working conditions in the mines, etc.), but I am considering purely the investment angle. Diamonds are not fungible, which means they cannot be exchanged with each other. You will need to sell it at a fraction of its price if you want to buy another. So let us be clear: diamond is not an investment. Do not fall victim to the scam. Paintings, Antiques, Watches, Horses, and Other Collectibles A distinction must be made between assets which generate cash flows and those which do not. Paintings and other collectables do not have any economic function to perform and do not generate any cash flows. They need to be maintained. They need to be insured and stored safely. Vintage cars cost a hell of a lot of money to maintain. Horses need a hefty daily allowance to maintain. Like beauty that lies in the eyes of the beholder, the price of these assets also lies in the minds of the buyer. A painting with the signature of M. F. Hussain may sell for US$1 million. It has no relationship to the cost. There is no intrinsic value, except perhaps the money spent on paint and canvas. We are not interested in anything that has no intrinsic value and which does not perform any economic function. Since these assets have no intrinsic value, there is no benchmark price. If there is no buyer or if the preference changes, they won\u2019t sell. Not within our domain. Let\u2019s stay away from ego products. Real Estate Mark Twain once said, \u2018Buy land, they are not making it anymore.\u2019 The greed to own land has existed since time immemorial. Kings have fought wars to gain more land and to defend their territories. A distinction has always been made between people who own land and people who do not. The landlords have always been the ruling class and consider themselves superior to the tenants. This has made us greedy for land. Until recently, we carried the notion we never lose money in real estate. The greed for real estate created a big bubble which burst a few years back, and the investors are yet to recover from the shock. Thousands of flats are lying unsold. Builders have defaulted; many of them are bankrupt. The bubble has burst. Though the market will recover, real estate is still not the best of investments. Till a few years back when financial markets were not very developed, people invested in gold and in real estate. Unaccounted money, which goes by the euphemism \u2018black money\u2019, is the key feature of the Indian economy. What better avenue to put your money in than gold and real estate? Till recently, it was not uncommon for the seller to use terms such as 60: 40, which meant 60% \u2018white money\u2019 and 40% \u2018black money\u2019. Things have changed a great deal over time, though the sector still remains a parking place for unaccounted money. Contrary to what people believed, a long-term return on real estate has been less than the interest on fixed deposits. Excess short-term returns were possible during the periods of irrational exuberance. The collapse of the market has shattered that myth. A key criterion to gauge the intrinsic value of real estate is the rent it derives. In India the ratio of annual rental value to property price is low. Payback period based on rent is long, which makes real estate an unviable asset class. Gains come from capital appreciation and not from rent. Capital appreciation is random and erratic. Some properties may appreciate because of proximity to the market or for whatever reasons, while others may not appreciate as much. It is a gamble. If it is speculative, however good it may be, we do not recommend it. Among all asset classes, the most illiquid is the real estate. Laws in India are complicated. The government records are far from perfect. Impersonation and forged signatures were not too uncommon in the past; many properties continue to be tainted because of past bad transactions. Though there has been a marked improvement in the procedures in recent times, still the past defects continue. Sale of properties requires clearance from dozens of authorities. The typical period of the realisation of sale proceeds is one year. Litigations and non-receipt of NOCs from authorities may extend this period indefinitely. Money from properties may not become available to you when you need it. Real estate causes much of the family litigations that happen in India. Litigations continue for generations. I know of a property dispute that has been pending in the courts for over a hundred years. Properties carry a bundle of emotions, nostalgia, and egos with them. Most property disputes are ego driven and may defy logic. Property maintenance cost is high. Taxes and supervision costs are high. Encroachment on vacant properties is common, and the cost of keeping the property free from encroachment and encumbrance is exorbitant unless you are occupying the property. Sale price is a matter of haggling; there is no quote of the prevailing price, unlike shares and other securities where you can find the current market price on a day-to-day basis. Deals are done through a broker, often in secrecy. After the contract is executed, you discover that unscrupulous brokers have taken you for a ride. The property does not come in small pieces, and you need larger capital investment. In Mumbai, the minimum price for the smallest apartment starts at \u20b91 crore. In comparison, you can buy shares at as low as \u20b9500. Real estate is not a worthy investment proposition. You should consider real estate as an investment only if you can put them to actual use. If you do not own a house, buying a house is a recommended property investment for you. Buying factory land and buildings, office space, shops for your actual business requirements is recommended. Stay away from real estate for any other reason. Conclusion: Equity as an investment beats all other investment classes. It has been delivering a return of 13-14% per annum. When compounded over a long period, this return is substantially higher than the return on any other investments.
