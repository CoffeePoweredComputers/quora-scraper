            "answer_text": "How much energy does a computer lose as heat and how much as calculations? In other words, given the same amount of electricity, how much is a heater more efficient than a computer to warm the room? This is actually an interesting question, because ALL the energy input to the computer ends up as heat. It is exactly the same as plugging in a heater of the same wattage as the computer. The interesting thing about it is that if this is the case, the calculations and everything else the computer does, must be free. But that\u2019s not the way people look at it! The look at the calculations as being valuable, and the energy wasted. Worse than wasted, because it ultimately has to be rejected to the outside, which in most cases requires refrigeration systems, which make the total energy used even more. To answer the last question, the heater is no more efficient than the computer at warming a room. ",

            "answer_text": "Other than the minuscule amount of energy being sent down the phone line/cable connection, which is generally more than balanced out by the incoming amount, all of the energy becomes heat. In a house heated purely by electricity, and not using any sort of heat pump to extract extra from it\u2019s surroundings; during the seasons when the house is being heated, it is not wasteful to leave computers running, lights (even old incandescent or halogens) on, or anything else we are told wastes energy, as all of the \u201cwaste\u201d is just heat, and provided you have a thermostat, the extra heat will just mean your heating turns off earlier. In many ways a computer is a more efficient way to heat a room as it does something else with the energy first before heating the room. ",
