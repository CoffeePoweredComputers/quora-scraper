            "answer_text": "1.Home Health Aides Home health aides provide personalized, in-home assistance to individuals requiring extra help in daily activities. Though home health aides do not exclusively help senior citizens, the aging baby-boomer generation does make up a significant portion of the client base. Home health aides serve anyone needing personal assistance at home with health related issues, including those with cognitive disabilities, physical disabilities, and chronic illnesses. The duties of the job may involve assistance in tasks like dressing or bathing, meal preparation and planning, checking and recording a patient\u2019s pulse, temperature, blood sugar, changing bandages, assistance with prosthetic limbs, and more. The job requires some knowledge of basic health and care concepts, but it does not require extensive medical knowledge. Home health aides develop the knowledge and skills they need through on-the-job training. To enter the profession, individuals must have a high school diploma or equivalent. However, special training and certification may allow home health aides to assist with home medical equipment, and some states allow home health aides to administer medication. Home health aides may find employment with private or public agencies, community centers, and adult-day care centers. Educational Requirements: High school diploma or equivalent, as well as on-the-job training Projected Growth, 2016\u20132026: 2016 Total Employment: 911,5002026 Projected Total Employment: 1,337,000Median Annual Wage 2016: $22,600. 2.Wind Turbine Service Technicians Stemming from the push for renewable energy, wind turbine service technicians are in high demand, with the profession projected to grow by 96.1% over the next decade. That demand results in a large number of job openings for qualified individuals seeking to enter the field. Like solar photovoltaic installers, wind turbine service technicians are in the business of installing, maintaining, and repairing renewable energy systems. Individuals in this profession must possess a detailed knowledge of wind turbine systems and their operation. Wind turbine service technicians inspect and maintain wind turbines, ensuring their successful functioning, perform routine tests, replace worn or broken parts, collect and analyze data on systems, and service underground systems that convey energy from the turbines to collection facilities. To become a wind turbine service technician, individuals must earn a minimum of a postsecondary non-degree award, such as a certificate or diploma in wind turbine maintenance, from a college or technical school. Additionally, individuals receive on-the-job training. Wind turbine service technicians work for electrical power and utilities companies, repair services, and technical services. Some are self-employed. Those in the field may need to work odd hours to service out-of-commission turbines in remote locations and bad weather. Employment for the profession is determined by location, with most wind turbine systems being established in windy, open areas, such as California, Texas, and Iowa. Educational Requirements: Postsecondary non-degree award, plus on-the-job training Projected Growth, 2016\u20132026: 2016 Total Employment: 5,8002026 Projected Total Employment: 11,300Median Annual Wage 2016: $52,260. 3.Personal Care Aides Personal care aides, similar to home health aides, serve populations in need of extra assistance and care with their daily living requirements. However, the personal care aide profession places more emphasize on non-medical services. Personal care aides gain most of the knowledge they need through on-the-job training. They serve individuals with physical or cognitive disabilities, and other limiting health issues. Their duties include meal planning and preparation, dressing and bathing, housekeeping, arranging transportation or driving, and keeping their clients engaged. Personal care aides may find employment with private or public agencies, residential care facilities, and private households. Educational Requirements: High school diploma or equivalent, plus on-the-job training Projected Growth, 2016\u20132026: 2016 Total Employment: 2,016,1002026 Projected Total Employment: 2,770,100Median Annual Wage 2016: $21,920. 4.Statisticians Statisticians, like mathematicians, analyze and apply data in a wide variety of fields. Utilizing advanced knowledge of statistical interpretation, prediction, and mathematics, statisticians work with the government, research institutions, universities, finance and insurance companies, healthcare services, and consulting services. Statisticians predict trends and outcomes, anticipate problems, trace problems to their source, and develop models of prediction. To perform these roles, statisticians must design experiments, surveys and polls, must apply mathematical and statistical principles, and possess creativity and critical thinking skills. With organizations of all sorts and sizes relying on statisticians to aid in making key decisions, the field is expected to grow significantly over the next decade. To become a statistician, individuals need an advanced degree, with a Master\u2019s degree at a minimum, and a Doctoral or professional degree preferred for some situations. Educational Requirements: Master\u2019s degree Projected Growth, 2016\u20132026: 2016 Total Employment: 37,2002026 Projected Total Employment: 49,600Median Annual Wage 2016: $80,500. 5.Software Developers\u2013Applications Since the rise of the personal computer, skilled software developers have been in high demand. With the development of smartphones, tablets, cloud-based computing, and more accessible computer technologies the demand for software developers who specialize in applications is expected to steadily increase. Whether creating word processors or spreadsheets software for computers, productivity apps for busy professionals, learning apps for adults and children, or games for pure entertainment, applications software developers have plenty of unique jobs and projects to choose from. Regardless of their specific focus, all applications software developers analyze, design, and test applications, troubleshoot and recommend upgrades for clients and employers, documents aspects of their applications, and collaborate in design teams. Applications software developers may work in a variety of professional settings, including application design firms, software publishers, financial or insurance companies, manufacturing companies, and corporations. To become an applications software developer, individuals must have a minimum of a Bachelor\u2019s degree in a relevant field, such as computer science or software engineering. Educational Requirement: Bachelor\u2019s degree Projected Growth, 2016\u20132026: 2016 Total Employment: 831,3002026 Projected Total Employment: 1,084,600Median Annual Wage 2016: $100,080. thank you so much reading my answer \u2764\ufe0f.
