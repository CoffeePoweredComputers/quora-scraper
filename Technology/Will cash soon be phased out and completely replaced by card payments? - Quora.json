            "answer_text": "No, most people in the cities forget in the country cash is still king. Cash means never having to tell the IRS your sorry. There isn\u2019t any tracking of how cash is spent. This drives big brother crazy. We, as Americans, are far too willing to give up privacy to our govt. Does this sound like paranoia? Not really. If you use social media you have already given up most of your privacy. Why do you think you get ads from companies that you have never heard of? It is not random, social media makes billions off your info. A cashless society tells the Bank, the State, and the Feds where all your money goes. Think about this abstract line of thought. ",

            "answer_text": "Socially, this appears to be happening in places, but the government hasn\u2019t pushed it, and it hasn\u2019t become mandatory, and for a few good reasons. For one, poorer people would suddenly lose even more access to performing economic activity of any kind, which is a big problem. For two, not everyone enjoys the Internet as much as would be ideal for a cashless society. Things are moving in that direction, but will they ever be forced to be? We\u2019ll have to wait and see. I already run without cash and it doesn\u2019t stop me from doing basically anything. ",
