            "answer_text": "This question refers to one of those phenomena of the universe, which is not yet described accurately by Science. It is life after death\u2026.  Before you read, I want to tell you that I don't mean to harm or disrespect any religious beliefs or practices in this answer. With all my due respect to those religion and the followers of them, I start sharing my opinion. First of all, there are only one group of people in the universe who would accurately describe what exactly happen when we die. They are the dead people. However there are certain hypothesis, certain observations and certain incidents that refers that there may be a life after we die. One of them is the N-DE or Near Death Experiences. N-DE is one of those rare occasions where a person, physically declared dead, comes back to life. Why is that? Let me explain. When someone is close to death, their heart stops beating. So it will fail to send blood throughout our body, resulting multi organ failures. But the brain still works in those cases, even after the heart is stopped. This moment is the crucial stage of one's life\u2026. If the doctors or person tending to the patient can't revive the blood flow before brain death, then death in inevitable. Now let us assume that the person is revived before his/her brain death. What are their experiences? According to them, they see themselves gliding through a dark tunnel, or being in a complete numbness, in a dark surrounding. They can\u2019t move, walk or talk\u2026. They just stay. There is no pain, sadness, anything. Just peace. Opinions differ from person to person. But the most significant as well as shocking thing is that, many person actually see themselves standing in a corner of the exact same room where he sees his own body being treated by Doctors. Their descriptions of the doctor's desperate attempts to revive the body is shockingly accurate, as mentioned by many doctors who were there.  So are there souls or spirits in existence? Who had seen the body then? Now experts say something different to this. According to them, the observations like \u201cgliding through the tunnel\u201d or even sometimes \u201cmeeting dead people\u201d are due to the release of DMT or N,N-Dimethyltryptamine in the brain, which is a drug, as well as a powerfull hallucinogen. This drug is found in trace amounts in human nervous system, and according to experts, this is the reason for such supernatural phenomena.  As mentioned earlier, brain remains active even when heart is stopped. This is the time when DMT is released into brain, and the person hallucinates such things. DMT is also taken as a drug from outside, by some people or tribal men, as a part of their ritual. They also witness such hallucinations even though they were nowhere near to death. Now some people close to death, lose hope sometimes. They constantly feel \u201c..this is the end\u201d or \u201cnow I will meet my loved ones soon\u201d or something like that. So the hallucinations include the images of the dead people who the person was thinking about as their loved ones. This is my point of view about the reason of observing these apparantly supernatural phenomena. Now I am coming to a seemingly different topic, that may explain our state after we die. Since our birth, we contribute to entropy. What is entropy? Basically it is a thermodynamic concept that measures the randomness of the system. Entropy increases over time, you can't prevent it. This is why we get old, and die. Our system is becoming less stable every single moment. This may freak you out, but this is truth. Why am I speaking all this? Because of this fact, that we believe souls are indestructible. They cannot die. This is not true, if souls are assumed to be an entity. According to me, souls are nothing but energy. According to principle of conservation of energy, an energy cannot be created or destroyed, it can be converted into other form. Same thing goes for souls. When we die, we just become a part of the energy governing the universe, which can be nothing but God, according to religious beliefs. This is from where we started, this is where we should return. :) ",

            "answer_text": "Let med tell you about what happens at the point of death, according to the Bhagavat Purana. If you have been very good and pious, you will upon leaving the body be led to the planets of the demigods - the heavenly planets. There you will enjoy for millions of years before again you will be born on earth as a human. On the heavenly planets you enjoy basically as you do on earth - sex, drugs and rockn,roll - but it takes place on a subtle plane, the astral plane as some call it. You are in a subtle body - a psychic, finer physical body that doesn't exude excretions. IOW, you don't perspire, fart or stink. In heaven there are heavenly dancing girls and the soma-drink - an intoxication that makes you feel good and prolongs life. The music is delivered by the gandharvas - some sort of angles who are the musicians of the heavenly planets. On the heavenly planets there is no disease or old age, but eventually you die and fall back to a human body on earth. Now, at the point of death, if you have been very cruel and evil not caring or empathizing with other living entities, you will be picked up by the Yamadhutas, the messengers of Yamaraja - the god of Death - and taken to the hellish planets, where you will be tortured and undergo purgatory for what feels like eternity. Like on the heavenly planets, it happens on a subtle, astral plane, so a moment can feel like a long, long time - like in a dream. After having ended your prescribed suffering, you will again be born on earth, but not necessarily from a human womb. You can be born in any of the 8.400.000 species of life. If you have just been an ordinary, somewhat decent human, neither too good nor too evil, like people are most, at the point of death you will fall into a deep sleep and stay like that for 7 months after which you'll wake up and find yourself tied up in a womb. The situation for the fetus is full of pain and distress. You are in full consciousness but you are totally bound up and gagged, it's like being bound up very tightly in a sack. You will remember everything you did to land you in this particular womb, why you will be born to certain parents. Then after 2 months of such hell you are squeezed out of a hole much too little for you, and born in shock into total forgetfulness. The foster state is described in the Bhagavat Purana in great detail. If, OTOH, you have practiced spiritual life and think of Krishna at the time of death, you will return to the spiritual world in your original constitution of eternity, knowledge and bliss. Or you will be born in some universe on some planet where Krishna has descended to reveal His pastimes. When that period has ended, you will return with Krishna to Goloka either as one of His friends, His girl-friends or as His elder in a parental mood. The choice is yours. Where ever you go after death will be according to how you formed your mental body. The mental or the psychic body is formed after the activities of your gross, physical body and the mentality you are cultivating. Krishna says: And whoever, at the end of his life, quits his body remembering Me alone at once attains My nature. Of this there is no doubt. (Bg. 8.5) Whatever state of being one remembers when he quits his body, O son of Kunti, that state he will attain without fail. (Bg 8.6)  ",
