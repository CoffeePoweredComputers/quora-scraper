            "answer_text": "Do you have a cellphone? If so, it probably runs on a 4G network. A decade ago, telecom companies spent over $200 billion on the cell towers needed for 4G. That\u2019s a lot of money. But it\u2019s small potatoes compared to the $500 billion they\u2019re spending on the towers to upgrade to 5G. \u201c5G,\u201d as you\u2019ve probably heard, is short for fifth-generation wireless network. This new technology will let phones and computers communicate 1,000 times faster than 4G\u2014enabling everything from remote surgery to self-driving cars. In order to get 5G fully up and running, the US needs 300,000 new cell towers. These towers form the physical foundation of the 5G network. So they\u2019re absolutely essential. The Safe 5G Plays Investors are already pouring money into 5G. As with any new technology, some are looking for that \u201cmoonshot\u201d stock\u2014the one that might quickly shoot up 100% or more. Those kinds of wins are great. But let\u2019s face it, moonshot stocks are too risky for most income investors. Still, that doesn\u2019t mean we have to sit this one out. Back in July, I recommended buying shares of AT&T (T), the second-largest telecom company in the US. Shares have surged 20% since:  AT&T is starting to look expensive, though. I wouldn\u2019t buy it right now. But there are other ways to safely profit from 5G. I\u2019ll share four great options in a moment\u2026 The Backbone of the 5G Revolution Remember, the US needs 300,000 new cell towers for the 5G upgrade. The companies that build and maintain these towers are called tower real estate investment trusts (REITs). They\u2019re required to pay out 90% of their profits as dividends. So they usually have fat dividend yields. At the same time, network hardware companies supply the high-tech chips that let the towers \u201ctalk\u201d to each other. Both of these sectors are critical for 5G, which has already launched in small pockets of the US. Their stocks are set to surge as the rest of the country rolls over to 5G. Tower REITs Will Rake in Cash Tower REITs own the cell towers, which they lease to wireless carriers like AT&T and Verizon. Crown Castle International Corp. (CCI), for example, owns more than 40,000 cell towers in the US. The company will rake in cash from wireless carriers as they expand their 5G capabilities. And, with a 3.6% dividend yield, Crown is hard to beat for income investors like us. Crown\u2019s chief competitor, SBA Communications (SBAC), also stands to benefit from the 5G upgrade. The company owns towers in all 50 states and Canada. SBA started paying a small dividend this year. Right now, the yield is only 0.7%. But the company has a lot of cash. So I expect a dividend increase next quarter. Chip Market to Double Three Times Over As I mentioned earlier, cell towers need special chips to talk to each other. And the market for those chips is set to boom as 5G becomes a reality nationwide. Last year, 5G chips were a $593 million market. That figure should hit $19 billion in 2022, according to Bank of America. In other words, the market will more than double every year for the next three years.  5G towers need two types of chips: backhaul and fronthaul. Cisco Systems, Inc. (CSCO) is one of the leading backhaul chip providers, so it\u2019s primed to profit from the 5G buildout. Cisco is also a well-established company with a safe 2.9% dividend yield. So it\u2019s a great fit for income investors. I also like Analog Devices, Inc. (ADI), the largest company operating in the new fronthaul chip market. (Fronthaul chips will let data travel faster over the 5G network.) Analog Devices will directly benefit from 5G technology in cars. This includes in-dash infotainment displays like this one: Eventually, ADI\u2019s chips will allow streaming video and other content in your car. The company has a safe and reliable 1.9% dividend yield. So it\u2019s a great addition to any income investor\u2019s portfolio.

            "answer_text": "There is likely to be a huge investment in 5G over the next decade according to many experts in technology (see The road to 5G: The inevitable growth of infrastructure cost). 5G will have much more rapid Internet speeds and serve as the backbone for many of the key technological innnovations taking place including the Internet of Things as well as Autonomous Cars. There are many components to building the 5G infrastructure as well as technological devices that will be used on the band. Before listing any stocks, as with any investment it is critical that one conducts there one research and make an informed decision as there are always risks (prices can go down, companies can fail, etc.). Some stocks that I believe have promise for the 5G age (note I have a small amount of NOK and SNSR Stock): Nokia - While Nokia had its heyday about a decade ago, the company is likely to play a key role in helping Telecom companies and others around the world build and operate 5G infrastructures. While the stock is now trading a bit about $6, I don\u2019t foresee a huge increase. But the stock does also pay a healthy dividend of slightly over 4%.Many of the key Telecom Companies - Some of the larger Telecom companies in the US and elsewhere that will be providing 5G data services to their individual and corporate clients might see strong returns. I say might as this isn\u2019t guaranteed, but stocks such as AT & T, Verizon, Tmobile, Vodafone and others around the world could be potentially good investments. I would caution though that one needs to carefully look at Telecom companies as there are risks with any stocks.The SNSR IOT ETF might be an interesting choice. As many companies in this space will play a key role in providing services on the 5G infrastructure. It does have an expense fee of .68% and the past year has performed great. But I think it has potential or one can also look at the holdings that include companies such as:SkyworksCiscoDo reading on finance platforms, news outlets and more to see what are some of key companies that are likely to play a key role in 5G.Again as with any investment one should always do your own research to make an informed decision and be aware of potential risks/challenges.
