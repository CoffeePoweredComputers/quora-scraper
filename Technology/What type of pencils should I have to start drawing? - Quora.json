            "answer_text": "For drawing, you definitely want to make sure you get at least a decent RANGE of tones. My recommendation is to get something that has an HB, 2B, 4B, and 6B. Those are commonly sold as a four pencil set, complete with a pencil sharpener and an eraser. (Whenever you see a \u201cB\u201d after the number, think of it like \u201cblack\u201d that they are softer pencils which leave darker marks. 2B is darker/softer than HB, 4B is darker/softer than 2B, etc. On the other side of the spectrum, you have the H pencils like 2H, 4H, etc. The \u201cH\u201d stands for \u201chardness\u201d, and usually results in lighter/harder marks. Those are good for fine details and finer lines.) Technically speaking, you only NEED one pencil to draw. But many artists (myself included) use a few of the above mentioned ranges because they allow you to get darker or lighter. Another question you may want to ask yourself is, \u201cDo you want to draw in graphite or in charcoal?\u201d I started out with graphite pencils, but I have since moved onto charcoal pencils. With charcoal pencils, I have found that I can get much darker values\u2026..and unlike graphite, charcoal is not reflective so it won\u2019t have a shine when light hits it. Here is an example drawing I did in charcoal to give you an idea of how DARK you can get with it. I also find that charcoal allows for faster drawing since it can be blended and smoothed out a bit easier/faster. Downside is that you will get your hands dirty:  On my YouTube page, I also have tutorial videos for every portrait that you see, which hopefully will be a big help to you. Please let me know if you have any other questions. ",

            "answer_text": "None. You can draw with a stick in the dirt. If you want to do graphite drawings, there still aren\u2019t \u201crequirements\u201d (unless you are in a class and the teacher provided you with a materials list, in which case the requirements are listed). I usually draw with a range of pencils running from 6B to 2H. I don\u2019t care to go harder, because I don\u2019t like to feel as though I\u2019m drawing with a nail. The Bs are softer lead, the higher the number, the softer the lead. The Hs are harder lead. Again, the higher the number, the harder. If you want to do some sketching that will be hidden by your drawing later, start with the harder lead pencils and a lighter touch. If you plan to do smudging, to create shading and gradations, use a softer lead. Another thing that matters is the paper you are drawing on. For pencil drawing, you\u2019ll want a bit of tooth to the paper. Texture. If the paper is too slick, your drawings will end up looking light, and smudge easily since there\u2019s nothing for the graphite to grab onto. Also, don\u2019t drop your pencils. Even if they don\u2019t look bad after a fall, the lead can fracture easily inside of the wood, and every time you go to sharpen the pencil, the lead will fall out. You don\u2019t need to buy expensive drawing pencils when starting out. If you prefer mechanical pencils, you can buy lead refills of varying hardness that follow the same scale. I also like to do my initial sketching with a non-photo blue pencil. Even if it\u2019s work I intend on finishing. I just like how it looks. ",

            "answer_text": "Hi, Sketching is basically \u2018shading\u2019 the drawing. Inorder to shade it, we can use few categories of pencils to obtain different shades. There are three types: H(Hard type) HB(Mid-variety) B(Bold type) \u2018H\u2019 range of pencils produce light shades. \u2018B\u2019 produce darker shades and HB stands in between them. Usually, H or HB is used to draw the outline and fill the basics. Then HB is used to darken up a little. Then the Bold variety B is employed to further give a good, dark blend for the sketch. Different ranges of H and B are there => H-9H ; B-9B . Each producing its unique lightness and darkness. They just indicate the \"Degree of Darkness\". There is something called \"F\" type, which is nothing but a mid-shade sharp pencil. This pencil sharpens to a fine end.  Apart from these, we can use charcoal pieces, graphite chalks, colour pencils, pastel pencils, ballpens, marker pens, etc,. While using charcoal pieces in the beginning, you won't get the flexibility like the one you get in Shade Pencils. You may end up with your fingers filled with charcoal dust. But once you start using it, your work will look rich. In the case of pencils, When you start, start with HB. Then, Grow your work with H, B shades. Then with Charcoal or whatever choice you like. Happy sketching! :) That's all from me, Srivignesh ",

I\u2019m enclosing a link to almost all the pencils (brands, types, prices, grades) you can buy Drawing and Sketching Pencils I started out with a #2 schoolroom pencil and for years that is all I needed. If your past a beginner and more an intermediate, the Blick studio set will more than suffice Lets face it, graphite is still basically graphite and it doesn\u2019t matter if your pencil was put together by 76 virgins and blessed by a priest on the 7th day of July by the Pope or if it is made by the \u201cLighthouse for the Blind\u201d, there is a point where your personal skill makes the difference and not the brand name of the pencil.

A great tin to buy is this medium set of the Derwent Graphic pencil range Derwent : Graphic Pencil : Tin Set of 12 : Medium I used only a HB, 2B and 4B in this drawing here. All the best with your drawing journey, its so wonderful to draw!  ",

            "answer_text": "You dont need to have a wide range of tools at your disposal to start with painting or sketching. You can start with a HB and a 2B graphite pencil. These are good for the initial stages and you can achieve a range of shades using only these two. They are easily available as well. I had started off using these. Below are some of my sketches created using only HB and 2B pencils.   Later on, as you start understanding the finer aspects better, you can add darker pencils like 4b, 6b, 8b to your kit. Depending upon your style, you will realise what you need to add. Hope this answer may help you to start. Happy sketching! :-) ",

A light sketch with a hard graphite pencil effect:  Image source: How to Draw a Trout: step-by-step - John Muir Laws In the case of the popular brand Kimberly, the darkest lead is 9xxb and the lightest is 2H. Both 2H and H would be recommended for preliminary sketching if you don\u2019t want the lines to be seen in the final piece.

            "answer_text": "2B. B means 2 things. The lead us softer and more breakable with pressure. It also means that it is rich and black. With this lead you can work all of your lights and darks with pressure and or layering of tone. Its perfect. B 2-6 means softer and darker with each progression up in numbers. 6 is charcoal like. Smudgy and black. I don't like the complication of using different pencils. I achieve all the tones I need with 2B. I use mechanical pencil because of the frustration of having to continually sharpen the pencil as the point dulls. I like detail and tiny marks. With wooden pencils and all the sharpening, you end up drawing with a 1 inch pencil. H stands for \u201chard\" and you cant get much more than a silvery grey with it. Layers will never reach black. I call it \u201cmath homework grade\u201d pencil. But some might like it. You can make beautiful art from any medium if you know what your doing and how to use your materials. If and when I teach drawing, when the drawings are graphite, I only bring 2B. No one has ever needed more. Staples brand mechanical pencils are quite nice. Inside there are extra leads and erasers for when they wear out. You can buy little packs of replacement leads in many brands. These, and a sketchbook are a portable studio. ",

But if you are interested then I would recommend 2H for the light sketch an HB or 2B for just the majority of the drawing and then a 4B for the dark areas of the drawing. Now\u2026. if you're talking about the brand it does not really matter any brand would work fine. All of this could still be done with a number 2 HB pencil but still, it's nice to have some different gradients for darker or lighter lines. But most of the time you cant get just those and you get a whole pencil set all the way from 9H to 9B which is still nice any kind of pencil that produces a mark will work and it's nice to experience with the different types of pencils and see which ones you like to use. The ones I stated above is my preference. I would recommend getting some different pencil gradients as long as if it is not too expensive. ",

            "answer_text": "The best pencils are the ones you use the most. It\u2019s a personal thing. If you\u2019ve been sketching for a while you will have noticed differences between them, in particular, that some pencils produce a darker line; others lighter. That\u2019s a function of how much graphite (darker) or clay (lighter) the lead contains. The softer (darker) leads will smudge more easily, harder (lighter) will produce a line that won\u2019t move much. In addition to the qualities of the marks they leave, notice which ones feel good in your hand as you draw. Most art supply stores have pencils and pads out next to the displays, which allows you to compare these qualities before you lay your money down. So, try different brands, different densities, and different shapes - (round, flat rectangular). Also, check out color and mechanical pencils too. You\u2019ll soon which are the best pencils - for you! ",

So, if you are based in India you can go with faber castell or any such brand. Also it depends if you mean to draw good but normal drawings ( not aiming realism) then any good brand will do. LET ME TALK ABOUT PENCIL : They come in H and B. H stands for hardness of the lead and B stands for blackness / darkness. Higher the number associated with h, harder will be the lead and softer will be the pencil stroke. So use a 2h pencil for rough drawing and then use may be a 2b for final drawing. Also these different values are used for shading. Light and dark tones. You may check my previous answers, if you find this a little confusing. I have written about pencils and books you need to look for, if you wish to. Hope it helps. ",
