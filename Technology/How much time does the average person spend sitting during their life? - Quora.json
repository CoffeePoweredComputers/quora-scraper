            "answer_text": "According to this infographic, Sitting is Killing You - MedicalBillingAndCoding.org , Americans spend 9.3 hours a day on sitting. That sounds reasonable to me.  Some groups obviously sit more than others. If you for instance have a work where you sit most of the time and work 8 hours/day, 5 days a week it\u2019s likely that you sit more than average. 2 hours/day is reasonable to spend on meals. 2 hours is reasonable to spend on traveling to and from work. That is 12 hours/day. Besides all of that, I\u2019m sure that many of us sit down watching TV to round off the day or perhaps sit in front of the computer. If we now assume that we don\u2019t spend any time during the weekend on sitting, we will get a sitting average of 60 hours / week = 8.6 hours/day. But it\u2019s safe to say that we will spend at least 2 hours/weekday on meals which will give us a sitting average of 64 hours / week = 9.1 hours/dayIt\u2019s actually scary how much time we spend on sitting. We even sit at the gym :)According to The Mayo Clinic, Do you have 'sitting disease'? , 50 to 70 percent of people spend six or more hours sitting a day. 20 to 35 percent spend four or more hours a day watching TV Researches show that sitting a lot reduces our life expectancy, so it might be a good idea to do what you can do to reduce your sitting average.Here\u2019s the link to Forbes' article about the danger of sitting: Research Shows that the More You Sit, the Less You'll LiveNY Times' article: Stand Up While You Read This! Here's a good article on how to break the cycle of sitting: How much time do you spend sitting?. ",
