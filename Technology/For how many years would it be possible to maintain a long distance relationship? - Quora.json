            "answer_text": "It really is about the two involved and what they want out of the relationship. I have been in a long distance relationship for over 2 years now (we were together for a few more years prior to that, but not LDR). I know friends who fell out of a LDR in less than a year. It's not really about there being an expiration date, but knowing the following: 1. Do you want to be together despite the distance? Would the relationship work in all other aspects if you eliminated the distance? Some realtionships ONLY work because the partners are apart, as crazy as it sounds. Distance makes the heart grow fonder for some and close proximity can lead to plotting murder for others. 2. What is the obstacle between being together? Is it work? School? Citizenship or financial obligations? Is there a possible end to the timeline? (4 years and then graduating, work will end in and you'll be home in 2 years, visa will be ready in a year)3. What is your agreed timeline? You both have to be onboard for a relationship of any kind to work and for a long distance one, communication and clarity is even more important. For my other half and I, we know we are in it for a long haul because of both our jobs. Neither of us can work where the other is, but we are willing to keep this going. Does it suck? Oh yea. Is it possible? Well, we're still together for now. 4. What is your end goal? Marriage? Having one move to be with the other? Kids?  I think a strong relationship is always worth trying your hand at despite obstacles like time, distance, finances. Good luck. ",

            "answer_text": "I know of one that has lasted over a decade(15 yrs) without the use of video or Skype. I also know of a marriage that has to use Skype because of their careers having them travel all over the world. But they are the exception, not the rule.  Any long distance relationship requires clear, honest communication and some sort of semi-regular in person visits. Anything is possible, but both have to be willing to work at it and maintain it. ",
