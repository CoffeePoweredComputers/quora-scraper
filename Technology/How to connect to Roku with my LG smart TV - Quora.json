            "answer_text": "On the back of your LG, there are probably at least four HDMI ports. Your Roku box/stick should have come with a short HDMI cable. Connect the cable between the Roku box/stick and one of the HDMI ports on the LG. The Roky device should also include a wall charger that also has a cable, probably a USB cable, to connect between the wall charger and the Roku box/stick. Hook everything up, turn on the TV and use the remote to change the input port to the HDMI port connected to the Roku. You should see a user interface. You will not have to navigate through the user interface being displayed on tv to the wireless setup. Here you will locate your wireless wifi router, select it, and enter the password for the wifi when prompted. Once you are connected to the Wifi the Roku will find its way to the Roku website. Here you will use the Roku remote to setup your Roku account and you are ready to have fun. cheers pat price ",
