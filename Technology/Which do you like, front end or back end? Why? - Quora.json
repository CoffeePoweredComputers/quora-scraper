            "answer_text": "Well, since the two existing answers said front end, I\u2019ll provide the contrast. I\u2019m a rather asocial introvert with probably a touch of Asperger\u2019s. While I can do front end development, I\u2019d much rather do the back end work. I\u2019m not particularly visual (my dreams are more like someone telling me a story than me watching a movie). That makes it hard for me to create something that is visual; I can do it, but it takes a lot more effort. Now, dealing with the computer and data? That comes easily. I understand how to store and retrieve data, whether in files or a database. I can transform data from one format to another, handle applying equations to it, etc. I understand data structures, I can learn algorithms. ",

I like putting the extra time into choosing layout, fonts, and flourishes like animations. I prefer front-end for that reason. However, the back-end of a system is tremendously important in terms of the functionality of an actual app/website and I have only respect for back-end developers. ",
