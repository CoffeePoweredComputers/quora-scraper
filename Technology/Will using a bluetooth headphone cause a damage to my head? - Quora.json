            "answer_text": "Obviously, a Bluetooth headphone cannot cause physical damage to the head. At least, it could be a headache caused by a heavy and tight headband, which also cannot bend. However, we can look at it from another perspective - can it cause cancer? Let\u2019s make things clear. Does a Bluetooth headphones release radiation? To understand this, you should know how it works. Wireless headsets are radio-transmitting accessories that are connected to your device via Bluetooth. The latter is a radio frequency radiation that operates by sending data over a limited distance through the air. Not to be confused with the radiation from a mobile phone that transmits signals through a long distance. So, the radiofrequency from Bluetooth headphones has a lower power and radiation release, which is not that strong to give rise to tumor. Thus, the Federal Communications Commission states that the damage to a head caused by using wireless Bluetooth headphones has never been scientifically found and proven, nor its relation to cancer or other health issues. In the meantime, the World Health Organization suggests that Bluetooth headphones and mobile phones might be a reason for a tumor due to the increase of cases with a tumor in particular part of the head. And this is where we should slow down to make things even clearer. Health concerns Where are the headphones usually placed? Obviously, it\u2019s in or over your ears. The longer you listen to music, the more you augment the period of contact of EMF radiation with your head and brain tissues. Here are some other health concerns users should be aware of: Emotional breakdown and headachesSome users report starting experiencing headaches after using the headphones. Biological impactThe radiation thrown by mobile phones and Bluetooth headsets send the signals of calcium ion and bring about the leakage of ion channels in the brain, according to Dr. Andrew Goldsworthy. It can lead to a human brain damage, particularly to neuronal and irrevocable DNA one, which booms the threat of cancer. ADHD - Attention Deficit Hyperactivity DisorderThis disease has also been attributed to an excessive exposure of the head and brain to the radiation from Bluetooth headphones and mobile phones. Therefore, these are just indirect suggestions that radiation from headsets and mobile devices is somehow related to brain issues. But they cannot be considered as established scientific proof. So, Bluetooth headphones rather do not cause damage to your head. Keep on reading. There\u2019s something more about it. Suggesting that the radiation of EMF impacts on your head and brains, yet the ability of Bluetooth from headsets to do harm depends on its capacity to influence DNA and cells. The radiation needs to fracture the DNA molecular bonds to the moment when the data is changed prior to producing cancer in a cell. This can only happen when the radiation is ionizing, which exiles electrons from molecules and atoms. Thus, the characteristics of the DNA atoms are shifted, and its molecule bonds are fractured, the cells are trying to reproduce, and tumor cells can theoretically start growing. But here\u2019s the truth - Bluetooth is non-ionizing radiation that cannot fracture bonds of molecules and atoms in the DNA. As a result, it doesn\u2019t bring about any tumor cells growing into cancer. The Internet \u201cspreads rumors\u201d about potential risks, such as Bluetooth ruins nerve cells or microwaves the brain. But none of them are true. And now you know why. Finally, the American Cancer Society says that between you and a wireless device there\u2019s a big distance, which decreases the amount of radiofrequency waves that reach your head. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, definitely. If one fills a bag with hundreds of Bluetooth headsets and then hits you on the head with it, it surely causes serious damage your head. Seriously? This conspiracy theory has been bouncing around for more than 20 years (read: it predates Bluetooth) for each electronic device introduced. In the beginning, it was claimed that cellphones cause brain cancer, then it was claimed that WiFi causes tissue damage, etc. Such claims make absolutely no sense and have thus been proven wrong by several academic research projects. In summary: personal wireless technologies that exist today do NOT adversely affect human health. If you think otherwise, then perhaps you should stop using electricity altogether as it has been proven that it causes tens of thousands of deaths each year. Accepting a technology that causes tens of thousands of deaths each year but rejecting a technology that hasn't caused a single fatality since it's introduction can only be called one thing: hypocrisy. Edit: A recent scientific research (unlike a conspiracy theory) published finds no correlation between cell phone use and brain cancer. As Bluetooth operates at the same frequency with mobile phones but sports less power, I must say that it's time to do away with this myth. Summary of the article: 30-year study turns up no link between mobile phones and cancer The original was found in medscape website but it requires username and password that I don't have. As a result, enjoy both your mobile phone and your Bluetooth earphones, as science says. ",
