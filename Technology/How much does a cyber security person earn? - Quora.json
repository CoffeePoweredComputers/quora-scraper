            "answer_text": "Cybersecurity Salary: One Skill Makes a Huge Difference  Nate SwannerJuly 11, 20187 min read CybersecurityEarningssalarytech pros  Cyber security has never been more important. With leaks, bad actors, and GDPR all in the news, every tech firm is concerned with securing user data and how it flows through the world. But does a typical cyber security salary match that universal importance? Happily, we can report that it does. But like the job itself, the real story of a cyber security salary is in contextual nuance. Leaning into our Dice Salary Calculator for guidance, we used cyber security jobs in San Francisco for tech pros with five years\u2019 experience as an industry baseline. (We picked San Francisco as the base for this study because so many Silicon Valley tech pros live and work there, so it\u2019s a great place to start.) We isolated three job titles: \u2018Cyber Security,\u2019 \u2018Cyber Security Engineer,\u2019 and \u2018Cyber Security Analyst.\u2019 These three job titles return different cyber security salary ranges, so each is worth examining. We examined salary levels in various major metro areas across the United States, then took the median of the three cyber security salary ranges and applied it to Bankrate\u2019s cost of living calculator. Job titles matter. If you want a decent cyber security salary, presenting yourself as an \u2018engineer\u2019 is your best bet: It\u2019s a title that tends to pay on the higher end of the tech pro salary spectrum. (Generic \u2018Cyber Security, without any job title attached to it, is respectable, too, although most companies won\u2019t consider your application unless you get a bit more specific.) If you can manage to be a \u2018cyber security engineer\u2019 at your place of employment, do so. If you\u2019re concerned about titles affecting your career earnings, avoid the \u2018analyst\u2019 role. It pays slightly less, and adding specialized skills doesn\u2019t shift the needle very much. The only meaningful skill that boosts an analyst\u2019s earnings is CISSP. (Engineers will also see a boost from CISSP, which is far and away the most influential skill for cyber security salary across job titles.) Happily, we see cyber security salary is high across major metro areas. For the chart below, we took the average of the three job title salaries and compared them to a comparable rate for San Francisco. The second column shows the average salary for job titles, and the last is what Bankrate\u2019s cost-of-living calculator says is an equitable cyber security salary, comparatively. Cyber Security Salary - Cost of Living 1 Silicon Valley 96,750 N/A 2 Boston 86,083 79,144 3 New York (Brooklyn) 92,417 94,995 4 San Diego 88,250 79,418 5 Washington D.C. 92,250 80,515 6 Baltimore 86,000 61,867 7 Seattle 85,333 76,950 8 Los Angeles 88,083 76,950 9 Philadelphia 77,833 65,542 10 Minneapolis 86,729 59,344 11 Dallas 81,500 52,708 12 Denver 82,833 60,112 13 Total Averages 87,005 73,691 Data compiled using Dice's Salary Calculator, 2018 Salary Survey, and BankRate's Cost of Living Calculator Source: Dice The average cyber security salary is pretty high in just about every geography. New York is the only city where the average cyber security salary doesn\u2019t compare to Silicon Valley, actually falling a few thousand dollars short. Minneapolis, Minnesota continues to outperform. It has the largest gap between average salary and comparable cost of living to Silicon Valley; cyber security pros in that city see a $27,000 gap between an equitable cost of living and average salary. Denver also ranks highly with a $22,000 gap. Those two cities help bring the average gap between earnings and comparable cost of living to right around $14,500. If there\u2019s one bit of advice, it\u2019s that skills matter. A CISSP certification can yield a ten percent bump for any cyber security salary, so it\u2019s highly suggested for cyber security professionals.

            "answer_text": "According to CIO, cyber security professionals earn an average of $116,000 annually or $55.77 per hour, for instance, while PayScale estimates that the average salary for computer security specialists is around $74,000, with location as a major factor in pay structure.  A January article by Steve Morgan at Forbes, based on data from multiple sources, points out that top cyber security salaries in major U.S. metros can reach as much as $380,000 annually. According to Glassdoor.com, a cyber security engineer makes an average of $85,000 annually, while the Infosec Institute estimates that the average annual salary for an incident responder is $81,000, although the average varies by location, at about $83,000 in San Francisco and around $70,000 in Georgia. For a vulnerability research engineer, the average salary is around $96,000 annually. Salaries fluctuate based on location and company size, but the data is adjusted for cost of living. In San Francisco, for instance, the salary for a senior cyber security engineer can range between $122,000 and $207,000. In Atlanta, the salary ranges between $72,000 and $107,000. According to a report from TechRepublic, the 15 cities in the United States with the highest salaries for cyber security professionals include (salary data adjusted for cost of living): 1.
