            "answer_text": "There is so much to share. I've been doing this for nearly half my life - it is both the most rewarding and most frustrating thing I\u2019ve ever done. My experiences with teaching have been quite varied. I started in a job teaching AP Chemistry to some of the hardest-working kids on the planet. They were absolutely amazing, and they pushed me to my limits. That was great. But things change. Even though I still work in the same building, the city and culture has changed around me. I now have massive attendance and apathy problems, and the average grades in my class have plummeted. I spend lots of time on behavior problems and remediation. One thing I\u2019ve learned from this transition is that I can\u2019t teach students I don\u2019t see. Quite simply, skipping a class is something I cannot help with. I\u2019ve tried so many strategies to increase student attendance, and nothing has worked. I don\u2019t know how to solve this particular problem, but until it gets solved, my failure rate will remain high. It\u2019s tragic, particularly because most of the students who have terrible attendance aren\u2019t terrible students - many are quite bright. But they perform poorly because they miss so much instruction. I\u2019ve also learned that parental involvement is critical. I had to stop giving homework several years ago (I still give almost none) because so few students turned it in that it ended up lowering everyone\u2019s grade. Now, you might say \u201cwell, good\u2026those kids deserve a lower grade\u201d, but there\u2019s a problem with that statement (well, several actually). First is this: why aren\u2019t they doing the homework? Is it laziness? Inability? Homelessness? It could be any one, and there\u2019s not much way to know for sure. Second is this: if too many students fail, you lose the class (and potentially your job). When everyone is failing, why try? The class must be impossible. Third: it\u2019s a logistical nightmare when students are regularly absent. Fourth: students don\u2019t care so much about poor grades. Telling one of my students they might fail does almost nothing - many students have failed very frequently and so don\u2019t care anyway. Fifth: Cheating is not only rampant but viewed as the norm. Everyone cheats on homework, either by using other students\u2019 answers or by using the internet. So homework went the way of the Dodo. But then students don\u2019t get as much practice, as much repetition, or as much mastery. All of this taught me another important lesson: \u201cSchool Quality\u201d is a joke. Look at any city, and you\u2019ll see amazing scores for the affluent suburbs and lousy scores for the poor inner city neighborhoods. But is this a reflection on the job the school is doing or the ability and support systems of the kids coming in? Believe me, it\u2019s the latter. Some of the most amazing teachers I\u2019ve ever met work in really poorly-performing schools. They look like terrible teachers if you judge them by their SAT scores. But judge them by the difference they make to kids, and they are invaluable. It\u2019s just that the measurement of this difference is difficult to say the least. So instead, we say \u201cWow! Look at the SAT scores at Suburban High School #12. They are so high - that school must be doing something right!\u201d They are doing something right - they\u2019re educating the children of affluent, well-educated adults in a low crime, low poverty, low homelessness environment. But chances are their teachers and administrators are no different in quality to any other school. Last thought: What you tolerate, you promote. We hear that one a lot. So just stop tolerating tardiness and it will go away\u2026right? Unfortunately, that only works if everyone stops tolerating tardiness (or whatever it is you want to stop). That means principals, all teachers, and most importantly, parents. It\u2019s nearly impossible to stop a negative behavior when parents take the blame for it. I see it all the time - parents making excuses for their kids when the kids are clearly able to do better. And the result is nearly always the same, too - the behavior increases and the performance goes down. But I still love my job\u2026part of the time. There are days when there\u2019s nothing I\u2019d rather be doing. But there are days when 60% of my students are skipping\u2026and then I want to quit. I know I\u2019m practically wasting a day, and I\u2019ll have to do lots of extra work to help kids who are skipping my class. Both of those things suck your will to do your best. ",
