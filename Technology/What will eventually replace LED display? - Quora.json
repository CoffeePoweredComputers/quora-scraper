            "answer_text": "Somewhere in the turbulent \u201960s of the last century a small group of young excellent engineers of the R&D department of Philips in Holland developed a new revolutionary way to create light. They where challenged by their management to develop the light of the future. This is what they came up with.  The CFL (Compact Fluorescent Lamp) It was a revolutionary new way of lighting that would find its way world wide in a matter of a few years. Over time adjustments and improvements would be made but surely it seemed for a long time that this would be THE way of lighting that would stand time. It was used by everyone in all kinds of applications. From office buildings, schools to shopping centres and hospitals. 30 years later one of these engineers was a teacher at a technical school. Passionate he would explain the deeper theory of this lighting source to students who were listening eager to his amazing stories. One of his students raised his finger to ask a question. When he was allowed to do so he asked. \u201cSir, what will be the successor of CFL lighting\u201d? The man took a deep breath and said. \u201cIt will be a lighting source people can't imagine now\u201d. \u201cBut it will take over the world even more rigorous than the CFL did\u201d. \u201cIt will also be a lighting source that will exist longer than the CFL ever will be\u201d. It was silent in the class room all the attention was focused on the teacher. \u201cThis lighting source will be in essence what is the core of your watches\u201d All the students looked at their wrists and would see something similar to this.  The teacher kept talking. \u201cIt will be a light emitting diode or LED\u201d. The students where full disbelief and most of them didn't take it seriously. Only the student who raised the question would keep thinking about it ever since. He became passionate about light just like his teacher was so many years ago. He would make it a living to be part of this new lighting source. And that student that was me. And I can tell you that LED will not be the final way of making artificial light. But there are still so many improvements to make and challenges to overcome that for now LED is there to stay and I probably won't be able to become old enough to see its successor. ",

            "answer_text": "I think LED display is very hard to be placed rather than continual upgraded version. Technology innnovation is not so easy or coming rather later. If you wanna get a final answer from me, I think VR technology virsual world products will instead of LED Display. My reason is very simple. no matter what a wonderful spectacle which led display can make, VR technology seems to be better, VR technology can be limitless for anything. Maybe one day, you just go shopping by VR products, While VR products will be the biggest mobile shopping mall. You just stay home and enjoy a wonderfull concerts. Of course, it depends up your application totally, OLED and AMOLED or IPS LCD. no matter tradtional materies or upgraded material, they still can create miracle. Technology always change our life, but something can\u2019t be insteaded forever.who knows what happen nextly. ",

            "answer_text": "LED\u2019s were initially invented in 1907. But the first time, they were really used was 1962. I worked for a company that made them in Dallas. I had a tour of their factory in early 1990. I thought they were interesting and asked if they had white ones but they were just red and green and yellow. It took a few years to develop the white ones. I did some work for a chemical company that did chemicals fit the electronics industry. In 2001, I visited their research lab. In the corner of the lobby, there was a OLED television running. It was dusty which indicated that it had been there a while. Years later OLED tv are being intro the market. OLED were invented in 1985 by Kodak. It takes a long time to go from an idea to a research project to an actual product and then the product actually becoming popular. When I did some work for that chemical company, there seemed to be some chemicals that would light up when power was applied. I am sure there are various technologies slowly working their way out of the lab to people\u2019s homes. ",

Fluorescent lamp - Wikipedia Sales of \"fluorescent lumiline lamps\" commenced in 1938 when four different sizes of tubes were put on the market. They were used in fixtures manufactured by three leading corporations, Lightolier, Artcraft Fluorescent Lighting Corporation, and Globe Lighting. The Slimline fluorescent ballast's public introduction in 1946 was by Westinghouse and General Electric and Showcase/Display Case fixtures were introduced by Artcraft Fluorescent Lighting Corporation in 1946. During the following year, GE and Westinghouse publicized the new lights through exhibitions at the New York World\u2019s Fair and the Golden Gate International Exposition in San Francisco. Fluorescent lighting systems spread rapidly during World War II as wartime manufacturing intensified lighting demand. By 1951 more light was produced in the United States by fluorescent lamps than by incandescent lamps. [20] ",

            "answer_text": "My money/hunch is on laser diodes being next in line. Car headlight technology on top of the range models has been a good indication and trend setter for a while now regarding lighting used in agriculture and household stuff. Because the laws for headlights limit the input power to a set number (55w I believe) the only way to getting better and brighter lights is to increase their efficiency and price is not so much of an issue. And there is a lot of hype about high end cars having laser based lights. This technology gets cheaper after a while and starts to be used in other industries. Laser diodes have some interesting benefits compared to conventional led's, for example higher theoretical maximum efficiency and being able to pump more energy per mm2 of surface area. After laser diodes there will be a better technology that replaces it, but it's unlikely we can guess what it is yet. ",

            "answer_text": "The future in the after-LED will be in the field of OLEDs but we have to spend years to have results superior to the current LEDs. Organic Light Emitting Diodes ( OLED ) have a very different technology from LEDs, even if they appear on the market with similar name, and emit better light. Today we are working on them and there are already lamps and lights, but they have a very high cost and are still of low power, so we today suggest to buy LED lamps, but stay open-eyed to see on the market when the lamps made with OLEDs will be in the common trade. Attention, do not confuse the OLED TV with the lamps. They are two completely different products, as are the TV LEDs with OLED lamps ",
