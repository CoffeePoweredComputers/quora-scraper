            "answer_text": "Machine is a thing which reduces human effort and makes work easy to do. It also reduces labour it also increases the efficiency of the work. It also makes the work more accurate. This is the simple definition. And by book the definition of machine is A machine is a tool containing one or more parts that uses energy to perform an intended action. Machines are usually powered by chemical, thermal, or electrical means, and are often motorised. A simple machine is a device that simply transforms the direction or magnitude of a force, but a large number of more complex machines exist. Examples include vehicles, electronic systems, molecular machines, computers, television, and radio. ",
