            "answer_text": "Depends on the DVR, 16 cameras is normal, more isn\u2019t unusual. More modern NVRs (network video recorders) use IP CCTV cameras and can have unlimited connections, they are limited only by bandwidth (typically the HHD interface is the weak point) so if you approach the maximum number of cameras you can decrease the bitrate of the feeds from the cameras to connect up more cameras. However, you can always have the IP CCTV cameras record to a SAN. Even high quality CCTV feeds are seldom more than 4096kbps, you can connect 200,000 CCTV cameras to a SAN over a 1Gbps connection and many SANs have a 10Gbps connection. In answer to your question, as many as you want, it is only limited by the depth of your wallet! ",
