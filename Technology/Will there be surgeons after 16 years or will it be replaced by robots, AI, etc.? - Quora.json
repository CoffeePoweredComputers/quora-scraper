            "answer_text": "Even with significant breakthroughs things take time to implement, if nothing else because humans are a little slow in the uptake. And the current paradigm is in no condition to replace surgeons so I would say in any case 16 years is not enough for a complete revolution. With the current paradigm I would say you will see very little change over 16 years. You will perhaps see AI built to handle a very specific type of surgery that it can do super well. So you might see limited specialist AI surgeons. To take a funny example, foreskin removal :) But say improvised reconstructive trauma surgery is likely vastly too complex for 16 years. And even in the events you see fancy new tools they would not be so good that it would not require human supervision. And if we say I give the world one or more significant breakthroughs more, even then it would take significant time for something complex and consequential to be implemented widely. I think AI will take the form of increasingly fancy tools for people because that full human versatility and virtuosity is still very far away. And without me it might take 50 years for anything significant to change :) I came up with \u201cdeep learning\u201d in late 2002, mentioned a bit about it in 04\u201306, that seemed to trickle into Hinton\u2019s office and in 2012 one of his students had some of the first significant results. And now we are in 2018 and we have some speech recognition and synthesis and it can play some games with a lot of human effort. And classify retinal images. Guys who are paid millions a year struggle to make a car follow clear lines on a road so things don\u2019t move quickly. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes in 16 years there will still be human surgeons. They will not be replaced by robots. They will however be aided by machines a lot more than today. Complete replacement of humans with robots can\u2019t happen with humans still controlling the world. If we are really replaceable it will be the end of us. I don\u2019t see it happening in another hundred years. ",
