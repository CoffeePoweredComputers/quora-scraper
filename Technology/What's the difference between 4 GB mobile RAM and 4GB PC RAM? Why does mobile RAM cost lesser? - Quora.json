            "answer_text": "There are several differences. 1) A PC typically has one or more sockets holding RAM chips soldered onto a pluggable card. This allows easy upgrading and replacement, but does increase the physical size of the system. For mechanical reasons phone RAM is normally soldered directly to the motherboard, or even in a \"package-on-package\" on top of the phone's CPU. 2) DIMM/SODIMM memory modules for a PC are normally 64-bit data width. You will typically have eight separate RAM ICs, each 8 bits wide, connected to separate 8-bit data buses but sharing address and control pins. Extra-large DIMMs can be \"dual rank\" and have chips on both sides for a total of 16; these are structured logically as an 8x2 grid. Each 8-bit chunk of the data bus has two chips on it, one handling the low half and one for the high half. By comparison, a phone typically has a single 16-bit wide RAM IC. 3) A PC's memory is normally a high-performance memory standard such as DDR3, while phone memory is normally power optimized like LPDDR3. Among other things DDR3 runs at 1.5V while LPDDR3 runs at 1.2. Here is the source Andrew Zonenberg's answer to Is there any difference between a phone's RAM and a PC's RAM? ",

            "answer_text": "PC RAM has RAM IC + Controller + PCB + Assembly Cost and its volume is not as much as Mobile RAMs sold so it is costly. Mobile RAM These days Mobile RAM directly get soldered on the Processor and this is called (POP package over package). So no additional cost of PCB space etc. Moreover Mobile Ram is produced in very high quantity so as the quantity increases the price decreases. Speed wise I don\u2019t consider there will be much difference as PC it is DDR3 or DDR4 and mobile its is LPDDR3 or LPDDR4 which is optimised for low power and can work with high frequencies. ",
