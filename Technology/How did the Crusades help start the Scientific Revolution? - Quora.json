            "answer_text": "They didn\u2019t. If anything at all they delayed it. The Arab scientific knowledge was far superior to that of Europe, because the Arabs had adopted and developed Greek science and Indian science, thus they were leading in many scientific fields such as astronomy, medicine, agriculture, architecture, (al-)chemy, as well as mathematics (algebra, algorithm are Arabic words). At the same time Christians were eager to destroy anything that had the touch of being pagan. Had it not been for the Arabian influence in Spain, where the three cultures (Christians, Jews, Muslims) lived relatively peacefully together for a considerable length of time and learning spread from there over other parts of Europe, the Scientific Revolution would have started even later. While Europeans were busy building cathedrals, serious scientific research continued in a number of Muslim cultural centres. Unfortunately, this eventually ended, when Al-Ghazali and his fateful doctrine took over. Al-Ghazali declared numbers to be the work of the devil. From this silly notion the Islamic world has not recovered since. That is the answer in a nutshell, maybe not all the details are 100% spot on, but the general message is there. ",

Some took place in the Old World, mainly the Mid East Some jumped over the Atlantic to colonize the New World and convert the indigenous people there to Christianity. Little, if any, technological breakthrough was significant at that time. ",
