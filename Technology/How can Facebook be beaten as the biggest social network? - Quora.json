If you check the first version of Twitter and the one that exists now you'll realize that it hasn't changed too much. It sure has had a few changes and updates but not a lot. Facebook on the other hand has adapted itself to the changing needs of people, acquired upcoming apps and when they couldn't acquire they copied. So sure there could be a platform that could surpass Facebook but it will have to be phenomenal and remain relevant long enough to get more than a billion users. ",
