            "answer_text": "Stock options are a little different from stock bonuses. I presume you are asking about stock options given as bonuses. The difference is that stock options are an incentive to work to improve the companies stock value since you reap a dollar for each increase of a dollar in stock price for each option share you own. Usually stock bonuses ( I presume a bonus paid with stock) are rare; cash bonuses would be easier. Stock options are given as sign-on bonuses for key employees or for new employees in a startup company as long term incentives. Stock options are a promise that they will hold N number of shares for you that you can purchase at some future time for the price of the stock X at the time the option is issued. This gives you the incentive to make the stock price increase. If at the time the option vests and the stock has risen to Y you can make N*(Y-X) immediately if the company allows it, without any capital outlay. The company will purchase it on your behalf and sell it immediately and give you the proceeds.  Or you can pay Y per share and take possession of the stock certificates to sell at a future time, already having appreciated. You are not required to see when it vests, usually you can carry the option on for some time more so if it continues to rise you can make even more money.  Its like an asset, but of course if the stock drops below Y you would lose money by excercising options, in that case its better to let the options expire and if you want stock, buy it at the current market price. Excercising your options at the right time is a obvious timing thing you have to manage. Very often the options are issued to you when you start employment, with a total of say 5000 shares, 1000 vesting at the end of the first year of employment, 1000 more after 2 years, 1000 more at 3, 1000 at 4 years and the last 1000 at five years. This is to encourage you to stay on since if you leave employment you surrender the non-vested options. As bonuses, you can also be issued more options at any time, with new vesting dates. ",

            "answer_text": "A stock bonus plan is a type of profit-sharing plan paid in employer stock instead of cash. Stock bonus plans are qualified retirement plans, and like most other types of investment accounts, they have advantages and disadvantages. A stock bonus plan is a defined-contribution profit-sharing plan, to which employers contribute company stock. They are subject to the standard rules of retirement plans -- namely, no unqualified withdrawals are allowed before age 59-1/2 without a penalty, and participants must take required minimum distributions beginning at age 70-1/2. Contributions to a stock bonus plan are discretionary, but they must be substantial and recurring. Further, stock bonus plans cannot discriminate toward highly compensated employees, such as executives. Annual contributions to a stock bonus plan are limited to 25% of each employee's total compensation. Participants in a stock bonus plan receive pass-through voting rights for their shares and have the option to sell their shares to the employer, just like they would if they held a put option on the open market.

There are also periods of time during the year that you will not be allowed to trade the stock once that period is over. Those rules are governed by the SEC and are in place to avoid insider trading. Beyond those restrictions, you can typically sell at will however it is usually preferred that you do not do so as a show of faith in the company. ",
