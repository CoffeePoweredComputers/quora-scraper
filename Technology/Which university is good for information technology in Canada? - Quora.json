            "answer_text": "It depends on your career goals mostly, and the rate of graduates who end up employed and able to pay off their debts in their field of choice. Unfortunately, many universities and colleges in Canada are rated not by these factors but on silly, trivial things such as how good the night-life is or how easy it is to \u201cmake friends\u201d. I\u2019m totally serious. Pick up any Dalhousie University brochure and you\u2019ll see mostly promises of great pubs and bars, a huge gymnasium and lots of social interaction - very little, if anything, discussing career opportunities or the actual education involved behind obtaining a degree there. The same could be said for many post-secondary schools in North America, from two-year community colleges to Ivy League schools. I would recommend a place with low residence costs (or the option to live with parents to save money), high graduate success rates and access to up-to-date technology and professors with credentials in your field of interest. You can talk to graduates from IT programs from various universities, contact academic advisors or book a campus tour for more information. Try to inquire specifically about the IT degree itself and future prospects. ",

            "answer_text": "The most notable one, in my opinion, would be the University of Waterloo, in the Waterloo region. It\u2019s at the top or near the top in many reports done ranking universities in the information technology area in Canada. The co-op program, from what I\u2019ve heard, is incredible, the university claims it\u2019s the largest in the world, with the largest number of employers, companies like Facebook and Blackberry actively recruit out of the university. It\u2019s also incredibly competitive in terms of admissions, so be ready for that. A lot of the universities have a made for themselves however. The University of British Columbia is one, the University of Toronto is another, both also provide incredible programs. I know Microsoft operates a co-op program with UBC. McGill, if I recall correctly, is also in the top, just not as near to the top as the ones I listed before. An rising star on the scene is the University of Ontario Institute of Technology (could they not have dropped the University out of the name?). While it\u2019s not really well known, it\u2019s beginning to build a name for itself. I\u2019ve heard a few stories about graduates struggling to find jobs, it\u2019s a really a game of chance, some employers recognise UOIT as reputable, others, not so much. At the end of the day, there are many fantastic universities across the country, so I don\u2019t really think you can go wrong. Best of luck! ",
