            "answer_text": "ITIL (Information Technology Infrastructure Library) is a framework designed to standardize how information technology (IT) services are selected, planned, delivered and supported. ITIL guidelines and best practices are designed to align IT actions and expenses to business requirements. ITIL traces its roots back to the 1980s as data centers began decentralizing. The flexibility this approach provided also led to differences in deployments that created inconsistencies. The United Kingdom's government recognized the importance of applying consistent practices across all IT services and introduced ITIL to help companies ensure predictable service levels. The ITIL framework has five books which are periodically reviewed and updated as technologies change. Each book contains best practices for a major aspect of the IT service lifecycle. ITIL service strategy - specifies that each stage of the service life-cycle must be focused on defined business goals, requirements and service management principles.ITIL service design - provides guidance for the production and maintenance of IT policies, architectures and documents that support IT services.ITIL service transition - focuses on change management and provides guidance for transitioning new and updated services into the business environment.ITIL service operation - focuses on strategies to support service delivery and maintenance.ITIL continual service improvement - focuses on processes for identifying and introducing service management improvements and life-cycle management.The latest version of ITIL was released in July 2011. It clarifies and expands upon many of the processes from the previous 2007 edition, which is often referred to as ITIL v3. Ongoing development for ITIL has been vested in Axelos, a joint-venture company created by the U.K. Cabinet Office and Capita PLC.  When you build DevOps on top of ITIL, there's control, but it moves the ball forward with bite-sized units of work. ",
