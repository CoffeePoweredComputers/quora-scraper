            "answer_text": "I cannot answer your question. This is because of what you do not say. What do you WANT to do?  If you do not know the answer to that, neither do I.  If you DO know what you want to do, then DO IT.  That's my advice. If you don't know what you want to do, then get treatment for your depression with a professional.  You're at university, there must be counselors on staff there.  You are in India, right?  This problem has to be one of the most common problems at university.  I hope the counselors there have something useful to say.  Maybe they don't, but at least try talking to one or two, and see if they do. You chose to do what your parents wanted. Either make the best of it, or decide to do something else.  One or the other.  Figure out how to improve your grades, or make a plan for how to have a career in music.  And if you say you aren't good enough at music to have a career in it, well, then, what are we talking about? ",
