            "answer_text": "YES. Motorola still manufactures mobile phone and they have changed their brand name to short as \u201cMOTO\u201d. Some of upcoming devices from Motorola.   Motorola is called \u201cMoto brand\u201d from last two years. Motorola will never stop manufacturing mobile phones until either their parent company sell motorola or motorola stop running their company. Now why Motorola will always make mobile devices until it dies. Because most of motorola company have patents for mobile designs and applications. Second things is that motorola is not separate company anymore. It is now running under Lenovo and Lenovo also manufactures mobile phones worldwide. Second thing that matters is most of Motorola fan base only accept motorola as mobile company and Motorola can\u2019t run other separate business without huge investment and freedom from their parent company.
