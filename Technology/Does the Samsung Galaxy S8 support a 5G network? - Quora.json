            "answer_text": "Assuming you are refering to 5g cellular network and not 5ghz wifi network: No. A 5G network uses completley different frequencies than 4g/3g/2g/1g did and thus requires a radio to be able to receive the signal. Since the data protocal used is also different then it also requires a different modem. The only caveat to this is AT&T\u2019s \u201c5G\u201d network. This will connect just fine because that label is a flat out lie. This is not a 5G network, it is just the most recent spec of 4G network with improved speeds, and AT&T is decietfully calling it \u201c5G\u201d. They pulled the same crap calling their 3G HSPA+ network \u201c4G\u201d when 4G was starting to be relesed. ",

            "answer_text": "Absolutely not.. 5G will need the technology built inside as well.. the Galaxy S8 will only do 4G LTE.. Samsung released the Galaxy S10 4G LTE version first and released the 5G version afterwards. Honestly, there's no need for 5G as 4G LTE is already fast. It's only good if you have an unlimited data plan.. otherwise you will quickly burn through your data plan. I believe 5G is good for business people or important things like the hospital but for regular everyday people, it's just another way to get you to pay more for data. So no, you cannot simply receive a software update and get 5G, it doesn't work that way.. you need the 5G hardware inside the phone and the Galaxy S8 does not have it inside the phone. ",
