            "answer_text": "I used tweezers and a pair of small scissors to pry the plastic apart and get out the razors. You might have to bend apart the plastic with your hands as well which is what I had to do as the plastic encasing the razor was tough and needed a lot of effort and strength to get apart. Please talk to a counselor or therapist about your urges to self harm when you feel you can open up about it so you can get better.:) ",

Note: this method works for disposable razors and razors with removable heads.light a candle.hold the head of the razor(where the blades are) over the flame for just a few moments to soften the plastic. Don\u2019t do it too long as the plastic could melt completely and coat the blades.Take a pair of needlenose pliers and pull out the blades.If you are thinking about harming yourself, please get help.
