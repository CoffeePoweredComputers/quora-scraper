            "answer_text": "Yes and no. Yes because you need a Smartphone to use the Alexa app to register and configure the device initially. No because people who do not own Smart Phones can still register their devices by going to these websites: https://alexa.amazon.com or https://echo.Amazon.com . You can sign into your Amazon account and add devices. Now using this method excludes you from using some of the features that the app has. Additionally, if you want to use calling and messaging and conferencing features yes you will need the Alexa app installed on a Smartphone. EDIT 6/4/2020: I forgot about this post. So I will update my answer to include a workaround. NOTE: I personally have not used this method. I am just passing the info along. For those of you that do not own a Smartphone nor a Tablet. Therefore you are unable to install the Alexa App and you want to be able to make phone calls and use the Video Conferencing feature. Try using a Google Voice Account. You get a phone number assigned to you (for free) or you can port an existing number (for a fee) and you can add contacts for use in the account too. Then use the web version of the app to complete setup. ",
