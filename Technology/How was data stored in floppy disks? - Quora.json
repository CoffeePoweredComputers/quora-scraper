            "answer_text": "A spindle motor in the drive rotates the magnetic medium at a certain speed, while a stepper motor-operated mechanism moves the magnetic read/write head(s) radially along the surface of the disk. Both read and write operations require the media to be rotating and the head to contact the disk media, an action originally accomplished by a disk-load solenoid. Later drives held the heads out of contact until a front-panel lever was rotated (5\u00bc\") or disk insertion was complete (3\u00bd\"). To write data, current is sent through a coil in the head as the media rotates. The head's magnetic field aligns the magnetization of the particles directly below the head on the media. When the current is reversed the magnetization aligns in the opposite direction, encoding one bit of data. To read data, the magnetization of the particles in the media induce a tiny voltage in the head coil as they pass under it. This small signal is amplified and sent to the floppy disk controller, which converts the streams of pulses from the media into data, checks it for errors, and sends it to the host computer system.

            "answer_text": "Actually, very much the exact same way it is stored on hard disks. It\u2019s still a spinning platter with magnetic coated material. Heads moving crosswise over the platter and the platter itself spinning around so the head can reach each and every spot on it. The only \u201creal\u201d difference between HDD and floppy is the substrate below that magnetic coating. In a HDD this tends to be some metal, like steel, aluminium, etc. While in a floppy it\u2019s some form of plastic. ",
