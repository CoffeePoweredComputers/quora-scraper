            "answer_text": "You should first ask yourself, \u201cwhy am I looking for a condenser microphone?\u201d What you are looking for is a microphone. There are other species of microphones other than those called condenser microphones. So, what you be doing with this microphone? What do you intend to plug it in to? Many people think that the word \u201ccondenser\u201d somehow represents quality or goodness or some such horseshit. They are wrong. Oh, and after reading your profile, I am downvoting this shitty question and muting you. I strongly recommend that everybody that reads this do the same. ",

            "answer_text": "The most frequent tests of studio microphones utilize vocals as a test signal, however, do not hesitate to use more complex sound sources like guitar, piano, and wind or percussion instruments to spice up your evaluation. Most microphones have a decent on-axis response, and you are only able to evaluate the actual quality of a microphone if you also test its off-axis qualities. Musical instruments are extremely qualified sound sources for testing both the on- and off-axis qualities of microphones simultaneously, but you can also get a good idea of the microphone's performance when using speech or singing using the following procedure. Make sure the headphone feed is from one microphone only, as it could otherwise influence the vocalist's performance. ",
