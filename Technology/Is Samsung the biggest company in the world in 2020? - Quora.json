            "answer_text": "Samsung is ruling the mobile market all over the world. Presently it is the leading smartphone company globally. In Q2 2017, the Samsung market share was 22%. Clearly, Samsung is the leader in terms of its sales, performance, and market share but in 2017 there was not much growth in the sales of Samsung. Galaxy S8 and S8+ did good but the sales of mid-range J and A series of Samsung phones declined which is a point to ponder for the company. ",
