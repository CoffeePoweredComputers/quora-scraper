            "answer_text": "Yes, your assumption is correct. The air filter intake box on this truck sits approximately 5 feet off the ground.  Something else to consider; a diesel engine works on compression, and as such doesn't have an electrical ignition system that would get wet and potentially stall out the vehicle. ",

            "answer_text": "I don\u2019t think that was their intention, but it\u2019s a nice side effect. This is a truck engine. If you were standing next to it, the top of the engine is about the height of your head.  That big chrome thing that looks like a garbage can is the air filter, and the screen around the top of it is the air intake. On a \u201cshort-nose\u201d truck like most of the ones on the road these days, the air filter is bolted to the firewall above the engine. It\u2019s not that high to give the truck great stream-fording ability (in fact, fording a truck isn\u2019t recommended; not only are the batteries and a lot of your truck\u2019s electronics are down there, but the cast-iron brake drums can be damaged by being suddenly cooled in water) but because that\u2019s the most convenient place to put it.
