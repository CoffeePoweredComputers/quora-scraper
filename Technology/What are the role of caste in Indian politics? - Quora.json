            "answer_text": "In India, it is significantly observed that, \u201cpeople do not cast their vote, they vote their caste\u201d. It implies that in a country as vast and diverse as India, caste plays a vital role in mechanism of the politics. Politics is all about exercising power and representing voter\u2019s interests. Therefore, politicians in India engage in appeasement of voters and masses by dividing them on caste lines in order to expand their vote bank to maximum. Castes in Indian society implies to a social group where social status or membership is decided by birth. The relationship between caste and politics has been observed at two levels: one, how caste is affecting politics and, how politics affects caste. Broadly speaking, caste and democracy differ from each other and can\u2019t co-exist since caste is a synonym of fragmentation of the society whereas, democracy promotes unification of society. Caste is ruled with idea of inequality by birth, but democracy is pillared on the principles of equality. Caste and caste-ism in politics is immensely deep rooted in the society and politics India, alike no other country in the world. The caste system, which has been significantly prevailing since the ancient times, is so complexly rigid and widespread that it is very difficult to eradicate it fully. Although, some progress is made due to urbanization and modernization, but India is not successful in eradicating it completely. Discrimination on basis of caste is hardly observant in major cities now, but still it somewhat prevails in rural areas of villages and small towns. Political parties take negative liberty of the fact that people from one caste vote for their caste. That\u2019s the main reason why candidates are often chosen based on their caste and not merit. It is clearly visible during an election, that if one specific place extensively comprises of people from one particular caste, almost all political parties will take candidates from that caste. This in turn does more injustice to candidates who are more qualified and have better caliber than the former. One merit of caste politics is that people from the so-called lower caste or oppressed caste now have a voice, an opinion at the policy level. They have representatives to raise their voices in the main stream politics, about their struggles and problems. Since these people and their votes are crucial for the political parties, the voices are often tangible enough to bring new provisions. Caste and politics also have an indirect effect. Politics also affects caste in our country. One significant change in practice in political trends is that many insignificant castes and small castes join hands for political reasons. They have a grim realization that they are more in number and can form alliances if they fight election together. There is also a further exclusion happening simultaneously with political powers enjoyed by the different caste groups. There are often tags attached such as backward caste groups or forward class groups. It is because of electoral politics, campaigns and the mass media which keep caste alive. While creation of the nation for citizens and deciding citizenship rights caste was kept alive. Outside of politics many changes, gradually, have transformed caste practices and caste consciousness in arenas such as inter-dining, inter-caste marriages and caste-based occupations. Although, Politics has no connection with caste, a mechanism has been introduced into the system to repeat the concept of 'Divide and rule'. Excess greed is the key reason for the linking among both the terms. Many link caste and politics for personal benefits. For instance, if violence is happening media tends to highlight the religion or caste of a person, rather than facts. To an extend untouchability has been abolished, but still there is a need to eradicate caste system completely and the material base of the system that sustained untouchability, now laying newer forms of discrimination and violence.

This means that in a country as vast and diverse as India, caste plays a vital role in determining the politics. Politics is all about being in power. So, politicians in India engage in appeasement of masses by dividing them on caste lines in order to garner more and more vote bank. Louis Dumont has given sociological understanding of caste by differentiating between jati in India and class in western countries. Jati is Indian system of social stratification based on the concept of purity and pollution while class is a western system of social stratification based on economic criteria.Jati is based on birth while class is based on worth.Jati is rigid, mobility is not permitted. On the other hand, class is open and permits social mobility.HISTORY OF CASTE AND POLITICS IN INDIA ANCIENT INDIA- Since ancient times, India was divided on the lines of caste. The varna system divided the society into 4 classes - Brahmins or priestly class.Kshatriyas or warrior class.Vaishyas or business class.Shudras or working class.BRITISH ERA- Britishers colonised India with the sole motive of self-profit and empowerment. In order to remain in power, they used caste and religion as a part of their Divide and Rule policy in order to disrupt the unity and integrity of the nation because a united India could have proved detrimental to the hegemony of British. POST INDEPENDENCE- Though leaders like Jawaharlal Nehru considered casteism and communalism as a threat to national unity, Indian Constitution does not abolish caste, it only abolishes untouchability. With the introduction of Mandal Commission recommendations, caste politics has become more pronounced. From the 1990s, Mandal and Kamandal became the idioms of Indian politics. Majority of the political parties associate themselves with a particular caste like the Samajwadi Party (party of OBCs), Bahujan Samajwadi Party (party of Dalits, preferably Jatavs). This is done for political appeasement and vote bank politics. IMPACT OF CASTE IN POLITICS Caste in politics can have both pros and cons- Issues like development, employment, GDP etc. should play a more important role for the citizens to cast their vote rather than voting politicians on the lines of caste.The lowest strata of society i.e. SCs and STs have faced historical injustice since time memorial. The reservation system will lead to development, competency, unity and equality of this class.Caste in politics has led to the social engineering of the backward class. With their entry in the political sphere, their voices were being heard in the Parliament which led to the social and economic empowerment. Political empowerment is vital factor for the upliftment of the backward caste. Progress has taken place in this sphere as can be seen with the election of Mayawati (backward caste) as the Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh.Recent Lok Sabha elections (2019) has shown that the role of caste in Indian politics is on a declining trend. Had the votes been casted on the lines of caste, the NDA led BJP government would not have won 303 out of 542 seats. This may be attributed to the fact that the citizens have become more conscious and politically literate to give more weightage to the issues like development and employment generation rather than caste ",
