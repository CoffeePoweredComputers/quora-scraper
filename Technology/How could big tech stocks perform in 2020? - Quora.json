Assuming you want to know what I think will in fact happen\u2026I\u2019m very bullish re: 2020 stock market performance in general. But careful, the year is likely to start with a 2\u20134 week sideways/down market (a minor 4 wave), then after a minor 5 up to new all time highs, a larger intermediate 4, then after an intermediate 5 up to new highs\u2026a PRIMARY 4 back down, then a primary 5 back up again (though somewhere along the line the calendar will swing into 2021). So larger and large moves up, and corrections back down is what I expect. But overall\u2026all indications I\u2019m aware of scream \u201cbull market\u201d. ",

Apple, microsoft, google\u2026 That's bad news when you consider these five tech companies are collectively worth nearly $6 trillion -- about 25% of the S&P 500's overall value. It means just a handful of stocks can sway the broader market, and all the passive index funds that many investors own. ",
