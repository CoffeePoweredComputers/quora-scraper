            "answer_text": "Biden? I don\u2019t know ANYONE in their right mind who would compare Joe Biden with Ronald Reagan. Reagan was a deeply conservative president \u2014 and a very popular one at that. He was popular in every state. In fact, he won 49 states in the 1984 presidential election. This was just four years after he won 47 states in the 1980 presidential election. I live in the San Francisco Bay Area \u2014 arguably the most liberal area in the country (outside of Washington D.C.). Over this election cycle, I have only seen THREE yard signs for Joe Biden and just one Biden bumper sticker. Four years ago, there were Hillary Clinton signs and bumper stickers everywhere. In fact, I climbed Half Dome (the mountain in Yosemite National Park) in early September. On the drive between the Bay Area and Yosemite, I saw many more Trump yard signs, flags and bumper stickers than I\u2019ve seen for Biden anywhere around the Bay Area. That\u2019s not to say that President Trump would win any district or county in the Bay Area. This place is increasingly liberal and very different from most areas of the country. However, the interesting thing is that Ronald Reagan \u2014 despite being exceptionally conservative \u2014 won the state of California (and many otherwise liberal districts). In fact, I saw a photo of my town (Palo Alto) from 1984. There are Reagan signs everywhere. This was despite the fact that media pundits (including those in the press, magazines, network news and those on CNN) lambasted President Reagan excessively. Media outlets dismissed President Reagan as unintelligent. They questioned his experience (he was an actor who only served two terms as a governor). They thought that his conservative policies were \u201con the wrong side of history\u201d (a phrase that was actually first recorded during his presidency). Many Democrats and some media pundits questioned his health and vitality. They mocked his wife as being \u201call glamour and no brains.\u201d They said that he was merely an actor and celebrity \u2014 one who tried to act like a \u201ccowboy.\u201d They said that he was too \u201chawkish\u201d with foreign governments. They claimed that he didn\u2019t care about the poor or minorities. They criticized him for not being on the side of LGBT groups. The media blamed him for environmental issues. Even some pundits alleged that he was a racist. Is Biden like Reagan? No. Not at all. In fact, Biden was one of the people who constantly criticized President Reagan. He publicly said that Reagan was \u201cbad\u201d for America. It didn\u2019t matter. The people \u2014 a silent majority \u2014 went to the polls. Even when the media said that the election actually favored Jimmy Carter, Reagan won in a landslide. Four years later, those same pundits said that the election would be close. Reagan won 49 out of 50 states (and only lost the state of Minnesota \u2014 the home state of his opponent, former Vice President Walter Mondale \u2014 by a couple thousand votes). Joe Biden is no Ronald Reagan. In 2005, a television network wanted to discover who Americans thought was \u201cthe greatest American.\u201d After a series of nationwide submissions, surveys and polls, the finalists included George Washington, Abraham Lincoln, Thomas Jefferson, Martin Luther King Jr. and Ronald Reagan. The winner? Reagan won in a landslide. Critics dismissed that contest. Yet, in 2011, Gallup ran a scientific poll about who was the \u201cgreatest U.S. president.\u201d The winner? Ronald Reagan. In that poll, Democrats did not even have Reagan in their top ten. Yet, Republicans and independents ranked President Reagan #1 and #2 respectively (independents placed Lincoln just ahead of Reagan). Americans Say Reagan Is the Greatest U.S. President In his wildest dreams, Biden couldn\u2019t come close to the popularity of President Reagan. ",

            "answer_text": "I don\u2019t see that comparison at all. Reagan could charm the mass of people. This was especially effective with the large population of uneducated and simple minded Americans who were/are susceptible to an emotional appeal expertly delivered by an actor. Reagan was a creation of corporate America who\u2019s general program was to dismantle the social and economic safety net established in FDR\u2019s New Deal policies and programs. The working class of Americans loved him, though, even as he effectively tilted the playing field in the direction of the wealthy and an unabashed bias for a \u201ctrickle down\u201d world view. He also never saw a new weapons system he didn\u2019t love. He has an American Era named after him for good reason. Joe Biden, on the other hand has never been a strong communicator aside from a couple of notable occasions when he publicly and conspicuously shared his tragic family experience as a young parent. He has a puffed up \u201cMan of Great Resolve\u201d public persona and speaking style that most people can see through as an act. He has no notable program other than, as a Corporate Democrat and bi-partisan War Party member, pay lip service and throw crumbs in the direction of working Americans while maintaining the general advantages that enrich the already enriched, and at the same time pursuing American hegemony and regime change policies that will bring us more wars. I think that he will eventually be brought down when the facts and appearances of his Ukraine dealings are brought to light. There will be no American Era named after Joe Biden\u2026 ",
