            "answer_text": "I don\u2019t believe any on line program would prepare you to be an interior designer. Most states have laws. \u2018Title act\u2019 which specifies the kind and amount of training PLUS years of work under a licensed Interior Designer is required to promote yourself as an Interior Designer. I would start by looking up the requirements in your state. Go to an accredited interior design program in your state. Do the 4\u20135 years learning not only taste, trends, etc but drafting materials computer programs like AUTOCAD, Rivit, sketchUp, maybe 2020 and otherprograms that broaden your skills. Take business, sales and marketing classes. You sell yourself every time you meet a perspective client. Join associations like ASID and network in other like associations. Take all the NCIDQ prep classes and pass the test. Continue in all the classes to receive ongoing education which is required year after year. Learn all the codes and statutes that apply to the kind of work you are doing. Know how all the materials you specify are properly installed as you will be the one holding the bag if it is not done correctly. Cultivate contacts In all trades, as well as reps for the types of materials you most often specify. Watch how long each phase of a project takes as you\u2019ll be responsible for schedules. You are the one point of contact for your clients and you set expectations in budget, materials and installation. Oh, and in the midst of all this you are cultivating new business, billing and often approving contractor payouts collecting from clients, preparing contracts and as I stated previously, no on line courses can prepare you well enough to get you in the door of a professional Interior Design firm.
