            "answer_text": "The best use of a gadget is when you use it for its primary purpose, and you maximize its usefulness. For instance, when you have an iPhone, you are expected to use it to communicate with others, be it thru voice calls or SMS. You may also exploit the fact that it can connect you to the internet, and so you use your iPhone to browse the web, check email, and watch videos. Then you discover that you can install software into your iPhone, and so you download various apps that will help you with life, such as a dictionary, an encyclopedia browser, social media platforms that will help you learn about, and communicate, with a wide variety of people, and so on. It is like you own an electronic Swiss-army knife, and you make use of as many of its tools as possible. ",
