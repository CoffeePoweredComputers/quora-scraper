            "answer_text": "I guess you mean to ask what's the approach to design a market research. Identify the problem: what is the purpose? Why is the research being done, i.e. what are the set of questions to be answered? How will the findings be used? The first step is to have the answer to all these questions. The research ought to be addressing an information gap, therefore a problem that needs to be identified and defined.Primary or secondary: while it's always smart to recycle rather than reinventing, relevance may require hearing from the market. However both require resources, time and money being the common ones. If there is a research published already on the demand demographics, behaviour, and preferences that help shed light on voice of the user, then obtain it; else find out via interviews and discussions.Scope: the route to the solution for the research problems needs to be well-defined, else one gets stuck in a limbo. There is so much information digitized out there that one can be in a limbo, excavating endlessly and aimlessly after a point. So market, topic, geographies, segments of product and customers, etc are best defined to set a perimeter for the research to be containedResources: how many people are available to run the research? What are their skill sets? Has the project manager picked complementary skills? Who is responsible and accountable? How much material is available? Where can be obtained from to develop analyses? How much money is available to obtain this information? Finally, how much time is at disposal for this research? Actually this should be point #2 as it would lead to drawing scope and determining the research.Packaging: the information gathering, processing, and analyses needs to be synthesied and structured in an eloquently articulated report. The report needs to be engaging by use of smart visual imagery. The messaging needs to communicate the 'so-what' so that the audience finds it worthwhile their time to read the findings and use it.Hope this helps! ",

            "answer_text": "Effectiveness can be found in the ways to do the research and the ay how you will use the knowledge you gain. Before doing the research you should know what you\u2019re looking for as well as to know how to use the data you\u2019ll gather for the best possible benefits. Here are some tips for effective market research: Identify the information you need - Understanding market trends is important if your business is to make the most of its opportunities and remain competitive. You also need to understand your competitors and be aware of what they are doing in order to predict their next moves and exploit any weaknesses.Use field research - Popular methods of field research include surveys, interviews and direct observation. The way that you conduct your field research will have a significant impact on the quality of the results - ask the right questions, talk to the right people, talk to enough people and keep research impartial.Interpret the information - Be careful how you interpret readily available market information. External data might not be in a format that's easy to use - it may have been collected for other purposes or be from a range that doesn't tally with your target market. Also, beware of out-of-date market information.Consider using a market research agency - If you don't have the time or skills to carry out research yourself, and if the budget is available, you could consider using a market research agency. Always provide the agency with a thorough and clear brief. You should include the project\u2019s business objectives, what the research should uncover, and details on how you will use the results.Use web scraping services. Web scraping can give you a great advantage while working with big-scale market research and when you need a lot of data from various websites which you could be able to gather fast and be sure that this will be all the data you requested.
