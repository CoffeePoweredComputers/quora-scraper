            "answer_text": "Killed is a bit strong of a word but the nature of the hobby is evolving. As some one else pointed out, the number of licenses issued has actually increased. However, what does not seem to be around in the hobby as much is what I call the magic of radio. Being able to hear my own call sign being sent to me from another person from the other side of the globe used to seem like magic. Now all we have to do to talk to anyplace in the world is dial them up or use a messenger app on our phone. In some sort of an emergency where internet access is lost or a cell phone tower is taken down it is still good to have ham radios for communications. Computer to computer communications is something many in the ham radio hobby are working on now which would also be useful in an emergency. ",
