            "answer_text": "There are lots of things I should know more about. Caring for my health. World affairs. Rap and Beethoven. Chess openings. What\u2019s under the hood of my car. But there are only so many hours in the day so the heck with it. I do what I can with the time I have. All businesses should know more about technology. They should all be using it more. They should all be connecting with their customers who are almost all online and have an endless thirst for easier ways to do business. The big boys are integrating technology with their markets to create customers and to lower operating costs and a thousand other things. They are closing the door on less technically connected firms. To my mind technology is a competitive imperative. It used to be a firm needed a couple of technical specialists looking out for their interests - the banker, lawyer, accountant, and insurance agent. Now they need to add a software guy, a network lady, a social media type, a web developer, data analytics\u2026. you know the changes. To employ tech, they need to think about their business model, their logistics, their marketing, their connection to their customers- everything. But tech is a big deal that has nothing to do with their core mission. Like me and Rap, it just isn\u2019t the priority. You\u2019d think there\u2019d be an opportunity in this situation. ",

            "answer_text": "I would say many do not simply understand the importance of a strong CRM tool, a good website, and analytics that tell you how things are. Small business have to fight every day to be seen, to be known and to be heard. They need differentiators and some think by putting an ad, or working with an agency that it is enough. You need to realize that millions like you are out there, and being able to be seen in that first local phone search, in that particular topic, and in that recommendation that it will keep new people coming in the door. Many think these technologies are expensive, but they are not. What is expensive is to find the right people that can set these things up for you, explain them and deliver the results you need at the price you can afford. Of course, that\u2019s my opinion, I could be wrong\u2026 ",
