            "answer_text": "No. It is not guaranteed that any given device can be hacked, if only you are a good enough hacker and have enough time. I can put a device on the internet which only responds to pings, and I'm fairly certain you won't be able to hack it - people have been trying to attack TCP stacks for decades, and while there was a notorious hole some years ago, it's long fixed. But the more services you add, the more chance there is of a bug. A static webserver using thoroughly tested software such as Apache - pretty secure. Add active content, database lookups, or a human in the loop who will open email attachments, it's starting to get more likely it can be hacked. A big system with millions of users, it's almost guaranteed that someone's password is \"12345\". The routers that switch backbone internet traffic are arguably connected to the internet, but are very secure. That's because though they route public traffic, they don't accept commands from the public internet. A deaf person won't fall for a phone scam because they can't hear what you are saying, no matter how persuasive you are. ",

            "answer_text": "No, but that device would be useless. In order to make a device useful you have to install software, to do so you have to sacrifise security. For example recently there was a vulnerability with word (from Microsoft office). Every device that had a not-updated version of word was vulnerable to this exlpoit .A laptop or a phone, yes it is possible 100% but it can be a lot harder if:1) The victim is careful and does not download files from unknown sources 2) All the software is 100% updated to the latest version (especially firewalls / antivriouses) 3) The OS version is new. For example, Windows XP is vulnerable to remote access, which means it could be hacked just by the hacker knowing the IP address (no matter how careful the victim was). Microsoft claims their new operating systems (7, 8, 8.1, 10) are not valnurable to remote access but it is only matter of time until a new vulnerabilty is found. ",

            "answer_text": "Effectively yes, you should assume that. History suggests that while we might not know of an exploit in a system right now, we will eventually find one. So, sooner or later, anything that is connected will be subject to attack and compromise. Thus, if you really, really, really want to keep something secure, like the launch controls for your nukes, you do NOT connect them to the Internet.   ",

They can hack it in mins *ANDROID If ur using an android phone with android version below 6 (marshmallow) it would be 50% percent easier to hackAnd ur android device is ROOTED with running below 6 (marshmallow) it will be 90% easier to get hackedGoodness is that, if ur running above 7(nought) like (8) OREO or (9) PIE or higher it will be somewhat difficult to hack:)",
