            "answer_text": "If \u201cfriendly\u201d Artificially Intelligent agents with human level intelligence are deployed in society, the following would occur : A. Positive consequences: Increase in productivityIncrease in quality of lifeMore efficient inter-human transactions by fixing trust deficitRemoval of the need to do menial ,stressful or repetitive jobs.Better public-policy implementation, civil administration, democracy. Using AI to run societies and countries would bring in significant transparency in administration ; and therefore expose the prevalent hypocrisy of governments and politiciansReduction in crime, more social conformityBetter international integration (since AI agents can impart language skills on demand, translate on demand ,enable familiarity with other cultures by showcasing experiences)B. Negative consequences: Job losses both in less skilled and highly skilled jobsIf AI deployment happens under the wrong economic policies, there will be a short-term rise in social inequality and a fall in social mobilityImpact on predominantly gender based roles ie., the deployment of robots in a field where one gender is predominantly represented would disproportionately affect people of that gender.[eg: replacing all human nurses with nurse-bots would impact women more than men]Possibility of lack of motivation in humans, the risk that more humans will spending time on entertainment and self gratification without a sense of purpose, without participating effectively in societyPossible misuse of AI by state actors to enforce a distorted set of policies over a political territory , holding society hostage to 21st century values and preventing justified dissentIf there is any attempt by governments to mitigate AI impact on humans by enforcing a population policy on society,it might result in gender imbalance and social turmoil.In my personal opinion, rapid deployment of AI agents should be avoided - A more gradual deployment would give humanity time to get used to \u201cfriendly\u201d AI. A gradual pace of AI deployment , over a period of three generations, would provide a sufficient adjustment period and would help society to absorb the shock of job losses and devise compensation policies / population policies. For those displaced from jobs due to robot deployment, short term/medium term compensation would be necessary. A fund could be setup for job-displaced humans and the some conditions set for compensation. For example, a condition for compensation could that the humans seeking compensation should get trained on how to create, manage,control and supervise AI systems. In cases where huge job losses happen rapidly, corresponding deployments of AI-agents could be heavily taxed to reduce the pace of AI deployment. AI agents capable of some luxury workflows could be taxed more than life-essential workflows : (eg: entertainment related AI agents could be taxed more than healthcare AI agents) Related: Kesavan A's post in Safeguards in Artificial Intelligence ",

            "answer_text": "I think a \"friendly\" AI could have a very positive benefit for society as a whole and for individuals. First of all, I am going to restrict my answer to a human level artificial general intelligence (AGI) that understands human language.  I think this is a very possible relatively near term goal that is within reach using holistic AI methodologies. Many of the other answers to this question display a common misconception about human level AGI - they assume that an AGI would automatically be conscious. I don't believe that AGI implies consciousness. Let me explain why: For an AGI to really understand language I believe it needs to essentially have a full symbolic representation of the world and of humans in that world. With that background information all the ambiguities that current language \"translation\" software run into are easily resolved - which of the two ambiguous possible meanings of a sentence, in it's present context, are more compatible with the current symbolically represented model of the world? The more compatible one is the correct meaning of the sentence.   But I don't think this AGI needs to be conscious. To be conscious, I believe that in addition to the model of the world and of humans in that world, it needs to have a rich, detailed and complete model of itself in that world.  This has to be a requirement for the AGI to have consciousness since otherwise it would not even know of it's own existence as an entity. So if we can prevent the AGI from making this kind of model of itself in the world, we can prevent consciousness.  One way of doing that would be to restrict it's input and output.  If, for example, it's input is the contents of the web, plus a microphone where a user can input questions and it's output is a display where the results of the search are displayed, then the AGI will never be able to make a complete and detailed model of itself interacting with the world and will not be conscious. A non-conscious AGI is automatically a safe AGI, and yet it would be a very helpful AGI to have around. The benefits of an AGI that correctly and humanly understands language would be tremendous.  It could, for example, become a search engine that would beat Goggle hands down. It could become a true personally assistant infinitely more useful than Siri. It could assist in research and would have a perfect memory.   But it would not mean an end to work anymore than the invention of electricity or automation ended work.  It would not even necessarily result in household robots - that is more of a hardware problem/perception/control problem than a language understanding problem. ",
