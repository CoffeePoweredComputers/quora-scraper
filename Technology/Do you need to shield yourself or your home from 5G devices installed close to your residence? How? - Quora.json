            "answer_text": "No. 5G will use higher frequencies than cellular, and as frequency goes up, so does loss, or attenuation. Said another way, as the frequency goes up, the less power can get through walls, glass, etc. Radio stations are up to 50,000 watts, and there are dozens of those in a city. Broadcast TV can be 100,000 watts (even higher for stations that were \u201cgrandfathered\u201d when rules chnaged. AM radio, the lowest frequencies of all, can be 50,000 watts, and at say AM 1000, the frequency is more than 800 times lower than original cell frequencies, 2000 times lowere than the second batch of cell frequencies, and the power transmitted is a fraction of what AM stations pit out. AM stations work better inside, in the basement,etc because ofvthis, than FM stations, which are around 100 time the frequency of AM, and half the allowed power. You are surrounded by RF. Visible light has higher frequencies, by a lot than any RF. Ultraviolet light is higher still, and long wave uV cause sunburn, and in combination with short (higher frequency) ultraviolet, cause sunburn and melanoma. X rays and gamma rays are higher still. The only difference between what a light bulb puts out, light, and what a radio or cell rower puts out is the frequency of the waves. And light is higher.  The green blob I grew is down around cellular. To the left of that you see radio. TV is between the two. You see visible light way to the right of the green blob . Further to the right still, higher infrequency and therefore shorter in wavelength (the two are inversely proportional. Double frequency halff The wavelength) you see I\u2019ve drawn a red bar unde uV, which is where the wavelength starts to get short enough to effect the human body. Keep going right, we know about the danger of X-rays, and all the way right, are gamma rays, which are lethal, but so high in frequency the atmosphere is enough to get rid of nearly all of them before you get to the earth\u2019s surface. Plain old air at that frequency is enough to attenuate them. If 5G worries you, stay inside, blacken your windows, no lights, because I bet there is a 100 watts of a frequency much higher than 5 G within 15 feet of you. ",

            "answer_text": "I can reassure that it wont hurt be protected from 5G same as from other human made artificial EMF's what are way more the limit our bodies can deal with without messing up nervous system and many biological processes. Just think about this, on what voltage our nervous system works and what greater powers are blasted by all this wireless devices around us. I have the practical knowledge of dealing with 5G because of my work connections. I've used this new powder paint what I get from the UK: 5G Protective Shielding Paint EMF TURTAL - EMF Clothing Ltd And it is fantastic! But keep in mind that best to ground it (it's easy with the copper tape!) as any proper 5G shielding installation. Also you can use any LBK100 wall covering instead of paint, just make sure it is really from an official Leblok distributor, not a copy. In both cases you may need to put the EMF absorbant wallpaper on top to stop any reflection (Leblok Absorb wallpaper). Hope that\u2019s answers on your question. Let me know if something not clear. Stay well. ",

            "answer_text": "The short millimetre waves that are used in the 5G network ranges from 24GHz up to 300GHz. These waves can not travel well through walls, trees or water. This provides a great shielding benefit for someone trying to protect themselves from the harmful EMF waves. For the 5G network that utilizes the frequencies of up to 6GHz, RF shielding fabric based on Stainless Steel, Copper or Silver threads will provide adequate protection. Make sure that the attenuation of the fabric is more than 25db, and you purchase it from a reliable source. ",
