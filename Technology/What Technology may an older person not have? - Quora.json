            "answer_text": "I can only speak for myself. Technology information and equipment are missing here. It\u2019s difficult when the world \u201crequires\u201d you to communicate via waves yet doesn\u2019t provide the money to do so. Theirs are silly demands. Years ago I was able to put up 5 websites and 4 were removed because of Yahoo and Bravanet changes. I still have one but can\u2019t update it. I was in messenger and that went away, and all the work I did on Yahoo profile pages with regard to where to find jobs went away too. It was fun being able to talk with some people overseas for a few years. When u-tube came into being none of my computers were able to see that, then one of my computers could no longer reach the internet because of Microsoft\u2019s change in programs. There have been so many changes by the makers of computers, laptops and desktops that they are about to knock out the poor and seniors. Just trying to solve a problem thru calling support is like talking to the wall and always has been. Techs expect that everyone has a cellphone and that\u2019s not the case. Now we\u2019re being blocked by upgrades of the software and hardware techs. I\u2019ve also found techs don\u2019t or won\u2019t do what I need them to do with regard to a desktop computer. Oh sure they toot their horn as to how great they are and that they have a satellite phone (who cares?) and their knowledge is up-to-date, and then they pat you on the head and say yes they still love working with Windows XP and just give them a call and they\u2019ll fix any problem. Then just try to call them when the need arises and you get a thousand excuses, a snotty tech, and you hear the word \u201cno\u201d a lot. What good are they? See technology has not been easy for us. From the start we couldn\u2019t even get trainers, we had to learn what we know from trial and error. And to date we use what we learned to use, certainly not using everything on the internet (we\u2019re limited). I don\u2019t like it when banks, retail, news places try to force us to use online. I keep wondering what young people and businesses are going to do \u201cIF\u201d we ever had to do without. I remember during the last hurricane hit where I live and we were without phone, without tv, without cellphone contact, without internet service. I had to drive my car to the apartment complex office to see people, and to find someone to ask what\u2019s going on. While internet is nice, people need to learn to live without it. ",

            "answer_text": "I went to college in the mid-90s. PCs were really starting to come into their own at that time. The Internet was getting started, and the new Pentium II computers were hot-rods compared to the older AT/XT computers, or the 386s and 486s. CD Rom drives were starting to become widespread. And by this time, every computer had a mouse. One of the students I tutored was a part-time student who worked in a computer store. He had received complaints that the cup-holder on the computer broke and wouldn\u2019t retract. Yep\u2014the CD Rom drive. One old fellow thought it was to hold his Big Gulp. Another old lady complained that the foot pedal wouldn\u2019t work. What???? She thought the mouse was a foot pedal, like her old Singer sewing machine. I remember around this time, my uncle and cousin were trying to push a PC on to my grandmother. They insisted she to had have one. It was the rage\u2014right? Who could possibly not have a computer by 1995? The answer of course, was my grandmother. Well, they didn\u2019t listen to her, and bought her one that Christmas. My grandmother, who never shied from speaking her mind, declared that the only thing good it would do for her was to serve as a dust collector. She was right, they were wrong, and it sat in the corner of her den and I don\u2019t think she ever so much as turned it on. OP and every one else\u2014are you paying attention? Okay. Read this very carefully: Do not try to foist the latest technology on to your 75 year old grandparents when they don\u2019t ask for it and don\u2019t want it. ",
