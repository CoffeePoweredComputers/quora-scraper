            "answer_text": "If a message is sent, then the recipient will know that someone sent it. Doesn\u2019t have to be you. Use a friend\u2019s phone, or, preferably, get a burner phone for this purpose. You might spend a few bucks, but you might be OK with that, depending on your budget and the importance of the message and the recipient. Maybe a techno-wizard or two has some other, newer, better way to conceal your identity. I am not lecturing here, but you might want to look into the reasons why you want to be anonymous in your texting with this person, why you don\u2019t want to acknowledge and own what you say and what you do. I personally don\u2019t want to hide things from people. If I feel strongly about something, I want to be open and honest with them, and if I don\u2019t feel confident, then I don\u2019t send messages or communicate my opinions. But now I am too old and too evolved to avoid thinking about why I am uncomfortable doing, or not doing, something, and I can\u2019t hide from myself. I know my own tricks! This ploy, hiding your identity, or the identity of someone else, was at one time a popular theme in theater productions in the 18th-19th centuries, and there are a few examples of social satire that were popular, usually involving mistaken identity. Yes, these playwrights mined the mistaken identity thing for all it was worth. If this mystery text is a one-time thing then it shouldn\u2019t be a big deal. But if there is a pattern of hiding things from others and especially from yourself, then it might be productive to explore this with a trusted friend or with a therapist. ",

            "answer_text": "I never wanted to send text to someone without them knowing it's me, because I always stand firmly behind my words. Now when I think about it, I wouldn't want to risk to confuse, upset or scare people with some anonimous texts. There's always a possibility for the receiver to take it in the wrong way, because of the limitations that such way of communication presents. We sometimes misunderstand texts that we receive from friends and family. A person who doesn't have an idea who the sender is or what are his/her intensions can easily take the messages the wrong way! I don't think that there are many people who would enjoy anonimous over properly signed texts. If it's text with a positive connotation, it's better to know who it came from. If it's with a negative connotation, rethink your idea to do harm and send positive message to someome else instead, to make their day. You'll feel better about yourself. What type of reaction do you expect? Do you expect to get a reply to someone who's hiding their identity? I wouldn't waste my time to engage with someone who seems to be hiding something and, possibly, have an ulterior motive. I like honest and straight forward people. I don't play games. Thank you for asking me to give you my answer. I hope it helped. ",
