            "answer_text": "ASI is what the best AGI will automatically become after it\u2019s been running for a few weeks, so the distinction between them is rather artificial. An AGI system which applies the rules of mathematics (including reasoning) to all things without error will be able to achieve what the best humans can do, but inordinately more quickly because the best humans make a lot of mistakes and take a long time to find and correct them. It\u2019s the speed difference that will matter, and the ability to crunch astronomical amounts of data. The actual rules that it applies will be the same ones that mathematicians already know. Teams of the best human minds simply cannot think quickly enough to be able to complete in a lifetime the kinds of task that AGI/ASI will be able to handle in an hour. It\u2019s all about speed of processing and lack of errors. ",
