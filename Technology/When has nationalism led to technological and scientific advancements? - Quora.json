            "answer_text": "One answer may be found in the case of Japan. Already in the second half of 19th century, Japan developed a decent relationship with Germany. Japan until then was so xenophobic that it executed any foreigner who landed on its shores. Thus it had remained a nation with a monolithic race until it took about 3 million Koreans, mostly comfort women of Japanese soldiers, into japan, without giving them citizenship or other benefits. Thus Japan industrialized by its Friendship with Germany before the first and second world wars. The development was so good that it's war planes created havoc on America and in China, Korea and the south Asia. Extreme nationalism was the forte of Japan. After its defeat in the second world war and the nuclear bomb attack on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, the defeated Japan was taken under its wings by the USA. It was not allowed to develop or make any military related equipment. Thus, without having to spend on defence, it developed its civilian industries supremely briskly and very well. Indeed, it became a world leader in manufactured industrial goods. All along it has been a supremely nationalistic motherland. I have tried to answer the question asked in the case of Japan. ",
