            "answer_text": "Yes. Every time Elon opens his mouth about it I get a sinking feeling in the pit of my stomach that I won\u2019t live to see the day when the car can do what the visuals imply. Really disappointed in smart summon. It sort of works about half the time but never when you need it like if it\u2019s raining. Traffic lights and stop signs graphics cute but hardly useful. They\u2019ll give you a warning sometimes but probably not. My wife and I were talking and I was just barely paying attention before I noticed a stop sign. I was able to stop way past the sign but did it give me a warning? No. Good thing there was no traffic. It warned me once when I was paying attention and just wanted to test it. Navigate on autopilot doesn\u2019t do enough to make it worth trying to engage it. Autopark is pretty good but could use some improvement. I think that is about all we\u2019ve gotten for our seven grand. Autopilot is very useful and I love it and no other car can approach its utility. But so far FSD is a waste of money. I bought it in September 2018 so soon we will be two years in. I am just financing the training of a few AI programmers in way over their heads. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, I did. In my judgement, Tesla will succeed before I\u2019m ready to sell the car again - and as they get closer to success they say that they will ramp up the price of FSD. This will gradually increase the value of the car\u2026so it seems like a good investment. Also, I\u2019m a huge tech-head - and the car is pretty much the ultimate geek gadget. I use the FSD features on road trips - and the self-driving feature really does make the journey more relaxing - and also safer. But I do get quite excited as each new update comes along and the car inches step by step closer to completely driving itself. ",

            "answer_text": "When I bought my Tesla in 2018 I paid for the enhanced Autopilot feature, but chose to wait for the Full Self Driving until experiencing what the Autopilot could do. I have been more than satisfied with the features that function has. I will eventually pay for the full self driving, even knowing that it will be up to legislators as well as Tesla to reach agreement as to what that legally constitutes. That will also depend upon the efforts of the other corporate players in that field, who may lobby in such a way that the lead that Tesla now has could evaporate. That we will have full self driving in time is a given, though, as legislators and the automobile industry are all in need of it. You see, they have tried adding urban lanes at great expense, yet gridlock still occurs when ever human error or hubris causes a fender bender or worse. Taking more land off the tax rolls and onto the tax funded highway budgets just costs too much, so more uniform traffic movement under automation is one of the solutions. ",
