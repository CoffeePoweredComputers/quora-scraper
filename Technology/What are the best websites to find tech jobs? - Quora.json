Why would you want to go to a site and find a bunch of job listings, fill out numerous applications, and maybe hear back? With Hired: You can get exposure to vetted, awesome companies that you ordinarily might not be able to. Not going to single out any of the companies (there's over 2,000), but you can go to our website and see some of the employers who use Hired. Companies essentially compete for you. They reach out to you with salary, position, and equity upfront. Interview only with the ones you find interesting. If you get a job through Hired, we give you a $2,000 signing bonus + some other goodies :) If you don't get a job through Hired, but find a job you love through another channel, that's great as well. We truly want everyone to find a job they love. If that sounds interesting, you can apply to get on Hired by going to our site :) ",
