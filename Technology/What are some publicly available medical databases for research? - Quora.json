            "answer_text": "Here are some of the databases and archives I have found myself using the most often for medical research, several of them including multiple databases:  AAFP [American Academy of Family Physicians] - AAFP Family Medicine Journals  Frontiers - Frontiers | Peer Reviewed Articles - Open Access Journals  JNeurosci [The Journal of Neuroscience] - The Journal of Neuroscience  Kargar - https://www.karger.com/Journal  NCBI [National Center for Biotechnology Information] - National Center for Biotechnology Information  NPG [Nature Publishing Group] - Home : Nature a - z index  ResearchGate - Share and discover research  RSTB [The Royal Society] - Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences  ScienceDirect - Science, health and medical journals, full text articles and books.  The BMJ [The British Medical Journal] - Home | The BMJ  Wiley - Wiley Online Library   Not all articles are always free, but you can fill some of the gaps by searching alternative databases, or simply Googling the article title until you happen upon a free link (sometimes even in private databases, like pages of the researchers themselves).  Sometimes, not even an abstract is shown in a particular database, but you can usually get at least that from alternative sources. You can also try searching for articles that cite what you are looking for, and try to glean information from their quoting, paraphrasing, or arguing from the reference you are interested in. There are many foreign-language articles in some of these databases.  Many do not have translated content available anywhere, but you can use a free translator to get a gist.  A lot of important work is sometimes only available in other languages, though maybe there exists a database which seeks to specifically provide translated articles. You can also look at listings of databases to find additional ones that might be suitable, like this Wikipedia entry (which helpfully notes which serve free content, and links to additional lists at the bottom of the page): List of academic databases and search engines  ",

The ones that are not free in MEDLINE, mostly will not be available for free in any other databases.  With over 25 million records, I think it is the largest medical database that is available publicly.  ",
