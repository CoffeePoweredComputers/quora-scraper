            "answer_text": "I don't know if the iPod Touch is eligible for Apple Care, but it is basically an iPhone without the phone part. An iPhone with Apple Care is supported by Apple for three years, so you can expect it to be supported for about that long, plus about a year (at least) after that\u2014it would reflect poorly on Apple if their devices stopped working as soon as the warranty is up, and the perception Apple's customers have of Apple is Apple's entire business. However, after that time, you can expect the next iOS update, or the one after that for sure, will not support your device. Once you're no longer on the latest iOS, you can expect to see more and more apps that don't support your version of iOS and/or your device. For apps that cannot be updated anymore because your device is outdated, the online services may stop working; in-app purchases, online syncing and bakups, online games and sevices that require internet connectivity to work, etc. Basically, the protocol may change and the app cannot be updated to work with it anymore. So in general, you can expect an iOS device to work for 3-4 years after that particular model was discontinued, and possibly a year more before things stop working and your choices in the App Store are limited. When your device will become useless and nothing in the App Store works anymore will be determined by individual app developers and whether or not they choose to keep supporting your device. At that point you may wish to jailbreak in order to open up your device to more options, but overall your options for working apps will be limited more as the device gets older. ",
