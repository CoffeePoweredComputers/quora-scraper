            "answer_text": "In my opinion, both business and market research share few common aspects. These are directed towards understanding and analyzing key industry elements, while drawing forecasts, trends, economics, and statistics on relevant data. However, business research and market research are separate tools altogether. Business Research: To study a particular business or company activities, getting information on external and internal health and performance of an organization, find the challenges/opportunities/weaknesses/threats to the topic in consideration, are some of the features to a business research report. It may or may not contain competitor or customer analysis, but sole study of the business in question. Depending on the subject in hand, business research can mean a lot of things. Market Research: The foremost step in setting a business, market research is a broad category, of which SWOT analysis and customized reports are a part. Be it knowing who are the potential consumers, key players of industry, competitive landscape, history of the market, the share etc., a market research report can consist of a large amount of information, which not only talks about the business in concern, but also the factors influencing it. The market report specifically delves in to the markets more than the business, though the later could be a research segment. ",

            "answer_text": "The process of gathering, analyzing and interpreting information about a market, about a production or service to be offering for sale in that market, and about the past, present and potential customers for the product or service; research into the characteristics, spending habits, location and needs of your business's reference market, the industry as a whole, and the specific competitors you face . Accurate and thorough information is the foundation of all successful business ventures because it provides a wealth of information about prospective and existing customers, the competition, and the industry in general. It allows business owners to determine the feasibility of a business before committing substantial resources to the venture. Marketing Research, however, scales on a much broader level. It encompasses areas such as: \u00b7 Research into new products \u00b7 Modes of distribution \u00b7 Product development It can also include promotion research, pricing, advertising and public relations. Both concepts are integral parts of marketing, which is essentially everything that happens before the sale of a product or service. Here\u2019s a quick way to sum it up: market research is a subset of marketing research. ",
