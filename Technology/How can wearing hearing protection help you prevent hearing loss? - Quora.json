            "answer_text": "Ok, here goes some snark. Take a hammer, preferably a big one. Now hit your thumb with it\u2014HARD. Does it cause pain? Does it cause damage to your thumb? Darn right it does. Now take a feather. Hit your thumb with the feather. Does it cause pain? Does it cause damage to your thumb? Not likely. So if you listen to loud sounds they are transmitted to your cochlear structure where there are thousands of very sensitive hairs detecting different frequencies. Those loud sounds bash those hairs around like the hammer bashed your thumb. You may not feel pain exactly but eventually the frequencies detected by the damaged hairs become dead in your hearing. You become hard of hearing or deaf. Now if you put hearing protection on it is like hitting those little hairs with a feather. They like that and are not hurt by that. If you do it often enough you may be blessed with excellent hearing into your old age. Lesson: wear hearing protection. ",

            "answer_text": "Wearing hearing protection during loud events is helpful in preventing NIHL. Noise Induced Hearing Loss can cause damage to the ciliae lining the cochlea, which in turn creates hearing loss. Any sustained sound from 85 dB up can cause issues. So wearing protection such as ear muffs or plugs, prevents loud sounds from entering the ears and damaging the cochlea and the ciliae. ",
