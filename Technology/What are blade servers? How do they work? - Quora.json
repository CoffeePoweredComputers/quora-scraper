            "answer_text": "A blade server is a modified/optimized version of a server that is deployed when space or energy is an issue. You can also say it is like a modular kitchen where we don\u2019t have the space to put all the things we need to but the design of the kitchen is made in such a way that it fits the required space. How does it work? A blade server basically has many components like slots to hold multiple blade servers. In terms of operation it works like most other servers which has a power, storage , networking and cooling component. Blade servers often process more within less rackspace and simplify cabling consumption. Blade servers are also said to experience as much as 85% reduction in cabling for blade installations over conventional tower servers. With little cabling, IT admins can spend less amount of time managing the infrastructure and ensure high availability. Hope this helps :) ",
