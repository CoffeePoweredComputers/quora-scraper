A very well secured network (change the passwords to something complex instead of the defaults) a network is more difficult to hack. If you get a hacker that hacks you after you have established a better security (change the password) then there is something he/she wants\u2026.trust me there is nothing you have a hacker really wants, unless it is a secret no one else has, there are more important people to hack.

Each smart device is one of those entry points., therefore the more you have the more ways there are for a hacker to get in.
