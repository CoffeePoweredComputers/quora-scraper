            "answer_text": "Have you ever read Nassim Nicolas Taleb\u2019s book, Antifragile? Antifragile is all about the steps you can take to make yourself more resilient. Why do you need to take steps to make yourself more resilient? The answer is most of us are pretty fragile. If you apply Taleb\u2019s concepts to building a company from scratch, then you recognize that you\u2019re pretty fragile when you\u2019re just starting out. I was at a lunch meeting with the head of the venture capital fund that was sponsoring me as Entrepreneur in Residence (EIR). I said to Mike, \u201cI know if we get funded, we will succeed.\u201d Mike looked at me and said, \u201cI can think of 100 things that will kill your company.\u201d Mike\u2019s tone indicated he didn\u2019t want to be challenged. I thought to myself, \u201cWhat a jerk. Sure, there\u2019s the possibility of something going wrong, but none of that\u2019s going to happen to us.\u201d You don\u2019t realize how fragile your startup truly is. Mike was right. I don\u2019t know if there are actually 100 things that can kill your company, and I certainly don\u2019t want to count all the possibilities. That would be too depressing. However, Mike\u2019s sentiment was right. You just don\u2019t realize how fragile your company is when you\u2019re just starting out. Any number of things can kill even the best run, best financed startup, staffed with the best people. Don\u2019t think for a second that you are immune from these things happening to you. Here\u2019s the one absolutely worst, nightmare inducing scenario for any startup CEO: You lose your investors support. There are many ways this can happen to you. For example\u2026 Shortly after that lunch meeting with Mike, I started raising money. Then, Dave, the partner that was sponsoring us at the firm, asked me to stop contacting potential investors. Dave said there were concerns the partners at the fund had about the investment. He asked me to complete what he called some, \u201cFetch a rock\u201d requests from the partners. I asked Dave what that meant. Dave said, \u201cI throw you a rock, and then you bring it back. You think you\u2019re done, and then I say, \u2018fetch another rock.\u2019 You fetch the rock again. You\u2019re asked to keep fetching rocks until you get tired and give up.\u201d Dave suggested that I might want to look at the possibility of the fund not supporting the investment. Dave wouldn\u2019t give me a reason for the change of heart. I held out hope that maybe we could fetch the rocks and change the partners minds. Finally, about one month later Dave explained to me that he was being asked to leave the fund, so he wouldn\u2019t be able to sponsor the deal at the fund. Who would have guessed that the partner sponsoring you as an EIR would be forced out? I would have never believed in a million years that would happen. But it did happen. I was on my own now, but I was still very confident that we would be able to get funded. We had a great team and great plan. What could go wrong? The loss of support from the VC fund led to a cascading set of events. Read on\u2026 Now that I was free from the grip of the VC fund, I started raising money again. Within one month, we landed what would be our first investor. The fund was a well-respected fund on Sand Hill Road. We were raising $11M, and they committed to giving us $5.5M. We signed a term sheet with the fund in April. Everyone I knew told me that finding a second investor would be easy now that we had a first investor. Except that didn\u2019t happen for us because, yet again, external events came into play. This time, the economy took a turn for the worst. What we didn\u2019t know at the time was that the US was entering its worst financial crisis since The Great Depression. For about one year, the climate for investing in early-stage companies became toxic. Everyone turned us down. And by everyone, I mean everyone. 63 investors said no thanks. We had only two investors left on our list to contact. We had been avoiding both firms because we had heard negative things about working with them. But, when you\u2019re down to nothing, you have no choice but to take a chance. So we reached out to the partner at the fund (we will call this fund \u201cDonald Ventures\u201d) who was an expert in our space. Three meetings later we found our second investor. End of the story, right? Not so fast. Everything went well between us and our investors at first. The investors were happy with our progress, and we continued executing to plan, adding customers and revenue at a good clip. It became time to raise our next round of funding. Both our investors, Gill and \u201cRaul\u201d, agreed to do their pro-rata. The climate had gotten tougher for semiconductor companies to find funding than when we raised our original funding. It took us about three months, and then we received a term sheet. The next day, I had a call with Gill and Raul. \u201cI agree to the term sheet,\u201d Gill said. \u201cI agree to the term sheet,\u201d Raul said. All we needed to do was close our funding. If you haven\u2019t realized this already, nothing is done until the money is in the bank. So we started moving as fast as possible to get through the final diligence and get the money in the bank. About two weeks later, I was meeting with Raul in his office on Sand Hill Road. It was our normally scheduled meeting before next week\u2019s board meeting. Seemingly out of nowhere, Raul said to me, \u201cI think we should sell the company.\u201d Raul\u2019s tone indicated he was deadly serious, but I was having trouble processing the words. My heart rate spiked. I could literally feel my heart beating. In fact it felt like my heart might explode out of my chest. \u201cWhat?\u201d I said. Raul repeated his demand. \u201cI think we should sell the company. We might raise the flag and put $1M into the next round. But even that isn\u2019t a given. \u201cI think we should sell the company.\u201d My heart started beating even harder if that was possible. Raul and I started arguing with each other. Raul actually seemed to be enjoying my predicament. He was calm, and I just lost it. Eventually, after about 45 minutes, I left Raul\u2019s office. A sense of dread swept over my body. That sense of dread would stay with me for the next year. We would have to find another investor to replace Raul, keep the new investor in the deal, and keep Gill and his fund happy. Two months later, we received a second term sheet from a fund based in Boston (Silicon Valley was out as a possible source). Again, I was thrilled. The sense of dread left my body. The Boston investor knew about Donald Ventures not supporting their portfolio companies, so they added a clause demanding each existing investor put in a minimum of $1.5M. Raul blocked the deal, saying his fund would only put in $1M. Again Raul renewed his demand that we sell the company. My sense of dread came back again. But we had three other investors that were pretty close to giving us term sheets. I felt confident that we would be able to close another investor. So now the challenge became finding a third new investor while keeping the new syndicate intact. We weren\u2019t so fortunate. The Boston based investor smelled something was wrong, and they withdrew their term sheet. I still felt confident we could thread the needle and get the two other potential investors to invest. One was a fund based in Pennsylvania, and the other was a strategic (a public company in our space) based in Texas. About two months later, we were able to get both new investors to commit. We had a term sheet that required none of Donald Ventures money. We were home free, or so I thought. Raul blocked this term sheet too, again demanding that we sell the company. There was one trick I had left up my sleeve. It was a hail Mary pass, but, maybe just maybe, it would be caught. We had a loan with Silicon Valley Bank. Maybe SVB would step in and help us because they were going to lose a sizable amount of money. We had an emergency board meeting scheduled for the next day. During the board meeting, Raul called Gill to let him know that Donald Ventures would allow the deal to go through. We had been saved. The sense of dread I had been living with for the past year left me. For the next few days, I was euphoric. I was busy doing everything I could to close the money as fast as possible. Unfortunately, it wasn\u2019t fast enough. The first new investor, who had stayed in the deal for eight months, decided to pull out of the deal. Who could blame them? Raul had created so much uncertainty that the new investor was worried about Donald Ventures being on the cap table in any capacity. We tried to save the deal, but we couldn\u2019t. Raul had won. We would have to sell the company. The moral of the story is there are many unforeseen things that can kill your company. That\u2019s why entrepreneurship is so difficult. Little did we know at the time that Raul and Donald (the head of Donald Ventures) were fighting. Raul, not surprisingly, lost the fight, and he told by Donald to liquidate his investments. We were just collateral damage. I would have never thought we would get tripped up by problems the partner leading the deal had inside his fund. But we did not once, but twice! The point is that startups are fragile. You hopefully will not go through the ordeal we went through, but you will have challenges along the way that could go either way. The only thing you will have that will get you through is your grit. For more, read: How Much Luck Do You Need To Be Successful? - Brett J. Fox ",

            "answer_text": "You only need to know one thing to make it fun, easy and enjoyable. After reading a ton on this topic and writing a lot of it myself, and still having entrepreneurship be hard for all the time I've been doing it, I've arrived at one conclusion that I wish was the VERY FIRST THING I EVER KNEW. No one ever taught it to me, and I have yet to read it in bold. This is important because it applies to every entrepreneur without a single exception. It will solve any problem, and absolutely guarantee your success and constant growth. It is the only thing that will make entrepreneurship easier and it couldn't be any simpler...   Get help! Please please please get help! Anybody can help you. Some maybe more than others, but help is just getting more than you put in. That's it. It's called the Help Doctrine.  This is not obvious or easy for many entrepreneurs due to their roots. They start with what they are good at, and feel their success is somehow tied to their knowledge, capabilities, passion, and control... This is all true, except, it is also a trap. You cannot be a do-it-yourself person to the end. Be needy, be incapable, and be openly vulnerable. This is the difficult part, and it's not just for entrepreneurs -- this is hard as a human being.  But all great entrepreneurs are or were openly vulnerable. No business in the history of business has grown without the combined efforts of highly capable and competent individuals working together to achieve a common goal. They all have one thing in common. They got help! You will then find that none of the \"competent individuals\" were all that competent in the beginning. The journey made them competent. It's a self-fulfilling prophecy. We look at Steve Jobs and aspire to be him. We don't aspire to be the 50,000 people that make up Apple, Inc. Who are they, and what are they all doing? Your answer to this question is how much you really know about the inner workings of a business. How much you know about Steve Jobs is important, but he is only 1/50,000th of the puzzle. So, You need to aspire to be as big as Steve Jobs, but also as small as him.  Microsoft has 100,000 employees worldwide. Facebook about 6000. Yes, ONLY SIX THOUSAND. This isn't just about blue chip companies however. Even if you're opening a small cake shop in your own neighborhood you need a lot of help, and the better the help, the better the cake. Even a little girl working a lemonade stand is better off with help from her bigger brother. The same principle applies at any scale. It even applies to teams and departments and people within a business.  Everything grows with help, even if it's from each other. There is only one of you. The Earth's population is over 7 billion. Get their help. That way you will never have to be superman. You can stay ordinary, as will everyone that joins you. This all makes so much more sense. Then what is extraordinary? The journey, the synergy, and the power of combined ordinary...  Ordinary people accomplish extraordinary things, with help. A lot of help. That then makes them extraordinary. You could try to be superman or find superman to build your super company. Or you can be an ordinary dude getting help from ordinary people, and still build a super company, and then have people see you as superman. Maybe no one is superman to begin with? In the end, you can only contribute what you can, and anything beyond that, you can only get with help. So all you will ever need is help! Once you apply this, how much you contribute no longer becomes an issue. You are important because you started it, but you don't have to ever feel you are not good enough or that you failed or that your ambitions are beyond you. If you can get help, you can suck at everything.  You just need to be good at getting help.  Entrepreneurship is not only hard, it is impossible if you're going at it alone. Get good at getting good help. Though it may sound counter intuitive, as an entrepreneur, you must also practice sucking at things. Yes yes, be the jack of all trades, the capable, competent do-it-yourself leader that built your business to whatever. But when you hit your maximum, you must admit you suck. And in all honesty, you can't suck soon enough, because help is the key to success, and the sooner you seek it the better. There is an infinite amount of advice and know-how you can find online now, and how anything was done, is done, or could be done, is all being talked about by someone on some site. Most entrepreneurs are open because they want others to succeed. There really are no secrets to entrepreneurship. Good luck! ",
