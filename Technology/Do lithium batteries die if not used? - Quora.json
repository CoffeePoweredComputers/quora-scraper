            "answer_text": "There are many different chemistries of lithium batreries, but as a general rule of thumb: rechargeable batteries that sit for over a year die. they self discharge to a low enough voltage that its not possible to recharge or will have severely diminished life. this is why most if your old cell phones done really work after sitting in your desk drawer for a few years.non rechargeable batteries (aka primary cells) have a very long shelf life (10+ years). this is due to a small layer of chemicals that build up inside the cell that prevent self discharge. this layer of chemicals burns off when you finally end up using the battery.",

            "answer_text": "Generally there are two kinds of lithium batteries. The rechargeable and non rechargeable battery. And the life of battery reffer to two aspects- the shelf life and cycle life. for the rechargeable battery, the shelf life is 2\u20134 years, and the cycle life is 600\u20131000.for the non rechargeable battery, the shelf life is 10\u201312 years, and as it cannot be recharged, so it has no cycle life.There is a good article explaining the lifespan of different kinds of batteries: Lifespan - Battery Universe Blog ",
