If you think about it, what about so many different companies in places like Shenzhen and Taiwan, who have created so many things. Think about farmers in the middle of nowhere who learnt how to hack their own tractors. In reality, although it may seem like it, you have to remember that many people are insanely intelligent yet just choose to do something else other than work for a tech company. ",
