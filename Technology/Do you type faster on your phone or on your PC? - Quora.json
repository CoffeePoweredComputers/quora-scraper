            "answer_text": "I can type way faster on a computer keyboard with autocorrect turned off. I type incredibly fast on a real keyboard and rarely ever have to look at the keyboard, or even the screen. I can close my eyes and type more accurately and faster than I can on a smartphone. I\u2019m not kidding. On a smartphone or tablet, I find I spend 3/4 of the time correcting autocorrect. If I turn off autocorrect it\u2019s really no better. If I take the time to look at the suggestions, it slows me down and can knock me out of my train of thought. A tablet is marginally better than an iPhone. I took touch-typing in junior high summer school way back in the late 60s. My parents made me. I had to type my term papers in college on an electric typewriter in college. We couldn\u2019t use correction tape or white out. This made for accurate typing. Word processors weren\u2019t common until my second professional job. I used to write code on a computer keyboard from 1977\u20132006; I rarely had to look at the screen. Brain to code actualized. I can type pretty fast on a tablet or iPhone screen, but do have issues with autocorrect seemingly randomly inserting names from my contact list. I\u2019ve watched in awe as if goes back and change things I\u2019ve typed correctly. It almost always puts in \u201cTim\u201d when I type a \u201ct\u201d and will change \u201cdo\u201d to \u201cdon\u2019t\u201d. The list is endless. \u201cI\u201d becomes \u201cIsmaili,\u201d which, ironically took me four tries to type in when I wanted to! Good becomes Goodman, and it\u2019s adding \u201cs\u201d contraction and entire suffixes to be \u201chelpful.\u201d \u201cThat\u201d becomes \u201cthat\u2019s\u201d or even \u201cthat\u2019ll.\u201d They becomes they\u2019re. \u201cBecomes\u201d becomes \u201cbecome s\u201d. Etc. . This slows me down, a lot. Obviously. The real issue for me is that typing on a smartphone or tablet makes me pause to deal with the mechanics and lose track of the content. For example, when typing the previous sentence, autocorrect went back and changed \u201ctyping on\u201d to \u201ctyphoon game\u201d. WTF. What real keyboards have that screens don\u2019t is tactile feedback, spacial certainty, and special clues. There are raised dots in most key boards that identify home keys. The mechanical keys move and or click when depressed. You never have to worry what the computer will do if you hit the \u201cI\u201d and \u201co\u201d key at same time. Your touch either one or the other, not both, In the very old days, the typewriter keys would jam if you pressed two at once, so you learned quickly not to do so. Now, the computer uses some nerd\u2019s algorithms to guess what you meant to type. Computer keyboards are big enough for your hands and the meaning of keys don\u2019t change as you work. A p is a p is a p. You KNOW when you\u2019ve hit a key and there is a good chance your fingers are in the right position. The keyboard won\u2019t helpfulky add letters to words. This is the recipe for speed and accuracy\u2019s. ",

Also\u2026 I wouldn\u2019t really call it typing unless you hold your phone like this  This isn\u2019t Typing:  That is barbarically using your thumb to smash buttons on a flat piece of glass. And the probability of you misspelling a word is much high than on a standard keyboard. This is a KeyBoard: It has real Keys on a real Board They go down when you press them, and when they reach a certain point, they register. Often a bump and/or audible click are felt heard.  This is Not a keyboard. This what I would call a Virtual Button board. Look Closely:  There are no Keys and No board (well, kinda, I guess the pone is a board itself) But the buttons here don\u2019t press, they don\u2019t bump, they don\u2019t click, nothing. Its just a hit or miss. And they are 1/5th the size of a real Keyboard Key. Which means it is much harder to hit them. A phone keyboard is just a virtual imitation of a real keyboard. But they are handy, for sure. But the typing is not the same. Definitely go for the Keyboard rather than a phone. if you have a choice. often you don\u2019t. ",

Most people can type between 30\u201350 words per minute on a PC/laptop with some practice. People who are good at typing can probably reach 70\u2013100 words per minute (the best typists can reach much higher than that)On the phone, actual \u201ctyping\u201d won\u2019t get you close to those speeds. But if you are using predictive text typing or speech to text, you could possibly go much faster (accuracy may suffer and depends on how well you can make it work)So, in summary, most people can with some practice generally type faster on the PC, but in the near future, that difference might not be much especially if speech to text recognition and other techniques get really accurate (Note: These could work on both PC and phone) ",

It starts working well only after few weeks of usage. So instead of typing in most of the cases all I'm doing is picking words. P. S Just for info. My phone is Note 4. Screen is big enough. ",

I use most of my fingers on a computer keyboard. On a phone, my fingers cover about 2 keys so I can\u2019t tell what key I pressed. I can hunt-and-peck with a capacitative stylus which is a bit better, but much much slower than on a physical keyboard. I can use my thumbs on my old tablet with chiclet keys, but my thumbnails don\u2019t trigger a phone screen. Having said that, I think the current typing speed record is held by someone using a swipe keyboard on a tablet. ",
