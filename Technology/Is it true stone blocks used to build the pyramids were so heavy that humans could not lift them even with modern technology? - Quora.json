            "answer_text": "No, of course not. That is arrant nonsense. Wherever you got that from, never believe another word you hear/see/read there. The heaviest blocks used in any of the pyramids are estimated to weigh between 70 and 80 tons. But very few of that weight were used, and they tended to be foundation pieces, i.e. they never needed to be lifted much. Most of the blocks used to build the pyramids weighed in at somewhere around 2.5 tons, with a number of others that weighed around 15\u201320 tons. In any case, all of those are within the capabilities of modern technology. To put that in perspective: 80 tons equates to 160,000 lbs. The Saturn V rocket[1] that boosted Apollo 11 into space weighed 6,100,000 lbs fully fueled on the launch pad. That means that merely to get off the ground it had to lift a weight roughly equivalent to 38 of those 80 ton blocks. Straight up. At the same time. Now the higher it went, the less it weighed, since it was both moving farther from the source of the gravity giving it its weight, but more because it was burning off the fuel that constituted most of its weight to begin with. Still, even empty that Saturn V weighed over 500,000 lbs, or 250 tons, which is still more than three times the weight of just one of those big blocks of stone. The basic fact is that nothing in the building of the pyramids was particularly difficult or required any advanced techniques. All it took was two out of the six famous \u201csimple machines\u201d[2] that humans have had since prehistoric times plus one more element. Here are those three requirements: The inclined plane[3], one of the six simple machines. Basically this is nothing but a ramp. It lets you lift heavy stones just a little bit at time by sliding or rolling them sideways as much or more than you lift them, each time you move them at all. Picture in your head the difference between rolling a car up a shallow grade versus bodily lifting it straight up into the air. Obviously rolling it takes very little force compared to lifting it straight up. The blocks were lifted into place the same way.The pulley ,[4] another of the six simple machines. By attaching many ropes through many pulley attachments mounted at a higher level than the one you are trying to lift a block to, you can simply pull on the ropes to get the block moving. Then just lock the pulleys or anchor the ropes when you want to stop pulling, in order to keep the stone from backsliding. Better still, use the pulley arrangement known as the block and tackle[5], which both gives a greater mechanical advantage and allows easier locking off of the ropes.Lots and lots of slaves. I once saw a demotivational workplace poster with a picture the pyramids. The non-inspirational caption read: \u201cACHIEVEMENT\u201d And then below that: \u201cYou can do anything you set your mind to when you have vision, determination, and an endless supply of expendable labor.\u201dThat pretty much sums up how the pyramids were built. Conspiracy theorists and tinfoil hat wearing advocates for fictional space aliens miss one essential point when they try to characterize the building of huge monuments and temples in ancient times as beyond human capabilities, or even as particularly challenging. They falsely assume that because those people in ancient times lacked modern science and technology, that somehow means they were stupid. There is also the silent but true irony in that the stupid ones in this equation are the aforementioned tinfoil hat crowd, for failing to realize for themselves just how simple and straightforward such projects could actually be. I mean, really, how complicated is \u2026 the ramp\u2026 the pulley\u2026 the lever? Edit: since some folks took the joke about slaves right on the nose, I add this disclaimer: it was a fewkin joke.

            "answer_text": "No. It is not true that the blocks used in the pyramids could not be lifted today as practically everyone who has answered here has stated. So why am I chipping in? I am gobsmacked at the amount of unqualified assertions and uninformed opinions that have been added to this simple answer. The question is about engineering - can we lift the blocks? Many engineers have stated yes we can. I agree. To then answer the question - can we replicate the Great Pyramid - which most answers have addressed - is more about Egyptology than engineering. Why? Because answers including phrases such as \u2018\u2026nothing in the building of the pyramids was particularly difficult or required any advanced techniques..\u2019, \u2018..trivial. Child's play\u2026\u2019, \u2018\u2026stacking blocks in successively smaller courses is the literal simplest and most stable arrangement possible..\u2019 show a complete lack of any understanding of what the Great Pyramid actually is. It\u2019s just a stack of blocks! Seriously? Come on! Look into it. It\u2019s fascinating. I cannot begin to describe the geometrical & astronomical wonders and mathematical mysteries as I am no expert. I have, however, looked into it enough to know that there are things we do not understand. Instead of the mutual back-patting along the lines of aren\u2019t our machines great?we move these blocks on ships every daywe are so advanced and cleverour trucks shift these blocks like sugar cubes \u2026.. etc etcwe should be asking do I know enough to express an opinion as fact?does the mainstream viewpoint hold water?what are our \u2018facts\u2019 based on?Start here  then dig further. Ask questions, don\u2019t make assumptions or uninformed assertions. I\u2019m no expert on engineering or ancient Egypt but I know there\u2019s more to Giza than 99% of people are led to believe. Can we just dismiss the ancients as less advanced? Are we really so advanced and clever nowadays? The USA - I\u2019m looking at you and your White House!! ",
