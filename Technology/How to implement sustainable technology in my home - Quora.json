            "answer_text": "There is no such thing as sustainable technology. Everything uses energy to make, move or use and everything decays over time and will become garbage. I have some solar panels made in the 70\u2019s and they were 22 watts. Now, 50 years later they are junk. They can't even produce 1 watt and will end up in the landfill. I have some panels that were made in 2000\u2019s and they are now worthless as the glass is cracked and rain got into the wafers. I will toss them into the garbage also. They are toxic and need to be recycled but I am not going to drive 500 miles round trip to the closest recycling station and burn all that gas. My smallest wind generator finally died last year and needs to be recycled but again, I am not going to drive 250 miles round trip to an electronics recycling plant which defeats the purpose of green energy. Every thing decays. The sun is going to run out of energy. The Earth will cool as the uranium decays and the Earths core will solidify. Once that happens the Van Allen radiation belt will go away and the solar wind will blast off our atmosphere and Earth will look like Mars. All organics decay, like wood, and once it starts to decay it gives off CO2 and methane which is the end or all carbon based life forms. There is no way to stop what the universe has in store for us. Sorry to burst your bubble. ",

            "answer_text": "Ummm\u2026 I wonder what you mean. Sustainable means the ability of a community to be able to meet all of the needs of all of it\u2019s population in less than 24h/d/ca, using only the skills of the population and the resources/ecological services that it manages, in perpetuity. Technological Development is the creation or enhancement of systems of infrastructure (broadly defined), with an expectation that the quality of life of the community would improve. A sustainable technology is an investment in time and resources that aids a community to be sustainable. That would be anything from a broom (made with local materials that are harvested from the ecological interest, using local skills) to a t-shirt (ditto), to a house (ditto), to a book, \u2026 the list is long. So, how would you implement almost anything that was created using ecological interest that improves quality of life, in your home? I dunno - that depends vastly on where you live, what ecological interest your community produces, and what skills it has. ",
