            "answer_text": "Humans are very likely evolving faster today than at almost any time in the past. Sounds crazy, right? How could this be? Let me explain. Most people think of evolution as operating on members of a species with \u201cinferior\u201d traits, thereby reducing their survivability and ultimate contribution to the gene pool. With this understanding, you\u2019d then point to our modern longevity and note that \u201chumans have largely solved the problem of survivability\u201d \u2014 which we have. We can remedy poor eyesight, compensate for chronic diseases, vaccinate against plagues, work around infertility, etc. But this understanding is based on a narrow view of evolution. Evolution operates at a species wide level across vast periods of time. And what is it looking for? You might say, \u201csurvival of the fittest\u201d or \u201cnatural selection\u201d. And that\u2019s where a lot of the confusion comes from. With ever longer lifespans and no natural predators, evolution seems to be way back in the rear view mirror for Homo sapiens. But what evolution really cares about is reproductive success. And we\u2019re not talking about the whole \u201chad two kids that aced the SAT and became a doctor and a lawyer\u201d, evolution is talking about numbers of offspring, not just of one family, but across generations. So if we want to see if humans are evolving, we need to look for any signs of evolutionary pressure, which is defined as \u201cany cause that reduces reproductive success\u201d. Are there any forces exerting selective pressure on human reproduction? Absolutely. Here are some amazing trends whose consequences are yet to be determined: Humans are currently undergoing a massive fertility shock as a direct consequence of birth control.Almost all population growth is occurring in developing nations (e.g. Nigeria - see below). Developed nations have stopped growing, and most are declining. Pretty much any modern society (i.e. having access to birth control) eventually succumbs to below replacement fertility rates or less than 2.1 children per woman. You might think that some populations are immune, like Muslims or Hispanics, but not so: Source: Our World in Data This leads to a very interesting division where developing nations (mainly in Africa) are under less selective pressure due to clean water, immunization initiatives, lots of kids, lower infant mortality, etc., while developed nations (almost everywhere else) are under much, much more - a veritable evolutionary pressure cooker. A Tale of Two Fertilities - Africa and Everywhere Else. Source: Our World in Data also see the inverse map showing birth control adoption. Of course, we don\u2019t feel like we\u2019re under pressure, and you might say, \u201cHumans are fine, we\u2019re just choosing to have fewer children.\u201d And that\u2019s true, but it\u2019s not what evolution sees. Evolution doesn\u2019t care if the \u201creduced reproductive success\u201d is a choice, or infanticide, or a plague, or a famine, etc. It doesn\u2019t see the difference between natural selection and natural self selection. All evolution sees is a lack of fitness which it will attempt to remedy with selective breeding and genetic mutations.Let that sink in for a moment. The genes that gave us and our mammalian forebearers reproductive success for 200 million years (!!!) are now broken and obsolete (aka Evolutionary Mismatch) and in the span of several generations will be replaced by new genes that favor novel reproductive strategies. What are some those strategies? They might suprise you:Winners:Twinners: Expect the genes for twins to become more prevalent. In America where we have a total fertility rate of below 2.0, having twins can easily boost your fertility by 50%. Over time that\u2019s a big deal.Gender hunters: Parents with two boys \u201choping for a girl\u201d and vice versa also stand to win. Anything that causes you to decide to have another marginal child will have a big impact over the long run. Of course, technology might solve this problem and cancel out the need to have an additional child.Amish and ultra-Orthodox Jews: Both groups have maintained an extremely high fertility rate through a partial or complete rejection of modernity with the Amish doubling their population every 15 to 30 years and Haredi Jews in Israel averaging 6.9 children per woman. Can they scale to larger numbers and still keep the forces of modernity at bay? Hard to say.Catholics and Mormons: Both of these groups do embrace modernity, which is critical. Large Catholic families used to be prevalent but \u2014although still occurring \u2014 no longer are prevalent enough to result in very high fertility or about 2.3 children per woman. Mormon fertility is certainly the highest among surveyed American faiths, but not as high as you might think (~3.4 and falling) and like all faiths, Mormons are struggling with retention amidst increasing secularization (U.S. growth rate was only 0.75% in 2017).Easy birthers: Those annoying Moms that are still jogging during their 8th month of pregnancy, don\u2019t retain water, minimal or no morning sickness, no post-partum depression, non-invasive deliveries, etc. Why not have one more? (HT Michael Lush)Sperm donors: Could there be an easier way to play \u201cthe game-of-life\u201d? Long term who knows though. In the future Lesbian couples will likely be able to use their own genetic material to produce offspring, but it\u2019s unlikely that technology will produce or replicate sperm faster/cheaper than young American males.Not Winners:Accidentals: Teen pregnancies are declining in the U.S. and abortions are generally readily available. Birth control is becoming more fool proof with increasing prevalence of low maintenance methods like IUDs. Most of the people that reproduce \u201cby accident\u201d will see any genetic \u201cadvantage\u201d vanish over time and turn negative.People who like sex: In the past a strong sexual drive was a chief sponsor of reproductive success, but humans stand to become the first sexual species to decouple sex from reproduction. Today you can have a lifetime full of sex (virtual, protected, gay, whatever) without producing a single offspring. Mating, but without the mating part.Anti-abortionists: Disapproving of abortion may result in a woman becoming a mother at an earlier age, but it does not seem to translate into having more children than replacement (2.1), which is understandable considering the hardship many young mothers face being single or lacking a college education.Huge Winners:Baby lovers: In the short span of about 100 to 200 years we\u2019ll evolve from a species that had children because we enjoyed sex, to a species that has children because we long to have children. Any genes or mutations encoding for loving babies, wanting big families, caring disproportionately about your legacy, etc. will come to dominate the landscape (already started). Let\u2019s ponder that for a moment. In 200 years, sex could be like, \u201cMeh\u201d, but when we see a chubby baby in a diaper we\u2019d be like, \u201cAww!!! I want one!!!!\u201d Sex scenes in movies will be replaced with \u201cbaby tickle and giggle scenes.\u201d You\u2019ll be frustrated skimming through Spotify trying to find some new good songs that are not about babies. That\u2019s some serious evolution taking place!Successful baby lovers: Anything that contributes to realizing a baby lover\u2019s desire for offspring: successful and long term pairing, affluence, etc. Just think about the challenges of trying to have a large family. You have to convince someone to go in with you on the endeavor, support the brood, etc. Doing so generation after generation means you have genes well adapted to succeed in modernity (collaborative, education oriented, intellectual, etc.).BOTTOM LINE: As a direct consequence of the pressures of natural self selection, humanity is evolving rapidly and people 200 years from now will not identify with our entertainment, our music, or our goals in life. Look around at the people choosing to have kids. That\u2019s the future. Us Today:  Us in 2200:  Sources: Pexel and Pexel Disclaimers and Other Cool Stuff Check out this cool video showing global fertility rates declining by country since 1800. You can visualize that this selection process started well over 100 years ago in more developed countries.Also, I understand people\u2019s skepticism saying 200 years is way too short, maybe I\u2019m being a little dramatic, but check out this chart showing how quickly fertility can crash \u2014 China went from >6 children per woman to <3 children per woman in 11 years (even before one-child policy)!EDIT - 11/15/2018: Answer heavily edited based on feedback from fellow Quorans.

            "answer_text": "Evolution is impossible to completely stop.  Evolution is a very slow process driven solely by random Mutation and the pressure of Natural selection. One can effectively argue that Evolution has slowed as medical and technological advances lessen the pressure of Natural selection. As for people that posit that modern society has increased the pressure of Natural selection this is highly speculative and unfounded.  Confirmation bias is the basis for such thinking where the social system picks winners and losers regardless of genetic health. One needs to widen the economic lens to account for how the modern world is in reality.  Wealth is typically birthright not an earned result despite what people believe.  That is why it is called the American dream despite the fact it is a fictional fairy tale not based in reality. As for the rich staying rich and the poor staying poor this is very regrettable as the best genetic material is discarded as the result of intentional political and economic corruption.  The current system precludes Social mobility, as the rich have a vested interest in staying rich regardless of genetic fitness.  Therefore the favorable beneficial genetic mutations are lost and evolution is slowed or even reversed due to Inbreeding as was the case of the Egyptian Kings of old. Here is a current article from The Economist discussing the failure of Meritocracy in the USA. America\u2019s elite An hereditary meritocracy The children of the rich and powerful are increasingly well suited to earning wealth and power themselves. That\u2019s a problem An hereditary meritocracy MY BIG fear,\u201d says Paul Ryan, an influential Republican congressman from Wisconsin, is that America is losing sight of the notion that \u201cthe condition of your birth does not determine the outcome of your life.\u201d \u201cOpportunity,\u201d according to Elizabeth Warren, a Democratic senator from Massachusetts, \u201cis slipping away.\u201d Marco Rubio, a Republican senator from Florida, thinks that \u201ceach element\u201d of the sequence that leads to success \u201cis eroding in our country.\u201d \u201cOf course you have to work hard, of course you have to take responsibility,\u201d says Hillary Clinton, a former first lady, senator and secretary of state, \u201cbut we are making it so difficult for people who do those things to feel that they are going to achieve the American dream.\u201d When discussing the chances of ordinary Americans rising to the top, politicians who agree about little else sound remarkably similar. Before the word meritocracy was coined by Michael Young, a British sociologist and institutional entrepreneur, in the 1950s there was a different name for the notion that power, success and wealth should be distributed according to talent and diligence, rather than by accident of birth: American. For sure, America has always had rich and powerful families, from the floor of the Senate to the boardrooms of the steel industry. But it has also held more fervently than any other country the belief that all comers can penetrate that elite as long as they have talent, perseverance and gumption. At times when that has not been the case Americans have responded with authentic outrage, surmising that the people at the top are, as Nick Carraway said, \u201ca rotten crowd\u201d, with bootlegging Gatsby better than the whole damn bunch put together.Today\u2019s elite is a long way from the rotten lot of West Egg. Compared to those of days past it is by and large more talented, better schooled, harder working (and more fabulously remunerated) and more diligent in its parental duties. It is not a place where one easily gets by on birth or connections alone. At the same time it is widely seen as increasingly hard to get into.Some self-perpetuation by elites is unavoidable; the children of America\u2019s top dogs benefit from nepotism just as those in all other societies do. But something else is now afoot. More than ever before, America\u2019s elite is producing children who not only get ahead, but deserve to do so: they meet the standards of meritocracy better than their peers, and are thus worthy of the status they inherit.It takes twoThis is partly the result of various admirable aspects of American society: the willingness of people to give money and time to their children\u2019s schools; a reluctance to impose a uniform model of education across the country; competition between universities to build the most lavish facilities. Such traits are hard to object to, and even if one does object they are yet harder to do anything about. In aggregate, though, they increase the chances of wealthy parents passing advantage on to their children. In the long run that could change the way the country works, the way it thinks about itself, and the way that people elsewhere judge its claim to be an exceptional beacon of opportunity.Part of the change is due to the increased opportunities for education and employment won by American women in the twentieth century. A larger pool of women enjoying academic and professional success, or at least showing early signs of doing so, has made it easier for pairs of young adults who will both excel to get together. Between 1960 and 2005 the share of men with university degrees who married women with university degrees nearly doubled, from 25% to 48%, and the change shows no sign of going into reverse.Assortative mating of this sort seems likely, on average, to reinforce the traits that bring the couple together. Though genes play a role in the variation of intelligence from person to person, this is not a crude genetic determinism. People tend to encourage in their children what they value in themselves and their partners. Thus people bought together by their education and status will typically deem such things important and do more to bring them out in their children, both deliberately and by lived example\u2014processes in which nature and nurture are more than likely to work hand in hand.  Not only do graduate couples tend to value education; they also tend to have money to spend on it. And though the best predictor of an American child\u2019s success in school has long been the parents\u2019 educational level\u2014a factor which graduates are already ahead on, by defintition\u2014money is an increasingly important factor. According to Sean Reardon of Stanford the past decades have seen a growing correlation between parental income and children\u2019s test scores. Sort the students who took the SAT, a test for college applicants, in 2014 by parental income and the results get steadily better the further up the ladder you climb (see chart 1).First, cultivate your kindergartenAnother factor is family stability. Wealthier and better educated American families tend to marry before having children, and like most married couples they split up less than unmarried ones. This correlates with various good outcomes for their children.The educational benefits of being born to wealthy parents are already clear in toddlers (see article). Families which are used to and eager for success try to build on them at kindergarten. Competition for private kindergarten places among high-status New Yorkers is farcically intense. Jennifer Brozost of Peas, an educational consultancy, recommends that parents apply to 8-10 kindergartens, write \u201clove letters\u201d to their top three, and bone up on how to make the right impression when visiting. Some parents pay for sessions at which their children are coached on how to play in a way that pleases those in charge of admissions.Once children enter the public school system\u2014which about 90% of them do\u2014the advantages of living in a well-off neighbourhood kick in. America is unusual in funding its public schools through property taxes. States have a floor price for the education of each child, but parents can vote to pay more local tax in order to top this up, and frequently do. Funding levels per pupil can vary by up to 50% across a state, says Mike McShane of the American Enterprise Institute, a think-tank.  Sometimes this results in poor students in cities that collect lots of property tax being better funded than the children of wealthier families in the suburbs. More often, though, the opposite is true. The result is that America is one of only three advanced countries that spends more on richer pupils than poor ones, according to the OECD (the other two are Turkey and Israel). And on top of spending on school, there is spending outside it: the gap between what rich and poor parents shell out for museum trips, music lessons, books and so on has been widening (see chart 2). In a world where lots of people do well on SATs, cultivating extra skills matters.The opportunities for parental investment continue in higher education, which is ever more costly (see chart 3) but offers ever greater returns. Between 1979 and 2012 the income gap between the median family with college-educated parents and one with high-school educated parents grew four times greater than the headline-grabbing income gap between the top 1% of earners and the rest, according to David Autor of MIT, rising from $30,000 to $58,000.  Those whose parents have provided good schooling and good after-schooling have advantages already\u2014but some get an extra one from institutions that discriminate in favour of the children of alumni. According to a survey by the Crimson, Harvard\u2019s newspaper, 16% of the 2,023 who got in last year had at least one parent among the university\u2019s alumni. Harvard says that legacy preference is only ever a tie breaker in admissions; but with 17 applicants for every place there can be a lot of ties.All this and lacrosse tooMost of the country\u2019s research universities and liberal arts colleges grant preferences to legacy students; the practice seems widespread at universities just below the top tier. The University of Pennsylvania is particularly friendly to the children of alumni, says Katherine Cohen of Ivywise, a firm with several ex-deans of admissions on its books which provides advice on getting children into the best schools. Though it is rare, stories still crop up of the parents of academically borderline students buying admission for their children with a generous bequest to a particular school. The fierce competition between universities to build endowments makes doing such favours for alumni enticing. And there is a public-good argument for it: a student who comes with $1m attached can pay for financial aid for many others. But in practice this is not how the system works. While it is true that some elite universities are rich enough to give out a lot of financial support, people who can pay the full whack are still at the centre of the business model for many. Mitchell Stevens, a Stanford sociologist who spent a year working in the admissions office of an unnamed liberal arts college in the north-east, found that the candidate the system most prized was one who could pay full tuition and was just good enough to make one of the higher-profile sports teams but had a strong enough academic record not to eat into the annual allocation reserved for students whose brains work best when encased in a football helmet.Combined with the long-running push for racial diversity on college campuses, this makes for an esoteric definition of merit. Men are slightly under-represented across college campuses; African-Americans are not, but can still benefit from some forms of affirmative action; and there is always a need for those who are good at sports. Poor whites and Asians get a bad deal from this kind of filtering. Though the Ivies all deny operating quotas to limit Asian students\u2014the best performing group in SAT scores\u2014the number admitted each year has fallen from its peak in 2008 and stays strangely consistent both from year to year and between institutions. Caltech, a university which admits purely on academic ability, has more Asian students than other elite schools. It also has much less feared sports teams.  On graduation, many members of America\u2019s future elite will head for the law firms, banks and consultancies where starting salaries are highest. Lauren Rivera of Kellogg School of Management interviewed 120 people charged with hiring in these sectors for a forthcoming book. She found that though they did not set out to recruit students from wealthy backgrounds, the companies had a penchant for graduates who had been to well-known universities and played varsity sports (lacrosse correlates with success particularly well). The result was a graduate intake that included people with skin of every shade but rarely anyone with parents who worked blue-collar jobs. \u201cWhen we are asked to identify merit,\u201d explains Ms Rivera, \u201cwe tend to find people like ourselves.\u201dSomething similar has happened in corner offices of America\u2019s biggest companies. As computing power has increased and clerical jobs have been automated, the distance between the shop floor and executive positions has increased. It was never common for people to start at the bottom and work their way to the top. Now it is close to impossible. Research by Nitin Nohria, the dean of Harvard Business School, and his colleagues has shown how in the second half of the 20th century a corporate elite where family networks and religion mattered most was replaced by one whose members required an MBA or similar qualification from a business school. This makes the managers better qualified. It also means they are the product of a serial filtering that has winnowed their numbers at school, college and work before they get their MBAs.More than 50 years ago Michael Young warned that the incipient meritocracy to which he had given a name could be as narrow and pernicious, in its way, as aristocracies of old. In America some academics and thinkers on the left are coming to similar conclusions. Lani Guinier of Harvard speaks for many when she rails against the \u201ctestocracy\u201d that now governs America. Once progressives saw academic testing as a way of breaking down old structures of privilege; there is now a growing sense that it simply serves to advantage those who have been schooled to excel in such situations. Heirs to Andrew Jackson on the right have their own worries about the self perpetuation of an American elite, but no desire at all to use government as a leveller. Both sides can agree that the blending of merit and inheritance is un-American. Neither has plausible ideas for what to do about it. ",
