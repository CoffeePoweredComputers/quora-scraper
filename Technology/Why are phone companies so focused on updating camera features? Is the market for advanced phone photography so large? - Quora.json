            "answer_text": "The main reason smartphone companies are focused (sic) on camera features is simple: it sells phones. That\u2019s a general rule. If you hear any company repeatedly stressing any particular feature of any particular piece of kit, that\u2019s because they have somehow determined that stressing helps sell their item. Most of the market analysis of smartphone sales suggests that over 90% of smartphone users will use the camera and that camera issues are on the top three list of things consumers look at. That\u2019s where we start. The other things at the top of most feature lists: quality of device, operating system, price, and a few others.. well, they\u2019re just a little more difficult to fudge. Whereas camera specs, on the spec sheet, are nebulous and confusing enough, any company can claim a win.  Look at the Nokia 9 Pureview here, a brand new phone. Ok, it\u2019s not your father\u2019s Nokia, but Nokia did have great cameras in their day. This one has both color and monochrome cameras, all the same, and they all shoot at the same time for computational processing without worries about blurring. Sounded kind of cool. But in actual testing\u2026 not so much. The DxO review puts the overall rating a few notches below phones like the iPhone 7\u2026 from 2016! Part of it is absolutely the idea that a manufacturer can talk you into buying something you want, that sounds cool, that you don\u2019t fully understand. That\u2019s a Marketroid\u2019s dream! And here\u2019s the thing: no one\u2019s making phone cameras for advanced photography. They\u2019re making phone cameras that hopefully won\u2019t produce horrible results in the shooting situations that regular people want. Like a selfie in a dimly-lit nightclub. They are trying to make phones smarter and more capable only because their users are not interested in learning photography, Just in shooting their latest meal to Facebook or Instagram. The other reason is a bit technical, but also salient. Back to my first point: marketing. A smartphone maker has to figure out how to sell you that phone. There are dozens of small, fringe companies making niche phones for things like construction. Caterpillar (yeah, the heavy equipment company with the yellow earthmovers) makes a smartphone with a FLIR heat camera. Not for everyone\u2026 but I\u2019m a little tempted. But a mainstream phone company needs to make phones for average everyone\u2019s. And no one is more of a generalist than Apple, because they only make 2\u20133 models every year. So they make the camera important. Why? Well, for Apple, it\u2019s lately been keeping up with all of the Androids out there. Apple hasn\u2019t introduced a new camera feature in quite some time. But as a big software-oriented company (despite their disguise as a hardware company), they have been near the top of the software game on phones. So they keep doing pretty well. On Android, it\u2019s a little different. Apple makes their own phone processor, the A-series system-on-chips ICs. They use the same one for every new iPhone model, and within that, they can differentiate low and high end a little with cameras. But on Android, you\u2019ll find nearly every flagship phone in any given year using the same Qualcomm SOC. In short, they all have basically the same performance. Google added an AI processor to theirs, but most companies can\u2019t do that. But as far as cameras, and even software, goes, that is a thing each company can figure out on their own. Their points of differentiations: physical design, RAM and Flash, display, etc. But you can\u2019t make any huge differences in memory. Only a few companies actually make the displays, and the 800lbs gorilla in Android, Samsung, is one of them. There\u2019s a little room on physical design, but not that much. Even going to a 5.5\u2033 phone was a risk when Samsung did it. People reject phones that are too fat or just a little too weird. So the camera(s) are one place they can make a difference. ",

            "answer_text": "Because people love to take pictures, videos, and selfies, especially for social media. Phones that take better quality pictures and video and that make taking pictures and video easier with image stabilization, smart autofocus, good automatic white balance and exposure, good low light performance, water resistance, and more, will of course sell and attract buyers. Nowadays, automatic built in skin smoothing is especially popular, and new Iphones do this automatically, and Pixel phones also do this for selfies, but you can turn it off if you want to. The only problem with phones is that there are serious limits to quality and performance, because people want thin small light phones that aren't too expensive, so for the best pictures and videos, professional equipment is still necessary and makes a huge difference, and even just a lens hood makes a huge difference, but most people are happy to just have an easy and convenient to use phone and not have to worry about buying big expensive gear and going through the long process of learning how to use it and learning the technical side of photography.
