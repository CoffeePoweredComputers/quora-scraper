            "answer_text": "We should use renewable energy instead of fossil fuels because there is 5000 times more sunshine alone in any given year than all the energy, transportation, electricity etc, that humanity currently consumes. If you add in wind, biomass, hydro, geothermal, tide, current, wave, 4th generation nuclear and other forms of renewable energy and we have a resource that is not depletable. Only wind and solar and partly tidal are intermittent forms and provide power at times which often differ to demand. Storage of electricity and energy in general provides us another approach to taking the energy when its available, storing it and then feeding it into the grid, or a single house/factory when its needed. Such developments are now being installed all over the world and some communities in the world are already 100% renewable supplied, including 4 U.S. towns. Many more are seeing the light and committing to 100% sustainable economies which are entirely possible with current technology but getting incredibly attractive with some of the stuff coming down the pipe! Fossil fuels have brought us our current civilization, but they are also accruing negatives at a higher rate than ever before. Fossil fuels present us with externalities, or actual costs we don\u2019t pay directly. When we buy a gallon of gasoline, or use a ton of coal for example, we don\u2019t have to pay for the pollution directly. There are eight external costs to fossil fuels: Waste: When its finite and we use it with inefficient conversion methods\u2026.like 20% efficient cars, we create the heat but don\u2019t get all it promises us. Depletion: Oil gas coal and uranium are all finite. Maybe we started with 4 trillion barrels of oil in the ground. BP\u2019s annual Statistical Review shows how much of each we have remaining. With renewable energy however, there is no sell by date on the package. Geopolitics: Some nations have fossil fuel and others do not. Wars have been waged. Pollution: We are in the 6th major extinction of our planet and this time its we who are to blame by chemically polluting and invading our environment so much that major and minor species are on the way out faster than ever before. Health: Millions in the world die or suffer annually from complications due to the above pollution, especially from coal, but also weaker more vulnerable humans die from heat exposure, wider ranging diseases, migration etc. Subsidies: We pay far more subsidies to the oil gas and nuclear industries than is received by the renewable energy industry but guess which one we need most? Price Volatility: Feedstock logistics is the half of the energy business often not shared by renewable energy. We have to keep tons of coal coming to a power station with all the negatives that implies. With solar or wind there is no ton of sunshine or barrel of wind to buy or extract. Also when the economy is growing, so do the prices of energy commodities, oil gas and coal. As these prices climb they act as a governor or tax on the economy preventing it from full growth. An economy working on renewable energy however is not so restricted. Climate: Fossil fuels release CO2 in such quantities that the natural planetary sinks cannot keep up. So the ocean acidifies and coral reefs bleach and die off and ice in both poles melts and large icebergs that support upstream icebergs in Antarctica risk floating off to warmer waters. Wildfires, droughts, storms, hurricanes, tornadoes, ice melting, rising sea levels, changing ecosystems, spreading disease vectors, drunken forests, tipping points in ice to ocean albedo, methane release are all part of a picture that is now rushing at breakneck speed relative to how such changes have happened in history, all because mankind releases another 40 gigatons of CO2 into the atmosphere each year. Most of the time, this discussion concerns a single topic, say pollution or subsidies. The reality is once you see the damage from all angles, it becomes a screaming necessity for us to transition to a world where energy comes from other, non depletable, better priced, more healthy, less geopolitically contentious energy sources which leave our people in top physical health and maybe we ought to accelerate that process by subsidizing at least to level the playing field and give these desperately needed solutions the chance to show us how they can lead to a stronger economy.

            "answer_text": "We should be using more renewable power to reduce pollution and power carbon output. Currently the world wide demand for power is rapidly increasing. This is due to population, wealth, economic and industrial growth. Renewable energy is not able to supply this growing demand. And it needs to compete with cheap fossil fuels. Fossil fuels, coal and gas, may last for another 50 years and demand will increase. Political agreements will not stop demand and supply. Many governments still support the oil, coal and gas power. The fossil fuel industries have a lot of political support that they have developed for many years. And governments will find it hard to tax wind and solar power. Traditional power supplies have well developed infrastructure that does not suit renewable power. China has invested a large amount of money on renewable power but has cut back due to the fact they did not have power lines to support to move the power where it is needed. We need to consider all forms of low carbon power. That should include next generation nuclear power. Current nuclear power has a very good safety record despite media hype. Coal is far more dangerous and kill hundreds of times as many people. But current nuclear power still has safety concerns and needs huge amounts of investment and careful management. And current nuclear technology, Pressurised water reactors, PWR reactors using enriched Uranium are very wasteful. Producing large amounts of waste. Next generation nuclear power involves a variety of new nuclear technologies that may make nuclear power safer, cleaner, cheaper and more efficient. Also versatile and able to use many fuels apart from enriched Uranium. MSR reactors, molten salt reactors, are one type of reactor currently being developed. They can use a variety of fuels including nuclear waste, nuclear weapons material and mining waste as fuel. These reactor can be very efficient meaning they will actually reduce nuclear waste. Mainly as they do not use solid fuel rods that have a very limited lifespan and are disposed of while still containing useful Uranium fuel. Instead of fuel rods they can use the molten salt to carry the fuel and transport heat from the reactor core. Unlike solid fuel rods, the salt/ fuel mix can be rapidly removed from the reactor core without risk of melt down. Some designs will actually turn themselves off automatically without human intervention. The fuel salt can be drained into a safe containment tank. A number of new prototype reactors will be built over the next decade. Most of the development of next generation reactors will be in China and India that have rapidly growing demands for power. They also face pollution problems and have a well developed nuclear industry. Next generation nuclear should be considered as well as other renewable power sources. Currently that means development of prototype reactors to prove they are safe and efficient. This can give us time to develop renewable power or better energy sources. ",
