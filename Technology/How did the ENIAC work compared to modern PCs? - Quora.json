            "answer_text": "A modern PC stores its program in memory just like any other data. On the ENIAC, programs were stored on plugboards. The machine was programmed by physically plugging wires into holes to create the instructions. There was no such thing as an operating system. The computer was configured (programmed) to perform a specific computation, then started up and allowed to run. To run a different program, the plugboards had to be changed. ",
