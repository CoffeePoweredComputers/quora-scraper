            "answer_text": "Radiation suits are very uncommon, if we consider cobalt-60 sources then as the half thickness of lead is 12.5 mm then if we consider only covering the torso with a 400 x 400 x 12.5 mm sheet of lead for the front then this will weigh about 20 kilos. Now put on a back plate on the torso and you will have 40 kilos. Then add about 20 kilos more for protecting the person from the sides. Now even a bodybuilder will have a hard time running, climbing and working while wearing 60 kilos of armour. We need to also include the weight of other leaded garments designed to protect the groin and the long bones of the legs to try to save the bone marrow. We would be looking at maybe doubling the weight of Mr Average, for all this weight we will only get a protection factor of 2. Now with this great weight Mr Average will be slowed down such that he moves at less than half normal speed and takes more than twice as long to do tasks. As a result Mr Average will spend more time in the high radiation area which will more than offset the dose reduction caused by the leaded suit. Thus it is clearly not a good idea to have a leaded suit to try to protect against high energy gamma emitters. A better idea would be to build a box with a monumental amount of shielding and then put a worker inside this with a very thick leaded window. This is the reverse idea of a hot cell where you have about 3 meters of concrete / lead to shield you from what you are working on. During the Chernobyl event a Demag crane was used to lift a 20 ton bathyscaphe which is a box with a lot of lead. Workers would ride inside the bathyscaphe into the very bowels of the reactor wreckage to enable humans to enter the wreckage to explore it and supervise the process of building the object shelter. I have seen a photograph of one of the bathyscaphes. It looked like the tank off a large transformer which had been modified. Some people who are potentially exposed to low energy gamma photons / x-rays will choose to cover their torsos with a lead apron. For example glove box workers who handle large amounts of americium sometimes do this. Another solution is to fix a sheet of leaded glass to the glovebox which then shields the torsos of the workers without needing them to wear the lead aprons. Suits designed to prevent you getting radioactive contamination on your clothing, skin or inside your body are a lot more common but that it another story for another day. ",
