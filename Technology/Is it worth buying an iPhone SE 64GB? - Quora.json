            "answer_text": "Q: Is it worth buying an iPhone SE 64GB? A: Yes, it definitely is worth buying, in fact its the most popular new iPhone for me and my colleagues (we are all high tech engineers) in 2020 because its so good. The iPhone SE 2nd Edition (2020) features:The same CPU and GPU in the iPhone 11, so it delivers flagship performanceIt has the same camera as the main camera in the iPhone 11, so again, the camera delivers flagship performanceIt even can deliver portrait mode even though it only has one camera, because of the stupendously powerful Apple A13 SoC (CPU/GPU) which can calculate the portrait mode with a single camera, no smartphone has ever been this powerful nor been able to deliver this feature with a single camera, everThe size that we like, we are all used to out iPhone 6/iPhone 8 so we like the iPhone SE physical and display sizeIts only $399 USD which means that it is the very best deal ever seen in the smartphone market",

            "answer_text": "Sure but id rather lose out on 2 years of support life and get one of the iphone X variants. It might be the tiniest bit slower but you get a bigger battery newer design, more ram, maybe more storage and they just look alot better than the 2014 iphone 6 design. You can pick up an iphone X variant for around the same price. ",
