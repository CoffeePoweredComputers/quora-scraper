            "answer_text": " Distributing content ten or fifteen years ago is much easier compared today. With more than 3 million blog posts out there ,with thousands more being added every day, it\u2019s not enough to distribute your content the traditional way. Here are great tips from Business2Community for better content distribution. Share multiple times. Today, sharing your content once will nut cut it. You need a few tries to get to more audience. Agree to the number of times you need to share your content on your social media calendar. You can use a simple calendar, a spreadsheet or any app that you like to schedule your posts and reposts. Mention others. This method is old by now but it still works. BY mentioning them, companies will help you distribute and promote your content as it also benefits them. Link your posts to your social media profile. This can actually be done on Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn. It\u2019s an ingenious method of keeping a specific post sticky so that it remains on top of your timeline and the first thing visitors see in your profile. Share with employees. Why limit sharing your post with likes or followers of your company\u2019s social media account when you can include your employees themselves? Surely, your employees will have more than just one social media account. Tap them to help you distribute your content. Share on Social Bookmarking sites. Share your content on social bookmarking sites like Reddit, Inbound, GrowthHackers, and Bizsugar. Millions of users visit these channels every day and it\u2019s a great way to distribute content to specific sub-groups or sub-reddits. ",

            "answer_text": "That's actually a good question. Your Facebook friends probably care more about your mood, holiday photos and lolcats, than about interesting contents that are more specific. On the other hand, Twitter (and blogs, also) is a great medium for publishing content to a community of followers who expect consistent contributions over time, in terms of topics or style. Hashtags can help to broaden the visibility of your posts to interested people that don't follow you (yet), but they mainly exist for conferences and trending news topics / internet memes.Today, it is complicated to share one piece of content about a specific topic, to a relevant/interested community, if you've not put a lot of effort in building this community on this topic over time (e.g. blog/twitter).In response to that situation, several startups are developing interest-based communications tools, allowing you to tag the content you want to share, so that it's visible to people that are interested by the corresponding topic(s). Check out: chime.in, namesake, anybeat, and whyd (the startup I've been working with). In a way, quora is also an interest-based communication tool, except it was not made for sharing content but asking/answering questions.Hope this helps! ",
