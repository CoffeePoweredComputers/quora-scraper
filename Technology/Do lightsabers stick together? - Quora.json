            "answer_text": "Different sources vary about this. Some early comics mention blades \u201clocking\u201d to each other, while other, later sources say that blades do not lock to each other, but instead repel. From my point of view, as someone trained in a traditional longsword style, the fact that the movies never show anyone fighting from in the bind, binding with their opponent\u2019s blade and then thrusting, indicates that they do lock to each other. After all, why would you avoid an effective combat tactic if it can actually be done? So, my personal \u2018canon\u2019 is that lightsaber blades do \u201cstick\u201d. Specifically, that if you attempt to slide a lightsaber blade against another lightsaber blade, the interference that arises prevents you from moving it more than an inch or two, so you cannot effectively thrust from the bind with a lightsaber. Of course, the real answer to why they don\u2019t do this is because if they did, it would make for realistically short duels, not the long, impressive duels that the filmmakers want. ",
