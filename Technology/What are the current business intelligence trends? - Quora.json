            "answer_text": "Data is the new currency of the digital economy! . The total amount of data in the world was 4.4 zettabytes (1 ZB is 44 trillion GB) in 2013. Data is set to rise steeply to 44 ZB by 2020. This sharp rise in data will be driven by rapidly growing daily production of data. To put it in perspective, 2.5 Exabytes are produced every day which is equivalent to 530,000,000 million songs. According to Cisco, Global IP traffic will increase nearly threefold over the next five years. Overall, IP traffic will grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 22 percent from 2015 to 2020. The technology trends data are driving this exponential growth are a combination of Internet of Things (IoT), Machine/Deep Learning, Mobile/Wearable Devices/Apps, and Cognitive Computing. The challenge is that, all these technology trends are converging and creating a perfect storm in this Digital Universe. The volume of data continues to double every three years as information pours in from digital platforms, wireless sensors, and billions of mobile phones. This causes some challenges, but it also presents incredible business opportunities. Their are several disruptive models in data analytics which industries can take advantage of. We will pick healthcare as an example and the disruptive models that it can take advantage of: \u2022 Orthogonal data, which is getting fresh types of data to augment domain data, such as combining travel and health data to assess medical risk before travelling \u2022 Radical personalization which could be incorporating the behavioral, genetic, and molecular data connected with many individual patients \u2022 Enhanced decision making by preventing medical errors by getting more data points from new sources to improve validation and adding automated algorithms. An example of dis could be a doctor who could make better decisions by combining data sources from lab work, data from wearables and correlation with predictive analytic algorithms.
