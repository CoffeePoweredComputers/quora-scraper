            "answer_text": "Neither, because both of them are fairly low-quality consumer-grade hardware, which isn\u2019t durable enough for use in cars. The main limitation I would expect you to hit is temperature - both boards are rated to a max operating temperature of 85\u00b0C (185\u00b0F). Even if you put those electronics inside your car, away from the engine, the heater that\u2019s under your dash can easily get hot enough to damage them. There are some projects to use Arduino boards to do inexpensive car modifications (Speeduino, for example) but those projects assume that you are okay with installing hardware that might just completely fail at some point. Auto manufacturers are supposed to use hardware that will last as long as the car. ",
