            "answer_text": "First of all you have to find a problem. For example you live in pre industrial era and ships are still moving by using wind as a source of power. You are interested in mechanics so you try to make it better. You take a problem and you take it to your desk and place. After hours you got an idea. You plan that you need to build a sort of a powering platform that would automatically use oars to power a boat. So you take your books and, search. You search for weeks even months. Finally you stumble upon a very archaic even ancient notes about usage of steam. It is true as Greeks built and documented a ball with holes on two sides pointing opposite directions. The ball was filled with water and put over fire. Steam was going through the holes and making the ball spin. You take that piece of information and think. You make assumptions you plan things again. You think \u201c what if I put a water container over fire and by pipes I will transport steam to powder many mechanical devices.\u201d You make a first prototype. It's bulky it's heavy it nearly breaks by itself. You show it to public but it fails. But you have an interest of an investor. So, with his help you fix problems upgrade your design and after some months again try it and put it on a ship. Steam flies through pipes. Ship moves. Success. You made a steam engine. Over years it makes it's way to factories, trains are constructed and you have changed a world. Of course this course of action could be more simple as other technologies are simplier but here it is. That's how you learn new technology. ",
