            "answer_text": "Enjoy ourselves with Augmented Reality (AR) gaming and entertainment! I think some the the Virtual Reality (VR) technology I have tried is really fun. But it is so closed off and completely immersive for the user. The new and exciting possibilities with AR is completely amazing. The system is a gaming device that looks like a bulky pair of glasses. However the user wears the glasses sees a new (Augmented) reality in front of them. The program takes into account the surroundings and the user and incorporates that into the experience. Wow! Cool! Imagine in the comfort of your own living room fighting a ninja warrior or walking out into your back yard and a bunch virtual soldiers from WWII are charging at you? Play a fake baseball game or a replay a game with a mix of some real and some fake players?!?! AR will bring in the excitement and social aspect of real life interactions with the addition of computer generated graphics viewed through see thru glasses! Some of the stuff I have seen is truly amazing. ",

            "answer_text": "I believe that virtual reality will become a more integral part of our daily life. It will make it possible for us to work more remotely (instead of an office). It could also change the way kids go to school\u2014maybe they stay at home, and log into a classroom on their headset, rather than leaving. Virtual reality will change the way we consume media: suddenly songs will have a rich, visual context. Movies will become an immersive experience into another world. Our social media will be something we can enter, not just scroll through on a smart phone. Right now, virtual reality seems kind of like an expensive, \u201ctechy\u201d experience. But we forget that the iPhone was perceived the same way, until the technology got better, the price dropped, and it revolutionized what phones could be for the average consumer. The first iPhone dropped 10 years ago. ",
