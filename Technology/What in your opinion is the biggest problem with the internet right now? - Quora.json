            "answer_text": "Even though I\u2019m supposed to be answering the above question, I just feel I should point something out that\u2019s very important for people to know (probably a lot of people already know). As much as it seems like there is a problem with the internet, I really don\u2019t think there is. It may sound like a shock to some of you reading this, but the reason I say that is because the internet cannot do anything on its own except what it is programmed to do.  The internet is just an instrument, and what it can do, whether positive or negative, it depends on who wields this instrument. Imagine you have a pencil in your hand, if you are an artist, you can use that pencil to draw a picture that people will appreciate. But what if you are an angry person full of violence? Then you\u2019ll see that pencil, not as an instrument of art, but a weapon. The tool as the pencil, which can be used to make some of the most mesmerizing arts appreciated by people, can also be referred to as the murder weapon in most criminal cases. The internet is also treated that way today, just like every other instrument. I believe by now, you get my point. The internet has no problem, but people are. It offers the same possibilities both to those who have an evil intension as well as those with good intentions, While one person can use the internet to educate and make information readily accessible, another person can use it to deceive, propagate, fear, or use it for other selfish reasons. The internet is created that way. It\u2019s just an instrument. I gave some good thoughts to the question of what the internet biggest problem is, and after some time of thinking, It became clear to me that we are asking the wrong question. It\u2019s like saying, \u201cWhat is the biggest problem with the pencil.\u201d Well, I will say it is accessible to anybody. I believe that will be the same answer to the above question. Accessibility. Now the issue will be, is accessibility supposed to be a problem? Long-time ago, people believed the lack of information was the cause of widespread ignorance. Today, I think the internet eradicated that idea. Now there is the accessibility to free information. But I strongly don\u2019t believe the internet is to be blamed, but people. The same internet that simplifies the job acquiring process is also what gives access to pornography that people have become addicted to.  The internet, in a simple term, is like a highway that gives access to content people already are willing to share. If you say accessibility is the problem, then the best solution is to stay away from it. Why, because if you cut out accessibility, then there\u2019s no internet. The intention behind the creation of the internet is to breach the gap between people and information. The internet is a way people express themselves by the content they share or look for. It\u2019s a market place that runs 24/7 on steroids. I may be wrong, but this is my opinion about the internet. What you choose to do with the internet is up to you. The internet doesn\u2019t have a mind of its own. Now, having said all that, take a look at this link for some relevant information. These are about companies who take advantage of the Internet to provide something good for society: Blog | Thinkmobiles  ",

            "answer_text": "One of the biggest issues with Internet use today is privacy. There are not a lot of opportunities to remain private online, so a lot of your personal information is out there online for the world to see. This can be disconcerting at times, especially when you have googled yourself to see your address next to your name along with your phone number. The internet does not allow for a lot of privacy these days, a lot of websites track your every movement. There is not much that can be done about that, however, there are a few steps you may want to take. These include the following: Block cookies. These allow websites to keep you logged in and track you. Blocking them may impact how you can use their website, however.Use an adblocker. These block trackers and can even block cookies from certain websites for you. You can personalize how you want these to block ads for you.Use a VPN. These allow you to block your location from being shared with websites. When you use a VPN, it mimics a different location from a different state, or even country, and makes it look like you are there instead of where you actually are. This allows for better privacy.Keep in mind, adblockers and VPNs can block targeted advertisements, which can be a blessing. Unless you like being advertised things you like, use an adblocker to block ads and trackers (these are free) and a VPN to block your location (these can be free or pay). Blocking cookies sometimes works, however it may impact the website\u2019s functionality. With data breaches being imminent no matter the company, you also need to keep your private information, well, private. Decide whether or not it really is important to share that personal information of yours with that one company. Because you never know who is next for a data breach. ",
