            "answer_text": "After reading your comment, it sounds to me like the best way to do combat this person from hacking into your things is to talk to them, and if they won't listen then maybe the two of you need to go to counseling. It sounds like there are much bigger issues than just your phone and laptop being hacked, and I can tell you right now that even if you had a super secure phone and a super secure laptop the problems wouldn't stop. Then she would just get mad at you for securing your devices and assuming that you are hiding something. I've seen this happen to a lot of people, and it is never good. If you really want to do something involving technology, I guess the best thing to do would be to take your phone and your laptop to the repair shop and see if they can find and remove any spyware that may be on it. I mean you could probably do that yourself, but if you're here asking how I'm guessing that it might be more trouble than it's worth for you to do it yourself so going to a pro might be helpful. If you don't want to spend the money then just a quick google search on how to find and remove spyware and key loggers should do the trick. From there just put a password lock on your devices. But I do not recommend this course of action as I think that it will likely worsen the problem. I honestly think it sounds like there are a lot of underlying problems here that you and your wife need to work through together. Good luck and I wish you two the best. ",
