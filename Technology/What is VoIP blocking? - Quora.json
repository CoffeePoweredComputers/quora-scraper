            "answer_text": "Many places do not allow VoIP calling and therefore they place restrictions on VoIP services. To block VoIP one has to block the ports that the system needs to operate. VoIP blocking is mainly because in many places telecom companies want to boost their own revenue and VoIP is a serious challenge to that. In many cases due to the encrypted service of VoIP, it is regulated and restricted by government for security purposes. Apart from these 2 major causes, there are isolated cases like in any hotel where they block the VoIP ports to make the guests use their chargeable telephone service.

Usually, foreign countries who want people to use their national telecommunications service to place expensive international calls, use this practice. But instead of paying the high-fees for calls, use a VoIP tunnel that allow calls to be rerouted around the firewalls. This refers to secure way to place a VoIP call using an encoded SIP protocol. ",
