            "answer_text": "Who said Steve Jobs was not good at anything? Have you ever seen his presentations? I will agree that he was not a programmer, he was not an electrical engineer. He had a limited knowledge in that. He was a visionary, he had this awesome dedication towards work that nobody had. The programmers can be great the electrical engineers can be great. But you need a guy who can show you the path. Who can predict what the world would be after 10 years. There is this term coined for Steve Jobs 'Reality Distortion Field' he would put you in a situation that sometimes he woukd tell you that the sky is green and you would believe that yeah the sky is greean for sometime. He had a major impact in the computing world. He changed the whole psyche of the computing industry. Before Steve Jobs the computer were big fat ugly. He always believed that the computers should be an extension of your self. They should be seductive. He saw that the Music players will not be like the present ones so he came up with the iPod. The phones need to be changed so the iPhone. And many more great products.  If you have to choose a man who has mostly influenced the computing industry it has to be Steven Paul Jobs. ",

            "answer_text": "Hello Amogha, Sorry to disagree with that statement! I can\u2019t believe Steve Jobs wasn\u2019t good at anything! He just had his mind at the right places and dared to dream and DREAM BIG! Success touches those who follow their heart and persist and keep moving in that direction. He had a vision to take a company to a place where no one thought of at that time! Why wouldn\u2019t he be successful then? You know what he was good at? He always had a clear vision as to where he wanted Apple to beHe took setbacks in his stride and turned it into an opportunityHe took the Contrarian approach which in business or life always worksHe was fearless in whatever he did and so always dreamed BIGHe fought his illness positively and came back with a bangHe overcame his personal lows and still did what he wanted toI can go on and on\u2026But I rest my case\u2026You want to know what was his biggest strength? His ATTITUDE! That\u2019s the recipe of his success\u2026 Dream Big :) Anu Krishna ",
