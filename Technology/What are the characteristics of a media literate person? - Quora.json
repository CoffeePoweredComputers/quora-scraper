            "answer_text": "I think a \u201cmedia literate\u201d person is someone with an open mind, someone willing to listen to every side of an issue. This doesn\u2019t mean he/she has to have such an open mind that his/her brains fall out. Some ideas and positions make sense to an intelligent person and some do not. And it\u2019s up to you to discriminate between truths and falsehoods, A media literate person is someone who READS a diverse number of publications and entertains many different points of view. I recommend the website, \u201cReal Clear Politics\u201d which everyday links readers to something like 15 different articles which express both liberal and conservative points of view. If you take the time to READ, you can become media literate. Reading can enable you to develop something scholars call \u201ccritical thought\u201d. That means that all the reading you have done has developed your mind enough for it to engage in rational thinking, that you\u2019ve developed the ability to discriminate between what does and does not make sense. As you read, you are likely to notice that some writers are extremely unfair. Their works are polemical and full of hate. They are like screaming at you. As your powers of discernment grow, you will be attracted to writers and speakers who carefully explain their points of view and develop a rational and persuasive way of making their case. You probably will not be attracted to \u2018news\u2019 which is hysterical, emotional and full of unwarranted accusations and libels. I happen to be a conservative, and one of the clearest thinkers I\u2019ve encountered is Thomas Sowell, pictured here:  ",

            "answer_text": "Media literate person knows the influence of the information to the minds and can manage with it. He or she can stop reading or listening news for making the silence around him-/herself and not to worry he or she misses something very important, because there isn't important. When this person needs information, his or her question is exact, well-constructed. The literate person can ask such a way to find all needed, to search with well-organized and trained vision of text structure. He or she has got tools for comprehensive reading, skilled not to accept all but as a membrane let the useful go through emotional line, getting rid of empty or harm. The main trait of the media literate person - to be able to divide him-/herself from the information influence, staying out of emotions. ",
