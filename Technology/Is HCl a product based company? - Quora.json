            "answer_text": "Though HCL is primarily regarded as a service based company, it has it's own product division. It is called HCL Products & Platforms. HCL is investing a lot of money in this new product division. Currently HCL is managing over 50 Enterprise grade products. Most of these products are originally IBM products, but as part of IBM and HCL partnership, these have come to HCL. One more thing I want to point out is that, there is no such thing as service or product company. There are product companies which have a lot of service related projects, such as Oracle. Also, there are so called Service companies which have their own product division such as HCL and Infosys. So, in the end it doesn't matter, whether you work in IT services or product. What really matters is the project you are working on. ",
