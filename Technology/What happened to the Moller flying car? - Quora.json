            "answer_text": "Maybe not for you, but for others who would like to know a little more of the background to this car:  Paul Moller\u2019s Flying Car A former University of California professor of aeronautical and mechanical engineering, Paul Moller, hopes to fly in an aircraft that will take off and land vertically, cruise at almost 300 knots, and carry four, and that will demand very little skill of its operator. He foresees that two decades from now some lucky venture capitalist will be selling these at the rate of 100,000 a year. Moller has dubbed his design Volantor, a word which he uses as both a proper and a common noun and a verb as well. Since 1965 Moller has built a series of volantors\u2014using the word in its generic sense\u2014that employ ducted fans to lift them off the ground. He himself recently flew an eight-engine machine, the M200, tethered to an overhead crane. Before the eyes and cameras of reporters he ascended to a height from which one could not safely fall; the M200 was under control; the tether was slack. Obviously, Moller was willing to put his mouth where his money was. In the current model, the M400, the axes of the ducted fans are horizontal rather than vertical. The significance of this change is that whereas its precursors were intended to show that a number of small ducted fans could keep a machine airborne, this craft is actually intended to show that once airborne, it can go somewhere. The M400 Volantor is powered by eight air-cooled 150-hp Wankel rotaries, two to a duct. The ducts flank the fuselage, two fore and two aft; a single wing of modest area perches above the rear fuselage, well aft of the center of gravity. The front fan shrouds, which have a slight positive incidence, are supposed to serve as a canard surface in aerodynamically supported flight. The machine vectors its thrust by moving cascades of flexible vanes in the slipstream of the ducted fans. For takeoff, the vanes bend 90 degrees and thrust is vectored upward; for transition to cruise, the vanes move forward in curved slots and straighten out, gradually shifting the thrust to the horizontal. Above 100 knots or so, the vanes are aligned with the slipstream and the machine is supported mainly by aerodynamic lift. The commands to the servomotors operating the vanes come not from the pilot but from a computer that mediates both stability and control in the VTOL mode. The Volantor will fly by wire; as Moller envisions it, rather than directly control power and attitude to climb (for example) as we do in current aircraft, one would dial in a climb rate and for-ward speed, and the aircraft, within the limits of its flight envelope, would oblige. Moller foresees fleets of volantors operating like taxicabs under the control of ground-based computers; in fact, he proposes them as a replacement for buses and subways. Perhaps, 50 years from now, Moller\u2019s name will be mentioned alongside those of Whittle and Sikorsky. Listen to Moller give a TED presentation on his flying car: My dream of a flying car ",

Interestingly, they appear to have had an FAA-registered aircraft on the books since 2005; see FAA Registry - Aircraft - N-Number Inquiry.   Maybe the upwelling of interest in unmanned aviation and the flight control stabilization systems needed to make it simpler will have some bleedover effect into Moller's venture.  There are still the problems of (1) power; (2) safety (if power is lost); and (3) efficiency to solve, and I don't think they're likely to be solved for the foreseeable future.  Still, the world is richer for its dreamers... ",
