            "answer_text": "A CPU is the central component of a device that executes the instructions in a program or OS. Have a bit of dry, boring, geek talk: Central processing unit - Wikipedia It explains what is considered a CPU. One of the examples in the article is that the first computer ENIAC, didn\u2019t really have a CPU, every instruction and action was hardwired into the machine and it had to be rewired to perform a different function, there was no central processing unit that was running a program. Well the two most obvious CPUs are the ones made by Intel (pentium, celeron, I series) and AMD (Duron, Athlon, Ryzen). IBM produces its own CPUs for their mainframe systems. One you might not be aware of is a company called ARM, they produce the CPUs (Cortex/Snapdragon) for those nifty little smart cellphones everyone is carrying around these days. Your desktop computer is NOT a CPU, it contains a CPU but it is not a CPU in and of itself. Same thing for your smartphone, it contains a CPU, but it is NOT a CPU in and of itself. ",
