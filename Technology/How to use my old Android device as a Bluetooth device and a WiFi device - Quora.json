Rather, use it to play games, read books or even play the radio so you don\u2019t have to clutter up your computer while working. Prepare Your WiFi-Only Device To start off we need to make it so that your phone is ready to become a WiFi only device. Sometimes you might have problems connecting to WiFi or using any of the functions on your phone because it still has old data that connects your phone to past wireless provider. Here are some tips to get started: Tip 1 Turn on Airplane mode and enable the WiFi connection on your phone. Airplane mode turns off all wireless network access.  Tip 2 Make sure your WiFi connection is running properly in your home or office by trying out other devices on the connection. Tip 3 Go to Settings > Network and uncheck the Data option. Then also uncheck the Roaming option. This also removes data connections that are lingering. This varies depending on your device, so search for the Settings area and locate the Network or Wireless option. Keep clicking through until you find the Roaming option.  Tip 4 Go to Manage Apps on your phone, select the Play Store and delete the entire cache if you are having problems with lingering data connections. Tip 5 Make sure you have a Google Play Store Account in order to download games and apps. Tip 6 Complete a factory reset to clear everything out and feel free to try a launcher or ROM if you want to change the look and feel of your phone.  Tip 7 Turn off the data connection on the phone.  Method 1: Use the Old Phone as a Radio One of the best ways to use your old Android phone is to turn it into a radio. ",
