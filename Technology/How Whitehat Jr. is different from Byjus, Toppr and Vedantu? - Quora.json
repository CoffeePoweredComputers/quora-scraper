            "answer_text": "Nothing much difference between all the above. The culture in Byju\u2019s and WhitehatJr is the same and in fact, many employees have been hired from Byju\u2019s. Both Byju\u2019s and WhiteHatJr are a partner in crime. Below is the inside view of WhiteHatJr, which is almost identical for Byju\u2019s too. Byju is been dragged to court by its own employees and customer for misguiding employees and harassment of client. The day is not far that the top management of WhiteHatJr has to face the same music. WhiteHat-jr these days are making lots of money (INR 3 Cr in a day across the globe) on daily basis by fooling parents not only on in India but in the USA and now they will be starting the same in A&NZ region too. The salespeople working here are kids in their early or mid-twenties who are forced to sell the curriculum to parents. Nowadays, Whitehat-jr is hiring in bulk almost 300 candidates in a week. They want to cash into the opportunity of the pandemic by selling some unapproved courses to parents. Do we know the reality behind this curriculum that they are selling !!!! The teachers whom they hire are not qualified in the first place. The hiring process is absurd and they hire anyone who is ready to teach. They don't have a defined teaching process. The teachers who are not qualified are told to create their own way of teaching, which at times is illogical and many times copied from an open-source like Google and other platforms, the software that they use are pirated and it stops working after few classes\u2026 I have myself experienced this and unfortunately have to come out in open to help parents save their hard earn money. \u201cPLEASE DON\u2019T INVEST YOUR HARD EARN MONET WITH WHITEHATJR\u2019S CURRICULUM; Talking about the inside of WhiteHat-Jr; the employees are under lots of stress of not getting paid properly and been told to harass parents who enquire and later don\u2019t buy the curriculum. I Would like to share a small incidence of employees been harassed in this time of the pandemic. I would like to share many instances of unhappy employees. They are been harassed by leaders like anything. First, they make employees work for 15 hours at a stretch and no week offs for 2 weeks at a stretch. Second, the salespeople are forced to push the products down to the throat of parents. Salespeople are told to abuse parents if they deny subscribing to the curriculum. I have been working now for almost 4 months and wanted to vent this out to the public. They also have a very bad policy of \"Hire and Fire\". Post they hire candidates, after the induction of a few days, they put candidates in an OJT(On-Job-Training) where they are told to achieve a target in 3 days or 10 days and if they don't achieve they tell the candidate to resign. They don't provide any training to candidates and directly push them to achieve targets from day one, which is pathetic. I had referred 5 of my good friends for the sales role opportunity, who had a good experience in sales and BPO industry in the past, however, all of them were told to resign for not achieving the given target in OJT. One of my friends now is in severe depression after he was told to resign. He joined as he wanted to make a career and support his family. These people are cruel, unprofessional, unethical. The entire process is a big blunder. Third, the incentive which they lure candidates for joining is nothing but a fake promise. They will say that 95% of employees easily get a huge incentive. However, that is not the case. Hardly 10% of employees will get some incentive, not the complete part. Fourth, the salary release by them is never on time and have lots and loads of discrepancy. They won't pay for the money promised as per the offer letter and will always delay the process of the promised payment. Lastly below is the mail sent by our team members today(Yes we are a team of 50 people who are witness to the inhuman behavior and the unethical practice which is been forced by the leaders). The below mail was accepted by the CEO and he has asked for improvement from his leaders and directors. \" Dear Sir, We trust that despite the uncertainty that has become an underlying theme of our lives, you are keeping well. We, your employees, write this email escalating our concern at the workplace. We write this email to raise the collective concerns of your employees, us, with respect to keeping the camera on whilst working from home. We understand, that these times are unprecedented. Having had been loyal employees for WhiteHat Jr. we have given our time and effort to what we would like to call our home. We respect and look up to your vision, acumen, leadership, and foresight that has helped this company blossom. But the current changing situations at the workplace are alarming. We know that you are a peoples person and are very occupied but we have been deliberating to escalate this concern to you We do not know if you are aware, but a good number of us are being asked to keep our cameras/webcams on during the entire shift whilst working from home. We understand that this helps in accountability but the dangers of constant supervision, privacy, fear of being watched, and recorded outweigh the minimal benefit that it may offer. We feel like we are being watched at all times, this not only hampers our creativity but exposes the sensitivities of our private life to the workplace. Thus, also hampering the work-life balance too. For example, A mother, working for the salesforce, before feeding her infant has to check her camera twice. A son, working for HR, has to check his camera before his sister or mother wants to enter the room. Again, we do not know if you are aware but certain team leaders, managers are stressing that the cameras be kept on at all times, from morning 10:00 am till beyond usual working hours, ranging till 09:30 am pm. Which we think is absolutely unreasonable. We already have targets to meet, which we have been meeting and surpassing wilfully but the idea of being watched only hampers that. Hence, we request you to probe into this matter and take prompt action. We, collectively, choose not to name anyone, because we do not want to bring anyone to task. But after long weeks of consideration, we write this email to you!\" I hope you will resolve our collective concerns!\u201d Regards,Your employees (WhiteHat-Jr) ",

            "answer_text": "Well, I want to share my experience of opting 8 classes introductory course from WhiteHat Jr. for my Son Rehan (class 6th). I am a java and oracle specialist, whenever sometimes I do my official work at home my son observes me coding very curiously and asks so many questions about changes moving on the screen with change in syntax again and again. I was able to comprehend his concerns and queries. Though my son is good in studies I didn\u2019t want him to go for Byju, toppr or vedantu etc because it will again lead him to be in same school curriculum thing whereas I want him to get indulge in something interesting which he can possess as his passion in coming future. Therefore, being a coder I was searching something best for my son which will help him to boost up his interest In something different from his monotonous school schedule and finally I found WhiteHat Jr. the best platform for him to opt to resolve his queries. As I know what is the future of coding in the coming era of technology, I just utilize his vacations by engaging him with WhiteHat Jr. mini program to make him familiar with coding syntax and unravel his queries about coding. EFFECTIVE CLASSROOM MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES and skillful instructors at online sessions of WhiteHat Jr. makes me wonder that after completing an introductory part of coding he was competent enough to design his own running calculation programs with concept of OOPS. Further now he is not limited to books only he is becoming more fluent with creative use of technology for his betterment and knowledge with a beautiful phenomenon to understand coding with the help of examples in your surroundings. It was required by me to maintain a balance in a way between his school assignments and extracurricular activity so that he should not lack interest in any one of them. Lastly, this feeling is matchless when your kids converse with you in your language. I would love to pass on my experiences to him as he is getting into the stream of coders. ",

            "answer_text": "The very first thing, do not confuse WhiteHat Jr. online platform with any other platforms. I researched about WhiteHat Jr. and figured out that this platform focuses solely on providing coding learning packages to the kids. Now, if you look at the other platforms like Byjus, Toppr, and Vedantu; they impart online coaching for academic subjects. So, WhiteHat Jr. is different with other platforms. If you are looking forward to helping your kid in learning coding from the tender ages of his life, then WhiteHat Jr. is the right choice for this purpose. According to it, the minds of kids of ages 5-6 are the most-creative. So, kids of this age can grasp the difficult concepts of coding very easily. Hence, WhiteHat Jr. offers an engaging curriculum for kids of ages 6-14. Also, WhiteHat Jr. does not limit their teachings to coding only. Rather, they have expanded their domains, and impart quality education on games development, mobile app development, and other relevant niches as well. Their online coding class is an excellent facility offered by them. Unlike the traditional teaching styled schools, this facility will ensure that every kid receives equal attention from the faculties, and none of them lags. Another facility offered by WhiteHat Jr., which grabbed my attention as well, is the option of attending trial sessions. Before enrolling kids to this platform, parents can cross-check their staff and the style of imparting education in trial sessions. I would recommend all the parents to join the trial sessions before making any final decision. If you find the teaching to be satisfactorily good, then only decide on enrolling your kid to the platform. WhiteHat Jr. is working on a different niche than Byjus, Toppr, and Vedantu. However, all the platforms are experts in their corresponding domains. ",

            "answer_text": "WhiteHat Jr. is way different from Byjus, Toppr, and Vedantu \u2013 although the three are very similar to each other. I looked into these options and a few more when searching for good online classes for my kids. It took me quite a while to make a decision since honestly, all of them have something good to offer. First, you must understand the main difference of WhiteHat Jr. from the three others. Byjus, Toppr, and Vedantu offer a wide range of classes, curriculums/courses. That\u2019s very good, yes. But, if you want your child to learn coding, then WhiteHat Jr. is the number 1 place you can go. Have you heard of the figure of speech, \u201cJack of all trades, master of none\u201d? That\u2019s how I came up with my decision to go for WhiteHat Jr. It specializes in coding classes from beginner to professional level. So the focus is on coding only, which means you can expect experts to teach your child. Students here learn from some of the best in the industry, even better there are live one-on-one sessions so it wouldn\u2019t be hard to keep up when the student fails to understand one lesson or another. He or she can always ask! Well obviously, if your child is interested in another course and not coding, then WhiteHat Jr. might not be the perfect choice for you. But if you\u2019re asking this question about WhiteHat Jr. because you have already learned that they do have coding classes and so do the other three, then I can confidently say that WhiteHat Jr. would be your better choice. My kids like their classes so far and I\u2019m hoping that they can get to a professional level in the near future. WhiteHat Jr. gave them the freedom to be creative and learn coding, which in my opinion is challenging and difficult at times, but they\u2019re having fun and enjoying their classes! ",

            "answer_text": "Byjus, Toppr, and Vedantu; all are renowned ones in the services that they provide for children. I have heard many parents and children talking about these online platforms. If we talk about Whitehat Jr. then it is the online platform, especially for coding. It primarily focuses on imparting coding education to the kids of 6-14 years of age whereas other platforms are great in teaching academic courses, and house expert faculties for the purpose as well. But if you are looking for platforms for computer language for kids, then Whitehat Jr. online platform is the answer for you. Whitehat Jr. offers a completely different programming curriculum to its students that keeps the kids engaged in coding for a longer duration. The kids do not feel like joining yet another school while learning coding at Whitehat Jr. Kids are often seen as taking up coding as a hobby after enrolling with this platform. Interestingly, their coding classes ensure that every kid is under light, and equally taken care of by the faculties. The faculties at Whitehat Jr. are expert in their niches, and can professionally train your kids to become efficient programmers in the future. They even provide a demo class for kids in which parents can also take part. I think this is a great tool in knowing the teaching methodology of the platform. You can make a wise decision of payment only after experiencing the exact teaching pattern of the platform. I am unsure about how to make registrations for the trial sessions. Maybe you will have to make early booking as the trial slots might be limited in number. If you are strictly looking for coding classes, then Whitehat Jr. can serve you and for academic ones, you can choose anyone from Byjus, Vedantu, and Toppr. ",

Edtech sites are those which provide education on online platform. So all these sites are Edtech that are providing online classes to kids on various subjects. Now coming to the question, the main difference between all these is that Byju\u2019s, Vedantu and Toppr provide classes on the subjects related to the educational curriculum provided by the schools. They provide online classes and video tutorials on subjects like geography, mathematics, science, etc. While Whitehat Jr. is an Edtech startup founded in 2018 to provide 1:1 interactive classes to kids from 6 to 14 years on coding. These courses are not a part of the school curriculum, they add up a tech skill in your kids.

            "answer_text": "I don\u2019t have much information about Byjus, Toppr, and Vedantu except that they\u2019re all EdTech institutions based in India. I\u2019m sure there are plenty of others who would share information about them here. I only know about WhiteHat Jr because I did a lot of research about them a while ago before I decided to enroll my sons there. WhiteHat Jr is an online coding school. But it isn\u2019t your typical online school that has a classroom-style setup with several students in one class. Group video calling doesn\u2019t even happen there. It\u2019s all one-on-one. This is something that I liked about WhiteHat Jr. I didn\u2019t find this feature or offer in most of the other Ed-Techs I saw online. The benefit of one-on-one lessons is that the students won\u2019t be too shy or embarrassed to ask questions especially those queries they have that might make them look like a below-average learner, when in fact, they\u2019re not. The teachers of WhiteHat Jr are super friendly and knowledgeable. My sons would ask them endless questions and they would patiently answer. Also, they have the full WhiteHat Jr curriculum available online. Other online schools seem to only show a portion of their curriculum until you enroll and pay up. WhiteHat Jr enables the parents and students to know in advance what to expect. They may even join trial sessions that are completely free before enrollment. Those trial sessions won\u2019t lock you into any commitment to pay and enroll. I found out about WhiteHat Jr through another forum site where parents would discuss online learning and distance learning amidst the Corona Virus issue. Just like our family, many have decided to make the kids stay home. They now have plenty of extra time. My sons are both interested in coding. They were more than happy when I told them about WhiteHat Jr. ",

            "answer_text": "While Bjyus and Toppr are well-established ed-tech platforms, Vedantu is relatively new to the market and WhiteHat Jr. was recently acquired by Byjus for $300 million. WhiteHat Jr. also raised about $10 million in funding from various investors worldwide. In very simple terms, what makes WhiteHat Jr. different is the very service they offer- although all platforms cater to school students, WhiteHat Jr. is exclusively for imparting coding skills to children between the age of 6 and 14, or up to Class 12. The syllabus and course material is unique, the activities and projects are engaging and innovative, and the students learn coding by doing (since classes are one-on-one live coding sessions, where the student is guided by an instructor). The teachers are experienced and come from top positions from their respective fields. The curriculum is divided into five sections based on the student\u2019s age and level of understanding, and covers everything from basic concepts like variables and loops, up to Artificial Intelligence, Ethics of Data, Data Science and the Internet of Things. I have enrolled my son in classes of both WhiteHat Jr. and Byjus, and he thoroughly enjoys attending classes as per his convenience. While both platforms help him supplement his school studies and schoolwork, he is also able to pursue additional projects as part of WhiteHat Jr. The classes have deepened his interest in coding, and he worked on a project of his own during the summer vacation. He designed an app with a practical application, under the guidance of a teacher from WhiteHat Jr. Meet These Indian Coders As Young As Six Who Are Shaping Up A Powerful Digital Future If your child is keen on coding or learning how to code, or you would like to see if your child is interested, I would recommend trying out WhiteHat Jr.\u2019s free trial class. If you would prefer something that caters to all subjects, then all the platforms you mentioned have good reviews and testimonials! I hope this helps! ",

            "answer_text": "In my opinion, WhiteHat Jr is entirely different from Byjus, Toppr, and Vedantu in the goals and teaching styles. WhiteHat Jr is a specialized Ed-tech platform focused on kids programming. WhiteHat jr offers a 1:1 online live class where an instructor will guide kids through the course. But BYJU'S, Toppr and Vedantu are mainly tutorial-based platform where a teacher explain about a certain topic of science, commerce, GRE, GRE, JEE, IAS, IB exam and so on.

            "answer_text": "All are Educational Startup companies that have been started with the sole motive of reaching to young minds, impacting their lives and making them more aware of the resources they have around them . Whether its Whitehat Jr. , Topper, Byju's or Vedantu, every organization's primary motto is to make your kids aware about the knowledge that exists , at times this format helps people since they have courses of what they like at their fingertips whenever they want, wherever they like. VEDANTU has been focusing on all the aspects of study as in Courses pf regular study of std 10-12 , competitive examinations, as well as coding in recent times. Byju's also had the same motive. However White hat jr. focuses specifically only on Coding and have a very organized curriculum designed to aid young coders in their job. Vedantu and Topper have also tried to start coding classes online but White hat jr. seems truly devoted to kids who want to code only. No, wonder seeing the current market situation, they'll take courses on other subjects too. But as of now White hat jr. seems truly devoted to young coders. They have a very organised curriculum if you'll follow and see that is solely devoted to Coding. Different people have worked on it for a long time, a long research was done before coming along with such a curriculum by Whitehat jr. 90% of primary schools don't have coding in their syllabus and they thought it\u2019s the need of the hour and practical case study to bring about coding courses too. Vedantu, Topper and Byju\u2019s aspire the same but they are more of an everyday classroom and learning process and are less devoted to coding. The matter of fact that you've asked how White hat jr. is different from these organisations,truly conveys that you've been looking for a platform to learn coding. I guess I answered you question. Happy exploring. Make your choices wisely. Great day !!  ",

            "answer_text": "Whitehat Jr., Byjus, Toppr and Vedantu are great platforms in their own ways you just have to check what you want and which amongst all is satisfying your requirements. Unique and enormous options are available around to teach online to kids. Like all sizes of clothes don\u2019t fit to everyone likewise different platforms may suit distinct people. Creators of these platforms are not only investing money in designing although vast research and long span of time have been contributed to build up these kinds of projects to vest and prepare creators of tomorrow. It\u2019s not about positives and negatives of platforms rather it\u2019s only about in what manner it is unique and suitable to us as per our requirements. Like amongst all I found Whitehat Jr is best for my child because I found it suitable in sense of programming curriculum, teaching pattern, flexible timings, individualized teaching approach, refund, costing, etc. My major concern was if they would be carrying recorded teaching sessions to teach children but fortunately, they are following live teaching methodology which is a big relief for me. Many times children are having confusion or doubt and once skipped it\u2019s hard to regain it, and also it delays the response time of the tutor but during live teaching sessions there and then kids can have clarity about whatever is coming in their mind and can move on further. It\u2019s been almost two months now my child is successfully going on with the program and also I am glad to see how she is getting into the habit memorizing things and of systematized completion of tasks. Please check all these points and find out which platform is best for you firstly Virtual teaching concept or live teaching, individualized or teaching in a group, want your child to be a creator or consumer, want qualified experts or the fresher as your tutors and of course fellowships, mentorships and certifications are a big appreciation for them in their growth.

            "answer_text": "One thing is very clear even after sharing different teaching and learning methods, though these platforms are sharing one similar motive of educating kids. Therefore, it\u2019s not required to differentiate between all of them because they are designed for kids to fulfill specific kinds of requirements. Platforms like BYJU'S, Topper and Vedantu mainly focus on academic curriculum-oriented teachings and entrance exam-based preparations for kids covering certain topics which will be very crucial in clearance of GRE, JEE, IAS, IB exam and so on. Whereas, WhiteHat Jr is one of the best online platforms for kids to learn coding as that is their niche. Also, the most essential feature of live teaching, instead of recorded sessions at WhiteHat Jr, is making it as the most recommended and distinct teaching aid platform. Let me elaborate, my son (Ayan) comes to me one day desiring to learn coding and WhiteHat Jr was the very first option which comes to my mind. Further, after suggesting without any delay my son checked across all details of WhiteHat Jr curriculum and decided to continue with it only. Even he highlights that mom why not we opt for a trial session first before proceeding further to have a clear idea about working on this platform. I found it interesting, and we registered for a trial session at WhiteHat Jr, though they were having very busy demo slots but still the session was scheduled. The Demo session was over and on a positive note my son enrolled for a suitable program at WhiteHat Jr and believe me he is really enjoying the sessions and delivering splendid outcomes by designing apps, games and animations independently. I must advise you not to differentiate between all these platforms rather just understand what you are looking for? Like you want to sharpen your academic skills or in the process of clearing any entrance exam or looking for something new to learn in coding/ programming. ",

All have worked hard in building such wonderful curriculum that are completely different from one another. The online sessions of Whitehat Jr. are enough to improve the knowledge and coding skills of kids. They feel themselves to be a part of some engaging and interactive task and can learn the coding concepts as a fun-game, without feeling burdened down under the course curriculum. Coding is the hottest industry skill nowadays. Being such a demanded skill, there have emerged out innumerable competitive coding learning options before us. Understandably, choosing a single learning mode, out of hundreds of available options is a challenging job. The market is flooded with many offline and online modes of teaching coding to the kids. It is quite easy to understand that the offline method is pretty outdated, and no one is interested in the boring routines of daily and timely visits to the institution and following a study timetable. The online method of learning is the latest trend nowadays, and kids are happily engaging in these platforms as well. So, it\u2019s clear that the online mode of learning is helpful for the kids, as they can learn and practice whenever they want to from the comfort of their homes. There are a few important things to keep in mind, before choosing an online coding platform. Firstly, the platform should be enriched with an interesting course structure so that the learners do not feel detached from learning after a point of time. Also, the online platform should have a teaching curriculum that is different from the school-teaching methodology. ",

            "answer_text": "Byjus is currently one of the most popular school learning app providing learning programs for students in classes 1 to 12. It has courses for competitive exams like JEE, NEET, CAT, IAS. Companies like Byju\u2019s are creating new-age learning experiences that will really help the children overcome the fear of exams and also stop the practice of rote learning and start learning on their own. The way they explain concepts and topics on the BYJUS app, helps students get conceptual clarity and form a firm base in math and science from a young age. They have to learn programs from class 1 - 12 and in case any student is preparing for medical or IIT; they have specific learning programs for that too. Founded in 2013, Toppr is a learning App that offers online coaching for IIT JEE Main, NEET, JEE Advanced, and other school exams.Toppr believes that every student is different and has different learning needs. They work relentlessly to solve student problems using advanced technology and help them learn better also have thoughtfully designed Toppr to ensure that it is a one-stop after-school learning platform. Toppr is based on the add-ons as you get on your meals i.e. you have an option to go with online classes online you can add Adaptive practice + Mock tests + Ask doubts along with it. Each set cost you add to the classes. You can have only Tests or Doubts set. If you are looking forward to helping your kid in learning to code from the tender ages of his life, then WhiteHat Jr. Is the right choice for this purpose. According to it, the minds of kids ages 5-6 are the most-creative. So, kids of this age can grasp the difficult concepts of coding easily. Hence, WhiteHat Jr. offers an engaging curriculum for kids aging 6-14. Also, WhiteHat Jr. does not limit their teachings to coding only. Rather, they have expanded their domains, and impart quality education on games development, mobile app development, and other relevant niches. The new NEP has taught coding as a subject to students from Class 6 onwards to make students ready for the 21st century. Their online coding class is an excellent facility offered by them. Unlike the traditional teaching styled schools, this facility will ensure that every kid receives equal attention from the faculties, and none of them lags. Another facility offered by WhiteHat Jr., which grabbed my attention, is the option of attending trial sessions. Before enrolling kids to this platform, parents can cross-check their staff and the style of imparting education in trial sessions. I would recommend all the parents and students to join the trial sessions before making any final decision. If you find the teaching to be satisfactorily good, then only decide on enrolling your kid to the platforms ",

WhiteHat jr offers a 1:1 online live class where an instructor will guide kids through the course. But BYJU'S, Toppr and Vedantu are mainly tutorial- based. Eventhough the parent company of whitehat jr. is Byju, still whitehat was able to generating its own revenue. Since, the curriculum of whitehat jr. is developed by industry experts and the most important activity of teaching coding is done by top 99.9th percentile of certified teachers, learners get state-of-the-art tech education and unfair advantage when joining the industry. Facilitators align digital literacy into coding courses, as required by the existing skills of the learners. Here they mainly focuses on kids and try to make their base strong. Whereas, the others i.e. BYJU's, Vedantu offers classes which are more relevant to elders rather than kids. All the three do the same task of providing knowledge to kids but besides this they all are different in their ways of teaching.  Parents are now more willing to pay for platforms like WhiteHat Jr since a skill like coding would be a value addition for their child's future. ",

            "answer_text": "With the current situation all around the world, things are becoming uncertain. Schools and colleges are shut down, and even the jobs are available only for those who are able to stand out from the crowd. Thus, we can say that only the knowledge is not enough but the skills are also important. But due to the current scenario, it\u2019s better to stay at homes and use the resources available for one\u2019s personality development. Especially the future of the kids is uncertain. You can\u2019t rely only on the studies that will help the child to succeed, skills are also important. There are a lot of websites available on the web that can help in the development of the child from a young age. Byjus, Toppr, Vedantu are one of the leading ones that can help you in the same. But we can\u2019t ignore the fact that all of them lack in some or the other way. Recently about 18 months ago a new website was launched and has now taken the whole country with a storm because of its commitments and helping the kids to ace the field of coding. WhiteHat Jr was launched 18 months ago and is already one of the Top EdTechs in the country. While I mentioned above some sites lack some things, WhiteHat Jr is growing substantially because it has all those capabilities, that other sites lack. Let\u2019s start with a comparison between the sites- TopprToppr is gaining popularity among those WHO ARE PREPARING FOR EXAMS LIKE NEET, JEE, etc. It doesn\u2019t focus solely on children. The classes that are available at Toppr are also for the children between the age group of 12-18 years i.e. Grade 6th-12th. As the focus of the website is more on competitive exams, the site is not so great for children below the age of 12. Whereas if we talk about WhiteHat Jr, the targeted student age is 6-18. This site solely focuses on this age group and their development, thus being beneficial for the children. The courses at Toppr are quite expensive and can be more of a financial burden than actually helping the child. While if we talk about WhiteHat Jr, the courses are very reasonable, and added advantage is they provide free demo classes, which is not in the case of Toppr.  VedantuTeachers play a very important role in the development of the child. The efficiency of the teacher in whichever subject she teaches is very important. At Vedantu, they focus on many subjects, not just one. The teachers are efficient but some of them do lack efficiency in some of the spheres. The teachers lack the advanced knowledge on that particular topic/subject due to which the tests which are created for the children to practice lack quality as well as variety. While WhiteHat Jr is very different than Vedantu. A teacher at WhiteHat Jr undergoes a long selection process to prove it\u2019s efficiency. The process of selection is of 5 stages and only 99.9th percentile holders are selected. Out of 100 teachers, only 10 are selected. As, WhiteHat Jr solely focuses on coding and wants the kid to ace it, thus only the most efficient teachers of this field are selected. As the teachers belong to top institutions of the world, the test that is made for the children has a lot of variety for better understanding as well as quality.  ByjusEarlier we could say that WhiteHat Jr was different than Byjus. But recently Byjus acquired WhiteHat Jr for $300 million. Both the leading EdTechs of the country have decided to work together through working as a different entity, for the advancement of the children\u2019s future. They will be now expanding their business to other countries as well for the betterment. This collaboration will now extend to countries like Australia, UK, Singapore, Malaysia, and many more.  WhiteHat Jr is proving it\u2019s worth among all the other EdTechs available and is surely standing out as well as helping your child to be an ace in such a dynamic field of coding. ",

            "answer_text": "They have 3 different types of courses that you can sign for. One is for 48 classes and the other for 144 classes. The course fee is based on per class. 48 classes are less economical compared to 144 classes but the value offered in every curriculum package is top-notch. They conduct these classes on their own coding platform which, so far, my kid has absolutely loved. You have to book the class in advance based on your preferred time slot. If you want to change the time slot you can do so 24 hrs prior. It makes sense. My initial impressions are that they are really good. For the initial classes, which my daughter is still in, it\u2019s completely image-based. This means the child doesn\u2019t have to write the code but drag and drop the code that\u2019s already written. This gives an easy entrance into the coding world without having to worry about writing textual bases coding. It can be a disadvantage if your child is already into text-based coding. Thus, compared to any other platforms offering coding lessons like Byjus, Toppr, and Vedanta, WhiteHat Jr. is miles ahead and well-structured. ",

            "answer_text": "These all platforms WhiteHat Jr, Byju, Toppr and Vedantu are totally different from each other but I appreciate all of them because they are serving dedicatedly with the motive of educating kids with more and more interactive techniques. Coding is a new concept which is emerging very fast whereas academic coaching is very common around. WhiteHat Jr is an online platform which is focused in passing on creative and interactive ways to learn and teach coding and on the other side Byjus, Toppr and Vedantu are providing more clarity on crucial concepts of academic curriculum and entrance exams. This is the only difference which I have found in all of them. I have two kids (Rahul and Akshit), and they both have different interests and mindsets. Where Rahul loves to remain in touch with mobiles, laptops and video games, Akshit is fond of only and only books. I have seen that Rahul\u2019s mind is very much into Coding and programming therefore found WhiteHat Jr as the best platform for him to learn coding. As A Result, he decides to enroll for a program after the demo session. After an informative demo session at WhiteHat Jr. he seriously gets overwhelmed by the advanced program packages which are not limited to coding or programming only but also more focused on overall development of kids of different age groups ranging from 6 to 15+ years. Finally, today morning he registered for the Silicon Valley program at WhiteHat Jr. On the other hand, I am still in search of finding the best platform amongst Byjus, Toppr and Vedantu for Akshit as per his interest for deep study of academic curriculum. Most probably in a day or so we will select the best amongst three and Akshit will continue further. Till now, me and my son are happy with WhiteHat Jr coding sessions and will recommend it to parents who are interested to indulge their kids in coding. Give it a try and enjoy playing with codes. ",

The following points make WhiteHat Jr. Stands out from Byju's, Toppr & Vedantu: Curriculum: There is a standard curriculum which is followed. This way the whole course is equally divided which later on teaches topics like AI and machine learning.1:1 classes: With the help of one on one interactive session, mentors are able to provide the utmost focus. There is effective learning without any outside entity.Mentor quality: The teachers come from esteemed colleges/institutes with desirable work experience. They are well-trained and go through a stringent process of becoming a WhiteHat Jr mentor proving that the quality is excellent.Silicon Valley Challenge: The kids had to compete in the Silicon Valley Challenge. The winners of Silicon valley challenge get an opportunity to visit Googleplex and interact with their engineers and visit the Waymo facility to experience driverless cars and talk to their product managers and also interacting with investors like Nexus venture and owl ventures.

            "answer_text": "Before jumping to the answer directly let me first tell you that all of them are Ed-techs or Educational Technology Platforms and let me introduce to you about each of them: WhiteHat Jr: It is specifically a coding platform for the kids of age group 6\u201314 years and focuses on producing the futures of the IT or the Tech industry. It is not at all exam oriented but it has a curriculum to teach this generation of kids coding at early ages and make kids future ready. Also it has got some unique features which I feel important to mention here and those are, 1:1 live sessions and free demo classes.Byju\u2019s: It is the parent company of WhiteHat Jr just to tell you. It is a learning app which covers almost all the age groups and is based on Indian Educational System and curriculum. It is exam oriented and focuses on teaching and clarifying concepts in a better way through audio-visual aids.Toppr: Toppr is an after-school learning app to make learning personalized. Toppr helps students prepare for various school, board, and competitive exams. So, basically it is another exam oriented learning apps which follows the school curriculum but in a very personalised way that\u2019s what I have learnt about this company.Vedantu: It is an online tutoring company which enables students to learn LIVE with some of India's best-curated teachers. It uses a real-time virtual learning environment named WAVE a technology built in house. It includes almost all subjects as per CBSE.So, now answering your question all I have to say is that WhiteHat Jr is specifically for learning coding online and especially designed for kids of 6\u201314 years of age and no doubt Coding is the new future and others like Byju\u2019s, Vedantu, Toppr are all exam oriented apps based on school learning concepts. I hope this would help you in choosing for what suits you the best. All the best. ",

If you are seeking a best teacher to teach coding for your child, whitehatJr is the best. All you need is your interest to teach coding to your child, a laptop and internet. Following are the key benefits which I have experienced: The teachers are well qualified in teach logic, codes as well as clarifying doubts of students of any age between 5\u201314100% interactive Live 1:1 (one student with one teacher) full individual attention providedTeachers are creative, punctual and able to drive the students to get desired goalsThe scheduling of online class is very flexible and possible to change even just before 1 day in advance.Give more value in clarifying logical and coding concept as per student\u2019s thinking capabilityAwesome platform to showcase the coding talent, because they arrange many challenges like silicon valley etc in pan india level.Enabling the kid to understand JAVA, CSS and HTML5 etc easily to help them to build mobile appsWhereas, Byju\u2019s, Vedantu and Toppr are the way more focused towards learning on academics. Let me explain how. Toppr is a platform to teach purely on academics. If you need personal teacher, you can book through this app on any specific subject. They will clarify all doubts live in virtual class. That means it is not 100% interactive only if you need help in any particular subject it will help. And Byju\u2019s, Vedantu are learning apps which helps to learn and strengthen academic side. The main advantage is you can learn more academics in much better way at any place, because it is self explanatory app. ",

Although both the platforms seem to have similar goal of educating school children, I found a lot of difference in the teaching pattern of both. At Byjus, they provide a pre-recorded video course that comes in a portable device. They hardly take live classes. This made me realise that I have almost no scope of taking classes on their platform. Also their curriculum and the subjects seemed a bit traditional to me, and not exactly what I\u2019d enjoy teaching. The moment I went through WhiteHat Jr.\u2019splatform, I understood that it is the right fit for me. They have specially trained teachers for who are highly qualified and not only teach coding but provides mentor support helps in academic growth, building self-confidence and improvement in academic performance. The lectures are live where we have one-to-one interaction with the students and clear all their doubts real time. I have been teaching kids coding 1:1 on WhiteHat Jr\u2019s platform for a few months now, and the overall experience has been incredible! I would definitely recommend Whitehat Jr. if you are a parent and looking to enroll your kid to learn coding. Its truly been a MAGICAL PLATFORM!! ",

            "answer_text": "Hello there!! Warm Greetings. Before I answer this question, I would like to elaborate about it first. WhiteHat Jr, Byjus, Toppr, Vedantu, etc, when you hear all these names, what comes to your mind. What does these names stand for? Edtech. These are some educational technologies that comprises the use of computers, blended with technology, which train and enhance the skills of students. Started just as an experiment, this technology has been metamorphosed by \u201cn\u201d number of entrepreneurs. It is all about applying digital technology and implementing a new form of learning. This undergoes a change in the traditional architecture of education. EdTech has the potential to generate competency and authorize newfangled ideas which uplifts the status. The reason why I am unfolding about edtech is because there are a profuse number of edtech startups in India. Their perquisites are shedloaded. These EdTechs aim at furnishing cognizance and education for students. Each and every edtech is peculiar in its own way. They are professional and are recognized in their particular province. Their only motto is to train budding employers. Now, circling back to the question. Let me apprise you about the other edtechs first. Byjus, Toppr and Vedantu are exclusively for tutorials, where the educator coach the students about a certain topic of science, commerce, training them for GRE, JEE, IAS, IB, so and so entrance exams. They guide them clear and pass these exams with premier marks.  They teach the students through tutorial videos which are comprised of detailed concepts, based on traditional institutions which has become outdated now. These edtechs are exam-centric and will only help your child improvise their results in their school curriculum. Most important of all, they don't concentrate on kids of tender age (6 to 14) for coding. WhiteHat Jr. stands out of all these. This edtech is astounding and pre-eminent of all other edtechs. WhiteHat Jr. provides a sensational coding curriculum which concentrates on coding for kids. This makes the kids bring their total involvement in class, and their enthusiasm is maintained throughout the class. WhiteHat jr offers one on one online live class. The tutor trains him personally through virtual classes. This edtech\u2019 s motto is to mould creators, making them rule over the future tech world, rather than just consumers of technology. This is based totally on their compromising future. The kids learn their concepts from basic skills of coding, than they are stuffed with complex things. If they don't enjoy learning, gradually they develop hatred towards the subject. So, this platform will definitely help your kid, become passionate in their learning.  Your kid has complete liberty in these sessions. There are many more advantages. They can post their queries to teachers without any hesitation. Session is fully interesting and interactive. It not only nourishes your kid with coding, but also makes your kids' expertise in their personal life and school-based curriculum. They become leaders and not just followers. They become all-rounder. Check out the free trial classes which gives complete guidance for you to choose the finest course for your kid. Happy Coding!! ",

Java was introduced under my school curriculum this year but it was taught to us by teachers in a very tedious manner, consequently level of interest in me was rating down day by day. I never wanted to step up towards my dream with such boredom and also was not interested for baseless foundation for my career. Therefore I discuss it with my parents and they guided me to find some other interactive way out to learn the same. WhiteHat Jr. was suggested to me by my friend Sara. After thorough study of all necessary details about website and program, I found that most influential features were one on one teaching concept and guaranteed refund of the payment in case of any kind of dissatisfaction or incompetency by the authorities but fortunately I am happy and gratified by the services provided. Rather than following all old patterns of learning, same old syllabus and opting byjus, topprr or vedantu apps only to score somewhere in range of 90s, I would recommend to explore our minds and face challenges to build up creative and logical thinking. WhiteHat Jr. is giving us an opportunity to think and come out of box and do something different. With the help and support of my tutor (Advanced Game Designer, TFI Fellow) I designed a working quiz app for the students for mental recreation and exercise at the end of my program At the end I would conclude by saying it is better to get engaged in more practical concepts rather than bookish knowledge only. Working examples or experiments are always point of attention. ",

White hat jr is like an awesome platform to learn coding for kids. My mom and dad were looking for something where me and my sister can get something best at our home. After complete exploration and examination of online language portal they finally trusted on white hat jr and are really happy that they have got such an amazing support where we can get online language sessions with complete fun and innovative concepts under supervision of parents. Me (Ritvik) and my sister (Inaya) begins with white hat Jr with two different courses. I enrolled with beginners program , once I finished with it I went for intermediate one, After that on my feedback my parents let my sister also begin with whitehatjr. Whenever we both spare time we contact with whitehatjr team to schedule the class. Flexible timings, one on one sessions, well-planned syllabus, refund facility in case of dissatisfaction, demo classes and interactive online sessions makes this app different from all other apps in the market. Whitehatjr has given us an exposure to fulfill our coding dreams.  Now, we both brother and sister not scared with coding syntax rather it seems fun to play with the coding .See curriculum is same which we used to study in books difference is only in the best possible way curriculum is being taught to us by the tutors which makes us comfortable with so called boring languages which are now we love to be with. My parents are very much thankful to Mr. Bajaj and Ms. Sufi for end to end support regarding all updated information about course, timings and classes. Lastly, I would like to thank Ms. Medha our online tutor who was very interactive and explained us concepts of coding so well that we fall in love with White hat jr. ",

            "answer_text": "How vast technology has been emerging! This technology has helped education platforms as well. Now, teaching and learning are not restricted to classrooms or extra-classes, students have the option of online classes as well and they are in love with such kind of technology. With this initiation, they do not have to attend classes by going anywhere and they can have the best mentor to learn any subject like coding which is very complex unless you are guided by a professional and experienced instructor. There are numerous online coding platforms available and all are good in their field as their motive is not to be on top of the list of online teaching providers but to impart practical knowledge to students for their bright future. Names like Byjus, Toppr, Vedantu, etc. are some renowned names in providing a good source of education. Along with these, there is also WhiteHat Jr. which has been successful in emerging out the younger coders at the tender age of 6-14 years. Coding is the only key focus of WhiteHat Jr. If we imagine, then teaching coding to children is not a piece of cake as it requires a lot of patience to deal with them, to clear all their doubts, to make them understand the concept, etc. But, all the online platforms like Byjus, Whitehatjr, Toppr, etc are proving its worth with every single day by devoting their time and dedication in making the ideas and programming languages simpler to kids. Their friendly teachers, interesting methods, and at-home sessions are all that school-going children need. They make sure that their classes might not interfere with students' regular academic classes. ",

            "answer_text": "Coding and academic coaching are two ends of a string. The coding concepts coaching platforms are few, whereas the academic coaching platform for the students is relatively larger in number. Platforms like Byjus, Toppr, and Vedantu are providing academic-coaching to children. While WhiteHat Jr. is an ed-tech platform that primarily focuses on imparting coding education to the kids above 6 years of age. The interesting and wonderful academic-coaching platforms are necessary for the regular school-goers to deepen their knowledge in academic subjects while for the coding enthusiasts, WhiteHat Jr. is the best option. Whitehat jr boosts confidence through various incentives and also have few weekly tasks and competitions that can be completed. It also helps in network building as in those weekly tasks ou have to create your own clan of people and win the task in group. It helps you play in group and win in group. If you are a person who wants to own your App and have your own startup, then you should go for coding and programming and hence choose WhiteHat Jr. But, if you want to prepare for any competitive exams or any other CBSE Board preparation, you can choose all these apps. WhiteHat Jr was acquired by Byjyu's for $300 million; the edtech startup became part of the multi-billion dollar online education empire. These apps have become the need of the hour, due to Covid and people are not able to step out. Their staying at home has caused them huge loss of activities and their personality development. But these kinds of platforms can help you excel in your areas while sitting at home. These apps have become boon for these kids. They can compensate this loss while sitting at home and enhancing their areas of interests and framing their future career at its best. ",

WhiteHat Jr is a specialized Ed-tech platform focused on kids programming. WhiteHat jr offers a 1:1 online live class where an instructor will guide kids through the course. But BYJU'S, Toppr and Vedantu are mainly tutorial-based platform where a teacher explain about a certain topic of science, commerce, GRE, GRE, JEE, IAS, IB exam and so on. Some Fundamental difference of Byjus, Toppr, and Vedantu from WhiteHat Jr: >Focus group: WhiteHat Jr focuses on 6-14 years of kids coding learning, whereas Byjus, Toppr, and Vedantu are a common platform that helps students to prepare for institutional exams. >Aims of teaching: WhiteHat Jr aims to create thinkers and creators who will rule the future tech industry. But, Byjus, Toppr, and Vedantu seek to help students to pass exams with better grades via their tutorials. >Teaching Style: Byjus, Toppr, and Vedantu teach their students through tutorial videos that cover an explanation of different topics of traditional institution's syllabus. But, WhiteHat jr offers 1:1 online live classes that help to interact with both teacher and student. Students get direct guidance from teachers and are able to ask questions. >Exam-oriented platform: Byjus, Toppr, and Vedantu are exam-oriented platforms which will help your child to get better results in his/her school. On the other hand, WhiteHat Jr is an entire application based coding learning platform for your kids. I hope now you will understand the fundamental difference of WhiteHat Jr from Byjus, Toppr, and Vedantu. As a parent, you may still have some confusion. Which platform will be better for your kid? I can help you to make the perfect decision for your kid's learning. >Ed-tech vs. Institutional platform: After completing a programming course from WhiteHat Jr, you will notice his/her mental development and improvement of logical power. It will also help him/her in a regular institutional study. >Create programming genius: If you plan to see your kid as a programmer, why shouldn't you start from today? WhiteHat Jr would be the first step to have a computer programmer in your family. >Institutional Study: It is also essential for your kid. For Institutional exams, you may choose an online platform or private tutor. It\u2019s up to you. Now you have a better understanding of WhiteHat Jr and other online educational platforms and their fundamental differences. I'll recommend you to enroll for a programming course, if you want to see your kids as tech experts in the growing Tech industry of India. ",

            "answer_text": "Below are the descriptions of how WhiteHat Jr is different from other e-learning platforms: BYJUs: BYJUs provide comprehensive learning to students from the ages of 4-18 years. The special feature of the platform includes conceptual learning through visualization, personalized learning programs, and unmatched individual attention. The courses are available in the domain of Commerce, CBSE, ICSE, NEET, CAT, IAS, JEE Main & Advanced, and NCERT. Toppr: Toppr is an after-school learning app that caters students from almost 22 boards. It prepares students for 58 competitive exams which include NEET, JEE, CA Foundation, Olympiads, and scholarship exams like NTSE, KVYPY, IMO, etc. The Toppr app is available on the platforms of Mobiles (iOS & Android), Tablets (Android & iPad), and Desktops (all browsers). Toppr has over 14 million registered students worldwide. Vedantu: Vedantu is an online teaching platform that focuses on students between the Grade IV-XII from CBSE and ICSE backgrounds. Teaching occurs through an in-house built technology of WAVE (Whiteboard Audio Visual Environment). The startup is run by four students from IITs. The company\u2019s business is to provide online tutoring in the areas of STEM, Hindi, English, Sanskrit, French, German, Environmental Science, and Social Science. It also claims to provide preparatory courses for NTSE, JEE Foundation, and Problem-Solving Assessment.  At last, coming to WHITEHAT JR. WhiteHat Jr is an EdTech that targets children from the ages of 6-18. The diverse array of courses is in the field of coding. Karan Bajaj, the founder believes that children should be the creators of technology. The live 1:1 class teaches students the art of coding starting from the Beginner to the Advanced Tech level. By the end of their courses, students can fabricate numerous applications and animations. In the course, a child learns loops, conditionals, sequences, python, space-tech stimulation, machine learning, etc. The testimonials by various users including Bollywood choreographer Farah Khan proves, that EdTech is worthy of its name. Now answering your question, I would say other courses from BYJUs/Toppr/Vedantu emphasize academics. While WhiteHat Jr teaches coding, which serves both as a co-curricular and help in academics. A child learns persistence, problem-solving, and logic which improves their analytical skills as well. ",

            "answer_text": "Well, it is not right to compare WhiteHat Jr, Byju, Toppr and Vedantu with each other because they all are serving kids and parents with their unique ideas and concepts of digital learning. The only thing to understand is about your requirement. I know these platforms would be a little confusing for those parents who are not much aware of the digital education system, but little research and awareness can derive your kids on the right track. Similar situation happened to me last year during summer vacations of my daughter (10 years) and son (12 years). They both approach me to learn something more advanced and different in coding from their regular school curriculum. Being a housewife, I am busy with household stuff and can spare very little time to help my kids in their studies but they both are very sincere, and dedicatedly devote their time to complete their work successfully. Further, I thought all online platforms related to digital education are providing coding classes but unfortunately genuine platforms are few. Following their interest, I searched across numerous online portals like WhiteHat Jr, Byju, Toppr and Vedantu. But found that WhiteHat Jr is the only portal dedicated for teaching coding to kids and the rest of the portals provide personalized solutions for interests and queries related to school curriculum, subjects or entrance exams. My kids had a trial session there and it was worth attending. The WhiteHat Jr tutor detailed us regarding their curriculum, their roster of qualified tutors, future benefits and class timings to maintain a transparent relationship on both sides. I was satisfied with the conversation and thus, enrolled my kids at WhiteHat Jr. I hope my words will clear your confusions and provide a platform from where your kids can start. ",

            "answer_text": "WhiteHat Jr is entirely different from Byjus, Toppr, and Vedantu. Let me explain it understandably. WhiteHat Jr is a specialized Ed-tech platform focused on teaching programming to kids. Whitehat Jr entirely centers on coding and has no other stream or subject to focus on, making it unique in its way. WhiteHat jr offers live one-on-one online classes conducted by eminent professional teachers who teach sessions for one student at a time rather than having to divide their attention among many students and not being able to pay attention individually. Byjus, Toppr, and Vedantu teach their students through tutorial videos that explain different traditional institution's syllabus topics. On the other hand, platforms like BYJU'S, Toppr, and Vedantu are mainly tutorial-based, where they cover the entire curriculum starting from subjects like maths, chemistry, science, general knowledge, etc. They have no specific domain but coverup curriculum as the whole. They even provide classes and prepare students for competitive exams like NCERT, JEE, IAS, IB exam, etc. WhiteHat Jr focuses on teaching coding to 6-14 years kids. In contrast, Byjus, Toppr, and Vedantu are common platforms that help students prepare for institutional exams delivering all subjects we usually find in school syllabus and curriculum. Moreover, the teachers take monthly feedback from the kids and parents and have a conversation on how the process can be done better, which is a great thing and not offered by most platforms. Byjus, Toppr, and Vedantu are exam-oriented platforms which will help your child to get better results in his/her school. On the other hand, WhiteHat Jr is an entire application based coding learning platform for your kids to develop projects like apps, game apps, coding models, etc. I would say Whitehat Jr is a more preferred and better edtech platform when it comes to coding.

            "answer_text": "WhiteHat Jr is an online coding platform that teaches coding for children between the age group of 6-18. Byjus, Toppr, and Vedantu also provide coding classes, but coding isn\u2019t their major priority. These companies have other courses in science, commerce, medicine and a lot more for various age groups unlike WhiteHat Jr, which focuses only on coding. WhiteHat Jr has an amazing team of teachers who are selected after five rounds of interviews. Only the top 0.1% of applicants are chosen, which makes WhiteHat Jr completely different from Vedantu, Toppr and Byjus. These teachers carry out a one-on-one, live online session with the students. Kids can ask questions and get answers in real-time. Other EdTech institutions do not always have the facility of live classes. They usually upload video clips of a teacher explaining some topic which was recorded earlier.  Classroom style teaching is not always ideal for online learning. When it\u2019s just one teacher and one student, the teacher can make sure that the child learns and understands every concept thoroughly before moving forward. I enrolled my six-year-old daughter in a coding class with WhiteHat Jr. They keep improvising their five types of curriculum and course content, which is why they are one of the top EdTech startups in India.WhiteHat Jr have to unleash quality content only based on coding, which is very tough compared to the other companies where they have different courses to balance the content with. Taking this as a challenge, they have successfully established themselves in the market and are doing exceedingly well and will keep up this pace in the coming future. These are some of the things that make WhiteHat Jr different and better than the other EdTech Indian companies. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, WhiteHat Jr. is different from Byjus, Toppr and Vedantu. But how? Where WhiteHat Jr is an ed tech platform which focuses on educating kids of age 6 and above about coding, on other end Byjus, Topprand Vedantu are more like working as coaching platforms which are imparting clear and deep knowledge about crucial academic and entrance exam topics. Like you, my daughter was also getting confused initially in finding difference amongst all these but later on after checking websites thoroughly of all these platforms difference was very clear. Even she explained it to me that,\u201d Mom WhiteHat Jr is for kids who are interested in learning to code while rest platforms are for school going kids who are focused to deepen knowledge about academic subjects and clearance of entrance exams. My daughter (Neha Sharma) is already doing great in her academics and approach her school tutors whenever she is having any kind of doubts. But amongst all subjects, for coding she is very keen to grab more practical experience on working of codes and also love crisp clear clarity on their concepts. Therefore, nothing else could be better than joining WhiteHat Jr. And also, she convinced her best friend as well to join this platform along with her. They both attended a demo session together at WhiteHat Jr. and believe me that they were seriously convinced after knowing all major highlighted features of coding through the tutor. Finally, 2 weeks ago they both enrolled for an endorsed program by their mentor to positively utilize their duration of 1-month vacations. It was my daughters choice to be a coder that\u2019s why she opted for WhiteHat Jr but if you are looking for something related to have more clear grip on concepts related to academic subjects and entrance exams than any of Byjus, Toppr and Vedantu can be a good option.

            "answer_text": "WhiteHat Jr was founded and established by Karan Bajaj, former Discovery Networks India CEO and novelist. White Hat Jr specifically focuses on helping kids between the age group of 6 to 18 years to learn fundamentals and advance level of coding/programming which would teach them to build animations, commercial-ready games, and apps online. WhiteHat Jr is quite new in the ed-tech sector yet is one of the fastest growing company in their field. The company, started in November 2018. Earlier, it raised $1.3 million in seed funding from Nexus Venture Partners and Omidyar Network India. One of the major reason that WhiteHat Jr is among the fastest growing ed-tech startup in India is that they stand out. They\u2019ve developed their own original coding curriculum. Their curriculum focuses on product creation. They deliver their classes through 1:1 live interactive classes. \u201cOur mission is to harness the natural creativity of kids and shift their mindset from an early age - from being consumers to creators of technology. It\u2019s been heartening to see the projects of kids in the first 6 months of launch as they\u2019re creating immensely creative, high utility digital applications that are bound to have long-term impact,\u201d said Bajaj, CEO, WhiteHat Jr. According to me, though WhiteHat Jr is among on of the all ed-tech startups in India, but they stand out of the crowd. Their focus is on making kids the creators and not consumers of technology! My nephew had a great experience learning to code there but you can always do your research. :) Thank You. Hope I could be of some help. :) ",

            "answer_text": "The main objective of Whitehat jr, Byju's, vedantu and toppr are the same. They work to enhance the learning experiences for school going kids. Each one of them has their teaching strategies which work for one group of users and does not work for the other. It is too subjective to be commented on. Go through the analysis below and figure for yourself. Targeted user group:Toppr and vedantu and Byju's can be used by any school going kid from grade 1 to grade 12. They focus on providing study materials for competitive exams for Indian civil services and college entrance examinations like JEE and NEET, While whitehat jr. only focuses on catering coding classes for kids from grade 1 to grade 7, which can be seen as one of the reasons behind its dynamic management. Aims of teaching:As whitehat jr. is a coding platform, it encourages your kid to think like a programmer, coding doubles the speed of logic building and hence affects the IQ of kids positively. whereas vedantu, byjus and toppr can help your kid in academics by teaching normal school syllabus with an engaging approach. Fee structure or subscription packages:The fee structure varies with different requirements. There is an option to book free trials in all the above platforms. I would recommend you visiting their websites for more information and choose the packages wisely according to your kids' needs. Class conduction:Vedantu uses WAVE(Whiteboard Audio Video Environment) which gives a premium experience to the students. It is a real-time virtual environment. The use of virtual reality is helping a lot in the field of education for a better understanding of students. Whitehat jr offers flexible class timings for the convenience of kids. It provides 1:1 interactive classes with doubt solving sessions. In simpler words vedantu, byjus and toppr are the tuition classes for your kids which are turned digital with improved learning experiences. They help your kid excel at present in their classes. And whitehat jr helps them excel outside their classes in the present as well as in the future by connecting them to the active learners all over the world thus providing exposure. Hope you are satisfied with the answer. All the best with your search. ",

Learning to code at an early age helps children to visualise abstract concepts, and will also help with communication, creativity, math, and confidence. Whitehat Jr is the only platform for kids where they can learn coding from the right age. It offers Artificial Intelligence (AI) courses to children aged between 6 and 14 years. It aims to empower children to view themselves as creators, so they become frontier inventors of the new world. WhiteHat Jr is very much different from Byjus, Toppr, and Vedantu as: \u2022\tWhitehat Jr provides live 1:1 online teaching sessions. Whereas others provide only video tutorials. \u2022\tWith coding, Whitehat Jr also focuses on the fundamental skills a child should have that helps in his mental growth. Whereas others just focus on the limited course content. \u2022\tWhitehat Jr is entirely a coding-based platform. Whereas others are just tutorial and exam-oriented platforms.

            "answer_text": "In a world of technology where the education sector has shifted its way from conventional ways of teaching to advanced ways of spreading knowledge, various EdTech platforms have emerged and at times it gets a little difficult which one to choose out of so many. The top ones include Byjus, Toppr, Vedantu, and WhiteHat Jr. Even though they all fall in the category of EdTech, all of them are different from each other. To begin with Byjus, it is good for students as every topic and every subject is taught in an interesting manner. Toppr is good for IIT-JEE prep but as the videos are not live, teacher-student interaction is less. While, Vedantu is very good for school and IIT-JEE prep, the classes being live and the teachers being ex-IITians with experience. However, out of all these WhiteHat Jr. is quite different and focuses solely on coding i.e, it\u2019s mission is to harness the natural creativity of kids and shift their mindset from an early age - from being consumers to creators of technology has made them achieve the title of one of the most remarkable startups in India. By 2020, AI and robotics will impact around 800 million jobs. Basically, any job that doesn\u2019t involve creation will be automated. In the face of these changes, it becomes imperative to tweak the educational curriculum for children as such that they become creators rather than just consumers of technology. And this is what WhiteHat Jr. is aiming to do. What makes WhiteHat Jr. positively stand apart from these other EdTechs is WhiteHat Jr\u2019s initiative of developing their own original coding curriculum, which is centered on product creation, and imparts their lessons via 1:1 live, interactive online classes. Over the past few months, WhiteHat Jr\u2019s online platform has seen over 150,000 student trials, over 7000 teachers onboarded, and 100% month-on-month student and revenue growth. The company conducts 1,000 online classes per day and has experienced demand with all capacity regularly booked within an hour of being announced and maintaining a daily waitlist of 500 students. ",

            "answer_text": "Learning online has been very popular in India for quite a long time now. Byju's, Toppr and Vedantu are some of the big names of the existing online platforms. WhiteHat Jr is comparatively new in this field but they have owned their position in a very short period of time. Despite all being popular online learning platforms, WhiteHat Jr. is not the same as Byju's, Toppr and Vedantu. Technically, Byju's, Toppr and Vedantu have similarities between them. All of them focus on teaching academic topics. They have separate courses on BNAT, CBSE, ICSE, CAT, IAS JEE, NEET etc. Toppr covers some more topics including syllabus of class 5 to 10, some medical and commerce exams. On the other hand, WhiteHat Jr aims at teaching coding to young kids, specially to the children of age group 6 to 14.They teach fundamentals of coding which include logic, structure, sequence and algorithmic thinking to enable kids to generate creative outcomes like websites, animations and apps. I studied the curriculum and classes offered by these online platforms when I was looking for a coding institute for my son. Only then I came to know that WhiteHat Jr was the institute I could rely on. Their course is designed in an interactive way that is so effective for kids of my son's age. The passion and keenness of them to teach everything that is required to the pathway of being a successful coder made me relieved in a quick time. I must mention that WhiteHat Jr is unique in another way. All the classes offered by them are taken 1:1 with the instructor. My daughter was also happy by the fact that there were none but the instructor and her at the time of classes. I believe online platforms have a great potential in taking India to the next level. More and more online platforms will be introduced for specialized branches of knowledge. ",

            "answer_text": "As we have known that Byjus lands up to be the most used when it comes to kids learning major subjects. But recently in 2018 ; A new website White Hat Jr. has been introduced which teaches kids how to code and learn other programming languages. Byju's learning now joins hands with White Hat Jr. making it easier for the children to get guided. What makes it different is where in other websites, kids just learn subjects like mathematics, English, science, physics and many more. But in White Hat Jr. it allows kids to explore a new field. That is the programming language. This on regular classes gets introduced to students when they reach the 10th grade or 11th grade class. But even having programming knowledge in prior doesn't cause any harm, it in fact builds a better understanding in logical, algorithmic, digital and data structures. I m a software engineer, honestly I had learnt the basics of programming in my 11th and now I m working on software related company itself. Somewhere down to the line I think if coding was introduced as a subject in lower classes it would have been good for us itself to learn more in advance and explore for in that domain later on.  But we are never too late for anything. As Byju\u2019S, Vedantu, Toppr teaches students on a whole and doesn\u2019t keep the 1:1 methodology as that of White Hat Jr. does. Apart from these short sessions White Hat Jr. makes it a point to teach the important topics very precisely. This makes innovative style to present to the kids. Why make you child sit only for regular sessions when one whole language can take your kid to the next level. Hope this guides you well. ",

            "answer_text": "Well, as far as I know according to what I have read and experienced. WhiteHat Jr. though built on the same concept i.e. EdTech is very different from Byjus, Toppr and Vedantu as both of these companies are more focused on disseminating knowledge about school syllabus such as CBSE, ICSE and competitive examinations such as IIT, UPSC entrance , GRE, JEE etc. WhiteHat Jr. focuses more on the age group of 6-14 years disseminating information only about the field of coding. Whereas, Vedantu, Toppr, Byjus provides knowledge about school syllabus and entrance examination. WhiteHat Jr. hosts online one on one live teaching sessions for students whereas this is not the case with the latter 3 as they provide recorded lectures to the students. Byjus, Toppr and Vedantu are more exam oriented and emanate knowledge and information related to board examination and competitive examinations. On the Other hand WhiteHat Jr. aims at providing knowledge about coding such as UI/events, logic structureConditionals etc. WhiteHat Jr. has a more holistic view as compared to the other three mentioned in the question above as it aims at the integrated development of the children at a younger age as coding will enhance the intellect of the children at a young age by developing their logical and algorithmic thinking ability. As per my analysis, WhiteHat Jr. is a totally different concept altogether as it has a vision of giving birth to tech geniuses by arming them with the power of coding and enabling them to become the creators of the AI driven world to come. So, if a child wants to learn coding and wants to become one of the pioneers of the future world then there is a no better platform than WhiteHat Jr. On the other hand, if a student wants to learn about the regular school syllabus or Competitive Examinations then Byjus, Vedantu and Toppr are the masters. I hope I was able to answer your question. ",

            "answer_text": "I have realized that the school curriculum these days are so occupied that students hardly get time to learn to code. So, I always wanted to provide my daughter with good competitive coding skills. Byjus, Toppr, Vedantu, and Whitehat Jr are some trustworthy online coaching platforms. All are offering the best to students and Whitehat Jr. offers a distinctive curriculum that is off-the regular school one. Another reason is that my daughter needs something interactive so I had to choose something which could happily engage her. The Whitehat Jr. curriculum is so engaging, creative, and modified that my daughter has now taken up coding as her hobby. Unlike other kids of her age, she has learnt the productive use of technology. I\u2019m happy to find her sitting in the room with a tablet, and learning how to code in her leisure time. She has also learned to strike a balance between her school studies and her coding classes. Also, I can see her excelling in logical answering and creative thinking all of which have been possible only due to good coding structure and techniques. I haven't experienced such growth in her in terms of coding language. I am glad that she now has the capabilities to take part in competitions and build her own app, which demands higher-order creativity, logical thinking, and competitive coding knowledge. Various online platforms are proving their worth, just be focused on what skills you want to make your child productive. Students can acquire extra skills by sitting at home in a homely environment and such coding platforms help children not only in their academics but also to prepare them for their future career in an interesting and child-friendly manner. Coding is essential to be learned now, for better tomorrow. ",

            "answer_text": "Of course, these platforms are different from each other but why are we differentiating in them? As much I have checked about these platforms, these all are designed to serve the purpose of unique niche and Therefore, rather than finding differences in them just check their qualitative aspects and also learning requirement of kids that if he/she is interested for more clarity on academics, entrance exams or coding concepts. Because my son (Rudra-10 years) is an active participant of WhiteHat Jr therefore, I know it is only associated with coding/programming/technology. But yes, I am aware that Byjus, Toppr and Vedantu as well that they are Offering courses for students from classes 4-12th from different boards and providing additional training and preparation courses for competitive exams such as Olympiads, JEE, NEET, CAT, GMAT, GRE and UPSC exams. Rudra is doing great in his academics but if in future he will require any kind of guidance or support related to his academic doubts or confusion then certainly he will go for any one portal amongst above. But this time he was feeling more inclined towards something different than his school curriculum. Last week only he enrolled for a program at WhiteHat Jr. and trust me he is really enjoying the sessions and becoming more innovative and confident day by day. Your question is giving me an idea of your confusion but don\u2019t worry I believe my words and experience will help to make a blueprint of the significance of all above mentioned portals which will pave your path towards exact and best. No difference, just consider the purpose and quality of the portal. I had experienced WhiteHat Jr and its feedback is marvelous therefore if ever you are looking for a platform for your kid learning to code then without any second thought go for WhiteHat Jr. Rest amongst three you can explore more and more and find out the one serving your purpose.

            "answer_text": "All four platforms are managed by ed-tech startups in India, but they differ in the kind of services they offer. For instance, Toppr is mostly used by students who are preparing for competitive exams, whereas Byjus caters to students of all classes for all subjects (including IAS preparation). Vedantu is more of an online tutoring platform, and WhiteHat Jr. is exclusively for coding classes for students between the ages of 6 and 14. I shall describe my personal experience with WhiteHat Jr., as I signed my brother up for their classes. He is in the 7th grade, and he did not have any prior experience with programming languages, except for the basics of HTML. Before enrolling for classes in WhiteHat Jr., we sought testimonials and reviews from friends and family, and got many positive responses. My brother tried their free demo session, during which real-life examples where coding is used were discussed. He is now proficient in Turtle coding, and is undertaking projects on his own, under the guidance of the teacher from WhiteHat Jr. The comprehensive curriculum is divided into five sections, namely- Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced, Professional and Applied Tech- based on the age/class of the child, and the level of understanding. The teachers are experts from IITs and are IB curriculum-trained, and can explain seemingly complicated concepts to the younger demographic as well. They teach everything from basic topics like variables, loops, algorithms, etc. all the way up to animations and apps. This is done through gamified activities. WhiteHat Jr. is making great strides towards achieving digital literacy among the younger generation, preparing them for a technology-driven world tomorrow.

They all cater to students with their specific educational needs, and thus have courses tailor-made for that purpose. However, there are some key factors that set WhiteHat Jr apart from the other aforementioned platforms: WhiteHat Jr is an ed-tech platform that is solely focused on teaching coding to kids. Coding is a subject that is still not widely taught across schools in the country. However, learning how to code is now more crucial than ever as the world is racing towards automation. It is estimated that 90% of the present jobs will be replaced by new roles due to automation. So, WhiteHat Jr prepares school kids for that future through its curriculum. Other platforms have some traditional modules as well, which are already taught in most schools.WhiteHat Jr teaches kids online 1:1 live, and not through pre-recorded videos. Some other ed-tech platforms have pre-recorded videos and documents that can be downloaded and learnt at own pace after getting enrolled.After going through WhiteHat Jr\u2019s website, and other platform\u2019s websites, I found one more distinction in their messaging. WhiteHat Jr clearly wants to equip today\u2019s school students with the right coding knowledge and skills to become a creator in the tech world in the future. So their course syllabus is very innovative and more practical. The other platforms seem to be more focussed on ensuring the kids do well in school and their modules seem to stick to the traditional curriculum.Please note that the above are just my opinions only. You are advised to do independent research before picking the one right for you. ",

The coding concepts coaching platforms are few, whereas the academic coaching platform for the students is relatively larger in number. Platforms like Byjus, Toppr, and Vedantu are providing academic-coaching to children. While WhiteHat Jr. is an ed-tech platform that primarily focuses on imparting coding education to the kids above 6 years of age. The interesting and wonderful academic-coaching platforms are necessary for the regular school-goers to deepen their knowledge in academic subjects while for the coding enthusiasts, WhiteHat Jr. is the best option. Since an early age, I have witnessed the zest in my son (11 years old) for coding. For the academic subjects, he relies upon his able school-teachers, and himself for self-studies. Last year when I saw my son struggling hard to learn some coding concepts from YouTube, I felt that there should be some coding institutions that may offer remarkable curriculums from expert faculties. As a result, I began my searches on Google. I came up with many search results for coding platforms including WhiteHat Jr., Byjus, Toppr, and Vedantu. After some deeper analysis, I realized that WhiteHat Jr. is the one that provides coding coaching for the kids, and brings highly satisfying results. Though it was necessary to opt for academic coaching as well, we decided to postpone the plan for some time. And began inquiring about WhiteHat Jr. It is a platform that offers 1:1 online classes for the kids, from IIT and IIM alumni. Their engaging and advanced curriculum fully convinced me of enrolling my son with the platform. And now we are regularly obtaining marvelous results from him. I hope I\u2019ve successfully cleared your doubt. Thanks! ",

They believe in providing practical learning rather than theoretical. Their programs are designed by keeping children\u2019s age in mind because if they will be provided with high-level courses then that may not clear their basic skills. Thus, they keep on upgrading their skills with age. It can be said that they have a clear vision of what to learn, when to learn, and how to make them learn.

            "answer_text": "In my opinion, it is too subjective to answer what is different among WhiteHat Jr, Byjus, Toppr and Vedantu. All of these apps work for students and their development. All of them have something unique in their deliverables. None of them are less. It\u2019s just that they are specifically giving better results in few of their areas, which makes a difference. WhiteHat Jr provides 1:1 live teaching sessions whereas all other are tutoring or rather have pre-recorded classes. It focuses on developing kids coding and programming while all other helps students prepare for GRE, JEE, IAS, etc. Whitehat jr boosts confidence through various incentives and also have few weekly tasks and competitions that can be completed. It also helps in network building as in those weekly tasks ou have to create your own clan of people and win the task in group. It helps you play in group and win in group. If you are a person who wants to own your App and have your own startup, then you should go for coding and programming and hence choose WhiteHat Jr. But, if you want to prepare for any competitive exams or any other CBSE Board preparation, you can choose all these apps. WhiteHat Jr was acquired by Byjyu's for $300 million; the edtech startup became part of the multi-billion dollar online education empire. These apps have become the need of the hour, due to Covid and people are not able to step out. Their staying at home has caused them huge loss of activities and their personality development. But these kinds of platforms can help you excel in your areas while sitting at home. These apps have become boon for these kids. They can compensate this loss while sitting at home and enhancing their areas of interests and framing their future career at its best. ",

Vedantu is an online teaching platform that focuses on students between Grade IV-XII from CBSE and ICSE backgrounds. Toppr is an online teaching platform that focuses on students between Grade V-XII. But According to me, WhiteHat Jr is far better than Vedantu, Toppr, and BYJUS due to the following reasons:  1 There is only one teacher per one student in the online course of WhiteHat Jr. In this way a teacher can give more time to the student. 2 WhiteHat Jr develops problem-solving skills in the kids by teaching them various programming languages and also by teaching real-life projects to the kids. 3 The teaching sessions are very interactive. 4 WhiteHat Jr aims to create thinkers and creators who will rule the future tech industry. But, Byjus, Toppr, and Vedantu seek to help students to pass exams with better grades via their tutorials. 5 WhiteHat Jr teaches coding to the kids in a very fun way, so that the kids can learn very quickly. 6 WhiteHat Jr is an entire application based coding learning platform for your kids.

White hat junior also provides certificates that represent that the child can code and work in programs.

Further i have written the pros and cons of each. One can go through and decide which platform suits them the most. Whitehat Jr. : leader in teaching coding to the children's aged 6\u201314 years in a very creative manner which is totally different from its competitors.ByJu\u2019s : It is good for average students as every topic is taught in an interesting manner.Toppr : It is good for IIT-JEE prep but as the videos are not live, teacher-student interaction is less.Vedantu : Very good for school and IIT-JEE prep, the classes being live and the teachers being ex-IITians with experience.Thanks!

From where I have seen the site is fully focused on kids programming development and their algorithm clearing .There is a lot more that whitehat jr offers than the other platforms it has a major child teacher connection with their face to face doubt solving at the time of difficulty and also a bunch of hands on practical's.

So, I always wanted to provide my daughter with good competitive coding skills. Byjus, Toppr, Vedantu, and Whitehat Jr are some trustworthy online coaching platforms. All are offering the best to students and Whitehat Jr. offers a distinctive curriculum that is off-the regular school one. Another reason is that my daughter needs something interactive so I had to choose something which could happily engage her. The Whitehat Jr. curriculum is so engaging, creative, and modified that my daughter has now taken up coding as her hobby. Unlike other kids of her age, she has learnt the productive use of technology. I\u2019m happy to find her sitting in the room with a tablet, and learning how to code in her leisure time. She has also learned to strike a balance between her school studies and her coding classes. Also, I can see her excelling in logical answering and creative thinking all of which have been possible only due to good coding structure and techniques. I haven't experienced such growth in her in terms of coding language. I am glad that she now has the capabilities to take part in competitions and build her own app, which demands higher-order creativity, logical thinking, and competitive coding knowledge. Various online platforms are proving their worth, just be focused on what skills you want to make your child productive. Students can acquire extra skills by sitting at home in a homely environment and such coding platforms help children not only in their academics but also to prepare them for their future career in an interesting and child-friendly manner. Coding is essential to be learned now, for better tomorrow. ",

Whitehat Jr. is an ed-tech platform which is more focused on teaching programming/coding to kids to make them creators of future tech industry.

On the other hand, few of them like my 14 yr old daughter would like to go for something new which they will feel different from the school curriculum and interesting as well. Here comes Whitehat Jr, which I feel is the best platform for kids to learn coding online through live teaching sessions, rather than preferring for recorded sessions just to make teaching and learning more convenient for kids. And also, the curriculum has not been designed just like that, instead the structure of the curriculum is ready to serve kids from beginners to a professional level. Many times normally, my daughter and I have discussions regarding her future, like which stream offers what kind of career options. And every time she expresses her aim to become an IT entrepreneur. I literally feel great to see her focused towards her dream. Respecting her interest, I believe Whitehat Jr is the best option for her to begin with. Following this she joined the program at Whitehat JR 15 days ago and believe me, she is really enjoying teaching methods of the tutor where she is getting familiar with coding in most convenient ways and also she is learning to work independently by single handedly designing games, apps, puzzles and programs.

Before finalizing the program I booked free trial classes at whitehat Jr and believe me it amazes me. Finally I make the payment and commence it with beginners program. As they follow 1:1 teaching concept, in result I got a dedicated teacher since from the very first day of my program. Krishma Mam was really very prompt and a helping hand for any concerns regarding tutor or scheduling of classes. Overall I am enjoying, learning a lot and getting hands-on experience of sessions by IT specialist. ",

First of all, BYJU\u2019s (which has now acquired WhiteHat Jr) is a website and app that teaches school students all the concepts in a simplified manner. It focuses on the understanding of all the core subjects like Mathematics, Physics, Chemistry, Biology. They also have some entrance exams prep videos. Their USP is their well-animated videos that focus on helping the students in visualizing the concepts. Toppr, I\u2019d say is more of a homework-help kind of an app, which the students usually use to discuss answers to the worksheets given to them for homework. WhiteHat Jr is totally different. It focuses only on coding, rather, \u201ccoding for kids\u201d. Their website says it teaches coding to students from grade 1 to grade 12 and that\u2019s exactly what it does. It is different from BYJU\u2019s and Toppr as it is not just reliant on pre-recorded videos to teach, but it does live teaching, i.e. one to one sessions with the learners. With the emergence of such facilities for kids these days, I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if the next Silicon Valley area turns out to be somewhere in India\u2026 ",

Whitehat jr\u2019s curriculum is designed by IIT alumni and IB professionals so the curriculum is aligned with industry needs. Moreover, all classes are 1:1 interactive sessions so that leaves no room for doubts. Many Whitehat jr. students have got their apps published on the Google play store at the ages of 10\u201312 years and many students got the chance to visit the silicon valley.

            "answer_text": "Hey, As you know these all institutes are mostly based on online and focus on children of classes 5 to 12 and, being India\u2019s oldest and one of the firsts are doing very well in today\u2019s date. But all of these institutes just focus on the curriculum that is being followed by different education boards in our country be it be CBSE, ICSE, or state boards. They just stick to that. And apart from this, BYJU recently started to provide coaching for JEE and NEET exams as well. But all these institutes just focus on the curriculum which the child is already been exposed to at the school level, they just help out the children in understanding the concepts more easily. Therefore, here comes in, a new ed-tech startup i.e. WhiteHat Jr., whose main focus is just on teaching coding language to the children and nothing else. Started just 2 years back and this institute is already doing wonders. They have now expanded globally while the students from their institute who are as young as 9 years old are now making mobile apps that you can use and install via the play store. Can you believe what this platform is giving to these children; the thing which their curriculum missed out is now being fulfilled by WhietHat Jr. Since *Coding is the future* and, because of WhiteHat Jr., now the kids won\u2019t be left behind in learning a new thing that is different from what they are currently studying. No doubt all these institutes are doing very well and hope they continue to do so. Cheers!! ",

Toppr provides education for exams like JEE, NEET etc. to its student but WhiteHat teaches coding to kids between the age of 6 to 14 years. BYJU\u2019s has also partnered with WhiteHat for the same. My brother gets tutorial classes which seem very boring and he just keeps taking down notes most of the time while my classes at WhiteHat are very fun and interesting. I get 1:1 live sessions on WhiteHat\u2019s where education is integrated with fun activities. The teachers at WhiteHat are very friendly and clears all my doubts at once. I took trail classes at Vedantu for a while but didn\u2019t like them. They were boring and used traditional teaching methods whereas WhiteHat\u2019s teaching methods are very innovative and involving. I am really glad that I enrolled at WhiteHat Jr.! ",

            "answer_text": "Firstly , you need to know a little about these organisations: WhiteHat Jr Launched in 2018, WhiteHat Jr offers artificial intelligence (AI) courses to children aged between six and 14 years. It aims to empower children to view themselves as creators, so they become frontier inventors of the new world.   Vedantu Edtech startup Vedantu has launched \u2018Vedantu Superkids\u2019 in May to equips early learners between three and 12 years with coding skills. It also has a project-driven coding programme for students between the age groups of six and 12 years. The programme focusses on learning, as well as developmental outcomes, including cognitive, sensory, and linguistic. In July this year, Mumbai-based edtech startup Toppr launched Toppr Codr \u2013 one-on-one live coding classes for children aged between six and 18 years. BYJU\u2019S - The Learning App is an Indian educational technology and online tutoring firm founded in 2011 by Byju Raveendran at Bangalore. In September 2020, it was the world's most valued edtech company with a valuation of $11.1 billion. Byju's claimed on 27 May 2020 that they had gained \u20b92,800 crore revenue in FY20 When it comes to the point of distinguishing all the above Edtech platforms White Hat Junior is totally different from all others. While the main concept of Vedantu, Byjus and Toppr is to give away lectures, study materials and mock tests majorly to school students and students preparing for other competitive examinations, White Hat Junior focuses on teaching coding to the children between the age 6-14 years of age. White Hat Junior focuses on development of skills and expertise when it comes to coding and programming instead of making students learn the conventional lessons of schools. This factor makes White Hat Junior unique amongst the other edtech platforms. ",

Some renowned online teaching platforms are providing a helping hand to parents. Among them are Byjus, Toppr, and Vedantu. All are trustworthy and reliable with different specialties and qualities which are best to make children learn. If anyone is concerned about education, then he can go for Vedantu, Byjus, etc. However, if your matter of concern is coding, then you can choose WhiteHat Jr. as they aim at clearing the basic programming concepts. So keeping that in mind, I decided to choose WhiteHat Jr. which not only offers quantity but quality as well. I even read their reviews, questioned some of its students, even met personally; everything was positive. They offer coaching for 6-14 years and their way of teaching is extraordinary. They believe in providing practical learning rather than theoretical. Their programs are designed by keeping children\u2019s age in mind because if they will be provided with high-level courses then that may not clear their basic skills. Thus, they keep on upgrading their skills with age. ",

It helps expanding knowledge in field of science, technology, engineering, mathematics by being creative, give real world exposure, encourage teamwork. Takeaway from their classes is to educate and to realise students so that they can simplify their lives and implied in daily life. And one real examples from whitehatjr. is Mae-Mae from meghalaya a 9 year old girl creates India's first anti-bullying app as she was being bullied earlier and this app now has 50k+ download she has been awarded by union HRD minister and also invited to Silicon valley.
