            "answer_text": "Every answer here assumed to \u201cbeat someone\u201d requires some sort of disassembly/reassembly process. Such a method is due to fail due to the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, which states you cannot know a particle\u2019s position AND momentum simultaneously due to the fact that measuring either affects the other. We achieved teleportation as early as 1961, as an instructor with the Canadian Air Force left his assigned area and watched some scientists teleport an ashtray to inside a large glass cube. Teleportation and faster than light travel are both achieved by engineering spacetime. You don\u2019t disassemble the object to be transported and reassemble it. You either create a temporary Einstein-Rosenberg bridge, which requires a huge amount of energy, and is something we still haven\u2019t perfected, you move the SPACE around the object to the desired location, OR you pull the object into a higher spatial dimension, and reinsert it into normal space at the destination point, which is much easier, and was likely the method the Canadians used. if you have a land of two dimensions, and draw a square around one of its inhabitants, you have imprisoned him. To free him you introduce a third dimension and pull the inhabitant UP and place him DOWN outside the box you drew, effectively teleporting him out. Well, that glass cube the instructor saw is analogous to a box, but only in 3-D. The pushed the ashtray into a higher dimension and pulled it back into this one, inside the cube. Seemingly passing \u201cthrough\u201d matter but in effect going above the cube by at least one dimension, likely using high voltage created EM fields. ",

How would those engrams be encapsulated by beaming technology? If the subject somehow arrives alive, is it just a mindless zombie now? Put your money on teleportation conduits, where the subject is teleported in one piece to the destination* (so more Stargate than Star Trek), just as pie in the sky but far more readily achievable by comparison Personally, if we ever get out there, I think planetfall will be achieved with re-entry vehicles beyond current recognition in terms of reliability, utility and size; I seriously doubt we\u2019d pursue a really difficult, improbable solution to such a problem when we can devise a much simpler one based on stuff that we can do in the now *Those ship-to-planet beaming rings, not the stargates themselves, which do demolecularise you ",

            "answer_text": "Of course. Assuming we don\u2019t use technology to destroy ourselves, human creativity is boundless. (I\u2019m paraphrasing the teachings of Carl Sagan here). Consider this: Except for the lens, today\u2019s 2-D imaging is basically a transporter, converting photons of light to digital and then reconverting it for many uses. One being motion pictures. However, the digital process is not theoretically perfect. A transporter must be perfect. There are several Star Trek moments wherein the process malfunctions, but they keep using it, much as we do airplanes and cars despite deadly accidents. Imagine being a 10 year old kid at Kill Devil Hills watching the first powered flight. Then try to foresee that within your lifetime, men would walk, then drive electric vehicles on the moon\u2026five different times. Yes. Humans can do almost anything when working together. ",
