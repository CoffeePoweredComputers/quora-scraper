            "answer_text": "Today\u2019s youth don\u2019t seem to know how to search for topics, how to brainstorm, how to categorize and find holes in our knowledge base. If Google doesn\u2019t know about something, it is assumed to be unknown. That\u2019s dangerous. There a great awakening coming, in that if we were to experience a serious setback in our energy generation, satellite systems, or climate change impact that eliminated or reduced the internet, the kids would be lost, unable to find, know about foods to eat, how to protect themselves, how to make potable water. Many don\u2019t seem to know how to write. Few know how to find a book, have patience to read a chapter, have interest in anything that is not electronic, moving, changing, changeable, colorful. There seems to be reduced interest in art. There is extreme interest in copying pieces in entirety or snippets. If they can\u2019t find it online first then maybe its not worth a few minute visit to see what it\u2019s all about. Perhaps 90% or more of kids under 4 in the US and other developed countries use digital technology more than their parents. Youth eyesight is suffering from red eyes, eye strains, tired eyes, blurred vision, too much smart phone usage. Kids are suffering from too much cellphone usage. I am as guilty about this as my kids. I have a five-year-old who carries her cellphone around with her and calls her Dad on Skype whenever her Mom leaves the house (though there are always other adults in the house), she doesn\u2019t call to say hello as much as she wants to feel she is with her parent (not to mention that her Dad is 5,000 miles away from her every day). So the cellphone is like a security device. Kids are suffering from technology-driven brain development challenges, problems with attention, learning languages, listening, hearing, and obesity from eating and sitting too much. ",

            "answer_text": "The technology which surrounds almost everyone in the modern society, affects both work and leisure activities. Technology contains information that many would rather it did not have. It influences minds in good and bad ways, and it allows people to share information which they would otherwise not be able to attain. Even if a person does not own a computer or have credit cards, there is information on a computer somewhere about everyone. The technology which is just now beginning to be manipulated and harnessed is affecting the minds of small children and adolescents in ways that could be harmful. It is affecting our immediate future. It also gives another form of communication and exchange of information which was not available before, information that is both good and bad.  Technology is one of the principal driving forces of the future; it is transforming our lives and shaping our future at rates unprecedented in history, with profound implications which we can't even begin to see or understand.  Many different elements affect how satisfied we are with our lives. The impact of technology on these elements can change how safe, healthy and happy people feel. Throughout history, people have looked for better ways to meet their needs and to satisfy their expectations. Technology has improved the way people feed, clothe and shelter themselves. Technology has also changed other aspects of everyday life, such as health care, education, job satisfaction, and leisure time activities.  People have used technology since they first chipped stone blades to improve their hunting. Yet some people call the current age the \"Technological Age\" because of society's dependence on technology. For the first time in human history, almost all the goods and services people use depend on technology. The products of technology are available to almost everyone in society. The economy of a country influences how the people of the county live.. ",
