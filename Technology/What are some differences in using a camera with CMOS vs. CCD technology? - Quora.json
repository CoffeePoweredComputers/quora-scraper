            "answer_text": "CCD:CCD sensor technology has been dominant in image applications since the technology debuted in the late 1960\u2019s. However, its analog design is based on a \u201cbucket brigade architecture\u201d and requires a non-standardfabrication process that is both complicated and costly to optimize.It is difficult for commercially viable sensor arrays to integrate analog-to-digital conversion (ADC) for digital processing onto CCDs, or to customize them by adding logic blocks to the chip for specific applications. Their high voltage (+12 to +20 Volts) and power requirements shorten battery life and limit their applicability in small form factor, portable devices. Moreover, the need to add external supporting components (including analog front end, timing circuit,reference voltage, correlated double sampling, mechanical shutter and RAM) results in large printed circuit board real-estate requirements, contrary to the trend of miniaturization in weight and size. CMOS APS:CMOS sensors were developed in the early 1980\u2019s. Passive pixel sensor (PPS) image sensors were the first products in this family to come to market. The large feature sizes available in existing CMOS technology allowed only a single transistor and three interconnecting lines for each pixel. The speed andsignal-to-noise-ratio of PPS was significantly lower than that of CCD sensors. In the 1990s, APS technology added an amplifier to eachpixel. This increased sensor speed and improved thesignal-to-noise-ratio, providing a big advantage over PPSsensors.When deep sub-micron CMOS technologies andmicro-lenses appeared, APS became the alternative sensortechnology. Its low power consumption and near-standardmanufacturing process made it a competitor to CCDsensors for certain applications.
