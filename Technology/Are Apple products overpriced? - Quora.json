            "answer_text": "tl;dr Apple products are and are not overpriced. Yes, Apple products are overpriced. Do you only want to run Windows? Or Android? Are you satisfied with slow hardware? Are you looking for the most raw processing power per dollar (that\u2019s me)? Or, do you have a very tight computing budget? If you\u2019ve answered yes to one or more of these questions there\u2019s a good chance that Apple products are overpriced for you. No, Apple products are not overpriced and are worth it. Do you like using macOS or iOS? Do you prefer to have faster or premium hardware, typically with good build quality? Are you prepared to spend the money to buy a premium product? Do you need something that \u201cjust works\u201d? Then, Apple products are definitely not overpriced. Usage scenario determines an Apple product\u2019s worth. I\u2019ve been a Mac user for over 30 years. In the past five years or so I\u2019ve been exclusively a Windows or Linux user, not because I now dislike Macs or Mac OS X or macOS, but, because Windows 7 and 10 met and meet my current needs at a price-point that works for the cheapskate in me. Now, I\u2019m even at a point where Windows meets my needs better than contemporary Macs do, at a (sometimes much) lower price point. You get what you pay for. What has stood out for me over the years is that the vast majority of Apple products prove the idiom, \u201cyou get what you pay for\u201d. While Apple products typically fetch a premium, 9 times out of 10 they\u2019re actually worth it. Virus and malware. For the vast majority of the Mac\u2019s history (let\u2019s say from 1984 to 2015, the year Windows 10 came out) Macs were virus and spyware free while the same could not be said for the Windows competition. Considering how much data has been lost over the years on Windows computers to viruses and malware that single fact has undoubtedly paid some Mac users dividends many times over. A single lost commercial project on a Windows computer would instantly swing the value proposition in Mac\u2019s favour. Productivity. Macs and now iPhones were and are also simpler to maintain and have allowed their users to perform more complicated tasks with less training than DOS and then Windows computers and now Android devices (Android is distinctly messier, less consistent and less stable than its iOS counterpart). This too pays dividends. For instance, in the early 90\u2019s it would\u2019ve been impossible to do any form of graphics work or serious word processing (without major training) on DOS or Windows 2.x/3.x while Macs chugged along. Macs allowed normal people to earn a good living while DOS/Windows only afforded that luxury to highly trained individuals. Win for Apple product. Resale value. Try reselling the vast majority of Android devices or Windows computers. Unless the device belonged to a desirable and unique line, chances are your Android/Windows device has lost a huge chunk of its value. By contrast, Apple products retain their value\u2014to the point where it\u2019s nearly worth paying that little bit extra to buy a new device with warranty rather than a really old used device. Yes, you pay more up front, but, you can sell them for much more later. For example, I\u2019ve been keeping my eye on a 2010-era Mac Mini to run as a headless Xamarin iOS compiler using Apple\u2019s iOS IDE. A Mac Mini from 2010 sells for between 1/2 and 2/3 (~$300-~$500) of its 2010 price (~$600+) in late 2017. By contrast, you\u2019d find it challenging to even give away a 7 year old $600 Windows desktop from 2010! ",

            "answer_text": "Updated Post: For Apple products from 2016 and earlier, I would say yes, they are worth the price (mainly because these are the ones I have the most experience with.) However, I will agree with the others that the iPhone X seems overpriced for what you get. After trying one in Target, I was a little bit underwhelmed by its performance. I was however, quite impressed with the new iPad Pro X performance, and I like that they switched to the more universal USB-C instead of the proprietary Lightning port. BUT\u2026 I am concerned about durability after seeing this bend test on Youtube. (Bend happens at 6:28 timestamp.)  Beside my current Apple products, I now also own an Eluktronics P650HP6 gaming laptop, and a Huawei P10+ Android smartphone (was a gift). So far I have been quite happy with the P650HP6 laptop, which currently has no hardware issues since getting it new on Mar. 2017. It has some of the best hardware I have seen at that price ($1300, Intel i7\u20137700HQ 2.8 GHz., 16 GB RAM, 256GB SSD + 1TB hard-drive, Nvidia GeForce GTX 1060 6GB VRAM). I got it to render 3D projects in Blender, and run graphically intensive games for use in machinima. Windows 10 can be a pain in the neck sometimes, especially because of the automatic updates, but I found a way to shut that off. I have noticed more minor glitches and hiccups compared to Mac's OS X. Overall, I would gladly purchase this laptop over any of the flagships offered by Dell, Asus, or Lenovo. I might consider HP, but so far Eluktronics is my go-to for pre-built Windows-based machines. I still use my BootCamped iMac for family gaming and occasional workflow. I am hot and cold about the Huawei P10+. I love the camera for photos, (but am disappointed in the video quality, which lacks in indoor conditions when compared to my sister's iPhone 6S Plus or my iPad Pro.). I do appreciate the higher versatility of the Android platform (when compared to iOS). However, I am not impressed with the occasional lags its gets, especially when the P10+ supposedly has an octa-core CPU, Kirin 960 chipset, and 6GB of RAM. (Also supposedly it has a high-end GPU.) I have found, app optimization for this specific smartphone is poor. I play a 3D mobile game called Noblemen that runs at 60 FPS and medium-high graphics settings on my iPad Pro (2016 model), but the P10+ struggles even at 30 FPS at medium settings. Also, Stopmotion Studio unfortunately performs poorly on the P10+, which gives me muxer errors when I try to render or export the videos (the same app runs flawlessly on my iPad). Another issue I have with the P10+ is the battery life. Even with battery optimizing apps, there is a slew of background processes that drain it's battery with a few days, even if it's not being used by me. I am considering getting the somewhat old Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge, which would probably have much better optimization than the Huawei P10+, due to the S7 Edge being a more well known device. On another comparison (headphones): I have several 3.5 mm AUX jack versions of the Apple Earpod. For $13 new and OEM from Ebay, the sound quality has a bit more depth and color than my SkullCandy Ink'd wireless earbuds (However, this may change after I use the Ink'd earbuds more and \"burn them in\" a bit. I got the Ink'd earbuds for $35 on sale at my local Target, but they are usually $50). Additionally, the Earpods even rival the clarity of my mom's $150 Bose Soundlink On-Ear headphones. Surprisingly, it was Target's $20 HeyDay brand wireless earbuds that had almost the same sound quality as my Earpods (however, I returned them due to the unreliable battery life.) Dec. 24, 2018, Changes since original post: My iPad 3's battery recently went caput after lending it to my mom for movie watching, and we neglected to charge it. Its battery went below 20% for too long. I usually try to maintain 40% to 80% battery capacity on my devices before storing for periods longer than 1 month, but unfortunately as they say, \"out of sight, out of mind.\" My sister has upgraded from her 5C to an 6S Plus (bought used) that she utilizes as her daily \"computer\"\u2026 drawing art, watching videos, reading articles and such. My mom upgraded from her 5C to a 6S. I use her 5C now, since I only need it for calls, and use my iPad Pro as my main device. I recommended to 6S series to them due to the balance of price, performance, and usable longevity (the 64-bit architecture should allow them to upgrade to iOS 13 and most likely a few more later iterations.) Original Post: (Note: some points in the original are now outdated. Refer to above for updated info.) Short answer: No, Apple products are not unnecessarily expensive. Long Answer: I live in Hawaii where the humidity is nearly 100%. Humidity + Electronics = No good. I own the following: iPad Pro 9.7\u2033 (aka: iPad 7), iPad 3, iPod Touch 5, iPad 1, iPhone 4, 2013 iMac 27\u2033, and a 2012 Macbook Pro 15\u2033. I love them. All my machines are currently fully functional except for the 2012 Macbook Pro (It's logic board is about to give out. It's lasted 5 years without repairs, so far. I bought it new.). My sister owns the following: iPhone 5C, iPhone 4S, and a 2013 Macbook 13\u2033. Her iPhone 4S' speakers and volume buttons are shot, but the rest of the phone still works. (Lasted 5 years so far. We bought it new.) Her iPhone 5C screen is beginning to loosen, but otherwise it functions properly. (Lasted 2 years, so far. Seller refurbished. My fault.) Her Macbook Pro is running swell for more than a year, so far. (Bought new.) My mom owns the following: iPhone 5C, iPod Touch 1, 2010 iMac 21.5\", 2008 Macbook Pro 15\u2033, 2008 Macbook 13\u2033, and a 2005 eMac. All her mobile devices are still fully functional. Her Macbooks conked out back in 2012 (they lasted about 4 to 5 years. Bought them new). Her 2010 iMac had a hard-drive failure, but a friend got it replaced for us and now the iMac is back in business (ran a total of 6 to 7 years before the harddrive failure. We bought it used.). Heck, I'm pretty sure if I pulled her old eMac out, it would still boot today. Probably the other biggest selling point on Apple products for me is their customer support. Unfortunately, I have noticed that recently their support has not been as stellar. But is is still significantly better than say the customer support of Dell, Asus, or HP, in my humble observations. I have been doing a lot of research on high-end laptops from HP, Lenovo, Dell, etc. I noticed that a lot of their products (even their top-line models) are receiving a lot of negative reviews. Look up reviews on the Dell Inspiron, HP Spectre, Asus Zenbook & ROG, and Lenovo Thinkpad high-end product lines, while you're on Amazon. Many of their negative reviews talk about recurring issues and provide substantial details on what went wrong with their machines (sometimes within weeks or months of receiving them). As mentioned above, I noticed a lot of people were having bad experiences with their customer support as well. I decided to look up reviews for the new Macbook Pro on Amazon just now, and I noticed it has a much higher percentage of substantial positive reviews. Of course, there was also a number of negative reviews that mentioned an unsatisfactory battery life and other issues, but I noticed many of these negative reviews were less detailed and less substantial (i.e. they didn\u2019t mention what they were running on their computer when they got a short battery life.) compared to the critical reviews provided by customers who had issues with their Dell, Asus, HP, Acer, and Lenovo computers. Sure, Apple products may not have the most impressive specs on paper. However, their machines (especially their mobile devices) have lasted our family a friggin' long time! To me, the specs on rivals' PCs (or even Android devices for that matter) don't mean much to me, if the machine will fail in such a short amount of time. And what\u2019s more is: why would I buy a computer if the company won\u2019t even stand behind their product? (Look at the Dell reviews especially.) I know this sounds strange, but this really is a place where the saying \"you get what you pay for\" is actually wrong in some cases. Take for example the high-end Asus Zenbooks which are over $2000. For the price, you would expect a high quality machine, yet there are many Amazon reviews pointing out major screen and longevity issues. You can get a Macbook Pro 15.4in. for around the same price, which has more consistent quality and performance. If you have a computer guru friend who can repair computers for you, then brand is less of a concern. It really then comes down to your budget, computer needs (i.e. gaming, graphics work, music production, etc.), how long you want the machines to last, and if customer service is an important aspect to you.

            "answer_text": "Yes, Apple products are way too overpriced. Good amount of folks who are buying it may be too much brand savvy or just for flamboyance purpose. Let\u2019s talk about the Macbooks Vs other computers. Refer to this laptop from Asus[1]. It has everything that what folks who are buying the Macbook would like to have. But still people try to follow others and simply blindly follows them. This laptop is at least $700-$1000 less than a corresponding Macbook. I only got a chance to work on Macbook when my employer provided it to me. In fact if you have grown on Windows or Linux - it\u2019s really very difficult or get used to Macbook. At least I don\u2019t prefer Mac OS over Linux or Windows 10. Worst thing - in Macbook everything is provided and controlled by Apple. You can have very less USB outlets, LAN cable requires a connector, external display preferably Apple and connector is Apple manufactured also. Everything is monopolized by Apple and there is no diversity in that ecosystem. Moreover Macbooks are not at all top of the line configurations\u2026they talk about all the buzz words - vertical integration etc\u2026but what is the price/performance matrix of these Apple devices? I am not even picking up Asus Zenbook. I bought this Lenovo Laptop from Costco during start of the year. It costs me only $800 plus taxes. I put another SSD and that\u2019s it. It\u2019s a rockstar laptop - I have dual boot Windows and Unubtu Linux and can do almost anything that my work or hobbies requires or what Macbook folks are doing. I don\u2019t want to impress the audience when I am presenting something from this laptop. It is backed by 4 years of warranty from Costco(2 years from Lenovo and 2 years of extended from Costco). And I am pretty sure that h/w and configuration will outdated after 4 years\u2026then what\u2026i will get another latest one at that time\u2026my expectation is if this laptop lasts for 2\u20133 years\u2026i got all my ROI\u20264th year is a bonus\u2026if i had bought Macbook -i have to pray that nothing goes wrong with it because it\u2019s monopoly support which is too expensive. Once I had a minor issue in the Retina display of employer provided Macbook\u2026took almost 3\u20134 months to get approvals and get it fixed. Yes, my Lenovo laptop gets hot after 2\u20133 hours of work but that\u2019s fine\u2026i can shut it down when i am stepping out for lunch or some meeting\u2026it\u2019s never burning hot\u2026moreover what ever money I had saved from buying this laptop\u2026I had a desktop also which is used in a very abusive manner by the kids and myself and it takes any load in the most stable manner. That desktop is also HP brought from Costco. I would suggest don\u2019t go for Apple products at all. It\u2019s never value for money. And I feel sorry for all those guys who are in big queues to buy the latest iPhone or iPads from Apple on the release day at Times Square\u2026sorry guys Apple won\u2019t make me buy any of their products using my own money\u2026if somebody provides it then also i have second thoughts to have it. Update Finally I came across Dell XPS 15 9560 model in 2018 at Costco and Newegg. Newegg had a refurbished one with one year Dell warranty. I bought it using my Discover Credit card which gives an additional year of warranty. I bought it from Newegg as there was no sales tax at that time. I got this nice laptop in just $1600.00  This one I am using for more than 2 years now. Dual boot Windows 10 professional and Ubuntu 18.04 LTS. It\u2019s Quad core, 32 GB RAM and 1 TB PCIe SSD with 4 GB Nvidia graphics card. This laptop is the Macbook killer. It\u2019s been bundled in 14 inches with a display of 15 inches. Display is 4K and once you work on this - you will forget retina display. So i have one of the best hardware with more flexible Windows and Linux O/S. If I want the same one in Mac - it will cost at least twice. And this one will last long with very high quality. Dell XPS laptops are very popular among Linux and Windows users. Look at this page where I have filtered the results for Dell XPS with 32 GB RAM and 1 TB PCIe NVME SSD. It is having touch screen-which is not offered in Mac Regarding few folks arguing about long lasting Macs - there are certainly very good high quality laptops in Windows/Linux - they won\u2019t go beyond $1600/$1800 mark with much better configuration than Mac. If these laptops lasts 4/5 years - you have got total ROI rather than paying $2500-$3000 for Mac and hoping it to last 10 years. Advancements in hardware are very rapid - you don\u2019t want to stick to something which is 3 or more years old. Worst thing - once you are in Apple\u2019s world - you are locked - everything you need to buy from Apple - not much 3rd party or OEM. Recently I got iphone8 from my job. I am using Oneplus phones since 2015. Trust me I don\u2019t feel like using iphone8. It has one major bug that unless you use speaker phone - you can\u2019t hear others and others can\u2019t hear you. Iphones cost at least twice of very nice quality Oneplus and I don\u2019t think they are any better than Oneplus.

It comes with 4 years of warranty also(2 years from Dell/Costco and 2 years from Citi Visa Costco card). Or https://www.costco.com/CatalogSearch?dept=All&keyword=Asus+zenbook Asus Zenbook Both of these laptops are real Macbook killer. Install dual boot Windows and Linux and I am telling you, you are not going to miss anything. Footnotes[1] ASUS ZenBook Pro UX501VW | Laptops | ASUS USA",

            "answer_text": "In my opinion...they are. I will refer to Macbook Pros only since I have used them for more than 8 years now. While they might be the same price as other Windows laptops when you buy them, they turn out expensive when things go wrong with it. For example, on the latest macbooks, if the disks fail, you HAVE to buy only from Apple and this means...expensive. Same thing for RAM. Not user replaceable.  Personally, over the last 8 years, I have been through 3 laptops ... ALL of which failed because of the graphics cards. The 2007 (8600M GT), 2010(330M) and the 2011(AMD). All the three models suffered from manufacturing/design flaws that Apple simply refuses to own upto. Until of course there is a lawsuit involved. I think the first and the last one have resulted in a class action lawsuit against Apple. The most infuriating aspect of the whole ordeal is that even the replacements are not guaranteed to last. I sold all three, for a pittance, once I got them repaired.  So, reliability, that Apple is so f'in famous for. Nope. In fact, the 2011 model almost cost me a job. It crashed 3 times during a timed programming test. Thank god my IDE saves automatically. So yeah...Apple is not the knight it is made out to be. And one last thing, when things go wrong, you are supposed to travel to the Apple service centre/store, leave your laptop there for 1 or 2 weeks (my second laptop was there for nearly 3!). So what the hell am I supposed to do for that long without a laptop! Why does it take so long to repair? Backlog of too many Apple computers to repair ? :-) At present, I  gave in and bought a Dell Precision. Yeah, it is thicker and little heavier. But boy is it reliable. Spill resistant keyboard (yeah...wonder why Apple designs do not incorporate this ).Better thermal management and really user serviceable. Case when one of the hard disks failed (yeah..it has got three slots for hard disks! ), I got a technician come to my place the very NEXT day and replaced the hard disk! Wow! And then I was thinking, why the hell am I on these spinning disks in 2014? Good deals abound on SSDs these days....sold the spinners that came with my Dell and purchased two SSDs off Amazon for a  grand total of 300$! Installing these disks on the laptop was a breeze!  The only thorn...Windows 8. It is not as streamlined with OSX BUT it is just as reliable. Never had a single crash...a single beachball...so far. I have had more issues in Mt.Lion/Mavericks (wifi, random freezes, random reboots etc) than on Windows 8. Yet like a crazed drug addict, I crave for OSX cause I love how organized it is...great trackpad....time machine...airplay. Mind you, this is not about stability...Windows is really stable but wish it was more thought-through. Hopefully, Windows 10 moves things along. So yeah, Apple's OSX is good, hardware is well designed but I think that comes at the cost of reliability and user serviceability (meaning you are tied to Apple's expensive repairs/replacements) ==> implies that Apple hardware is truly overpriced in the long run.

            "answer_text": "Ok, so this is quite a tough one as from my perspective there are a few reasons that anyone could tell you and a few that most people overlook. Because they make quality devices: Apple has a history of pricey products and they get away with it because of brand loyalty. However simply stating \u201cbrand loyalty\u201d is a weak point as the company must have done something to earn such a thing. The products Apple make are usually extremely well made, top of the line and very premium in the build. Whatever people may say a good looking device will sell better than a similar competitor in specs if the said competitor is less attractive. iDevices have that bespoke look to them that I don\u2019t think any other ecosystem has been able to replicate yet. You could take a glance at a closed Macbook and tell it\u2019s an Apple product without even seeing the logo on top. So yes, in a way the first point is that Apple can price their products higher than similar competitors because they are the best-designed devices on the planet. Some could argue but there hasn\u2019t been a single iPhone that for its time look bad or felt cheap. Apple always prioritises quality. A trait many people flock to. Because they\u2019re Apple! : I personally don\u2019t agree with this one but many people will simply state that the buyers are so indoctrinated by now that the iOS and MacOS users simply cannot switch away from their iPhones or Macs etc. And while yes I would agree many find it hard to leave the Apple bubble this isn\u2019t because the user gets withdrawal from not having an apple logo on their device it\u2019s for many other reasons which I hope to cover below. Apple\u2019s Operating Systems: Need I say more? If I purely focus on iOS for the minute (as this is the OS I know more about vs MacOS) I can conclude that it is a masterpiece of software engineering and one of the best mobile OS\u2019s ever devised. It boasts features that many people find indispensable and thus switching away is much harder. Using iMessage as an example many users would feel lost without it! It\u2019s such a natural thing to many iPhone users that when they are presented with an Android device they forget that they can\u2019t just send pictures easily anymore or they can\u2019t send files and attachments without using a secondary app such as WhatsApp or FB Messenger. I could go on and on listing feature after feature but you get the idea. iOS, and MacOS by extension, just work and for many casual users who aren\u2019t interested in customisation or tweaking their device, this is a dream come true. When Apple released the first iPhone it was a breath of fresh air in a world dominated by clunky, complex and slow mobile devices. Hell, have you seen Android 1.0? THIS is what built that famous Apple Sheep culture. Not the fact that they were born and instantly wanted an iPhone but because Apple earned that trust. People are willing to spend more money if they feel safe in the purchase. iPhones as far back as the 5s are STILL getting updates 5 years down the line. It comforts buyers that their purchase is going to be supported. Meanwhile, if you bought a Galaxy S8 only 1 year ago chances are you may see Android P sometime next year and then that\u2019s it! 2 years of slow, patchy support then nothing. The Hardware-Software Issue: This is a point I feel not many people tend to make but I feel it is the most important factor at play here. Samsung as a company make smartphones and other devices. OnePlus makes smartphones and other devices. Dell makes laptops and desktop PCs. You know what all of these companies have in common that Apple does not? Samsung and OnePlus make the hardware for their devices. They design the body, the framework and how everything is going to come together but many of the key components are made externally by companies such as Qualcomm and Intel. Apple meanwhile makes their SoC (System on a chip, basically the CPU, wireless receiver etc) in-house, as in by themselves. They have to put the money into R&D, prototyping then mass-production while someone like Qualcomm does that and mass produces many more chips than Apple and can thus lower its cost. Tens of companies buy Qualcomm's many chips but Apple has to make a profit on its own home-designed components and relies solely on people buying the full device to cover all their costs. Note: Devices like the Mac Pro etc do not face this hardware issue as they seem to simply use Intel processors and Vega GPU\u2019s etc. Now onto software! This is the exact same story as hardware as while Samsung can make a phone packed with plenty of hardware features and then pay Google the usage fee for Android; Apple has to innovate and create new versions of iOS and MacOS alongside its new devices which again costs money in R&D. Samsung or Dell etc can simply let Google or Microsoft do all the legwork in the software then either just sell it or whack a skin on it and update your device; the usage fee still hasn't changed. So to conclude this point in a short TL:DR I would simply say that for most other competitors you pay for the hardware of the device, the physical thing in your hand or on your desk while it runs software someone else develops and updates. With an apple device you are also buying the hardware but you also almost buy a licence to use the software apple themselves have developed; you pay for the development of both sides to the device, not just one and a half. Overall I stand by my final point and my first point as the reason Apple products are so expensive but my middle points were more for the \u201cbut why do people buy them if they\u2019re so expensive\u201d. So perhaps the real answer is \u2018Because people still buy them\u2019? A product, in reality, is only worth what people are willing to pay but as the general consumer base has decided that the hardware and software bundle is worthwhile then who are we to argue? ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, specifically the iPhone X  Source: Apple.com I own an iPhone X since its launch, and I don\u2019t really like it anymore. Back in September, I was so hyped by it that I was not even phased with the ridiculous price if USD$999, and I even got it for my birthday on the 27th of October, which was conveniently also the start of its pre-sale! I used to own an Phone 6s that was still working fairly well. I waited until 8pm NZT to be able to pre-order mine, once I FINALLY got into the link and purchased one, the waiting time was 3 weeks. I was so excited!Then around 2nd week of November, I got the phone. It was gorgeous. It felt like a different device from my old iPhone, and just like any other new iPhone X users, I played around with Animoji. As the following months come by, my experience with the Phone has been less enthusiastic. It is very fragile and heavy. I always have to be careful using it so I won\u2019t carelessly drop it to the ground and pay an arm and a leg to have it repaired. I cant hold on to the phone for more that 10 minutes straight without stretching my fingers, as the phone strains your hand as you use it longer.Photos are amazing though, but apart from the Portrait mode, I felt that the overall image quality was not that of a BIG improvement from my old 6s, especially the front facing camera. I also realized that compared to the other phones, iPhone X Front Portrait mode kinda sucks. After all these months, I had to ask myself this question: Is the phone worth $999 (NZ$ 1,849.00)? Absolutely NOT. I really miss the old iPhones back in 2010\u201312. The 3.5in screen was the most convenient iPhone for me. Although the screen size is not as big, the ease of use is miles ahead of the iPhone X. If you want a bigger screen, get an iPad. Conclusion: Apple products always look absolutely gorgeous, but the expensive price does not match with the quality and iPhone expectations. The biggest problem with Apple is as their Price increases, product value, quality and reliability remained the same since 2013 (In my opinion). This may be my last iPhone that I will use\u2026 \u2026and yes, consider me a sucker for buying this phone for that price\u2026 ",

            "answer_text": "Many people have already approached this question from the angle that 'overpriced' is an emotional, not a quantitative, measure. If people buy something, it isn't 'overpriced' by definition. I'd like to approach the question from a different perspective: that is, Apple products are not more expensive than non-Apple products. Yes, you can buy a cheap laptop for $300, but all Apple laptops are more expensive than $300. However, when you compare feature to feature, you generally find that Apple isn't more expensive than other products, and in many cases is cheaper. Let's look at the single most astronomically expensive product you can currently buy from Apple: the Mac Pro. As a desktop computer, it has an eyewatering price tag: the baseline system starts at $3,000 and goes up from there. You can get a desktop PC for far less than $3,000. But let's put together an equivalent PC, shall we? The baseline Mac Pro comes with a 4-core Intel Xeon E5 processor, 40GB/s PCIe, 4-channel DDR3 ECC RAM (up to 64 GB supported) clocked at 1866 MHz, PCIe SSD, six Thunderbolt 2 ports, and comes standard even in the bottom-end configuration with two AMD FirePro graphics cards with 2 GB VRAM standard per card (expandable to 6 GB per card). When we start to assemble an equivalent system from another vendor, the price gets really high really fast.  Dell offers a Xeon E5-based workstation for $1,400 if you're a preferred customer (street price is $1,800). But it has slower, non-ECC RAM clocked at 1300 MHz, a serial ATA hard drive rather than an SSD, and only one FirePro graphics card with only 1 GB of VRAM. It is not available with dual FirePros from Dell, and an SSD is not available from Dell--which means going to third-party vendors for those upgrades. Upgrading to a second FirePro will set you back another $650. That alone brings the Dell just over $2,000. An SSD to replace the hard drive adds another $650, so now you're up to $2,700, or $3,000 street. If you want ECC memory you'll have to jump up to the next tier of computers, and it's still only 1600 MHz; as near as I can tell, you can't get 1866 MHz RAM from Dell. Oh, and no Thunderbolt. Adding six ThunderBolt 2 ports adds $916 to the price, for a total of $3,616 preferred buyer, or $3,916 street. And you haven't built an equivalent system: the RAM is slower, and one of the graphics cards only has 1 GB of VRAM. You can do the same calculations with other Macs. The Mac laptop I'm typing this on cost $1,900; it has 16 GB of RAM, separate nVidia graphics, and an Intel Core i7 processor. You can buy a Dell laptop for $269, but it is not an equivalent machine. A dell laptop with the same specs as this system will cost you a minimum of $2,029 on Dell's Web site. So if Apple is \"overpriced,\" so is everyone else! ",

            "answer_text": "The simple answer: it depends on your point of view. Apple products are well designed, incorporate, usually cutting edge tecnologies, are innovative and extremely reliable. Apple products also hold their value better than any comparable brand. Why is Apple able to command the premium prices it does when there are other products that, on the surface, have as good or even better specifications? - Apple controls its own ecosystem. It both produces the hardware (yes, I understand that it is not necessarily manufactured in North America but that factor applies to almost all name brands, ie. their claim to be from a particular country is more about design and development than it is about actual manufacture.) and it designs and produces the operating system - one that has a more coherent and substantial base than the majority, if not all, of its competitors. That Apple is in control of both hardware and software is the crucial factor in their success. The only time that their share price took a substantial hit was when they were under the charge of an ext soft-drink CEO who decide that licensing the sortware would be a good idea. It was a disaster. Overnight, clones appeared that had no quality control, were cheaply produced, and simply competed to offer higher and higher specifications without any comprehensive testing or recognition of what the components could reasonably reliably provide. Apple is never-the-less not the company it used to be. Its ethos, in my view, has changed considerably since the death of Steve Jobs. Form a company that was truly concerned with the user experience, it has become a company more focused on remaining at the top of the heap. From a first and foremost computer manufacturer, it has become a manufacturer of consumer desires. I don\u2019t think that this change is good and, in the long term, I see it as being the demise of Apple. So, are the Apple products over-priced? No. However you can purchase what have similar or better specifications for less cost. Whether those products will be reliable, work as well, maintain their value, or have legacy benefits, is highly debatable but very doubtful. Apple remain, in my view, a better consumer product than those offered by its competitors and fairly priced.. How long that continues to be the case, sadly, I think is limited. ",

            "answer_text": "Original question: Are Apple products overpriced? Beauty is in the eye of the beholder and fair value is in the mind of the consumer. For me, most Apple products are out of my price range, however Apple has the best touch screens I have seen on the iphone and ipad. I can actually type well enough to be shocked. Everything else I hate typing on a touchscreen. People who use Apple computers use the same system for years, usually years after a similarly equipped Windows system would have been replaced. When I did technical support, I worked on very few Apple systems, because either Apple users support each other or they just do not have the issues that Windows users have. Apples prices are probably not significantly higher than any other computer company that makes everything from the top down - their own operating system, single hardware vendor (Apple, or Sun or Silicon Graphics). Comparing Apple to the PC market or Android devices is not really a fair comparison, especially in the Wintel market. Windows computers are commodity devices. Literally, you can go to the right store or web site and purchase every thing you need to build the system of your dreams. Then all you need to do is purchase a Windows license and install Windows or install one of the many other operating systems that is available like Linux, Minix, Android and even commercial UNIX operating system versions like Solaris. With Apple, Apple makes or has a contracted factory make the hardware, they produce and compile the operating system and many of the programs for the system. In the end it just fits better like a custom suit as opposed to a suit off the rack that has been tailored to your measurements. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes. Which is a measure of today\u2019s world because the one who makes the most money over charges for selling far fewer devices than Samsung and probably Sony and LG too around the world (not just the world Americans know i.e. North America) when these 3 companies are the real inventors, pioneers and invest in real technological advances. Apple pioneers nothing and with its obscene utilisation of the American patent office and law suits deserves condemnation for preventing other companies from advancing out of fear of been sued where Apple is shown as not been markedly worth what their marketing team advertise there products as being worth. \u00b7 Taken from Display Mate who are neutral Galaxy Note8 OLED Display Technology Shoot-Out \u201cThe Best Smartphone Display The Galaxy Note8 is the latest in a new generation of OLED Smartphones that have a Full Screen Display design like the Galaxy S8. It has many major and important state-of-the-art display performance enhancements, features and functions, with mobile OLED display technology now advancing faster than ever. The Galaxy Note8 is the most innovative and high performance Smartphone display that we have ever lab tested. So the Galaxy Note8 becomes the Best Performing Smartphone Display, earning DisplayMate\u2019s highest ever A+ grade. A new full 100% DCI-P3 Color Gamut and Digital Cinema mode that is also used for 4K Ultra HD TVs, so the Galaxy S8 can display the latest high-end 4K video content. The DCI-P3 Gamut is 26 percent larger than the Rec.709 Gamut that is used in 2K Full HD TVs. The Galaxy S8 is the first Smartphone to be certified by the UHD Alliance for Mobile HDR Premium, which allows it to play all of the same 4K High Dynamic Range content produced for 4K UHD Premium TVs. Yet more pioneering; Another world first and set the industry standards for others to follow, including Apple now that resolution is practically a waste of time on mobile device small screen form factors though for 20 / 20 vision and below, so anything above could appreciate better resolution) given viewable screen size limitations compared to a television. \u00b7 Multiple Screen Modes and Color Management One very important capability of the Galaxy Smartphones that is often overlooked by many consumers and reviewers, is the set of user selectable Screen Modes that are available under Display Settings, which we cover and measure each one in detail below. Most Smartphones and Tablets only provide a single fixed factory display Color Gamut and color calibration, with no way for the user to alter it based on content, personal preferences, running applications, or Ambient Light levels. A very important capability provided by the OLED Galaxy Smartphones is the implementation of Color Management that provides a number of user selectable Screen Modes, each with different Color Gamuts and levels of Color Saturation and display calibration based on user and application preferences. Color Management with multiple and varying Color Gamuts are a very useful and important state-of-the-art capability that all manufacturers will need to provide in the future.\u201d \u00b7 Taken from the Apple site regarding iPhone X - Our vision has always been to create an iPhone that is entirely screen. Lucky for them Samsung allowed them to realise it and did is first with S8 and S8 plus device and trialed it with S6, S6 Edge, Note 6, S7, S7 edge and Note 7. All that risk and negative press along with large form factor phones, which again Samsung footed the bill and bad reputation to actually set the standard for Apple to merely buy the technology and use that lie of a line. \u00b7 Super Retina Display - With iPhone X, the device is the display. An all-new 5.8-inch Super Retina screen fills the hand and dazzles the eyes. Super Retina. Really? Do you see Samsung using these silly monikers! That\u2019s not a question. Human retina\u2019s can see much more than this The Human Eye Specifications - 576MP!. \u00b7 Innovative Technology - The display employs new techniques and technology to precisely follow the curves of the design, all the way to the elegantly rounded corners. No it doesn\u2019t. Samsung was first and then Apple use Samsung technology. Where is Apple being innovative in using technology pioneered and designed by their direct technology because they knew they had to because they are not relevant without Samsung. Taken from DisplayMate Galaxy S8 OLED Display Technology Shoot-Out. Yet another first from Samsung and once again leading the field in yet another area. Where\u2019s Apple innovation? \u201cThe Future of OLED Smartphones The Galaxy S8 is the first in a new generation of OLED Smartphones. OLEDs have now evolved and emerged as the premium mobile Smartphone display technology. There is no better confirmation of this than a series of well founded rumors from a number of prominent publications that Apple will be switching its top-of-the-line iPhone model to an OLED display in 2017. More than two dozen manufacturers already make OLED Smartphones, and the new Full Screen Display design using a flexible OLED will be the new Flagship for all the upcoming future Top Tier Smartphones.\u201d LCDs are a great cutting edge high performance display technology for Tablets to TVs, but for small handheld Smartphones, OLED displays provide a number of significant advantages over LCDs including: being much thinner, much lighter, without needing a bezel providing a rimless edge-to-edge design. They can be made flexible and into curved screens, plus they have a very fast response time, better viewing angles, and an always-on display mode. Many of the OLED performance advantages result from the fact that every single sub-pixel in an OLED display is independently directly electrically powered to emit light, so only the active image sub-pixels draw power based on their individual brightness levels. OLEDs can also provide better color accuracy, image contrast accuracy, and screen uniformity because of variations in the Backlights of LCDs. As the result of their very versatile power management capabilities, OLEDs are not only more power efficient than LCDs for most image content, but they now deliver much higher peak Brightness than LCDs because the maximum power can delivered to just the sub-pixels that are needed for producing the current image. However, for mostly all white screen content LCDs are likely to remain brighter and more power efficient for a while. \u00b7 OLED Designed for iPhone - The first OLED screen that rises to the standards of iPhone, with accurate, stunning colours, true blacks, high brightness, and a 1,000,000 to 1 contrast ratio. Really? Samsung? Standards. Designed for Samsung by Samsung and then bought by Apple! What bold face lie. They don\u2019t have the skill or means to produce it themselves and has been around for 5 years on many Android phones. The first!? They know about Samsung. \u00b7 Wireless charging. Water and dust resistance - IP67 VS IP68 with all the competition for years. Wireless charging many years more as standard. Taken from DisplayMate, which limits everything up to iPhone 8 with screen readability limitations: \u00b7 Display Related Enhancements \u00b7 The Galaxy S8 is IP68 water resistant in up to 5 feet of water for up to half an hour, which means you can comfortably view the display in typical wet indoor and outdoor conditions \u2013 even carefully use it in a tub or shower, and it should be fine if you accidentally drop it in a sink or toilet. \u00b7 The Galaxy S8 can be used with Polarized Sunglasses in both the Portrait and Landscape orientations unlike LCDs, which generally work in only one of the two orientations. \u00b7 The Galaxy S8 has the new Gorilla Glass 5, which provides much higher resistance to breakage. \u00b7 The Galaxy S8 accepts a microSD card, which makes it easier to add large photo and video files. \u00b7 Neural Engine - Introducing A11 Bionic. The most powerful and smartest chip ever in a smartphone, with a neural engine that\u2019s capable of up to 600 billion operations per second. Samsung are leading the industry with their own production of the small west in the world CPU 10 nm processors http://www.samsung.com/semiconductor/minisite/Exynos/Newsroom/PressRelease/Samsung_Launches_Premium_Exynos_9_Series_Processor_Built_on_the_Worlds_First_10nm_FinFET_Process_Technology.html. \u00b7 Battery - inferior to much of the competition and about the worst high-end competitively. \u00b7 Finally, look at DisplayMate who are the world leaders of phone analysis, benchmarking and performance testing - Galaxy Note8 OLED Display Technology Shoot-Out iPhone X OLED Display Technology Shoot-Out - 4 paragraphs in are a personal highlight \u201cWithin a few years it became obvious that OLEDs would soon outperform LCDs, particularly in Smartphones. So the big question was when, not if, manufacturers would begin switching to OLED displays. For Apple, the transition was particularly difficult because it needs hundreds of millions of OLED displays, and Samsung Display was the only company manufacturing them in high volume.\u201d ",

            "answer_text": "I bought my iPhone 11 for $1,100 and yesterday it was reported that the cost is around $480 - so even though the price is double the cost, I tend to think that many of the Apple Products are overpriced. But, when we break down how much we use the device and what we get out of it\u2026 that may change. For example, I have been using GoPro cameras for years and they have a new one that just came out and the cost is $400 - $500. The iPhone 11 has a lens that provides me most of what the GoPro can do (Shoot wide in small areas). I was also considering upgrading a professional camera to take advantage of higher quality and faster auto-focus and that camera retails around $1,200 - so in essence with the iPhone 11, I don\u2019t need to upgrade either since with this latest iteration, I am able to take phenomenal photographs for my personal needs (Not doing this as a professional\u2026 more so as an enthusiast and a lover of nature). This month, I downloaded a program called Simplifi from Quicken and within two weeks am able to finally get control over my finances. The app works flawlessly with the iPhone and of course there is the web version. I also keep track of what I eat and I log my meals and I have a scale that I log my weight. In essence, I use my phone a lot as a PC throughout the day. I feel money well spent. My watch, though expensive, from Apple keeps me on track with my steps and has other features that makes my day a breeze. I have a Mac desktop that has 32gb memory and runs Windows 10 via Parallels for Mac - the computer was extremely expensive but taking care of it, should get 10 solid years or more out of it. I can remote into it via an inexpensive laptop. Same desktop from Dell or HP would set me back $600 cheaper - so I feel solid I got a better deal with something more stable for my needs. Provided it lasts 10 years, that is $310 a year. Not too bad. The MacBook Pros are priced very expensive and those are much harder to justify because Apple gets you on the memory and storage - which can add $600 or more to the base MacBook. If you were to compare Apples to Lenovo, for example, or even Dell - you would be spending possibly $700 more for the device and that is hard for a lot of people to do. On the other hand, once you buy it you will keep it for an extended amount of time. The MacBook Air is more in alignment with what I would expect a laptop to be but you don\u2019t get all that you do on the MacBook Pro. Most consumers would be fine with the MacBook Air. The Mac Pro is way overpriced unless you have ONE THING very specific that can only run on Mac OS. Sometimes it is worth it to spend a little bit more but on the other hand, there were decades of my life that I could not budget Apple products and I felt that they were elite. I switched to Apple in 2014 because I like the quality and their OS and I switched from Android to IOS in 2016 because I began to like what they were doing with their phones. When you have an Apple product and actually use it and carry it around with you or go to it if it is a desktop computer, then you feel the reliability and the quality and you feel that it is money well spent. Still, a company that has over $200 billion in cash in their bank accounts derived from profits\u2026 ya gotta think they can knock off $200 a product and still come out smelling like a rose. Keep in mind, they are making iPhone models at very different price groups and they are all very good quality. ",

            "answer_text": "This is something that comes up like Columbus Day\u2026 once a year and why do we do it? Apple isn't over priced. They charge what people are willing to pay. Some of their products were over priced and didn't do well but now have become like works of art\u2026 case in point, The Cube. Beautiful computer, WAY over priced, so, Apple didnt sell very many. There are other examples of this by all companies. Apples products do start at a higher price point because they include ALL the things you need to use the product out of the box. I have many clients that have PC\u2019s. They are cheaper, but they don't last as long, aren't worth much after 3 years, and when purchased new, needs other software or hardware to be really useful. No real mail client, no photos editor or database, no movie editor, no word processor, etc. Also the cheapest PC\u2019s are under powered and still defaulting to a spinning disk hard drive instead of an SSD that makes all the difference in the world. The prices are actually not far from each other when you put real, equal comparisons together. A Lenovo Yoga 920 14\u2033 is around $1500 compare to the 13\u2033 MacBook pro at $1500 or the 15\u2033 MacBook Pro at $2200. The Yoga is a great computer and I suggest it highly. But, The 13 MBP has a better processor, etc. and comes with everything you need to use it, right out of the box. Lastly, it comes down to an age old adage\u2026 \u201cYou get what you pay for\u201d. If you buy a low priced PC, you will get a low priced PC. You will need to buy or spend time on the web looking for software to amend or add to your low priced PC, and you shouldn't plan to keep it for long. The Mac has a long history of the hardware lasting a long time. Many of my clients are moving up to a new mac, not because their old mac is non-functional but because it is so old (8+ years) that they can no longer run the current macOS. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, they are. The only things that keep people with Apple are: brand loyalty, convenience, and technological illiteracy. How can I say they're overpriced? Simple: compare the specs of the hardware and you'll see Apple is overpriced. You can install the OSs on nearly anything. I won't discuss the brand loyalty part, but I'll discuss the other two along with a common rebutle I hear: \"life of the product.\" Convenience: The smartest thing Apple has done is complete integration and flawless of their services from mobile to laptop/desktop through the cloud. It keeps you loyal, it makes purchasing new machines easy, it's all around amazing. Microsoft has botched this a few times, but Google is fully capable of this, and tech-savvy consumers are able to set up their own cloud/backup servers through services like Plex. Tech Illiteracy: Most people don't know what the specs they're paying for mean, so competition doesn't really happen as intended when it comes to consumer-level tech. They buy based on brand because they dont know what their needs are or what each product's capabilities are. Additionally, consumers are much less likely to upgrade individual parts because of this (which is also much cheaper). Life of the Product: Yes, most of the time Apple products outlast their counterparts. However, that's a red herring, will your useage outlast the useage youd have on another device? For example, an iPhone may last 10 years, but if you upgrade your phone every 2, does it matter that the competitor only lasts 4? No. Also, your iPhone may work for 10 years, but will it work at an acceptable level for 10 years? Absolutely not. This argument more applies to phones than computers, but with computers I would dissuade you from purchasing completely new machines and instead upgrading piece by piece, transferring pieces when you purchase a new tower/case/laptop etc. as it much cheaper.

            "answer_text": "If people can build \"Hackintoshes,\" or computers with PC parts and software slightly modified to run macOS, at a much more inexpensive price point, you\u2019d think yes, right? However, you\u2019re gaining an extra learning curve, because it\u2019s not straightforward to get that computer up and running. Meanwhile, with Apple hardware, it\u2019s 110% seamless out of the box. As Steve Jobs said, \"It just works.\" Apple hardware and software is designed for ultra simplicity, so because Apple knows this, they tend to tack on that \u201cpremium\u201d price. Considering how much better Macs were in the past, I can say now they were competitively priced. Try getting a Windows-based laptop with discrete graphics today, and it\u2019s like $1800, while the MacBook Pros were in the $2500s. You do kind of get what you pay for, except Apple sort of forces you into a corner with living with less ports and limited specs. Yeah, the prices could still be a little lower, but again, it\u2019s all about paying for the complete integration. As an example, I have a Lenovo laptop I changed to a Hackintosh (bought for less than $1150), and it took a month or more to get it right. However, I still can\u2019t use Messages or FaceTime. On my actual Macs, it\u2019s not a problem. On the Hackintosh, I had to change the WiFi card for it to be more compatible, but if I wanted to, I can replace anything inside at any time, unlike actual Mac hardware, as everything is soldered in. I feel the fun of computing left with Steve, sadly, and Apple became just another technology company. Here\u2019s hoping the spirit comes back with the new modular Mac Pro, eh? Slight rant, but definitely food for thought. Thank you for the A2A. ",

            "answer_text": "Price is important, yes, but I think value is more important. Some people think Apple products are the sum of their parts. The problem with that assessment is, that if you take the numbers of, say, a Mac, and compare it with a PC on the basis of price, and you went just with that- then sure, you'd choose a $500 PC over a $1500 Mac. But I don't think anyone in their right mind would argue that the PC that is 3 times less expensive is better than the Mac. Why is that? Because Apple products have a certain essence to them. It's mostly due to OS X, the operating system every Mac that currently ships runs. The operating system is much safer, simpler, and more efficient than Windows in many ways, less vulnerable, at least. And despite having lower specifications, the Mac makes the best use of those specifications. The operating system is optimized for those specifications, and runs smoothly on it- faster than the PC with higher specs. It is also efficient on usage and power. The same argument goes towards every Apple product- especially the iPhone, where if you look at just the numbers, yes, a way cheaper Android phone smokes an iPhone. But if you look at how it performs in the real world, the iPhone wins by a long shot. And that's when specifications don't really matter anymore. This \"overpricing\" that you mention, is also due to a sort-of uniqueness and beauty to them- they're arguably the best looking and simplest designed of anything. They have a sort of quintessentialness to them. And this is why Apple can charge more for its products, despite likely not having the same or better specs than its rivals. ",

            "answer_text": "An Apple product is an Apple product. There are no two ways about it. The aura, the persona, the style, the feel, all is unmatched. Ask any hardcore Apple loyalist and you will get the answer. Apple products are not just about a bunch of hardware and software put together. The brand has positioned itself for the premium feel, elegant design and other factors which only Apple can stand by. It comes as no surprise then that the price associated with Apple is also on the higher side. Then again, it is debatable to say whether Apple products are over-priced. There is a difference between high & over\u201c. Apple fans will of course be of the opinion that Apple does not overcharge. In fact, they would be ready to pay any price that is placed alongside ownership of the much coveted Apple product. That is the power of brand Apple. It is enrapturing. It is beyond captivation. And so also speak the Nyasa Apple Outlets. There are Nyasa Apple Outlets in Nashik[1] also. We give prime importance to our customers. This would be conveyed by our effective customer service. What makes Apple Price worth it? Now lets take a look at a few rationalities that permit Apple to command the price that it does: Apple products usually do not face any issue and are supported longer in software. Owners of Apple products take not only great pride in their ownership but also devote care and attention to its proper usage \u2013 as they have paid big bucks for it of course! As result and also by default, Apple products retain better resale value. Apple products are very secure in nature and are not manufactured open-ended or open-source unlike many of its competitors in the similar stream. The Apple Product privacy policy is also very restrictive and rigid in nature. It does not allow sharing or selling of user information. Even the Apple App Store has strong quality check regulations before any app created by a developer is granted entry in the virtual store. The macOS from the Apple computing stable, is embarked with a proper terminal environment which makes them much more valuable work machines than PCs. Moreover, the macOS upgrades come at no cost. There are no variants, edition or user intended segregation to cater to different segments at varied price points. This justifies the upfront price or one-time investment in the Apple product, as it captures the manufacturing cost of the system along with the future version of the system. Apple products have been created such that each member of the brand family is completely synergistic with each other. The iOS ecosystem is made compatible with each of its clan affiliate so that processes and functioning can made similar and simultaneous for user convenience, also much to the advantage of the brand. When you buy an Apple Product you\u2019re not paying only for the hardware, you\u2019re entrusting them to maintain this network of stores along with a federated repair/support network. This is where your trusted partner, Nyasa Apple Store with its spread of Nyasa Apple Showrooms across the state has proven to be your reliable go-to partner for any query, purchase or servicing of Apple product bought. Whatever your question maybe, our equipped store attendant is always willing to be of assistance and guide you to utmost satisfaction. Footnotes[1] https://www.nyasa.info/",

            "answer_text": "Yes. because people tends to justify the price with the quality based on feeling. Does it mean that because apple product can perform this and that, therefore they should justify to sell at this price? We all know how much year end bonus they had. To earn money we understand. But they are earning really big bucks and it is because people are willing to pay. The market supplies its demand. For e.g mac air say selling at $1188 SGD. We roll down the pricing each time by $100. How much are u willing to pay for mac air? $1473 (256gb iphone x) $1398 (samsung note 8) $1248 (64gb iphone x) $1188 mac air/ iphone max+ 256gb $1088 256gb iphone 8 $988 64gb iphone 8+ $888 $788 64gb iphone 8 $688 $588 $488 $388 (maybe anything below here i might question its qc) $288 $188 $88 I think if apple product ranged from 488\u2013688 i would buy. 50% of their selling price. I believe their manufacture costs is only 25% or lower. Development costs is fixed so selling over certain numbers can recover. So just imagine a iphone x selling at $1473, sell 1 phone earn how many phone? Come on iphone x is more expensive than a laptop? Yes one may argue that the chip technology etc used in iphone is more advanced and difficult to produced etc but still so much difference? If the difference is big and apple is selling at marginal, their bonus would not be so attractive. Although the comparison is not apple to apple, in term of machines, but in term of dollars and cents, with the same amount of money, it is just illogical that a phone cost over a thousand. ",

            "answer_text": "With a Mac, I get the ability to develop for iOS. I don\u2019t get that with windows. If I develop on windows, I am forced to compile against a Mac running Xcode. That is part of the licensing requirements. Apple products do not compete against every product out there. Apple products compete against other vendors high end products. For example, I can go buy some parts from amazon and for about $900 have a fairly high end pc, I did this last week. That pc is great. I can\u2019t do any iOS development with it. I have a MacBook Pro from 2011. I have never had a laptop running Windows from dell or anyone else that has run like this for 7 years. Yes, they all need new batteries from time to time. It is running today and I use it productively today. I do my iOS development on it. The most I have ever gotten out of a windows based dell is about 5 years, and that was pushing it. Apple products don\u2019t come with nagware products already installed. Nagware is that stuff on windows that is constantly loading in, running, nagging you to register or do something, and taking up cpu cycles and network bandwidth to get you to do something. Nagware pays money to hw vendors to be on their computers. This drives the price down some amount. Given the time it takes to reformat a computer and start over, this right here offsets the price differences all by itself for me. Taking one day to put a computer into the state that I expected it to be in is just crazy. ",

            "answer_text": "You see...you are looking into a premium lineup of personal computers/phones which are very expensive indeed compared to their Windows/Ubuntu/Android based counterpart\u2026Apple is known for their build quality ,reputation,and their exclusive software featured in their iphones/ipads/Mac books\u2026.They are overpriced but can be justified\u2026they are more durable, \u2026.they are also reliable\u2026considering how common they are( Android is opensource,its free and lots of devices out there run on Android\u2026but IOS is exclusive for Apple\u2026..)they come with great specs\u2026a decent camera and a gorgeous screen\u2026.they will well last you over 2 years\u2026its just a premium\u2026..likewise with the Macbooks\u2026.they come well equipped,are of great build quality,excellent after sales services,and now-a-days are more apps are supported and day to day usability is more practical\u2026..and actually more secure than most Android smartphones\u2026.they also have good resale value\u2026.This is simplest way to put it\u2026without going deep into specs\u2026\u2026I feel its justifiable to pay another 20\u201330% more than a top tier laptop/phone/tablet out there\u2026considering the fact you are buying premium\u2026..but my explanation was more like why an Apple product is better\u2026.probably you could relate to the market out thereOther points to be noted:1.)Apple has their own chipsets for their iphones/ipads\u2026unlike other manufacturers who depend on MediaTek\u2026Qualcomm\u2026..Nvidia2.)They have not segregated their products by affordability\u2026..you can see the same quality grade in all their lineups from the Iphone SE to the Iphone 73.)They spend a lot on R&D4.)they just don\u2019t compete in the budget market\u2026In other words its just not right to say they are overpriced \u2026.they just deliver the market demand\u2026if they were affordable to anyone\u2026the sole purpose of their exclusivity is lost\u2026\u2026\u2026just like comparing a Honda to a BMW\u2026they both manufacture cars\u2026only BMW has their whole line up of luxury cars..when Honda has a few\u2026only cheaper and more affordable.I hope this helped.

            "answer_text": "No! First, lets start with the iMac Pro\u2026 A $4,999 insane beast. Quite powerful. According to ZDnet.com a self made windows 7 computer with approximately the same specs, would cost a whopping $4,686.71, just over $300 cheaper. Thats a 16% difference. Now the Radeon Vega in the mac is non-existent, because it is not out yet to any other computers. The iMac Pro also has speakers, a facetime camera, a support center\u2026 I could go on and on. In the end, apple is premium. That is a fact that brings this to a ASTOUNDING deal.  The iPhone X\u2026 A processor the power of the computer i'm using right now (a early 2014 MacBook Air) in a phone. For $999. Plus and \u201cinfinity screen\u201d. And a 4K camera. And a OLED screen\u2026 And well, Everything.  The iPad Pro\u2026 It just awsome. Get an apple pencil and shut up :D   A MacBook Pro. A $1500 with the specs of a $1200 computer. But premium. And long lasting. And apple\u2026 Okay I will stop here, I think you get it\u2026 (right?)  And oh! Remember the iPhone X? Facal recognition too!  P.S. This is my first answer to anything on Quora!

            "answer_text": "No. As long as people pay for them, they right priced. There are a lot of things to consider. You might either select buying product A or product B, say at the same price. One might be overpriced and the other underpriced. But, why? Both costs the same. One of the reasons it might be, one product is made to last, has many features, well designed, and the other, isn\u2019t. Another is that the company backing product A gives a better service (not cheaper, but maybe will suppport the product longer, have options to fix the product if out of warranty, have more tech centers), so that if you go with product A you will have a more reliable product over time. Another reason might be simplicity, product A has fewer options, but they are enough for what you do, but B is more complex and you need more time learning how to use it. Another is resale value, product A might let you sell it in 2 or 3 years and don\u2019t loose as much money as product B. Another is status, some people like that. It\u2019s not that they like to tell everybody, \u201cHey, I bought an Apple product!\u201d, but they like to have good products. An Audi cost more than a VW, even when both serve to move you from A to B. I somehow have never really loved an Apple product, for the way I use the products, there has always been something that I don\u2019t really like, but that does not mean that I don\u2019t know that their products are good and they are a good investment.

            "answer_text": "Price is a flexible thing. In general, if a person WILL pay the price, then it\u2019s correctly priced for that person, individually. If a lot of individuals make the same decision, then you have a pricing consensus on the value of the product - that is a market and a market price. A secondary aspect: does Apple make back their invested cost in the product and also hit their targeted profits. That is NOT the concern of buyers directly, though Apple\u2019s success is an owners concern - they get more value from a success product than a failed product via the Apple ecosystem such as the iTunes and App stores. I just bought the new iPad Pro yesterday. It was not as cheap as a cup of coffee or even plane ticket across the country, but it was \u201ccorrectly priced\u201d for me because I was willing to pay the price asked. We will see how many others will agree with my choice and do the same. Given Apple\u2019s track record, it probably will be a success in both creating a market and providing for sustained owner value. Now are there some for whom this is all ridiculous - that is, they can\u2019t see paying that much money, so the issue of owner value doesn\u2019t even matter? Absolutely. For some, the buying choice will be \u201cno\u201d simply because of price because they are not \u201csold\u201d on the value proposition. And that\u2019s a perfectly fine thing. It\u2019s good thing because that means there is room for competition. Strictly Apple is no where near a monopoly anyway but their pricing probably helps to assure that no one could ever call them one in addition to low double-digit market share. Simply being profitable does not a monopoly make. ",

You just don't have the budget.For Apple products, its mostly the first one. Why? Because you will realize the true value of a product when you own one and more importantly use one everyday. I was an avid windows fan, and I had windows everywhere, office, home and even the walls everywhere had windows (no pun intended). I use to come across apple products in an electronic shop and wonder why the hell are they so damn expensive. For God Sake, its just a personal computer or its just a phone. Long story short, I had to purchase an apple Macbook cause one of my clients required me to use a software that was only available on the mac platform. And phisssh, something happend. Without getting into too much details - Now I have apples everywhere - My iPhone, My MacBook Pro, My shiny new iMac, my iPad, my Apple Time Machnie Capsule - even my fruit basket never runs out of apples in my kitchen (no pun intended again). This is my  personal story. Moral of the story: Get one, Use it and not just use it, USE it for your everyday work and then decide if it was worth your money or ask this question on Quora. ",

            "answer_text": "They are relatively expensive compared to their competitors, but I think they are reasonably price, considering the quality of the exterior and the \u201cin-house\u201d operating systems. For example, the Microsoft Windows operating system is much more mainstream and is used in many computer brands, so they\u2019re able to price it lower because the distribution is wider. On the other hand, Apple Macintosh operating system is only exclusive among Apple products, so they need to raise the price up to keep up with the lower distribution of production. Imagine you have 2 products, product A and product B. You spent the same amount of money to develop product A and product B and they both have the same production cost. However, product A will be sold for 1,000,000 units per year, while product B only will only sell for 1,000 units per year. In order to get the same profit, product B has to be more expensive than product A. I also think Apple products have impressive exterior quality and materials. The Apple iPhone, for instance, feature aluminium body case, which is absent among its competitors. The iPhone\u2019s camera quality is also impressive. The speaker on Mac laptops are also impressive when compared to its competitors. Some say the Mac's operating system is faster than microsoft. Based on these, I personally think it\u2019s not overpriced, even if I\u2019m not a fan of Apple myself. ",

            "answer_text": "Apple is in the business of selling great user experiences, not simply hardware, or even a computer without a surrounding eco-system. Real innovation costs more time and money than slapping together off-the-shelf hardware and software from others. Apple\u2019s products are priced for their value, not their cost. In a highly competitive market, long term profits come from repeat customers who bring their friends. Millions of satisfied customers have determined that Apple products offer more in \u201cuse value\u201d than Apple charges in \u201ccash value\u201d. In many cases, Apple sets the \u201cprice umbrella\u201d meaning everyone else has to charge less to compete. If Apple lowered their prices, everyone else would too and you would still perceive they were more expensive. They just couldn\u2019t invest as much in building great products. Part of Apple\u2019s strategy is to not leave too much room for others to profit and thereby become stronger competitors. For example, the base iPhone 7 is now $499, last years iPhone 8 is $599, the iPhone XR is $849. Apple offers a range of price points to satisfy different customers. Based on their success, I think it\u2019s safe to say Apple is a very smart competitor and hard to beat in the areas they focus on. At the same time, there are areas Apple neglects where they are beaten all the time (like gaming or low end PCs). What distinguishes Apple is how much attention they pay to things that matter to a large base of consumers, even when they seem to be invisible. ",

            "answer_text": "Of course. You\u2019re paying for planned obsolesence (the practice of manufacturing products so that they stop working at 100% after a certain period of time or a certain determining factor is met/achieved). This is why Apple has churned out \u201cnew\u201d iPhones every year/year-and-a-half like clockwork since the iPhone 4. One clear example of an overpriced Apple product would be the ProStand, that sold for $999 usd, with a VESA-mount selling for $199 usd. We\u2019re talking about a monitor stand\u2026 it holds a monitor and provides height/tilt adjustment. One thousand dollars, for that? No thanks, I\u2019d fabricate my own; it wouldn\u2019t be pretty, but it\u2019d be functional. Not to mention all the proprietary hardware they\u2019ve included with many, if not all, of their products. They\u2019ve gone as far as manufacturing their own screws with custom screw-heads so that only techs employed by Apple can even open up a MacBook or iPhone to be able to diagnose a problem. So you\u2019re also paying the cost of having custom screws in your gear, and any service charges incurred when you send anything in for warranty. The performance factor isn\u2019t really justified. Most of the software present in Apple computers is optimized for the hardware present in said computers, which is why some of the same software won\u2019t perform as well when installed onto Windows-based systems. Not to mention that performance-wise, one is able to build a Windows-based system that is more powerful than anything Apple can throw out, for much less money, with the added benefit of being modular. If you want an Apple computer, my advice would be to build a PC and install a MacOS on it. It's completely possible, you're not breaking any laws or anything, besides hurting Apple's feelings when you do so (How to install macOS on your PC and create a 'Hackintosh'), because then they can't price gouge you when you need tech support or to replace a part in your system. They won't want to help to begin with because it wouldn't be a \u201cfull\u201d product of theirs, just the operating system. Stay away from the iPhone, there are better Android alternatives out there with actual current-gen tech instead of old tech marketed as new with a mere camera upgrade. Apple = Overpriced, no question about it. ",

Their thinking process goes like this- What are the technical specifications of the Apple device?What are the technical specifications of the non-Apple device?How much more does the Apple device cost than the non-Apple device, or how much better are the specs for the non-Apple device?Apple devices are overpriced because they cost more or have lower technical specs than the non-Apple device.This thinking is flawed. Why? Technical specifications don't capture the factors that are most important to the majority of users. Some examples of these factors might include: Tendency of the device to fail or reach an inconsistent, unusable stateConsistency of experiencePleasing aesthetics- good designQuality of the hardware design and buildQuality of the softwareHow well the hardware and software are integrated togetherHow well the products retain their valueThe ease of access to and responsiveness of customer serviceWhat do my coworkers or friends primarily use, and what benefits do I get from using a device in the same ecosystem?

A user's technology experience is only marginally about the latest CPU or GPU, camera resolution, or the amount of RAM or storage. A lot more goes into a quality experience than this. Apple isn't overpriced because they understand what their customers want and deliver it at a price they are willing to pay.  These iPhones look a lot like bars of gold, don't they? ",

Only $592,344.81 for the box (twelve tissues in all).Since \"overpriced\" \"has no real meaning\", I'm sure you'll be lining up to purchase a box or two, right? Sara Itani, BTW, excellent response. When people tag something as being overpriced, they are expressing an opinion regarding \"value\", or bang-for-the-buck. I may get my shirts on sale for $18, but to my very frugal father, that was not a good value, compared to his shirt (at $7). He placed \"value\" higher than \"fashion\" (obviously). This was many years ago, but I'm sure there were folks paying $150 or more for a shirt at the time. They decided they could afford it, liked the style, the design, and probably enjoyed the feeling of specialness it gave them. I've got some Apple products. They're pretty nice. Are they perfect? Not in any way. Are they head-and-shoulders above all other products on the market? Nope. Only a fanboy tool would claim otherwise; sorry, but that's reality. They are well-designed, attractive products which, due to advertising and other market forces, demand a higher price. Do they offer the best value? No way. Hence, they are overpriced, at least for people who  evaluate the value of things in an unemotional, practical fashion. Another commenter mentioned that Apple mobile products \" ... iPhones\" are \"actually cheaper than comparable products\". What's the weather like on your planet? Here on Earth, try comparing specs for any of the top Android phones to the current late-to-the-party Apple 6 devices. My old LG G2 compares quite favorably to a new Apple iPhone 6, and is dirt cheap price-wise. Your statement is ludicrous. ",

            "answer_text": "Oh definitely. But Apple has captured the premium market niche, which is price inelastic. This means that subtle changes in price do not significantly affect sales, and their pricing policies follow that. In fact, lowering their prices might actually damage their product market perception, and damage sales. Many decades ago a famous vacuum cleaner company over manufactured a particular model. The shipped out to their regular suppliers, and then out of desperation shipped the remainder to k-mart at a loss, hoping to recover some their costs. The result was interesting. The models sold to their regular suppliers sold well, but the same model sold cut-price at k-mart failed to sell. Investigating they found that the public perception was that the model sold through k-mart must be seriously flawed or a cheap knock off, so nobody wanted to buy it. Of those that did buy it from k-mart, customer satisfaction rate was significantly lower compared to their regular retailers. It is tempting to say that these people were fooling themselves, but the fact that the real value of a product is whatever the customer perceives it to be. Even if a product is good, if the customer is dissatisfied then they have not received value for money. This is why the correct pricing strategy is essential for bring a product to market, and at 98% satisfaction, clearly Apple has it right. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes and No. In the current market? Not really. Even android devices cost anywhere from $10-$2000+. Now why is it overpriced? Two answers. Again this does not only apply to Apple products. 1.) This applies to all devices. The actual worth of the device is hundreds of dollars cheaper. The only reason why it costs above $1000 is because of the logo. However this is how companies succeed and run a business\u2026.just like Samsing, Google,Lg, Sony and so on. 2.) It has come to a point that if one wants a device that runs well, he or she does not need to spend a $1000 or more. The answer? Oneplus devices, IPhone se, Google pixel a devices and so on. Otherwise known as \u201cbudget\" phones or flagship killers. I would say the latter due to there being a whole market of phones being even cheaper than those stated above that work well. The average user isn't going to be video editing or playing graphically intensive games nonstop. Can those devices play it well? of course. But there are even better devices. Or For example. I use a Samsung s9+ which is a couple years old. There are several Apple and Android devices that are newer. Is my device bad? Nope. It does everything I need to really well. Even if a person buys a phone a few years old like the s9+ or an iPhone x, they are not missing out on that much. These devices are still extremely capable and relevant. They offer a better bang for buck than the new devices that are \u201coverpriced\". ",

(Famous scenario is Galaxy note 9 vs XSmax) However, Do remember one thing. Apple charges what they believe the avarage user will think is a fair price. And never too high. You do need to remember a few things when you are talking about apple: Their OS isn\u2019t \u201cyet another skin of Android\u201d, it\u2019s a Whole whopping different OSTHAT OS is Unique to apple, there\u2019s no way you will find a Samsung or a Meizu or other brands running iOS.They build their devices on their own: what do I mean? Since the days of iPhone 5, they use components that are costum made. Like CPUs, GPUs, and custom orders of Modems. Etc.They have the longest Software lifetime. You are expected to recieve 5\u20136 major updates if you get an iPhone. Something that even the pixels are envying.And Lastly. It\u2019s the UX that matters to apple, they don\u2019t brag in numbers as it doesn\u2019t matter to the avarage joe. If you will advertise your phone has x mAh battery he will ask \u201cOkay, but how many hours of music, calling and browsing I can do?\u201d that\u2019s what matters.I am honestly an Android man. But I know a lot on iOS ",

And most of that extra margin that consumer have to pay is the brand value, much like how Louis Vuitton are overpriced products. But apple is NOT the LV of smartphones. Vertu is. So how does apple trick consumers into paying those exorbitant prices? Status symbol. They cultivated their brand as a luxury electronics brand. Owning the latest Iphone is like a owning a LV. BUT! But even middle class people CAN afford an iphone. So it is a status symbol, yet still affordable, though extremely expensive. So even people who only text, call, facebook, and who can't tell a difference between a picture taken by an iphone and a samsung will still line up at the apple store every year to get their hands on the gadget.Closed ecosystem. Apple products are very difficult to work with other manufacturers' products. So if you buy the macbook, then you have to buy the iphones etc.Style. Their products look good. People who care more about style generally do not give a damn about the specs or the extra price. This is why girls love iphones.I can say without a doubt that 90% of people who buy iphones and Macbooks don't need them. A $200 smartphone, and a $300 PC laptop will do most of what they need. But they WANT them, for the status. ",

            "answer_text": "No, Apple is not an expensive brand. The expensive brands are Samsung (who was the first to sell smartphones for more than $1,000, several years ago) and Huawei. Huawei sells its current foldable phone for $3500 and Samsung sells its foldable phone for $1,980, both of them have poorer performance than any iPhone made in the past two years so Samsung and Huawei are super expensive (especially if you look at what you get for those exorbitant prices). If you want to look at desktop computers and laptops, I have seen Windows desktops and laptops sell for nearly $20,000 at the top end. I used to have one of those desktops at work and that huge monstrosity was not worth its unbelievable price because 99% of the time I did not get any more work done than I did with my Mac that cost one quarter of that price or less. As for laptops the most expensive Windows laptops are gaming laptops (with external water coolers) that cost near $20,000 when fully equipped. Apple does not have anything near that price (you can buy several fully loaded MacBook Pros for that price), so no Apple is not an expensive brand. ",

            "answer_text": "Absolutely not, not for what they offer. I cannot remember the last time I had to reinstall MacOS/OSX. My Windows machine gets a reinstall of Windows at least twice a year and that is after a complete wipe of the HD. Then I get to reinstall all of the drivers and applications that I have on HD. What a waste of time. Since the base of MacOS is stable and only supports one manufacturer, Applications written for the Mac all have to meet certain criteria and put options in the exact same spot as every other application written for the Mac. On a Windows machine application A may have an option in one spot and application B have it in a different spot. That and there is no way to be sure that the application is going to act properly on every Wintel box out there. So, in conclusion, Macs tend to last longer, iPhones tend to last longer and both get longer support in their operating systems. More updates to the OS is a really good thing, lasting longer than their Wintel counterparts is a good thing. But most importantly, if you don\u2019t try using Apple products, you will never know what a quality product is. I have a 3rd Gen iPod Mini that still works like the day it was given to me. When was the last time you saw someone using a Zune? ",

            "answer_text": "Depends a bit on how you evaluate their products. I tend to look at computers from a performance per dollar point of view, and price to parts ratio, so I will be answering from that perspective accordingly. Parts to price, Apple\u2019s usually not bad, although when there is an exception, boy is it ever an exception. They tend to be within 50 to 200 dollars of the cost of hand making a rig with the same parts, which means that by prebuilder standards, Apple ranges from average to strongly above average in the part to price evaluation. However, this is only for the base config\u2019s. Some products, like the max config iMac Pro, are very heavily marked up from their parts cost, and that\u2019s without even mentioning most configurations of the Mac Pro. Performance per dollar however\u2026 Apple\u2019s usually not well regarded. Most of their products throttle in sustained heavy loads, and cannot achieve full standard rated boost clocks. Macbooks are especially infamous for this, even with the improvements to the latest models. So here, it\u2019s a pretty hard fail. If you like Apple, cool, but make no mistake. Performance per dollar is not something your getting. ",

I tried every single way to break it but it survived and i was glad that it was running on around iOS 12.5 something. why their products are overpriced here\u2019s the points to be noted:- 4\u20135 yrs of software backup which i guess is very good!camera which no other android devices provides!of course the apple tag you know if it\u2019s apple product then it\u2019ll be costly only!Apple know deep down people crave for having iPhones. In a country like India only around 10% Lucky people can afford their rich shit. Not everyone is rich blood! \ud83e\udd29\ud83e\udd29They always tries to provide a better chipset then the earlier but this doesn\u2019t mean the older ones are now useless. My friend has an iPhone X having a A11 chipset still fast as fu*k in 2020 no issues at all! \ud83d\ude33\ud83e\udd2fBest user experience and security you can have!premium feeling while holding the products. \ud83d\ude0c\ud83d\ude0cSo these are the things which make them costly and remember it\u2019s not the fault of apple that they\u2019re costly it\u2019s only us that we know apple has great products and we appreciate them a lot and the hype before any apple event you know! So they\u2019ll automatically raise their price or not? Think about this and you\u2019ll say yes \ud83d\udc4d \ud83d\udc4f Currently using and iPhone11 and it\u2019s \ud83d\ude18\ud83d\udd25 the only thing to hate about iPhones is battery \ud83d\udd0b battery \ud83d\udd0b battery \ud83d\udd0b nothing else.

            "answer_text": "Whenever people ask questions like this, I always come back to this quote from Thomas Sowell  \"The most fundamental reason why there is no such thing as an objective or \u201creal\u201d value is that there would be no rational basis for economic transactions if there were. When you pay 50 cents for a newspaper, obviously the only reason you do so is that the newspaper is more valuable to you than the 50 cents is. At the same time, the only reason people are willing to sell the newspaper is that 50 cents is more valuable to them than the newspaper is. If there were any such thing as a \u201creal\u201d or objective value of a newspaper\u2014or anything else\u2014neither the buyer nor the seller would benefit from making a transaction at a price equal to that objective value, since what would be acquired would be of no greater value than what was given up. In that case, why bother to make the transaction in the first place?\"  Sowell, Thomas (2010-12-28). Basic Economics: A Common Sense Guide to the Economy, 4th Edition (pp. 36-37). Perseus Books Group. Kindle Edition. In short, there is no such thing as \"real\" value -- so there's no objective definition of \"overpriced.\"  So really the question you should be asking is, \"why can Apple get away with charging so much for their products?\" I'll give you three reasons: Apple doesn't just make products -- they make emotional connections with people. They don't just lay out specs -- they lay out a central dogma of \"thinking different.\" Sure this all may be marketing mumbo jumbo. But it makes a big difference.Apple controls every aspect of their products down to the very pixel, which means that they can make experiences super consistent. Just compare iOS to Android. Whenever you complain about Android, people say \"yeah, well... you just didn't buy the right phone.\" Very rarely does the iPhone not meet customer expectations -- you usually know what you're getting yourself into when you buy one. And one bad experience can completely ruin the brand for people -- people still complain about blue screens of death in Windows even though they really don't happen anymore. Haven't seen one in over five years!Part of Apple's charm is their exclusivity. If everyone owned Apple products, they would no longer be exclusive. Plus the more marketshare they have, the more viruses and/or anti-trust lawsuits there will be, and the less likely people are to have a consistent experience.",

            "answer_text": "Macs cost LESS than equivalent hardware!  People tend to accept the idea that the hardware is priced at a premium. This is a myth.  Apple typically prices its Macs lower than the competition for the equivalent hardware & OS.  Example 1 - High End Device 5k Retina iMac vs Dell 5k MonitorThe Retina iMac 5K display at $2500 costs the same as Dell's upcoming 5K display but throws in one of the most powerful PC's on the market for free! $2500 - iMac with Retina 5K display $2500 - Dell's 27-inch 5K monitor packs almost twice the pixels of 4K displays   Example 2 - Low End Device Mac Mini vs Build your own Intel NUC  Mac Mini$499.00 - Mac mini (Free Two Day Shipping) Intel Core i5 (I5-4260U)4GB memory500GB hard drive1Intel HD Graphics 5000OS X YosemiteBuild your own Wintel (NUC)$350 (reduced from $390) - Intel Nuc Intel BOXD54250WYK1 Intel QS77 2 x 204Pin SO-DIMM Intel HD Graphics 5000 NUC KitIntel Core i5 (i5-4250U) Intel Core i5 4250U vs 4260U $90 - RAM 8GB CORSAIR Vengeance Performance 8GB (2 x 4GB) 204-Pin DDR3 SO-DIMM DDR3 1600 (PC3 12800) Laptop Memory Model CMSX8GX3M2B1600C9I'm using 8GB here as 4GB for the NUC was not available. As OS X has inbuilt RAM compression, 4GB Windows < 4GB OS X < 8GB Windows.4GB on the NUC would cost about $45 elsewhere but it also isn't a fair comparison. $50 - HDD WD Blue WD5000LPVX 500GB 5400 RPM 8MB Cache SATA 6.0Gb/s 2.5\" Internal Notebook Hard Drive Bare Drive $100 - $200 Windows 8.1  windows 8 - Newegg.com This doesn't account for the lack of free OS upgrades for the following six years. Total : $590 - $690 (Shipping not included) Here's the kicker though, refurbished models usually go for 15% off the standard price and are like new. I only ever buy refurbished Macs. Refurbished Mac Computers - Refurbished Notebooks & Desktop Computers - Apple Store (U.S.) So, what I'd call a fair comparison: Mac Mini : $429 - $499 with Free ShippingvsNUC : $590 - $690 with Shipping Not Included. Add the hassle of research, price comparison, shipping costs, multiple orders and tracking, component incompatibility and installation time and it's simply a no brainer to go with a Mac Mini. The same is true of most Mac models. Of course, there's also the standard reasons people give for buying Mac over Wintel : free OS & productivity software with free annual upgrades for roughly 6 yearsbetter OS (features, security, etc.)better software design & hardware integrationbetter hardware build quality better sales servicebetter services integrationless hassle than build your own But, this is nothing new!

            "answer_text": "The short answer will be yes and no. It all comes down to what you value, which will differ from individual to individual. Some key areas to note will be: Apple ecosystempricingease of useaesthetics of productpackagingcustomer servicefeatures of productproduct hardwareJust to list out the non-exhaustive list of features that come with a product. But just for convenience sake, I will just use screen size as an example. I will never ever want a larger screen size for my mobile phone because I want to fit it nicely into my pockets and they don\u2019t have a lot of space in them (plus I don\u2019t want there to be a bulge in my pocket). Others will feel that a larger screen size means more real estate to read mails, or watch shows, or play their games. So in this context, a larger screen size to me is a waste of money, but to those people it packs so much value for the extra cash they shell out. If you were to take any one of the above features as a standalone, then you will likely be able to find a competitor who can offer the same / better features at a much better price. However, if you were to package everything together, then you will come to realise that Apple is targeting a very specific market segment that none of their competitors are. Some might be willing to give and take a few points here and there, while others are not. But in the end it all boils down to personal preference on what is valuable to each individual. ",

            "answer_text": "In terms of hardware,  to every other comparable product, every single one of apples products are overpriced. Apple has created a completely locked down software development infrastructure which runs behind very high walls. The hardware is created in the same way. For example: the non-removable battery and non-expandable memory. (and these are only the most obvious and easy-to-grasp examples). Two things that have always been deal breakers for me and many others.  Great sacrifices are made of the users freedom of choice in order to keep the user experience highly controlled. Nobody is allowed to experience anything that Apple hasn't expressly said is OK by them.  How does that make you feel to read those words? I creeps me the hell out.  All that said, there are pros and cons in everything. Gains from sacrifices. And the opposite.  Apple is a luxury brand. You are paying for brand recognition the same way you do for Louis V. or D&G. There is no denying that you are also paying for quality products. They just happen to cost more than their actual material market value because we have been led to believe they are a better way. To some this was a gleaming truth, to others, like myself, this all seemed ridiculous.   Without using the very effective marketing techniques they did use, apple could have very easily failed in the marketplace with the exact same hardware.  This got way more ranty than I was initially going for, but it's been about 10 minutes and I have to go eat, so I choose to trust that you all catch my drift. ",

            "answer_text": "Well, they are not overpriced to buy. The latest iPhones cost about the same as the latest Samsungs not taking into account the Samsung Galaxy Fold. The macs and iMacs are getting a bit overpriced nowadays but some may say that it's worth it. I, for one, have seen them last for so many years so I am OK with the price. Where they are overpriced, its in the cost of repair. Most of their current computing devices like Macbook or iMac cannot be upgraded as everything is soldered onto the mainboard. Also, they are becoming increasingly difficult to take apart even if you decide to upgrade on your own. Don\u2019t even get me started on iPhones. I do love them and have been using an iPhone for the past 8 years but the repair cost has gone thru the roof. It's better to just buy a new one or take the risk and get it repaired at a local mobile repair shop. Now all iPhones are glass bodied front and back and normally, everyone thinks that back glass should be cheap to replace if it breaks. And that is where Apple has played you, my friend. They have soldered the mainboard of the phone on the back plate which literally no one else does. So when you want to replace that back glass, you got to replace basically half the phone. Better to buy a new phone or buy Apple Care if you still can. Especially if you are someone who drops their phone a lot. ",

            "answer_text": "There has been a lot of buzz around Apple\u2019s pricing strategy. And there are Apple fanboys and trollers to appreciate and criticise Apple products. However, Apple has successfully launched many products in different categories across the globe. Agreed that Apple products are costly, but they justify the prices. They say best things are always cheapest. The brand gives you best hardware and software combination, and therefore, the products last for a long time with little dip in performance graph. A 1000-dollar stand is actually more than a stand. Read below (information from the horse\u2019s mouth). Pro Stand makes every adjustment of your display feel seamless. Precision tilting and 120 millimetres of height adjustment help Pro Display XDR adapt to any viewing condition. The angle of the display stays true even as you adjust the height. With Pro Stand, you get a display that feels weightless, moves effortlessly where you want it and stays exactly where you leave it. The Pro Stand gives you the ability to move between landscape and portrait whenever you want. All you have to do is unlock the slider and turn the display. Whether you\u2019re a developer, a photographer or a composer, you can see more of your work without endless scrolling. Having the freedom to move between being on set and working in the studio can make a big difference. The magnetic connector on Pro Stand makes it easy to attach and detach from its polar-opposite magnet on the back of Pro Display XDR. These magnets guide the connection while latches automatically engage and securely lock the stand to the display. Detaching it is as simple as unlocking the slider. ",

            "answer_text": "Most of the answers say no and my experience is very old but I say that Apple products are often priced well above market parity. My original purchase of an Apple products was in 1984 of an original 128K Mac with an ImageWriter I printer and carry cases for total of $3000+. Of course to make it really useful I had to soon spend about another $1000 for a memory upgrade to 512K, double sided drive plus an external drive and the new ROMs. I know that not too long after the Mac intro Seikosha introduced a compatible printer for around $200 versus the ImageWriter\u2019s $500 price. I know I was paying the early buyer premium (typical of current iPhones) but even the Wikipedia Mac article says that it was Scully that decided to bump the price from $1995 to $2495. I was in retail sales in 2000 when the iMac really started to catch on and while it was more reasonably priced it still was higher than a comparable PC Windows system. So yes they are higher priced but then there is not really much difference between a Buick and a Cadillac except price. For some people the name is important. ",

            "answer_text": "It depends, but mostly *yes*. It depends on what you consider a product, and if you want to compare prices, you should also think of the service you are buying. If you think of a tablet, a PC or a smartphone like a \u201ctraditional\u201d product, you are on the wrong starting lane. I hate threads like this. After the first 2 or 3 answers everybody agrees. I have to disagree and my answer will be lost, but however\u2026 I could have bought an iPad some years ago. The mini was about 300 Euro or 300 USD. I bought an Amazon Fire tablet. And then another one, and then another\u2026 Now we have 5, my wife has her tablet, my kids have theirs, they all work like a charm, and I still think, if I bought a single iPad, I would have spent more money and they would have to share it. Tha last I bought was just 35 EUR (about 40 USD) and it\u2019 s more than \u201cgood enough\u201d. There is no doubt you could buy a no-name Android tablet and be disappointed, but Amazon, like Apple, really cares about the whole user experience. Same thing for an iPhone, we have Xiaomi phones that work just fine (I never used my Canon camera anymore after I bought a Mi5, for 1/3 the price of a lower quality iPhone). I have worked on a MacBook Pro for 5 years, and I\u2019m happy I could switch back to linux in my new job. That being said, there are many reasons you could like Apple products and services, buy them and be happy. What I don\u2019t like is not Apple products, but Apple users who think \u201cif it\u2019s good for me, it must be good for everybody\u201d. What\u2019s Apple worldwide market share again? ",

            "answer_text": "Its not about products being overpriced. That is Apple's pricing strategy. The company purely focuses on technology and makes sure that the user gets the best user experience around as compared to similar products from other players. They don't make cheap products or rather they don't target users who are looking for cheap computers/smart phones. Apple is a niche brand just like any other designer brands and does not target everyone in the market. They target the cream. Also, Apple product owners fall in a club of exclusive users not like Windows and Android. Once people start using Apple products, 9 out of 10 have a feeling that they have got what they paid for. You can't say the same about Windows or Android users where, the software remains the same but the hardware keeps changing from OEM to OEM. This is not the case with Apple.Agreed that, they have a very closed eco-system but they give you so much in their eco-system that users don't look out for options. So you get the point why Apple is costly. From a hardware perspective, Apple makes sure that it matches to their superbly designed MacOS. They use high aircraft qulity aluminium, quality stainless steel, impact resistant glass. I am platform agnostic, however, I feel these are some valid points that support Apple's expensive or should I say, niche pricing strategy. ",

            "answer_text": " In my opinion, they are not. I would like to elaborate why with the example of my macbook air as this was my first apple purchase and why it convinced me to stick with apple. Ok, apple product Is the macbook air overpriced ? No absolutely not, In fact I think that the macbook air (2015) which I have here is very reasonably priced. I won't give you a comparison to other windows laptops because you can compare the specs all you want and you won't prove jack shit. Before I had ever bought anything with apple written on it, I had this perception of apple being this luxury brand overcharging you simply because it could. Relying solely on it\u2019s brand value propelled by slick marketing. It so happened that last summer Someone gifted me this  Soon enough I realised why apple is priced the way it is. Here\u2019s why it\u2019s awesome. 1.The build It is miles away from any competition I can think of and I can't think of any..Maybe viao laptops but no not really. It is indeed a piece of art. The way it feels, the hinge structure and the weight The weight! Oh wait, did I forget to tell you It has no weight..Lol (no seriously, not kidding) 2. The design You should have a look at the macbook in person (especially the air) to understand what I am really talking about. The texture and feel is on point. The thinnest laptop you can possibly get. 3.The battery Watching 3 idiots? 3 hours long? As brilliant as the movie is, You probably will get bored watching it the 4th time straight :) 4.CPU Enough to glide through your daily use Surfing, YouTube, docs, PDF but strictly no games :( There are a lot of things to consider before buying a tech product but I think that these are the 4 pillars that you should pay the most attention to. And the macbook in my opinion stands strong and tall. So, all in all I think they are a great investment and if you are a person who appreciates quality and a true hassle free experience you'd love all of their products. So, no not overpriced. ",

            "answer_text": "This question has been answered many times. But never mind, I will bite. In Singapore, we have this thing called \u201cMixed Vegetable Rice\u201d. It is basically rice which you can choose different kinds of meats or vegetable to go with it and they will charge you according to what you choose. A typical 2 meat + 1 vegetable combo costs SGD$3.50 in a neighbourhood coffeeshop. The same combination may cost up to SGD$5.00 in a air conditioned foodcourt in a shopping mall. Is the one at the shopping mall overpriced? Sure, it is more expensive than the one from the neighbourhood coffeeshop, but you get to enjoy the meal in an air conditioned environment, which can be debatably cleaner also. On top of that, the vendor also needs to pay more rent compared to a neighbourhood coffeeshop. The situation is not much different from an Apple product. I will not go into details about Apple\u2019s cost, but as a consumer, what kind of value do you see in a product? If you do not see much value, it is overpriced. If you see the value, then it is worth it. Answering your question, yes, Apple products are overpriced, if they do not have any value to you. And no, because I see the value in their products. ",

I got it for 12,000 Philippine Pesos (US$230), plus a tempered glass screen protector and a rubber case for an extra 600 Philippine Pesos (US$12). As how Endowement effect would hit me, I used it with lots of care during its 1st year. The following years, well, my care receded a little bit.. There were times when I\u2019d accidentally drop it, sleep on it, bump it to another hard surface, neglectfully throw it on to my desk causing it to bounce off the edge heading straight to the ground.. All those usual, user-inflicted wear and tear. Today my 3 year-old son uses it. It still makes him happy. If I\u2019m to measure its service to me, using a calculation which I personally call a P/L ratio (Price-Lifespan ratio) 12,600/36 months = 350 pesos/month Had I bought a local, low-priced tablet, the estimated life-expectancy of it in my (and in my son\u2019s) hands would be 10 months. Say I kept buying a replacement every time it broke down, which consumers like me usually do (5000 x 4)/36 = 555 pesos/month Which of them is costly long-term? On top of the price comparison, that iPad mini met my expectations. It played its purpose as what Apple had promised. I\u2019d label it as a high-quality, great value, reliable product. actual photo of our iPad mini 1 taken earlier  ",

I\u2019m stating this based on fact that devices with same technical specs (or even more functions and processing power) produced by other manufacturers are clearly cheaper. Other \u201cparameters\u201d like \u201cgorgeous design\u201d, \u201cexclusivity\u201d, \u201cexperience\u201d, \u201cultra milllenial durabillity\u201d do not make any sense for me.  Every smartphone is same black (sometimes colored) brick with display. If designing a brick costs Apple $1.000.000 and designing a brick costs Huawei $1000 - whose problem is that? Every laptop has hinged screen and keyboard. Well, some do not have functional keys or have touchscreen, but that\u2019s not the point. I don\u2019t care if MacBook has speaker grilles carved with nanolaser or whatever detail of design is gogeous there. I need a laptop design function like \u201cfits in backpack and has generic color without rainbow stripes on keyboard\u201d. Every laptop has that. Exclusivity? No. CAT-branded rugged phone is exclusive, because not everyone even knows there are CAT Excavators, what to say about phones, and everyone sees Apple advertisements every other day.Asus Taichi has two screens. That\u2019s pretty nonsense, but is exclusive. Laptop with apple logo is not exclusive now - you may see it in every other coffee shop. Experience? Difference? Neural implant is different. Mashing icons on screen is everywhere. I tried using browser on iPhone and did not see any difference in pixels. Tried calling - no difference in voice.Dvorak keyboard is different. Clicking and dragging icons with mouse or touchpad is everywhere. Mac OS has absolutely no difference from Windows, OS/2 or KDE in user interface. There is a desktop and there are windows. Tried browsing internets on iMac - same pixels. Tried editing a text. Replacing a single Home/End with Option+-> is a bad \u201cdifference\u201d and frustrating \u201cexperience\u201d. Letters were the same though. Durability and longevity. I don\u2019t know what you folks do with your things to make them break with no reason. I\u2019ve never purchased a new laptop, I always buy used, upgrade RAM/HDD/SSD and use em for till total destruction. I\u2019ve used Dell 2010-made, 2014 bought E6410 till Feb 2017 and finally stepped on it. Took 3G modem, RAM, SSDs out, sold remaining parts. Purchased a used 2013 Dell E6230 for 200 bux, put 6410 things and a new backlit keyboard there and use it. Try doing that with \u201ceverything soldered and glued in\u201d non-overpriced indestructible MacBook. Phones\u2026 phones get lost, dropped from window, caught in motorbike chain and cut in half. Replacing a $200 generic smartpfone or $800 iPhone\u2026 well\u2026 ",

Current-generation Macs do have some quality issues: MacBook Pro / Air Butterfly Keyboard Issues (Repeating, Stuck, Unresponsive)Macs are SLOWER than PCs. Here\u2019s why.The Infuriating Design Flaw That Makes Spilling Liquid On Your MacBook Keyboard A Death SentenceThe design flaw behind MacBook Pro\u2019s \u201cstage light\u201d effect2018 MacBook Pros crashing with \"Bridge OS\" errorWarren Rumak's answer to Why does Apple remove ports from MacBooks?, in which I talk about how forcing users to use USB-C dongles exposes them to a new type of problem: low-quality dongles that fail much more frequently than built-in portsThere are some other items, too, but those are some of the big ones. If you look past all these things, sure, they\u2019re still good machines. The price of base-model machines is also generally fine, when you balance what you get out of the box. It\u2019s important to remember that you get the iWork office suite and GarageBand with every Mac purchase \u2014 these are more than good enough for most people who want to produce documents, spreadsheets, presentations, and music. The big problem is with pricing of storage and memory upgrades. Here\u2019s the Canadian pricing of the upgrades on a 15\u2033 MacBook Pro:   Here\u2019s the price of a comparable high-end Samsung SSD, as listed on NewEgg.    Storage: MacBook Pro: $1,440 plus whatever portion of the base price is allocated to the SSD. ($200?) Just about everyone else: $800 (less if it\u2019s on sale). And you can keep that big SSD when you move to another computer in the future. Memory: MacBook Pro: $480 for 16GB plus whatever portion of the base price is allocated to the 16GB memory. ($200?) Just about everyone else: $200 for 32GB of RAM. Once. Again, you can move this to another computer later\u2026. though in fairness, by the time you\u2019re ready to get another laptop, it might require DDR5.  Apple has intentionally designed these systems so that storage and RAM cannot be upgraded later. You are forced to spend the money up-front, even if your current needs don\u2019t require the extra headroom. Nobody is forcing Apple to do this. It is done with intent and purpose: to get more money from you. There is no quality or performance difference. ",

            "answer_text": "I don't agree with Apples politics and its tax evasion. I can find many faults with a company so many people idolize. My reasons for using a Mac are pragmatic. Macs tend to fail less often and offer superior build quality and level of design. They're well put together and seem to be the brand everyone else imitates. Apple never skimps when it comes to how things work. They almost always do it right, or won't do it at all (notable exceptions are Maps and Mobile Me). Apple also innovates and introduces ne features more than others, as far as I can tell. For example the iPhone integration in OSX Yosemite allowing me to place cellphone (not just VoIP) calls and send SMS (not just iMessage) using my Mac! These are massive productivity boosts for me and features I've been wanting for years. If I weren't using a Mac, I'd use Linux on the best non-Apple hardware I could find. Ideally, I'd like to see a more ethical Apple that isn't involved in price fixing, tax evasion and illegal hiring agreements with competitors. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes and no. Let me explain. There are 3 distinguishing factors for the price of Apple products.  1. Yes in a sense because they manufacture the items in China so the actual markup is immense. Labor in China is cheap, therefore it is easy to make good profit. Parts like screws and the actual computer don't cost much. Things like RAM GPU and CPU cost much more comared to the physical product.  2. No in a sense because if you look at other manufacturers like Lenovo or Acer, many products with the same specifications as apple products are costly ($ 1000+)   Apple doesn't use low end processors either, they use i7 and i5 processors which could cost upwards of $300 individually.  3. Finally, there is branding and reliability. I don't have the link but in electronics issue of consumer report, they have a reliability chart, and Apple is always at the top, meaning less time for you to have to wait ( or even go to a IT) for your gadget to be fixed and as they say, time is money. Branding is also another factor. Apple is world recognized because there design and color(silver) and that Macintosh they have at the back of every product. No other brand (besides McDonald's ) is probably as recognizable as Apple. Demand is so high that there are many Apple fakes, unique to ape products. I hope this helped and sorry for the paragraph form it's terrible j know ",

            "answer_text": "As a user heavily invested in the Apple eco-system since NeXTStep times, it is only overpriced if you compare hardware specs 1:1. The additional value does not come from this however, but how well integrated hardware and software are and how consistent interfaces are.Add to that a mobile OS that ties in neatly and you have something that a hopelessly fragmented PC/Android market can never offer - seamless and hassle free integration and stability. (To be fair Windows has come a long way. Release 7 is really a decent OS. I am saying that having recently completed a small .NET project. But I still did it on my Mac) Even if I do claim a deeper knowledge of IT and its concepts, I am not a masochist. I benefit a lot if the things just work, if I can avoid stability and configuration nightmares, and, yes, even if I just have a simple and clear GUI for some menial task. And that the devices are pretty doesn't hurt. So I do not think for a second that I paid too much for my MacBook Pro or for my iPhone, just because on a pure spec basis they are worse than some generic PC/Android equivalent.  I am very happy with my purchase. Not to mention that my virtual machines make up for any gaps in functionality. They are better PCs than an actual PC.(Some things like gaming excluded, but I don't have time for that anyways) I would never trade back. ",

            "answer_text": "Ok so technically speaking they are reasonably prices, since they are a premium brand. and secondly, its because they know they can sell their product for that much of a premium. Think of it this way, you open a lemonade stand. It will cost you about say $0.50 per glass just buying the material. Usually you would sell 1 cup for $1.00. Now thats safe to say that you are making $0.50 for every cup sold. Now lets change things a bit, what if you could sell 1 cup of lemonade for $2.00. Now you are earning $1.50 per cup. How about $5.00, or even $10.00. Now you would think who would buy it, but people will pay $10.00 for 1 cup of lemonade if you target the right people, and that is exactly what apple is doing. If you had something to sell, you would want to sell it at the highest price possible without sacrificing sales.  Now there you go, thats how apple has over $100 billion in cash, and how they are nearing to reach a company evaluation of $1 Trillion, yes with a T. The first company ever to hit $1 Trillion evaluation. For that reason, yes apple products are reasonably priced. If you think they are expensive, then apple is not targeting you. ",

Would you spend $2800 for an iMac? This will bring your total costs to $140000. Would you spend $2000 for a decent level multimedia/gaming desktop? This will bring your total costs to $10000. The second option will save you $40,000. That\u2019s enough to upgrade all their graphics cards to the next generation 2 years later plus additional storage and even RAM.

Well if you look T how Apple products are made and their great track record it's hard to dispute that they're not good. They're fantastic products that may have the best software out of any products on the market. They're fast, reliable, and built to last. I have an apple computer from 2008 and it runs like new. Then all the updates are free. So you always have the newest and latest. And the best part is that they all have anti virus software. They can never get a virus. Now to look at any other product on the market especially computers, you can spend up to $100 on anti virus software and even having that doesn't give a 100% guarantee that I will be completely safe from viruses. You have to look at all the positives that Apple has and how they save you money in the long run. Most computers will last maybe 3 years. Apples can last until you destroy them your self! Apple products are. Great investment.  If you are lookin for some cool Apple accessories this site has some great ones. Computer, tablet, and phone accessories.

But when you take into context that a lot of the software that comes along with it is free, not to mention the entire seamless interoperability within their ecosystem, it becomes less clear. From the iPhone, MacBook, iPad, AirPods I own, everything works from one to the next seamlessly with each other. I particularly love their service standards and how they emphasize on the customer experience. I love how when I encounter a problem and I click a couple of buttons on their website, and the next moment my phone rings and then I get connected to a customer service personnel, who usually manages to solve my problem if it is not hardware related. But if it is, I get an appointment and show up at the appointed time and everything handled extra efficient. This is also not saying that they are usually leaders in the design of each category of their products, with competitors copying and emulating, and yet still falling short of the original. ",

We simply don't make cheap ones.\" When comparing \"apples with apples\" you'll find that laptops at the same level of quality and materials will cost you the same or more than Apple's. Take a look at Sony's or even some other high-end LG laptops. The ones that have a similar build quality cost the same or more than a Macbook Pro. If you add to that how Apple has been investing in R&D while the other brands simply copy whatever Apple does these days, you understand why they can be a tad more expensive than a, say, HP Envy. If you you're talking about mobile products (e.g. iPhone, iPad, iPod) than that question doesn't make sense: they are actually cheaper than comparable products. :) ",

            "answer_text": "No, your not alone, its a common complaint, although its one that is ONE SIDED and doesn't look at the other side. Lets take your points on one by one. OVERPRICED RESTRICTIVE Overpriced. Well, that's subjective. Lets say expensive, because there is no way to say what the price of something should be. Most people fail to see the difference in Apple products from others. Apple is a premium brand. They are not a budget company, an eMachines. They are Mercedes Benz. I come across 9, 10, even in this case a 12 year old Apple computer, a Core2Duo iMac, that I loaded a modern operating System on, and with 4gb of ram it runs just fine for a customer doing banking, watching Netflix (in HD), going on facebook, and keeping up with news, as well as balancing the check book. Hard to tell the owner of that machine they did not get their value out of that \u2018overpriced\u2019 computer they paid too much for 12 years ago. While a Windows PC owner would have had to buy antivirus software on day one, and if your into PDFs, adobe acrobat; stuff not required for Mac users then or now. plus after a few years the Windows PC was probably replaced 3 times over if not more. Not to the same extent, but iPhones and iPads hold value longer than counterparts. EXAMPLE- All new Apple Computers come with 1 Year warranty including 90 days phone support. Unlike a Dell which was made by Dell, the operating system made by Windows, and the App made by another company\u2026Your Computer, OS, and main apps are all capable of having questions answered with ONE CALL. RESTRICTIVE: Probably easier to look at iPhones and iPads with this one. although the same Mac vs Windows applies to iOS vs Android. Its very true, you cannot find the same amount, not even CLOSE to the same amount of apps, or choices available on an Android phone, but that is a plus for both sides depending how you look at it. Less software available for Mac vs Windows meant that Mac did not have to install drivers for 50 million different Video cards, or sound devices. Windows did, and sometimes ran into conflicts. \u201cThe more hands in the cookie jar\u201d so to say! or \u201cthe more moving parts\u2026\u201d So you may have less choices with Apple, but you know that the choices you do have, are guaranteed to work because they've been tested. These are the basic PLUSES and MINUSES to the Apple vs Android question. Apple : CONS:Less Choices, less customisation, PROS: less confusion, inclined to \u2018 just work\u2019. ANDROID PROS: more choices, more customisation CONS: lots of choices can become confusing. Example can be found in what they can do. Facetime is simply video conferencing, you could do it on Android phone but you had to set it up. With iOS it requires no set up, you just put email address in at it works. I can't tell you how many months I spent trying to get an android phone to show its screen onto a TV with Firestick. With iPhone it took minutes and Apple TV. But, when I wanted to make a simple ROCKY theme as ring for my friend, it took seconds on android phone. I couldn't do it on iPhone without either buying it, or making it on a Mac (25 minutes). BEST ADIVCE I GIVE ON THIS SUBJECT, if you have other apple devices, stick with Apple. If you have other google or windows, stick with the immediate family as they work well together. ",

Even it it\u2019s only a couple of hours, that might add up to 10% of your life being screen time\u2026.for some folks, it\u2019s a heck of a lot more. My grandfather always said to spend money on the things you use every day, not on luxuries that you\u2019ll never touch. Following that reasoning, shouldn\u2019t a nice phone or computer be a functional luxury worth spending money on? Apple is expensive, but it\u2019s a premium product - a luxury of sorts. What Apple has developed has trickled down to the rest of the industry though, so if you can\u2019t afford it you can buy another brand and get similar performance. Keep in mind that \u201cexpensive\u201d\u2019and \u201coverpriced\u201d are relative terms. I just paid $55 for a pair of Converse All-Stars, which to me seems a little steep for a pair of canvas shoes invented in 1922. I refuse to pay $100+ for Nike Trainers, it\u2019s just too much. However, I was quite happy spending $5k for an iMac Pro - but it will last for years and I use it for work. In that sense, it\u2019s not overpriced. Expensive depends on what you can afford, and if you can\u2019t afford it, start with a less expensive option. ",

Considering the demand for Apple products and the generated profit, Apple products are therefore not overpriced.  It is however clear to me that Apple sells their products at a premium price and it positions itself at the high spectrum of the market. It is as respectable as Mercedes doing the same thing in the car sector. What is less respectable, it is i. the policy of channel control and exclusivity, reducing competition among sales channels, ii. the use of marketing tricks like managed scarcity, playing on consumers' irrational behavior, to drive artificially demand up and iii. the financial and corporate setup to channel profits through fiscal paradises to avoid paying tax.

I got it for 12,000 Philippine Pesos (US$230), plus a tempered glass screen protector and a rubber case for an extra 600 Philippine Pesos (US$12). As how Endowement effect would hit me, I used it with lots of care during its 1st year. The following years, well, my care receded a little bit.. There were times when I\u2019d accidentally drop it, sleep on it, bump it to another hard surface, neglectfully throw it on to my desk causing it to bounce off the edge heading straight to the ground.. All those usual, user-inflicted wear and tear. Today my 3 year-old son uses it. It still makes him happy. If I\u2019m to measure its service to me, using a calculation which I personally call a P/L ratio (Price-Lifespan ratio) 12,600/36 months = 350 pesos/month Had I bought a local, low-priced tablet, the estimated life-expectancy of it in my (and in my son\u2019s) hands would be 10 months. Say I kept buying a replacement every time it broke down, which consumers like me usually do (5000 x 4)/36 = 555 pesos/month Which of them is costly long-term? On top of the price comparison, that iPad mini met my expectations. It played its purpose as what Apple had assured.

Say the new Mac Pro (the trashcan style one), for it's specs, it's pretty decent value, but you have no choice but to get very high end graphics cards, which hardly anybody actually needs. The Macbook Air I think is good value compared like with like with other very slim laptops of comparable build quality. But Apple just don't make cheap plastic laptops any more. So, Apple products tend to be expensive, but for what you get, they're not really much more than other products, of comparable specification. The 5k iMac is a great price for the spec and that screen, I think the other non-Retina iMacs are not so good value. The Mac Mini is outrageously expensive unless you really need that small size, then it's barely got a competitor. It's a mixed bag, really. ",

            "answer_text": "I want to give a very simple answer to this from a lay person's perspective. Let's assume there are two companies, A and B. Company A products are considered good and reliable for the masses and has some basic features that everyone requires. Company B products are top of the line, built using the latest technology, and proven itself to be market leaders in terms of not only technology but also services ( applies to western nations, where people hugely depend on apple services like apple pay, imessages, apple music, air drop only to name a few features. ) Alongside this, Company B also was the first to launch that product and had good 5+ years while company A was still figuring out its s**t together on what to do and how to do it. This gave advantage to company B time to trap the customers to a thing called an ecosystem . ( basically, every device they own, something card and friends they know are linked to Company B) Also, company B doesn't allow cross linking with Compny A. So, the moral of the Story is that Apple uses binding practices to keep the users hooked to there ecosystems. Many users also, report that the ease of cross talk between apple devices are so seamless that why change . This has till now been the reason what apple has been able to charge exorbitant prices. Rest, R&D, Manufacturing cost, manpower cost , etc don't matter . Apple knows they can charge you money so they do it. ",

I\u2019ve only seen consumers push back hard on Apple once; when it was discovered Apple\u2019s practices for supporting older phones was at best questionable, leaning more towards manipulative. Apple hit with \u20ac25 million fine in France for iPhone slowdown controversy Apple tried to spin it, which they can usually do. But consumers didn\u2019t buy Apple\u2019s reasoning and the result was optimization for older devices and free battery replacements. Apple did that because they had to. They have always positioned themselves as a premium brand, and while I like my iPhone and MacBook, they are not 2x as good as other products half their price. ",

            "answer_text": "Thanks for the A2A. I had the same thoughts about Apple products and their prices until I myself bought one. Apple products are meant to last, not 2 years nor 3 years but for atleast 5\u20136 years. Lets do a small math calculation- Any HP i5 laptop: INR 45000($650)-50000($750)whereas Macbook Air- INR 70000($ 1075). Now consider the use, you get Mac updates every year making it one of the safest OS on the other hand you have Windows, where there\u2019s an endless wait to get updates. No UI change etc. Thus Mac is a better investment.The price Apple charges from its customer doesn\u2019t just include the cost of the product. It includes the research cost by their best engineers, the OS updates for many years to come and the ownership of their propriety OS along with the manufacturing cost of the device. For e.g: An iPhone costs around 60k-70k (INR) (or around $ 1000) which includes not only the cost of production but the research costs by the company. Other mobile companies use Android as their base OS, thus the cost of research reduces significantly.These are the reasons why Apple products are costly. Hope it helps. If you have reached till here, the Upvote is a few millimeters down, it\u2019d be great if you clicked it ;) ",

And then there are people like me, who don\u2019t depend on external materials to alter a perception of experience, of the product. We know ourselves so well, that we see no point in spending excess on it. My quality of life, doesn\u2019t depend on which product I use. But what these tools offer. My HP and Acer laptops are 9+ years old, and they are still working perfectly fine. If somebody is asking about durability. My Nokia N900 is also 9 years old, back then had multitasking. Which no Apple phone had. We can sit and have a debate over all this silly stuff. Bottom line is. What you value you pay for it. This is how people get fooled to pay more. I never valued sleek, good looking products. Because I valued that money saved, could be used to improved my over-all life experience. Not some silly experience of using a product. If I was in a position to either had to buy an Apple or Alienware or Razor. And if Apple was among all, I would buy Apple. See my point? ",

            "answer_text": "In 2007, Apple introduced the iPhone. It was the world's first smartphone and was a work of art of the highest order. Even though it was very expensive and \u201cdidn't appeal to business customers\u201d according to Steve Ballmer ($500), it was purchased by many. The price tag was justified. The same goes for iPad, iPod, MacBooks as well. But nowadays Apple rarely makes an invention. But it does keep the premium and the experience of owning an Apple. Even today, I believe that the iPhone is better than the S7. I have an iPad, which has lasted for nearly 5 years. Most tabs last only for a few weeks and have poor battery lifespan. Therefore Apple products are not overpriced. They give you the experience of a premium product and are the $100000 painting among the drawings. ",

When you buy an apple, a large part of what you're paying for is aesthetic. The little light next to the camera that looks like it shines directly through metal (and appears invisible when it isn't shining). Asynchronous fans in MacBooks that spread the fan sound over the full spectrum of sound, greatly reducing the amount we notice it. The background screen on newer iPads that will shift subtly as you tilt the iPad, giving the illusion of depth. The smooth, steel, exterior of an apple laptop. The fact that there are no speaker grilles on a macbook- sound comes out of every opening in the computer, for instance through the keyboard. The apple operating system applicable to your device. It can be overpriced- it just depends what matters to you. ",

            "answer_text": "Apple products and costlier than its competitors but not overpriced. It's a cliche statement to make. I will explain it to you. Recently, Tim Cook admitted that iPhone prices are on the steeper side. As I mentioned in one of the related posts, most of the Apple devices are strategically high priced and it\u2019s really smart of them. It\u2019s like creating a separate market where you simply do not have to bother about other Android competitors. But it has been working very well for them and for its customers. Yes, the products are premium and totally worth it. Internally, Apple considers its apps and not its iPhones or iPads as the fastest growing and highest margin product. Interestingly, most of these apps are not made by Apple for third parties where Apple makes a 30% sales cut of its in-app purchases. Thus, declining hardware sales in India would have less impact on Apple and it can keep uplifting its stubborn cravings for years to come. The operating cost vs market valuation put Apple in a sweet spot where it can allow a little bit of turmoil in its sales and still keep a clear vision. If you are buying Apple devices via Premium Retailers in countries like India, you are paying for the high import duties and taxes surcharges including the original US price (approximate). Component prices have certainly lowered over the past few years, but Apple's product prices have grown. According to an IHS Markit analysis, Apple's increase in prices is intentional to verify their customer's appetite for more expensive Apple products especially iPhones. It is following the classical Econ 101 approach which is extracting more revenue for the premium brand. Most of the customers are paying for their brand - the Apple logo. In fact, it will be hard to digest, but - in today's world, people are willing to pay more to procure the best quality devices, as it is no more about buying the most efficient items, rather it has become something that helps you look good and keep up with your friends and coworkers. According to WalletHub's 2018 Credit Score and iPhone Survey, more than 28 million Americans are willing to go to debt to purchase one of the iPhones. Despite having a great market placement (pick up any movies or magazines and you will see an Apple product somewhere in the frame). Its such adamant love towards Apple's products which keep a section of its customers alive and kicking. Thanks, Raja ",

            "answer_text": "\"Overpriced?\" is a relative term. Overpriced to what? Which alternative?  Yes, Apple's products are expensive. Not, because Apple wants to screw with its customer base. It doesn't. Apple has long been the company known for its innovative products, which are built better, perform better and lasts longer than its counterparts on the other side of the aisle. A lot money is spent on making the next \"new\" thing, all the way from designers, coders, testers, manufacturers, etc. And then, Apple has to make money, it is after all not a non-profit company you know.  So, yes. They charge more for its products, but over time it pays for itself through reduced maintenance costs, and an intangible benefit of piece of mind.   ",

There are many dimensions to develop a product\u2019s perception using price and build willingness to pay. This is what is notable about Apple and its products is the ability to define and capture a perception of value. This is not easy and many companies struggle with capturing the essence of why customers love their product or service and what that means in monetary terms. ",

            "answer_text": "This is a very common question regarding Apple products. The intrinsic value is a relative concept. What is valuable to me might be worth nothing to the next person. To me, Apple products are priced fairly. When you buy it's product, you are getting much more than just the hardware itself. For example, when you get the ipad, you are greeted with a bunch of free apps that Apple provides out of the box, including pages, GarageBand, keynote and numbers. These are very useful productive apps. If you do not like them, you could always head down to the App Store and download Microsoft office for free. When you get the ipad, it works seamlessly with your other iOS devices. Apps downloaded on one device are automatically downloaded throughout the devices you own. My favourite feature of Apple products is perhaps their raw superiority in user experience compared to their competitors. They sweat over the small things that matter. The primary way to navigate around your iPad is the touchscreen. And Apple made sure to create the best touch screen there is out there. There is no competition. iOS touchscreen are sensitive and feel extremely natural. In 2010, Apple revoltionized displays by making the retina displays. In 2013, they introduced the best fingerprint sensor ever on the market. They focus on the features that will enhance user experience and ignore the gimmicks that other companies pursue just to woo customers. Apple products are thus highly valuable by my assessment and hence I deem them as fairly priced. You may value Apple products differently and deem them as overpriced and that is completely natural, because once again, intrinsic value is a relative concept. Cheers ",

But Apple mostly cut the price of previous product by 40 to 50 percent or even more. Still they made a good amount of profit. For example iPhone 8 vs iPhone 7, difference between both is almost negligible. Fast charging, glass back,etc. Price was more than 700 bucks. While the iPhone 7 saw a good cut in price. It is a strategic planning for making money. I accept that Apple spend a lot on Research and development but still it feels overpriced. ",

Its base modal costs 89000 rs. for just 64 GB storage and if you want to extend the storage space you have to spend more Money approx. 5000 rs. For the same features and less price, one can buy the google pixel 3 xl priced at 49000 only. That also not cheap but as compare to the iPhone it is much cheaper. Now you get the point apple products are much overpriced than other alternatives. If we compare MacBook with Chromebook, Macbook is much overpriced with nearly the same amount of features. Chromebook also supports all the play store applications. whereas the MacBook cannot. The reason iPhones are overpriced is due to fewer sales. When sales are down, you can either sell more of what you have or raise the price of what you\u2019re selling. ",

That\u2019s a quarter of a TRILLION dollars. It is a huge amount of money. They are on their way to becoming the first company with a market value of over a trillion dollars. How, exactly, do you suspect they got that way? Because people buy their stuff. As long as people are willing to pay the prices Apple charges for their stuff, they are not unnecessarily expensive. Now there are those that would argue that. Specifically, those who believe they can buy products with better specs for less money. Well, for computers, that\u2019s true (not so much for phones). But here\u2019s the thing: since Apple closely controls the design process for both hardware and software they can provide the user with an experience no other computer company can offer. Microsoft finally figured this out and is playing catchup with their Surface computers, but as long as they license Windows to third parties, it will always be inferior in those specific ways that make Apple\u2019s hardware and software so compelling together. As long as that\u2019s the case, Apple\u2019s products will not be unnecessarily expensive. ",

            "answer_text": "Apple has set benchmark for the entire mobile phone market when they introduced their first touch handset in the market, at that point of time Apple justified its value for the price. But in the last few years Apple is just introducing few updates in their phones or we can simply call it the iteration of the last model that they manufactured, and charging heavily to their customers for changing the ergonomics of the phone, be it notch or removal of 3.5 mm jack. One major aspects of getting these phones expensive might be the protectionist approach taken by President Donald Trump against China to reduce its trade deficit, because of that Apple might have to start manufacturing units in some other countries and that will directly impact the cost of the phone. Secondly the wages for employees in America is higher in comparison to other developing countries and they can afford costly phones and also there is concept of getting phones on contract with the different service providers, in that way they can enjoy using services from best mobile manufacturer at few bucks/month and Apple knows it very well. Thirdly in countries Like China and India, people co-relate mobile phones with the social status, and I think Apple marketing team understand this thing. that\u2019s why I think they kept their phones price higher as compared to the competitors.

Initial purchases of Apple products are higher than corresponiding Windows products; however, I have never considered them overpriced for several reasons. For Windows products, the machine is made by one company, but the software to run it is made by another company. For Apple products, Apple makes both the machine and the software to run it; they are coordinated and regular upgrades of either are seamless. Also, I have found that many Windows products require additonal parts before full implementation is possible. With most Apple products I've used, all parts are included, and have been authorized by if not actually made by Apple. Windows friends of mine report on problems with and incompatibilities of various functions of their machines, all of which require additional expenses as well as very annoying expenditure of time and energy to return the product to full use. I avoid this with Apple products. I also there is a greater feeling of confidence using Macs and related items. That alone, for me, makes the price of Apple products worth the price. ",

They have a very good share of the most profitable market segments so losing to Android in other less profitable market segments doesn't bother them. Report: Apple, Android Now 96 Percent Of Smartphones Globally I expect a pretty strong correction for Apple over the next ~5 years and while they're setting on a huge pile of cash they haven't shown anything that's moved the needle in innovative products in quite a number of years.  The current crop of iPhones are definitely evolutionary steps and not particularly innovative.  Applepay will ultimately lead to more revenue for Google than it will for Apple simply because their reach is so much wider and there is zero incentive for merchants and credit processors to support only on of the two mobile payment systems since the hardware is identical.

According to Apple, 13 million iphones were sold in the opening weekend when 6s was introduced while the figure was 10 million in the case of iPhone 6.  Overpriced means that the product is at a higher price on the shelves than customers are willing to pay and that's not in the case of iPhone. The figures indicate that year after year. Apple has the biggest cash pile in whole of the industry. iPhones alone account for the 96% of the profit from all of the smartphone industry. And all of this (people willing to pay so much for an iphone) has been possible because of the marvellous work by all of the departments of Apple. Technical aspect, design aspect, marketing aspect and PR aspect all add up to make iPhone such a successful product.  Have you looked at the photography and portrayal of an iPhone in ads or when celebrities use it in movies. These all make up your mind that iPhone is a beautiful thing and if we talk about software, well, let's not talk about that. You already know iOS. ",

The second type is a product that is overpriced on purpose to spread the idea of Apple being a premium brand, which attracts customers. In the first category there are the Apple Watch, iPhone SE and 11, Airpods without the charging case, Airpods Pro, Macbook Air and Pro, iPod Touch, iMac, and the list goes on. In the second category there are the Mac Pro wheels and accesssories, the entry model Mac Pro, the entry model iMac Pro, the Apple Magic keyboard for the iPad Pro and iMac, and the list goes on. ",

But i have to tell you there's some stuff in our industry that we wouldn\u2019t be proud to ship, that we wouldn\u2019t be proud to recommend to our family and friends. And we can\u2019t do it. We just can\u2019t ship junk. So, there are thresholds we can\u2019t cross because of who we are. But we want make best personal computers in the industry. And we think that there\u2019s a very significant slice of the industry that wants that too. And what you\u2019ll find that our products are not usually premium priced. You price out our competitors\u2019 products, and add features that actually make them useful, and they\u2019re the same or actually more expensive. We don\u2019t offer stripped-down, lousy products.\" ",

Apple are the worlds biggest publicly traded company by market cap, and is astonishingly profitable.  That suggests that the market agrees with Apple about prices.  And in a very real sense, it is the market which sets the price. But Apple has a lot of competitors which charge less for similar products. And we should probably ask why that is.   Why is HP prepared to sell a notebook and make less that $15 on the sale? Why is Sony, a consumer electronics titan, losing money on every phone they sell? ",

Apple products are the best, so they do cost more. When you by cheap, you get cheap. I spent over $3000 on a MacBook Pro last year. I am 100% satisfied with its performance, and it has functioned perfectly since the day I took it out of the product box. It has never crashed. I get all day battery life. My iPhone has performed perfectly, and so have my iPad, and iMac. The two Apple TVs in my home also work great. Calling them overpriced is just a way of making yourself feel better for choosing an inferior \u201cgood enough\u201d product. ",

In particular the case was solid metal, bat life was significantly longer, screen was brighter and with a higher resulution (pixels) and OS upgrades were either free or at a nominal, one-time purchase cost and covered the license for use on other Mac we owned. For iPod family - there's really no comparison given the purchase price includes the iTunes ecosystem at no extra charge. iPhones are priced competitively with other smart phones although RIM seems to be giving away their BlackBerry models! iPads compare in price to other Android models unless you elect to skimp on features.   And iTunes integration with PC/Mac comes for free! They probably appear more expensive at first glance but you get a lot more for your money and most importantly they're absolutely trouble-free. ",

Another example is the Samsung galaxy note 8, which costs Samsung about 300$ to make, but they are selling the special aviation addition for a whopping 1800$! The regular note 8 goes for under 1000$, which let's Samsung net almost 700$ per device sold, minus labor, ect. Most tech companies do this, we are seeing it in computers, laptops, smart phones, smart watches, the list goes on.

I was told to purchase my own laptop and was told to use the MacBook Pro for reference. I had been a Windows user all my life and was very resistant to getting a Mac and so I tried to find something equivalent and I was very surprised that the enterprise grade professional laptops from Dell, Lenovo, HP cost around the same and even more in some cases as I had to get Windows 7 which was being phased out in favor of Windows 8.1. I finally caved in and got the highest spec'ed rMBP.  I have never used a Windows laptop in a professional context since then and do not intend to. I'm not going to go into detail as to why but as a PS engineer working in tech, my MBP does all it needs to and is a much better experience than any other Windows laptop I have used. ",

To add one more point to that answer, these questions are usually discussed on pure price level, average price of computer/phone/tablet is always lower than average price of Mac/iPhone/iPad. So proving \"overpriced\" nature of Apple products on paper is not hard.  The real question starts when you start comparing the return on Apple products vs other products. I have used Mac for over a year now and I would gladly pay for the premium again next time because the value I get by owning a stable computer is much higher than the price. ",

Whether that is the best use of shareholders money and the best for Apple long term prospects as well as mobile market in general is a different question. This gargantuan pile of cash speaks by itself about efficiency of the markets and Apple's cunning acumen in exploiting such inefficiencies. And it can be certainly said that all this money has been rightly coming to Apple and late Steve Jobs  as being the only ones to have the vision and courage to break the mold of the old thinking and conservatism in mobile preceding iPhone. The real verdict IMO will be in given in the future, seeing what Apple will end up doing with such an unprecedented pile of cash. Looking at history of such overwhelmingly dominant companies before does not bode well as it shows such cases marked their tops and subsequent long declines.   ",

This is an unsophistocated method of pricing that will likely get you into trouble these days and at the very least likely lead to leaving margin on the table. The best practice is to use value based pricing, where prices are set based on reference prices (competitors) and adjusted based on the positive/negative differentiation for the given offering relative to the reference offerings. Apple is very effective at value based pricing, because their offerings provide positive differentiation vs. the other offerings out there and they are effective at pricing accordingly. ",

This hasn't been possible for any other brand of phone.  Of course, I paid the carrier more than the cost of my phone, as part of their \"service\", but that service cost would be the same for an Android phone.   For a computer, similar economics apply.  I can sell a 4-year old Mac for more than 50% of the purchase price.  For a PC, I will be lucky to get 30%, and there is a lower probability that it will still be working after 4 years.

They are not interested in the medium or low section pricing. They only make premium products. There are millions of Apple devices sold each quarter. The money Apple invests mainly is in R&D. Why so over priced? Yes as always advertising is one of the big issues. MacBooks are one of the best notebooks out there in the market. iPhones to some Meh! But still they sell in millions. Same is the case of iPads. They just make some devices. But has a whole lot more to it. Consider the design aspect and the aesthetic value. And thats why they are the biggest brand in the world. ",

If Apple tried to charge more than people would pay, then the market would give them a signal that they were 'overpriced' and Apple would respond by lowering their prices. Apple's pricing strategy is not to sell the \"most\".  They want to make the best product they can, and will charge a premium for it.  Everyone is free to make up their mind if the product is worth it to them  (for me, the iphone/ipad is worth every penny.  However, the Mac PCs are not) ",

If you want the best of the best, you pay the most to get it Restrictive This is more subjective. Android allows more customization, but if you don\u2019t care for customization, restriction does has some benefits. iOS is far better optimized compared to Android. It can have similar usage time with a 30% smaller battery. It can keep more apps in memory with half the RAM. App developers can produce better quality apps. Some may find Android restrictive for not offering an app as convenient as iMessage. Or how it takes more work to make an ecosystem of devices. Customer service is almost nonexistent for issues with Android devices. Software updates can be late, carrier restricted, and usually only up to 2\u20133 years. ",

There are a lot of watches that are better than Rolex but a lot of people would only buy that brand. Do your friends use that brand and so having compatible equipment is important? That has value. Yet having a product with more storage or a better screen may be unimportant, and for that user those advantages have no value. To me, Apple products are terribly overpriced, but your mileage may vary. To others it must be fairly priced because they are still selling their products. ",

The prices are set more because of the customers willingness to pay, rather than the products actual value. I\u2019m sure if there was less demand the price would be cheaper. As well as competition, as most products of the same brand status will cost a similar amount. However, I think Apple does tend to be a bit higher, because even with that people will still buy it over a cheaper option because it is an Apple product. ",

            "answer_text": "A less cost way to get an iPhone is to not buy the latest version. I bought a so-called reconditioned iPhone 6 Plus 16 gb several months ago at approx USD 255. Lots buy the latest greatest and end up selling it or trade in. I am guessing - but there must be many thousands of used or recon that are like new iPhones on the market all over the world. This is my first iPhone and in comparison to the Android phone I had before - in my usage - it is so much easier to use. It\u2019s no wonder iPhones consistently get top rankings. Also I am not going to update the OS as it comes out - but rather wait at least a few months and after whatever problems are more worked out. If you want to get around the \u201coverpriced\u201d and do not really want or need the latest greatest version - buy a used / recon like new at far less. Of course the buyer must be very careful and be sure to get a phone that has been tested and can be given a good test run by yourself. I had a month to make sure all is working good and if not I could return it. Not only saves money - but can also save the phone from ending up in the scrap piles. ",
