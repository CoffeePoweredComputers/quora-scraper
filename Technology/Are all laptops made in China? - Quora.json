            "answer_text": "I had one that was made in Taiwan before (think it was an older Gigabyte or MSI, can\u2019t remember). Most of them are made in China (PRC) though. Even if they aren\u2019t, usually the \u2018made in\u2019 sticker is based on place of assembly and not all the components\u2019 origin. Most if not all of those components are going to be made in China\u2026 so basically, the answer is yes. ",

            "answer_text": "It is hard to say with absolute certainty but most laptops are made in China or at least south east Asia. Maybe there is some laptop that is really tied to one geographical location that is why I can\u2019t really say if all laptops are made in China. But one thing is for certain, most laptops are made in China. ",
