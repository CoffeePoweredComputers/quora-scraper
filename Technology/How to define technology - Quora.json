            "answer_text": "Technology, like \u201cart,\u201d is not a terribly easy word to define. It turns out that some philosophers have already done a decent job of parceling out categories, and I think they are helpful enough to list them out here.  These definitions come from Stephen J. Kline\u2019s 1985 article \u201cWhat is Technology\u201d found in the Bulletin of Science, Technology, & Society. 1. Technology as Hardware \u2013 This is the basic level that most of us mean when we use the word \u201ctechnology.\u201d As a piece of hardware (or an \u201cartifact\u201d for the anthropologist or \u201ccultural good\u201d for the sociologist), \u201ctechnology\u201d could be a clock, a shovel, a laptop, a belt, a thermometer, a can of root beer, a canteen, a tank, or a fake duck decoy. These are basically things do not occur \u201cnaturally\u201d \u2013 which, for theists, are things God himself did not make. [As commenter Eric pointed out, this is a very broad definition which overlaps with things we would normally call art. I would also point out that this definition encompasses things that animals might make like bees' hives and beavers' dams.] 2. Technology as Manufacturing \u2013 Taking a step back from the devices in our pockets and on our desks (and the desk itself) are the things that are used to make all these other things. Technology as manufacturing includes not just about the vat holding the molten steel for our next car or the robot putting together our next computer, but also the entire process (or \u201csocio-technical system,\u201d as the philosophers say) from the people running the machines to the electrical grid powering the plant to the legislation passed that regulates the industry. This conception of technology was largely non-existent before the Industrial Revolution. 3. Technology as Methodology \u2013 If technology as manufacturing encompasses all the physical goods and people involved in making hardware, this third usage is the knowledge and knowhow \u2013 or in Jaques Ellul\u2019s terminology La Technique \u2013 behind all of these processes. This usage of technology does not refer to a physical product or even the physical machines used to make the product, but the routines, methods, and skills used to make modern hardware. Consulting firms make billions of dollars refining and streamlining the methods (or \u201cbusiness processes\u201d) that companies use to make their hardware. Methodological thinking trickles into our lives every time we say, \u201cLet\u2019s try to standardize that\u201d whether it be a recipe, a Bible study, or a parenting method. In doing so, we are putting together a set of actions, and making it a way of doing things \u2013 a technique. Ellul criticized this aspect of modern technological society because it makes efficiency the highest good above humanity, community, fellowship, and other values central to a Christian conception of God\u2019s purpose for human life. 0. Technology as Social Usage \u2013 I label this one zero because it is the top level of how we as a society use technology. Our rules for driving are a kind of social technology imposed on top of the hardware of the car. The simultaneous actions of 45 people forming an orchestra are also a kind of technology that binds together instruments, people, and music (again, there is an overlap with art and technology). The way that you are reading this blog post (on a website, in a feed reader, etc.) and the idea that you might comment and I might reply are all social processes built on top of and intimately connected to the hardware, the underlying manufacturing, and even the technological knowledge of blogging.The point to all of this is that \u201ctechnology\u201d is not just the phones in our pockets and the laptops in our bags. When we use these pieces of hardware we are taking part in something much bigger than ourselves, something that affects us individually and socially. Ultimately, having a deeper more nuanced understanding of technology can make us more careful in our usage and more cognizant of the humanity (God\u2019s most precious creation) underneath it all. ",

            "answer_text": "Technology is the skills, methods, and processes which help to achieve goals. Technology has made significant changes and impacts on human life and nature. Life without technology was different compared to the experience with technology. Both have positive and negative sides. Although it may seem that, people were more self-reliant without technology. However, I think technology has brought many life-changing features, and with the help of technology, it is easier to connect with people in less time. With technology, it is easier to contact quickly with someone or to gather information in emergencies. In cases of emergencies like fire breakdown, urgent need of money in an unknown place, or many other situations like this, a person can call their relative, friends, or helpline through mobile phones for help within a minute. Or, if a person gets lost in a place or if the police want to get access to someone\u2019s location, it is very easy to gather information through technology by using GPS or MAP services. By providing us with these advantages, technology has made our life better. Technology has brought some fantastic features which provided us with many abilities and also helped to acquire unthinkable matters. Technology has made many inventions to help disabled people. Such as creating artificial mechanical legs and hands, hearing machines for deaf people as well as other medical equipment\u2019s which helps to provide a disabled person to have various abilities. People have never thought that they will be able to fly, visit space, or talk to someone who is sitting in a different country without traveling. But technology has invented the airplane, which helps to fly to almost every location. It also created a spacecraft through which scientists are now able to visit the space. For these features and inventions, life with technology is better. It may seem that people were more self-reliant when technology was not available. On the other hand, it can also be said that people are now becoming more self-sufficient with the help of technology. Because now, people are learning various skills and making the best use of their time. With the help of technology, people are also becoming self-employed. Using technology also saves a lot of time and energy in our day to day life. This is how using technology is also keeping people self-reliant. In conclusion, it can be said that life with technology is much better than life without technology. As it saves our time and energy as well as provides us with various abilities. Positively using technology can ensure its best outcome and can make our life way more comfortable than before.
