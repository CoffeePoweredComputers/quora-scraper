            "answer_text": "There are what we call the Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS). These are the various satelites systems  whose work is to perform global geo-spatial positioning. These systems include the following; GPS/A-GPS by the US Govt.GLONASS by the Russian Govt.BDS by the Chinese Govt.Galileo by the European UnionAll those system do the same thing - mark positions on the globe though they might differ in accuracy, coverage and availability. Google Maps is a web and mobile application based maping service by Google. Technology: On the web, especially on devices with no GNSS, such as desktop computers, Google Maps offers an interactive map that be searched and scrolled to find places, measure distances, plan routes, etc. On mobile devices (with GNSS), Google Maps works with the devices' inbuilt GNSS to determine location, measure distances, give corner-by-corner directions, etc. Google Maps can work without a GNSS (like on the web to find places and measure distances) but it has more functions if used on a device with a Global Navigation Satellite System. Such extended functions include precise location and directions. ",
