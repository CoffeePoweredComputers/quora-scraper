            "answer_text": "Depends on the country: lets take for example seeing a doctor for some common ailment, in 3 of the countries I have lived in with universal healthcare. UK, walk in, see the doctor, walk out. No money exchanged. France, walk in, see the doctor, pay a small co pay (used to be 5% or roughly 1 euro) walk out. Australia, walk in, see the doctor, pay nothing to maybe 50 dollars, walk out. Why in Australia will you pay nothing to 50 dollars? Because the Australian government covers doctors visits up to a certain price. On the other hand, doctors are free to charge what they want. Many doctors and medical centres advertise \u201cbulk bulling\u201d which is their lingo for saying we charge government prices and you will not be charged anything. Some medical centres deem they can charge more for their services and they have customers that are ready to pay. I used to go to a medical centre that charged 10 dollars over, I went because it was close and convenient. Over the years they have jacked up their price to 45 dollars over. I now go to another nearby centre that bulk bills. Doctors are just as good, their hours are better, when you have an appointment, you are seen at the time of the appointment. They have a pharmacy and a lab for various tests\u2026 What is there not to like? If you are prescribed medicine, in the UK, no matter what it is, you pay a flat low fee. In France the price is covered between 75% and up to 100 %. In Australia the cost is subsidised, I wouldn\u2019t know by how much, except one day in the US I needed some anti-inflammatories, and they were roughly 10 times more expensive\u2026 From memory, 70 some US dollars compared to less than 10 Australian dollars.

            "answer_text": "Answering for Sweden. Apart from hospital parking cost (that can be avoided with some planning or if you arrive be ambulance) there are some costs. If you have to stay in a hospital there is a cost of 100 SEK/day (about 11.20 USD). That includes all the services with care, food, clothes (comfy, but not very stylish training clothes), medication as well as quite fast wifi (when I was at hospital the TV only had the basic channels so I watched a lot of Netflix). Transport to the hospital (ambulance) and home again (taxi) was at no charge. The cost of medical care also has cap at 1150 SEK per 12 month period (about 129 USD) so anything above that is free of charge. Some regions may have a lower limit, but not higher. Under that limit you have to pay it out of your own pocket. For prescription medicine there is a cap at 2350 SEK/year (about 260 USD). Under that you have to pay it out of your own pocket. Dental car is a separate issue. The cost out of pocket can be quite high. There ere different prices, but a check-up by a dentist costs 865 SEK (about 97 USD). A root canal costs around 3445 SEK (about 386 USD). I have picked an extra insurance to cover that. They start at 32 SEK/month (3.60 USD), but can be higher. I pay about 6.40 USD a month for mine, but it feels got to not having to pay anything apart from a rather small sum each month. Glasses are also a special case. You have to pay the full cost (unlike in the UK), but for kids you get an automatic grant that covers basic glasses, but if you want more expensive designer frames you have to pay the difference out of your own pocket.
