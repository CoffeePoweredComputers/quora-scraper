            "answer_text": "I read on the news today that Google is watching you even when you opt out. In the beginning of April, I saw where Greenville County, SC had the most phones moving around away from home than any other county in the country. This stuck out to me because I live almost 5 miles from the Greenville county line. I kind of like the idea that phones can really help with contact tracing. I really hate the idea that anyone can simply trace me. Especially the government. It\u2019s bad enough Google does it. But at least they mostly want to sell me stuff. Someone wanting to know where I am and who I\u2019m with is just the sort of thing to break my Libertarian heart. Contact tracing or privacy? I would rather have my privacy. Never sell out your own freedoms for \u2018protection\u2019. ",
