            "answer_text": "Before talking about the present, I'd like to talk about my first contact with technology, and it was at my elementary school and I used an old computer to search flags at Google. I was 6 and I think I liked that experience. Nowadays, during highschool and now in the senior year, technology has positively affected my student life in so many ways. When studying to some exam, or reviewing a subject, practicing with quizzes about some specific topic and subject, and even when I started learning English, online and free, technology was of great use for me, because this English learning was and is very important to me. So many of those video lessons on YouTube I've watched since the end of middle school have helped me many times and sometimes I'd recommend them to my friends cause they're very good. In this senior year, in 2020, when covid-19 affected us all, technology was there to help us all, with Google Classroom, Google Meet, maybe Skype too, WhatsApp, Google Search itself, Google Drive etc\u2026 and it is also helping me to study and prepare for the national admission exam of my country (we call it ENEM) and it's such a long, hard and exhausting exam. With its tips, videos, content, quizzes, support marterial etc. Technology and, more specifically, the Web, has been affecting my student life in a positive way since middle school, and also now at the last school year of them all and surely it will be useful in college, which is a more IT-powered environment, isn't it?! That's one of the reasons why I love technology and why I want to contribute to its expansion, improvements and future innovations. Technology changes everything, it transforms our reality; that's the way it works :) ",
