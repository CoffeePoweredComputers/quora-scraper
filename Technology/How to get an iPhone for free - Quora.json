            "answer_text": "There are two sections to this answer, one for the purists, and the other for people, who are really looking for a free iPhone. Section 1:Firstly, nothing is this world, is for free. If you judge something as being 'free' only because it doesn't cost any money, then that is an error in judgement in my opinion. You always have to give something to get something in return. Always. (Except for mother's love, maybe)Think about it, even a beggar puts in a lot of effort to 'earn'/'beg' (whatever you want to call it) his money, by slogging it out throughout the day, usually in unhygienic conditions. So the payment he makes here is in the form of his effort. Regarding the question asked here, it is clearly evident that you are looking for a shortcut to success, and haven't yet realized that it is non-existent. I would advise you to look for ways to work hard and earn money instead, and THEN go on to buy an iPhone with that. It would surely feel much better than if it was bought with someone else's money. If you are satisfied with this answer, then you should stop reading now. If not, and you really want a free iPhone, then keep going.  Section 2: This is for those people who are blessed with immense luck. If you think that you stand a great chance to hit the jackpot if you buy a lottery ticket, this one is for you. There are many tech companies that hold international giveaways for new, popular products. One I can think of is the recent Samsung Galaxy S6 giveaway by Android Authority. You can look for similar giveaways where the prize is an iPhone. If you are lucky enough, you might just end up with a brand new Apple product.  Since you are still reading, I shall assume that you might have read the first section as well. As I had mentioned there, NOTHING is for free. You need to have a great amount of luck on your side to win an International Giveaway. Cheers, and thanks for A2A! ",
