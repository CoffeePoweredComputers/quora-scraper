            "answer_text": "Both of these smartphones are from different segments buddy. One Plus 8T which is going to be unveiled on 14th October 2020 will be a pure flagship level smartphone with flagship level specifications while on the other hand One Plus Nord comes under a premium mid-range smartphone category it offers you a near flagship level experience but not a full fledged flagship level experience. And both of these smartphones will also be having a huge price difference between them so first of all you decide that you want, a flagship level smartphone or a premium mid-range level smartphone then according to your needs take a wise choice. Thank you. ",
