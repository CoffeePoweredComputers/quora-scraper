You can subscribe directly to the email list for future announcements, which is publicly disclosed. The link is in the email. And here is the text of the email: Codenamed \"Groovy Gorilla\", 20.10 continues Ubuntu's proud tradition of integrating the latest and greatest open source technologies into a high-quality, easy-to-use Linux distribution. The team has been hard at work through this cycle, introducing new features and fixing bugs. The Ubuntu kernel has been updated to the 5.8 based Linux kernel, and our default toolchain has moved to gcc 10 with glibc 2.32. Additionally, there is now a desktop variant of the Raspberry Pi image for Raspberry Pi 4 4GB and 8GB. Ubuntu Desktop 20.10 introduces GNOME 3.38, the fastest release yet with significant performance improvements delivering a more responsive Experience. Additionally, the desktop installer includes the ability to connect to Active Directory domains. Ubuntu Server 20.10 integrates recent innovations from key virtualization and infrastructure projects like QEMU 5.0, libvirt 6.6 and OpenStack Victoria. Ubuntu Server now ships Telegraf, the metrics collecting agent that together with Prometheus and Grafana form the basis of a strong and reliable logging, monitoring and alerting solution that can be deployed on Ubuntu systems. The newest Ubuntu Budgie, Kubuntu, Lubuntu, Ubuntu Kylin, Ubuntu MATE, Ubuntu Studio, and Xubuntu are also being released today. More details can be found for these at their individual release notes under the Official Flavours section: Groovy Gorilla Release Notes Maintenance updates will be provided for 9 months for all flavours releasing with 20.10.
