            "answer_text": "100% chance. We can be quite certain of this because AI is already replacing lawyers and doctors and those with professional degrees. Of course it\u2019s not replaced all of them, nor even most of them (yet), but the process has begun and it will continue as part of a broader disruption by IT in many industries. There will never be complete replacement by AI, but certainly we will continue to see AI expand it\u2019s abilities in law, medicine, and similar high education professions. Let\u2019s take lawyers for example. Early computer systems and the rise of the Internet allowed for digitization of cases and powerful search tools, thus reducing the number of lawyers and paralegals. Then websites such as LegalZoom used IT to allow the masses to automatically create common legal documents and complete simple legal processes w/o a lawyer. More jobs lost. Finally, AI comes along and the efficiencies increase further. Now AI systems such as ROSS [1] can do in days what would have taken weeks for a team of lawyers to do. After all, most lawyers spend most of their time reading documents and writing documents. State of the art AI is getting better at each of these every year, and you don\u2019t even need human level capabilities to replace humans. What computers lack in general intelligence and common sense, they can often make up for in speed. The same story can be repeated for some medical specialties and other professionals as well, but the amount to which AI will disrupt them depends on the type of work as well as non-technical obstacles like government regulation. It could be that someone with an associates degree who has received training on special AI software can detect cancer in mammograms at the same accuracy as a radiologist. But due to government regulations, don\u2019t expect anyone other than a licensed radiologist to be signing off on your scans, regardless of the amount of money this could save. Unfortunately, lobbying by professional groups has been and will continue to be a significant bottleneck to adoption of new technologies and cost-savings in general. Finally, it\u2019s worth mentioning that many professionals will not see any significant disruption by AI in the next 50 years. Some jobs depend too heavily on skills or qualities that won\u2019t be replaced in that time frame. Jobs where the smile of a human (not a robot) makes a difference. Positions where fine-grained motor control and sensation is necessary. Positions where eloquence and innate understanding of what it means to be a human are needed. A trip to the doctor may include gently prodding at just the right spots with just the right pressure and asking if it hurts. Your expressions may convey worries that can be relieved by a reassuring smile and kind words. Going to the doctor is often about more than just receiving a diagnosis.

            "answer_text": "This is so complex to answer but in my view by that time yes ai would have developed a lot and we could have quantum computing power and right now Amazon and Microsoft has started quantum computing services so as of now ai in medicine may take 90 percent of tasks of radiologists now but still in final phase of testing and by 2025 we could see them commercially in Hospitals and clinics then later we will move on consulting physicians and we will build ai that could diagnose disease way better than doctors but in the current scenario we have certain softwares which could predict simple diseases but the development of that will progress of course we can't stop it and coming to your question will it replace professional like doctors in 2067 it will replace not fully at least to be safe 70 percent of their jobs but still we may have humans in a clinic but they will oversee the process of such machines yes the doctors are required to explain everything to the patient on their medical condition but the salary of the doctor may decrease and the demand for them won't be as we have now and we may see affordable healthcare by the next 10 years yes the process will start by 2021 and lawyers no robots can go to a court and battle your case it will at least take a 100 years to reach that era yes ai will do most of the jobs of lawyer and the only thing that lawyers have to do is to use the ai to make efficient decisions but in case of doctors the machines will diagnose the disease and must verify them and sign them hope this answer helps but again the future is unpredictable any thing can all of these are just a scenario ",
