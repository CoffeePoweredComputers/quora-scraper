            "answer_text": "That depends on how you choose to define \u201crobot\u201d. In his famous work, I, Robot, Isaac Asimov referred to computers as \u201crobot brains\u201d, because he wrote the stories that compose it in the 1940s, and the term \u201ccomputer\u201d for such machines was not yet well-established. Today, the term \u201crobot\u201d is normally reserved for machines that can semi-autonomously perform physical actions. Thus, a computer in itself is not a robot. Usage seems to also restrict it to actions that were not already being performed in the past by machines. Thus, for example, no one refers to a laser printer as a \u201crobot\u201d, since automated printing presses have existed since the early 1800s, but automated tape libraries are sometimes called \u201crobots\u201d. By this definition, a computer by itself is not a robot, but it may function as part of a robot or control a robot. Of course, following science fiction, many would restrict \u201crobot\u201d to machines that can operate with near-complete autonomy: that is, which can move around from place to place, recharge themselves by hooking into a charging station, and which have all their necessary computing power onboard. By this definition, a computer is part of each robot, but a robot that is not housed in such a machine is not a robot, nor part of one. ",
