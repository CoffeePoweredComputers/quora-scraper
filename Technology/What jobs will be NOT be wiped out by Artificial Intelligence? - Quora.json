            "answer_text": "Something difficult about adapting to technology that isn\u2019t already here is predicting what the technology in question will be like. This is difficult because breakthroughs, which enable more advanced technology, are difficult to predict themselves. What jobs AI will take over and when depends heavily on its capabilities. However, some jobs do indeed appear more likely to be automated than others in the coming decades; for instance, while truck drivers and telemarketers\u2019 jobs are in peril, and while lawyers and employees of financial firms may not be in much less danger, it currently appears somewhat unlikely that AI will replace the jobs of other professions relatively soon. For instance, while AI is ever-improving in the medical field, it will likely not replace all doctors and surgeons within the next several decades. But that\u2019s a temporary fix to a profound issue, and it won\u2019t work forever. Maybe it won\u2019t be until the end of the century that most jobs are taken by AI, or maybe there will always be some jobs for humans, but that doesn\u2019t mean there doesn\u2019t need to be a solution. One idea, though a poor one, is using government to punish or hinder automation. This would put countries that implemented it at a severe disadvantage, and would, again, be a temporary fix. Another proposed idea is that of a Universal Basic Income, a government payout to everyone that covers basic living expenses (food, water, power, clothing, etc.). While it can be criticized as wealth redistributionism, which it is, it may be necessary to prevent wealth from accumulating exclusively in the hands of those who own the factories. Ultimately, in my opinion, to deal with automation, we must take a fundamentally different view of work, and perhaps of our motives for progress. Work doesn\u2019t need to be the part of one\u2019s life that gives meaning. Similarly, profit doesn\u2019t need to be our motive for progress. ",

            "answer_text": "That depends on the level of AI you\u2019re talking about. Eventually, when computers can be programmed to do everything we now do, there may not be \u201cjobs\u201d. You wake up in the morning, decide to learn geology, start studying it, get bored in a week and move on to something else. Or you don\u2019t get bored, stick with it, and add \u201cgeologist\u201d to your resume. People will be free to do what interests us, not what earns us the most money, because with computers doing everything, the economy will be totally different than anything we can imagine at this time. (Ask someone in 17th century Great Britain what jobs will not be wiped out if coal mining were to stop. First, he\u2019d have a hard time imagining a world in which coal wasn\u2019t mined. How do you power, heat or light anything without coal? Then he\u2019d never imagine TV, the internet, computers, gasoline-driven cars, etc., etc. So how will AI affect things we can\u2019t even imagine now, in the first quarter of the 21st century? We can\u2019t even imagine.) ",
