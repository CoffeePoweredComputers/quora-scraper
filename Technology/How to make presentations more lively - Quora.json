Content of the Presentation: When it comes to writing a script, many of us face a major setback as to where, when, and how to start. I would say, take a pen and diary and keep writing notes of every idea, example, quote, story you can think of, and whenever it pops up in your mind. Once you have gathered a fairly decent number of ideas on the topic, then go back to what you have written, make a fair draft, edit and come up with a freshly brewed one and remember to always put yourself in the shoe of your audience and answer these questions, If I were in the place of my audience listening to this, will it interest me?Am I making my points clear?Is the information easy to process or it is overwhelming my audience?Am I giving a takeaway or message to my audience?If your script answers all these questions, then move forward with your script, else never hesitate to redo your script. #2. Body language: Body language is an important aspect when it comes to presentation because in Public Speaking, you are the centerpiece for your audience and whatever you speak or do are the only ways to engage and win their interest. Never stand behind a table and hide from your audienceUse both the hands effectivelyDon\u2019t keep moving around the space given to you. Stand, make a point, then move to the next space but make sure to use the stage wisely#3. Voice Modulation: Vice Modulation is the key to engaging your audience. The ups, downs you employ in your voice is what makes an interesting presentation extraordinary. Make sure to always record your own script and listen to it. You will clearly know where to improve and working on those areas is the key to delivering an outstanding speech.Finally, make sure to engage your audience with the use of questions or give them space to participate and make it a two-way presentation and not one-sided, where you talk and they listen quietly.

You could even say that virtually everyone needs to get some practice and preferably good guidance before they can learn to stay calm when facing a room full of people. Having all eyes on you is an uncomfortable experience and it takes time to get used to. However, even if you can manage to control your stage fright and stay focused, it doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that your presentation won\u2019t put people to sleep. This is usually the case with long presentations on a very dull subject, with the presenter speaking in a monotone voice and dimming the lights to play a PowerPoint presentation. You have to work hard to develop the right skills  If you want to be remembered and actually get people engaged, you need to make your presentation fun and enjoyable, without coming off as corny or desperate to please. I know, it doesn\u2019t sound that easy at all! A good presentation during a promotional event or given to an important client can be a game-changer for your business, so it is easy to get stressed out and fail to perform all that well. Luckily, giving an interesting lecture is something that can be practiced and perfected. There is plenty of advice out there on the topic, but let\u2019s look at the most important aspects of giving a memorable and fun presentation. 1. Make your presentation short and sweet With very long, meandering speeches you tend to lose the audience pretty early on, and from then on out it\u2019s just a test of endurance for the few bravest listeners. Not only will people\u2019s attention start to drop rapidly after sitting and listening to you talk for 30 minutes, but you also risk watering down your core ideas and leaving your audience with little in the way of key phrases and important bits of information to take away from the whole ordeal. Famous speakers throughout history have known the importance of condensing the information by using well thought out sentences and short phrases loaded with meaning.  JFK\u2019s famous: \u201dIt\u2019s not what your country can do for you, but what you can do for your country,\u201d expresses so much in very few words and gets the audience thinking. Ancient Spartans, for example, were famous for their quick, dry wit, often demolishing their opponent\u2019s argument with a single word or phrase. You\u2019ll want to channel that ancient spirit and be as concise as possible when preparing your presentation. 2. Open up with a good ice breaker In the beginning, you are new to the audience. There is no rapport, no trust, and the atmosphere is fairly neutral. Even if some of the people there know you personally, the concept of you as an authority on a particular matter giving a speech will be foreign to them. The best way to encourage a warm and friendly atmosphere is to get some kind of emotional response out of the audience right at the beginning. It doesn\u2019t matter what emotion it is, you just need to connect with them on a more personal level. It can be a shock, curiosity, laughter, knowing smirks, nervousness \u2013 whatever gets them out of that initial feeling of indifference. There are different kinds of effective ice-breakers, but generally speaking, the most successful ones utilize one of these tactics: JokingTugging on their heartstringsDropping a bombastic statementTelling an interesting and relevant anecdoteUsing a metaphor or drawing comparisons You can make a small, self-deprecating comment, stir the presentation one way and then suddenly surprise the audience, use sarcasm, open up with a short childhood story that taught you a lesson, quote a famous person and elaborate on it from personal experience, use an inspirational anecdote or hit them with a bit of nostalgia. Just remember to keep it short and move on once you\u2019ve got a reaction. 3. Keep things simple and to the point Once you\u2019re done warming up the crowd you can ease them into the core concepts and important ideas that you will be presenting. Keep the same presentation style throughout. If you\u2019ve started a bit ironic, using dry wit, you can\u2019t just jump into a boring monologue. If you\u2019ve started with a bang, telling a couple of great little jokes and getting the crowd riled up, you have to keep them happy by throwing in little jokes here and there and being generally positive and energetic during the presentation. You need a certain structure that you won\u2019t deviate too far from at any point. A good game plan consists of several important points that need to be addressed efficiently. This means moving on from one point to another in a logical manner, coming to a sound conclusion, and making sure to accentuate the key information. 4. Use a healthy dose of humor Some of the best speeches and presentations in the world, which have been heard and viewed by millions, all feature plenty of humor. No matter the subject, a great speaker will use natural charisma, humor, and beautiful language to convey their points and get the crowd excited about what they are saying. A great example of building rapport with the audience through the use of humor is Barrack Obama talking about the government building Iron Man. It is silly and fun, and absolutely not something that you would expect from a man in a position of power speaking in such a serious setting \u2013 and it\u2019s exactly why it works. The more serious the situation and the bigger the accent on proper social behavior, the harder your jokes will hit. 5. Try to tell a story instead of ranting  Some people can do all of the above things right and still manage to turn their short and fun little presentation into a chaotic mess of information. You don\u2019t want your speech to look like you just threw a bunch of information in a blender in no particular order. To avoid rambling, create a strong structure. Start with the ice breaker, introduce the core concepts and your goals briefly, elaborate on the various points in a bit more detail, draw logical conclusions, and leave your audience with a clear takeaway message. You want to flow naturally from one part to the next like you are telling a big story chapter by chapter. 6. Practice your delivery Standing in front of the mirror and practicing a speech or presentation is a technique as old as mirrors \u2013 well, come to think of it, as old as human speech, since you can see yourself reflected in any clear and calm body of water \u2013 and that means that it is tried and true. The theory is incredibly simple, yet the real problem is actually putting in the effort day in and day out. Work on your posture, your tone of voice, accent, pauses between sentences, and facial expressions. The most important thing is to talk slowly and loudly enough to be heard and understood clearly. Many famous speakers, such as Demosthenes and King George VI, overcame speech impediments through hard work. 7. Move around and use your hands Although you won\u2019t instill confidence in your project if you are very jittery, moving around erratically, not knowing what to do with your hands and making fast movements, standing dead still can be just as bad. You shouldn\u2019t be afraid to use your arms and hands when talking as it makes you seem more passionate and confident. The same goes for moving around and taking up some space. However, try to make slower, calculated, and deliberate movements. You want your movements to seem powerful, yet effortless. You can achieve this through practice. 8. Engage the audience by making them relate  Sometimes you will lose the audience somewhat in techno-babble, numbers, graphs, and abstract ideas. At that point, it is important to reel them back in using some good, old-fashioned storytelling. Make comparisons to events from everyday life that most people are more than familiar with. By making things look simple, not only will you help your audience get a better understanding of the subject by enabling them to visualize the information more clearly, but you will also draw a connection between you. After all, you are all just regular people with similar experience, you just happen to be performing different roles at the moment. 9. Use funny images in your slides  Although slides are not really necessary at all times, if you do need them to make your point and present your information more effectively, it\u2019s best to liven them up. They say that facts aren\u2019t always black and white, and your presentation should reflect this. Add a bit of color, make the information stand out, and use an interesting animation to switch from slide to slide. You can use the slides to add some more humor, both in terms of the text and the images. An image that is used to elicit a positive response needs to be funny within the context of what you are discussing. For example, if you are discussing the topic of authority, an image of Eric Cartman from South Park in a police uniform, demanding that you respect his \u201cauthority,\u201d is a nice way to have a bit of fun and lighten things up. 10. End on a more serious note When all is said and done you will want the audience to remember the core concepts and keep thinking about what you have said after the presentation is over. This is why you should let things naturally calm down and end with an important idea, quote, or even a question. Plant a seed in their mind and make them think. Let us turn to Patrick Henry for a great way to end a speech: \u201cIs life so dear or peace so sweet as to be purchased at the price of chains and slavery? Forbid it, Almighty God! I know not what course others may take; but as for me, give me liberty or give me death.\u201d As you can see, there is quite a bit to learn when it comes to giving a good presentation, one that is both memorable and fun. Be sure to work on your skills tirelessly and follow in the footsteps of great orators. Information From:- 10 Secrets of Making Every Presentation Fun, Engaging, and Enjoyable ",
