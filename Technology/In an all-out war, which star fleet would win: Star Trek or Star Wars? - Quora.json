            "answer_text": "Short Answer: \u2018Star Trek Technology\u2019 is vastly superior to \u2018Star Wars\u2019, but in an all out war, \u2018Star Wars\u2019 will win. Long Answer: this is one of the great debates among sci fi fans (and by \u2018great\u2019, I refer to the size of the argument, not the quality.) there are factors on both sides that impact the eventual outcome, and a lot of the details about the ships and their capabilities from both sides are undefined or widely variable, and folks tend to use the most powerful estimates for the side they favor, and the least powerful for the opposition. (full disclosure: I prefer star trek to star wars, though I don\u2019t \u2018hate\u2019 star wars.) First, consider the weapons. the Imperials have Turbolasers, the Federation has Phasers. a Trekkie makes jokes based on a comment from one episode that lasers wont even get through the navigational shields, so they laugh off SW weapons, and Warsies did some random math at some point that said the powerlevels of a Turbolaser were in the billions of terajoules making a single shot enough to vaporize the Enterprise shields and all. both of these estimates are inaccurate. Han solo said after seeing what was left of alderaan that to destroy an entire planet, it would take the power of half the imperial fleet. that is THOUSANDS of capitol ships, each with hundreds of lasers. when you figure in how much power is needed to destroy a planet, if the over the top power levels SW supporters cite were accurate, you\u2019d only need fifty Imp Capitol ships to do the job, not thousands. Over in Star trek, a fleet of some 50 or so Cardassian and Romulan ships attacked a planet full of leaders of the Dominion, and those 50, pouring on the weapons fire, melted the entire surface of a planet. if a few thousand ST ships were pouring it on, then , sure, they\u2019d be able to blow up the planet, just like an imperial fleet. so, it is reasonable to assume, whatever the label, the energy weapons of both ships are roughly equivalent in power. then there are Torpedoes: Photon for ST, Proton for SW. a photon Torpedo uses an antimatter warhead; proton torpedoes use some form of exotic matter. both of them are packing more of a wallop than a single shot form energy weapons, but they don't get a lot of use. based on the few times we see the Imperials use torpedoes, these are more powerful than UFP torpedoes\u2026but the Imps don\u2019t use them very much while feds are a bit more free with them. a federation torpedo spread (say, 8 to 12 torps) is roughly equal to a single proton torpedo. then you have the Shields: ST fans do the \u2018they don't have shields, just beam a torpedo on the bridge and you win\u2019 argument, which is weak and short-sighted. Imps have shields. there are those big geodesic domes sticking out of the hull that serve as shield generators. during the star wars movies, we saw a few scenes where rebel fighters take out those generators first (sometimes by crashing into them) and that brings down the shields so the rest of the ship is more vulnerable. imperial shields do seem to be designed around repelling energy weapons (solid objects crash right through them) but they are, when fully operational, highly effective. Federation shields seem to be slightly better. not necessarily more powerful (those shields go down to 47% after only a few shots) but Fed shields also repel solid objects (like torpedoes) and due to technological advantages (which i\u2019ll go into more detail about later) they can also be \u2018tuned\u2019 on the fly to different frequencies, allowing them to be more effective at repelling enemy fire by finding a frequency that works best. those shields are not impervious to weapons fire, end after enough shots, they WILL go down\u2026so while they might be better than Imp shields, Imps have a LOT of guns doing the shooting. weapon range is a factor to consider. for most fights, combat range seems roughly the same for each ship, but Imp weapons do have a much longer reach than fed tech. those capitol ships can sit way back and fire barrages of turbolaser fire, sending fighters forward for close combat, and it would seem their range for energy weapons is at least a million KM if not more\u2026.feds have a range of a few hundred thousand KM at MOST, with perhaps a million KM for a torpedo shot. the Imp tractor beam has a range of several million Kilometers, based on when the Death star was able to lock on to the Millennium Falcon, while Fed tractor beams are short\u2026a thousand Kilometers, maybe? if they really pushed it to maximum range? size is also a consideration. consider one of the biggest battlecruisers the federation has built: the Sovereign class Enterprise (NCC 1701-E, from the last few \u2018Next Generation\u2019 movies.) it\u2019s armored, with heavier weapons and shields, and measures some 700 meters long. an Imperial Star Destroyer, on the other hand, is around 2000 meters long. and then you start getting into the big ones for the Imps, Super Star Destroyers and the like, and lengths of 5,000 meters and more are common. they make a really BIG ship. so, it\u2019ll take a lot more shots to take one down. if ne were to try and have a \u2018fair\u2019 fight utilizing an equal amount of tonnage on both sides, then it would take five or six federation ships fighting a single star destroyer to meet that tonnage parity. federation ships have maybe a dozen weapon hardpoints for firing phasers. they have a full coverage of fire for their weapons, though not all their weapons can fire in every direction at once. Imps have about a hundred turrets on one of their SDs, and most of that firepower is facing forward, leaving their rear flank with much less protection. federation fire accuracy is higher (better computer systems) while Imps seem to rely on gunnery crews for each weapon, and thy are less accurate. they compensate by firing so many shots, and because they can pour out a LOT of firepower, they are still going to score a lot of hits, even if their accuracy is abysmal. then you have support craft: fighters vs shuttles. Imps have TIE fighters, very fast, highly maneuverable, lightly shielded, and packing low-powered rapid fire weapons. feds have Shuttles\u2026minivans with shields and phasers. the edge here definitely goes to the Imps. but Fed ships don't rely too much on their small craft in battle, using instead their better targeting abilities and the ability to fire a lot of torpedoes set for \u2018proximity\u2019 detonation to score kills on small attack craft. now, while some people will say that an Imp ship packs hundreds of fighters, they never seem to deploy that many\u2026at most 20 or 30 are deployed at a time. I have no idea if this is because of some limitation in Friendly fire tracking software, or a lack of pilots, or poor military doctrine, but you never see a single SD deploy hundreds of fighters at once. so, taken a few at a time, the feds will be able to clear them out. (of course, the time they take to shoot down fighters is time they are NOT shooting at the Imp SD, so the fighters are a problem.) next, consider movement: OF the two different FTL drives in use, Imperials faster by several orders of magnitude. crossing a galaxy takes an Imp in hyperdrive a few weeks, while the same distance with Fed warp drive would take 100 years. Hyperdrives are slow to spin up, and take time to calculate a jump path, while Feds can just sump in whenever they want, and change direction on the fly\u2026.and while using Warp drive for close combat maneuvers was only done once or twice by Fed ships, it CAN be done, while Imps don\u2019t have that kind of flexibility with their own drives. as far as sublight drives go, Imp Capitol ships are slow, ponderous beasts, while fed ships are much faster and maneuverable. (Imps rely on fighters because the fighters are much more maneuverable and quick at sublight speeds, even more maneuverable than Fed tech, but a Fed ship\u2019s maneuverability is far superior to that of an SD.) Feds have a crucial advantage in Technological development. Imperial Tech hasn't changed much in hundreds of years (if what we have been shown of the \u2018old republic\u2019 stuff in Star Wars is any indication). they are primarily geared toward combat, and fielding massive forces, and overwhelming enemies by sheer strength of numbers. Feds, on the other hand, are engineers, scientists, tinkers. While Feds don't have cloaking devices, that is due to poor diplomatic choices and not a technological gap; cloaking devices in the ST universe are small enough and effective enough to cloak something as small as a shuttle, while imperial cloaking tech requires massive equipment and components, making it impossible to build a cloaking device small enough even for a small freighter. Trek Tech is engineered to be efficient, to be radically advanced and compact, while SW tech is stuck with a \u2018bigger is better\u2019 mindset; showing very little innovation of improvement in their technology. Feds also have Transporter technology, superior holographic technology, matter replicators\u2026most of these systems can be weaponized in a desperate enough situation, and Imperials do not have any technological equivalents to match that. if a fed ship takes out that shield generator, they can use the transporters. not to beam a torpedo onto the bridge; that would be silly and not very effective given the size of an SD\u2026.but they could lock on to pieces of the SD that look really important and beam out a chunk of that machinery or circuitry\u2026.or beam over \u2018boarding parties\u2019 right into the center of the ship rather than have to cut through the hull and fight past thousands of stormtroopers in a physical boarding operation\u2026.or possibly, if their targeting is good enough, just beam TIE fighter pilots directly to their brig, neutralizing those fighters\u2026 feds are also brilliant at on-the-fly modifications of their equipment. a hand phaser can be rejiggered into a forcefield generator, a subspace radio can be reconfigured into a pulse weapon, a tractor beam can be disabled by setting up an exotic particle feedback loop\u2026.Imps do not display that level of cleverness or ingenuity. so, a fight between a soveriegn-class battlecruiser from the UFP and an Imperial Star Destroyer is a close thing. if the Feds are clever enough, their technological advantages can overcome the raw firepower of an Imperial SD. (if the fight were done on a tonnage parity model, 5 Fed ships vs one IMP SD, then the Feds will win easily. in a one ship vs one ship fight\u2026.a fed win is probably going to happen, but it isn't a sure thing.) HOWEVER, in an \u2018all out war\u2019, as the question puts forth, the number of Capitol hulls the Empire has outnumbers what the federation has by a hundred to one\u2026in terms of raw tonnage, the Imps outweigh the feds by something like a THOUSAND to one. Federation tech advantages may favor the feds for a ten-to one fight, possibly, if they really put their minds to it, twenty to one\u2026.but a thousand to one is just such an overwhelming number. coupled with the better logistical supply lines the superior imperial FTL provides, if the Galactic Empire invaded the United Federation of Planets, the Imperials win in a matter of weeks. yes, they will take heavy losses, far heavier than they inflict, but there are just so damn many of them that they can soak up the damage and roll right over the entire federation. (of course, I should also note that since Imperial doctrine is one of conquest and not complete annihilation, they will ,after crushing the federation, be sending troops to occupy and capture all those planets and technology, and whatever Resistance movement the surviving feds cook up is going to be much more effective than the rebel alliance ever was\u2026it will take months, not years, to break the Empire and regain their freedom.)

            "answer_text": "If you scroll through the answers and comments to this question, you will hear a lot of discussion about comparable speeds, firepower, and shielding. What you will not hear is what will actually determine the victor, tactics. Because of the vast differences in the designs of these two groups, discussing the results of a toe-to-toe fight is dumb. Neither Admiral Kirk or Grand Admiral Thrawn would approve of engaging in anything that might turn into a fair fight. The first major tactic that will determine the war would be: (borrowing a word from Warhammer 40K) Exterminatus. What is the willingness of each side to destroy all life/equipment on a planet in order to deny its resources to the other side? Both sides have armies, but not enough to quell multiple planets in full-scale (planet-wide) uprisings. Planets with billions of people, require hundreds of thousands, if not millions of troopers to maintain order. Troops run out fast, even with the large numbers of Imperial troops versus Federation planets. As such, you will eventually have to begin razing planets, or figure out a way to win the war very, very quickly. While the Federation has done this in the past, it is very, very rare and tends to create internal revolts. The Empire has done this repeatedly, but still seems to refrain from using it as a regular tactic. Instead, they tend to use it more as a show of force to instill general fear. The First Order seems to have no qualms using this tactic when and where they please. Thankfully, they have tighter budgets than the Empire and can not afford to do this often as they are willing to do so. The end result is that as long as the Empire/First Order continues to be callous in ordering the extermination of the oppositions civilians and manufacturing systems, The Empire will win in a war of attrition or elimination. As such, the Federation needs to really step up its defenses and win the war quickly. If the Federation has at least one reasonably smart Admiral (which according to the show, tends to be very lacking in general, but for the sake of this argument, they have one), then they will realize that the single best asset they have is not the Enterprise or the Genesis weapon or the Romulans, it\u2019s this:  The Danube Class Runabout. Combine this with the Akira Class\u2019s Flight Deck designs, and the Federation will quickly be the dominant space force. Why you might ask. It is simple. Tactics. With the technology the Federation already possesses, the last thing they want to do is engage in Broadside barrages or Dogfights. Instead, take advantage of the fact that the enemy doesn\u2019t have anything to scramble transporters. Load out the Runabouts with enhanced sensory suites and one really large bomb (I suggest something along the \u2018Quantum\u2019 lines). Use the Akira Class to quickly maneuver the Runabouts between systems and then deploy the squadron(s) when relatively close. Use the Runabouts\u2019 Warp Engines to perform the Picard maneuver (with the extra computational load required for the quick resolution being performed by that newly installed sensor suite). As soon as the Runabout is in the primary weapon shadow of the enemy vessel, they can let their shields soak the damage (transferring all of the shield power to the side facing the enemy and leaving a break for the transporter to do its thing) for a minute while they transport that really nice bomb sitting on their transporter pad inside of the enemy ship. Pretty much every movie confirms that once the shields are down on an Imperial vessel, it won\u2019t be long until it is destroyed. Transport it next to the main power plant, and you can be certain that it won\u2019t last long. Then the Runabout returns to the Akira from some quick repairs and a new bomb before going out again. Until the Empire gets transporter distortion technology (which took the Federation years to figure out even after they had their transporters working), a single Akira class loaded with Runabouts could wipe out dozens of Imperial ships without taking significant damage. Once the Empire figures out what is happening, they will have to invade planets with hundreds of ships at a time, relying on the slowness of Warp drives between systems to prevent effective redeployment of forces once the battle is engaged. Unfortunately, one large Imperial battleforce jumping into a planet with dozens of secretly staged Akiras and the war is pretty much over. The Akira and their runabouts can Picard warp all over the battlefield, blowing the Capital Classes up from within. It should also be noted that the common consensus is that Star Trek transporter range is further or at least equal to the effective long range for all but the biggest of the Imperial Weapons (the ones designed for planetary bombardment). So, a small, agile, and moving target should be able to avoid taking significant damage from a vessel that is firing at extreme ranges with weapons meant to hit asteroids and battleships, not small fighters. And as for the screening from fighters, it doesn\u2019t take much study to realize that the Star Wars fighters would see much of their operation in bombardment tactics and fighting other light assault vehicles. Unfortunately for the TIEs and ?-Wings, the Danube has near capital class weapons. Much higher than even most Star Wars Patrol Ships and even most SW Frigates. If the Sensory Suite also possesses a Friend/Foe Auto-targeting system, it could easily destroy a squadron within seconds to minutes (depending on just how good those shields are). And they wouldn\u2019t even need someone to man the targeting system. A Squadron of unshielded TIEs would take less than a minute to be identified and completely destroyed. So, the question is: Does SW crush ST through the collapse of Morale from SW\u2019s Scorched Earth policies? Or does the Federation create a defensive line that SW doesn\u2019t dare cross after losing thousands+ of their capital ships because they can\u2019t adjust to Warp-Skipping (the act of engaging the warp drive for a fraction of a second to re-position the ship in a more favorable location) Bomb Transporting Ships of Doom. Oh, and in the lucky case where a capital ship hits the Danube several times, the Federation loses two people and the meager time/resources needed to replace a ship that is somewhat approximately a thousand times smaller than most of the Enterprises. Seriously, when this war hits All-out stage, the Federation will be creating one of these an hour (maybe less) and an Akira every couple weeks. If they do get the Romulans involved, Cloaked Danubes would be just that more dangerous. ",
