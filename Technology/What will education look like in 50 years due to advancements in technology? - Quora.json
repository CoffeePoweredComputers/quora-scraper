            "answer_text": "Education will be empowered by technology. Teachers and tutors will be replaced by robotics. Instead of talking education, we will talk technology. Teachers and tutors will be out of jobs because robotics will take their spots. Most people will be jobless and they will stay home. Who will go to school of robotics? The meaning of school is going to disappear. School will be a factory of robotics. Teachers and tutors out of jobs will be on strike. More problems are going to be created by the excessive technology. Planet Earth will be Planet technology. Who is going to live on Earth then? Nobody. What a life! My advice is, technology must have limits. ",
