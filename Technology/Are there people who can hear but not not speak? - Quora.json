            "answer_text": "Some people are born with a disorder in which they are mute.  Possible causes are that they have problems with their esophagus, vocal cords, lungs, mouth or tongue...  If they weren't born lacking the ability to speak, it could be caused by the Broca's area of the brain being injured.  Another factor is a non-physical factor, it's a psychological one. After a frightening trauma, some people wish not to speak anymore. You can find out more about muteness here: Muteness.  ",
