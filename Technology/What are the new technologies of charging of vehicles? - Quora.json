            "answer_text": "Charging if vehicles is a major issue with EVs. Several methods are in use and some under development today. Apart from charging at home overnight, it is necessary to have charging facilities at parking lots and at office. Particularly when you are on travel, today it becomes necessary to plan in advance for charging at known charging stations and time required for charging. Following technologies are under development for efficient and fast charging\u2014 Underground charging\u2014 This obviates necessity of physical connection and charges vehicles by induction (from underground coil), from grid supplyFast charging by battery\u2014 supercapacitor combination. This can charge an EV in minutes.Fast charging of buses and trams from locally erected umbrella stops via battery/supercapacitor systemContinuous charging on road through underground cable system by inductionUltracapacitors powered buses and trams are charged at special umbrella stops from another large charged ultracapacitor bank .New development underway of swapping the batteries at charging stations does away with charging time completelyPeople are also trying with models with solar power charging through panels incorporated on vehicle itselfSupercapacitor powered metro trains are charged at stations from underground system between rails in 30 seconds.China has developed solar road, which can charge e-vehicles as they travel.On road charging does away with large energy storage on vehicles and stoppages for charging.
