            "answer_text": "How is a DVD-9 different from a DVD? and by \u201cDVD-9\u201d I\u2019m assuming that you mean a dual layer DVD with a 8.5GB capacity. These DVDs have multiple layers that can be burned, given a recording drive capable of doing dual layers rather than the single layer, 4.7GB DVD drives that were initially realeased. Most (all?) drives can read properly recorded dual layer discs (I\u2019ve never had an issue reading commercially burned dual layer discs on a read only DVD (computer) drive. By way of example, here is an (desktop) internal Sony DL (Dual Layer) burner for sale on the \u201cNew Egg\u201d web site: SONY DVD\u00b1RW (\u00b1R DL) drive SATA Model 5280S-CB-ROBOT - Newegg.com. for for $155. A portable version, e.g. if you\u2019re Laptop oriented LG SP80NB80 Portable DVD-Writer - DVD-RAM/\u00b1R/\u00b1RW Support - 24x CD Read/24x CD Write/24x CD Rewrite - 8x DVD Read/8x DVD Write/8x DVD Rewrite - Double-layer Media Supported - USB - Sl - Newegg.com for $48 (also on New Egg). note that even if they say DVD in the title and it\u2019s only $20\u201330, the burner may be able to READ DVD but only burns CDs\u2026 or READ DL DVD, it can only write SL DVD. Now, for what its worth (FWIW), the same architecture applies to Blu-ray SL is 25GB, Dual Layer (DL) is 50GB but the discs are more expensive (and they\u2019ve been out there for a while. But they\u2019ll write DL DVD as well as CDs\u2026 Here is an external LG burner from Best Buy: https://www.bestbuy.com/site/lg-6x-external-blu-ray-disc-double-layer-dvdrw-cd-rw-drive-black/6162900.p While this is not what you asked, given the incremental price difference, you may find it worth considering. Good Luck. ",

            "answer_text": "A DVD-9 has two data layers on it, one underneath the other. The laser on the drive reading it changes its wavelength to read the second layer, such that the beam will pass through the outer layer, and bounce off pits in the lower one. The total storage capacity is around 8 to 8.5 GB, depending on how it is formatted. A single layer DVD is known as a DVD-5, and can hold roughly 4.2 to 4.7 GB. As a general rule, the first sign of failing optical components in a drive is when it has trouble reading the inner layer of a double layer disc. ",
