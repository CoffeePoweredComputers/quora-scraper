            "answer_text": "The short answer is not very widespread at all. All of the carriers are doing testing, but to take advantage of 5G you need both the carrier infrastructure and the phone infrastructure. 5G will first start *really* rolling out in 2020 or 2021, but you will not see widespread 5G until a year or two after that. And, AT&T is cheating in calling it\u2019s service \u201c5Ge\u201d, that is a marketing gimmick at best and really clouds the water. In many places their \u201c5Ge\u201d service actually lags its competitors in performance. ",
