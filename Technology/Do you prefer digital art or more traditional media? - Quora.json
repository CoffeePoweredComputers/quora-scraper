            "answer_text": "Well, I loved my oil paints\u2026 but having to wait days to weeks for painting to dry, I moved to acrylics and after a few years could make them look like oil painting. I love my hands in building things, so traditional artwork be it painting, drawing or sculpture is always nice. As a photographer for 53 years on the other hand, I love the wet darkroom but the advantage of the digital camera and digital reproduction and adjustments to work with is very nice. Spending an hour creating a image in a wet darkroom and then having to go through the whole process again and HOPE you don\u2019t mess up a set is very trying. With digital I can produce the same work and then just touch a button and do it again. I can save that file down and a few months later make a difference version. Yes, we did this in the wet darkroom too, Ansel Adams famous MOON over graveyard is a great example of changing with the years. As a writer, I love not having to put a clean sheet of paper in the typewriter every time I screw up on hitting the wrong key. As a dyslexic person that means a ream of paper per poem some times. Being able to proof on screen is great! Being able to proof a printout and just hit a button to produce another printout after changes is EVEN BETTER!  So digital is very nice and great in it\u2019s own ways, it is sad to see people WHO ARE NOT CREATIVE make so much noise\u2026 Editing Photography is standard be it wet darkroom or digital. Editing of writing is standard, be it on a typewriter or a computer. Digital art is wonderful even if it is a digital drawing tablet with a pressure sensitive pen. People who paint with oils or acrylics are not bad or dumb, any more than a person who still shoots film cameras. I have used 100+ year old cameras myself. Art is more about the finished product that the process & while \u201capps\u201d do make it cheap\u2026 so what in the 1960s we had the Polaroid Camera\u2026 as well as the professionals who used a Hasselblad Camera\u2026 or Nikon, Canon, etc\u2026 ",

            "answer_text": "I don\u2019t see why you would have to choose between the two. Personally, I like to switch between them, especially when I feel I\u2019m becoming too dependent on Ctrl+z (there has been times where I have literally extended my hand to do the Undo motion while drawing on paper, only to realize that\u2026well, I\u2019m drawing on paper) or zooming in on the drawing. However, digital is sort of my main thing because I have can make drawings with actual colors in them. If there\u2019s a problem budget wise, I\u2019d say that digital is more cost-effective in the long run, assuming you already have a computer. Most programs you can get for free if you know where to look, and they offer pretty good renderings and simulations of traditional media without all the mess. No need to buy expensive brushes/oils/acrylics/canvases/watercolors/etc. when they run out (although, you don\u2019t need all of these to make traditional art, as you already probably know). But traditional art helps with technique, technique you can apply to your digital media. My answer, to conclude, is both. But if you had to choose\u2026yikes, I couldn\u2019t make that decision. It would be like making me choose between dogs or cats; I love \u2019em both too much in their own way! ",

            "answer_text": "As an observer, I love both. But what I dislike very much are attempts to use digital arts merely to replicate traditional mediums. Digital need to be their own reality - to be honored as a medium for what can be expressed through them. I've seen artists claim to be painting digitally - and the work feels soulless and without meaning. Sometimes digital manipulation of images that start as traditional media can be ok\u2026but not often. And as illustration they can be quite effective but as artworks I find they lack substance. That said, I believe society needs to honor the highly skilled making required by traditional media. These are very human activities the imbue their work with unusual sense of the soul because hand craft naturally becomes individual. Making? I make digitally for commercial use (national TV and web advertising). However when I want to be expressive I draw with pen and paper. Or paint. For me, expressing digitally isn't human enough. ",

            "answer_text": "I have drawn in traditional methods and also digitally and like any medium there is a short learning curve to become comfortable in it. I consider digital drawing allows you to rapidly develop your drawing skills faster. This is because the convenience of the tablet where you can pick it up and start drawing as opposed to having pencil and paper always handy. Is it better to learn one medium or another\u2026it\u2019s entirely up to you what medium you choose that feels comfortable with you. Many focus on one particular medium such as acrylics and others enjoy the digital medium. Another advantage of digital medium is that the tools available can be fairly diverse so you can really experiment with your creativity. Drawing skills are more important to the digital medium because you are only operating the stylus to produce the drawing. I would encourage you to try both and see what you prefer. There are many digital apps out there that can get you started such as Sketch, Paintology etc. Hope this helps! ",

I love painting and drawing. However I have always been a tech person. All my life. Back when computers were newer and everyone had one..i would get bored and draw with my mouse in Windows draw.. It took some training but still could be done. Later I thought it would be cool to learn digital and decided to go to school for game production. Better programs better effects. Technology got better. With a Styalus pen. Now I had the chance to create in 2d and 3d forms..which is kind of like sculpture just in computer world. Enviroments are fun to create. You still use all the basics you learn in traditional art just a different medium. To me it is all the same! I still get to create my art. Doesn't matter what media. As long as I can create Is all that matters. ",

Digital art no doubt has its place, but I need the contact of the real thing, what is that word\u2026? Five minutes later I remembered hahaha, Tactile! I have a short term memory problem sadly, can recall some of the tiniest details about art. I love the smell of oils, if I make an error I simply remove it using a painting knife, sometimes waiting for the machine to do its stuff can be very frustrating. But most of all, I\u2019ve painted in oils for the past 58 years, and I don\u2019t want to change. Thank you for asking me though ",

I think artists should be working at the cutting edge always, even if that means inventing the tools themselves. I seriously doubt Da Vinci would be painting if he was a 16 year-old in 2017.
