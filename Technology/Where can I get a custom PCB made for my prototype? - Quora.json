            "answer_text": "It depends how many you want. There are a couple of hobbyist services that will get you just one, but they work by collecting a whole bunch of designs and having them made all at once on the same sheet of fiberglass, so you may have to wait a long time while they assemble enough to make it worth while. These seem cheap, in the $30 range, but per square inch they work out fairly expensive. If you can use three or more pieces there are many more options. Here\u2019s a page with a number of links - PCB Manufacturers Reviews and Notes The service I use all the time - Gold Phoenix - is listed there. ",

            "answer_text": "If you are doing a very small run (less than 10 boards), you can design the board yourself, using the program of your choice. OSH Park provides good quality boards at a reasonable price. They also offer free shipping. I\u2019ve used Elecrow\u2019s PCB fabrication service, and the boards I got were not too shabby for prototyping. ",
