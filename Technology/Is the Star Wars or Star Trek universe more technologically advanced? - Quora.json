            "answer_text": "it\u2019ll vary, Trek has some areas where it is clearly more advanced then SW, the most notable are transporters and replicators, in other areas however SW is clearly the superior. for example, hyperdrive is considerably faster then warp drive (voyager wouldn\u2019t have been a thing if this was star wars) one thing I wanna note, trekkie partisans often claim data is proof that AI is more advanced in Trek then SW, but it actually proves the oppisite, AI is almost a holy grail type research in trek, it\u2019s been acheived but always in isolated instances etc. in SW it\u2019s pretty much a normal thing. C3P0 is less sophisticated then data, not because the tech level is lower, but because he doesn\u2019t need to has as advanced a frame. he\u2019s specialty built. ",

            "answer_text": "The technology in some ways is almost regressive. More advanced things are possible, like faster than light travel, but most of the technology seems to be just more advanced versions of what we already have with a few improvements. If you have an advanced spaceship why would you not also have advanced AI or even voice controls etc. Star trek, at least the NG portrays the future of earth at least as essentially being utopian, with food that can be created instantaneously out of machines, no poverty as such etc due to technology. Star Wars doesn't have anything that would compare. ",
