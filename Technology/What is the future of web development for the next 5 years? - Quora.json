            "answer_text": "There are a few different directions the web world can go in. As of now we are working in a component driven development enviroments. Frameworks like React, Angular and Vue have really become the default for building complicated applications. How I see web evolving I nthe future is creating even bigger abstractions then these frameworks have. It is becoming easier and easier to do web development, and that is due to the fact that we have these abstractions of JavaScript code. As for the backend, we will see huge movement to the Python world. This is due to several reasons but the main one is the amount of things you can do with a python backend. You want AI? You have Tensorflow. You want computer vision? You have OpenCV. You want mathematics? You have matplotlib\u2026. There are so many things that can be done in python. The most important thing is that there will be no renting of templates in Flask or Django. Instead you are rendering JSON data depending on the route. This is called a REST API. The main advantage of a REST API is that it doesn't care about who is making the request, it just cares about getting the data through. So maybe you have a multi platform application - IOS, Android, Web, Desktop. The rest API doesn't care which one of these devices makes the call, it will give the data to them. That brings me to my next point - web will overtake the native platforms. In 10 years time, everything that can run JavaScript will run JavaScript. We already have frameworks like React Native which give us amazing opportunity to test these things which will soon become a part of our day to day lives. The main problems with these platform-x frameworks is the speed and level of abstraction, but as processors get faster and as developers get more used to this way of doing this, we will see a rapid change in the native world. No one in their right mind will write an application in Java, then the same application in objective C, and then again in JS. They will just use JS and it will work on all platforms. ",

            "answer_text": "I am in this field for last 6 years, with extensive and practical knowledge with global teams and international clients. My personal view is after 5 year, AI systems will automate front-end page looks based on customer\u2019s experience and auto generate needed codes with help of Machine Learning - deep learning , neural networks , also back-end will be AI which will automate API\u2019s. I have already seen and worked on such systems which do the same, but need perfection, more learning and more strong AI. So the question future of web development will become AI first as of now it\u2019s mobile first. Yes you can learn any popular web programming language that will give you enough for living, but if need to be exceptional and excellence we need to grow ourselves and evolve and those persons will no longer get bounded by term web developer, it will be far more than that. My Personal suggestion, be prepared for the same, learn any web programming languages like javascript, python , go whatever you feel easy to use, then focus on programming AI systems. ",

Similarly, as with many predictions(sources), we are just able to find the indications and future trends of web development that can help to point us in the right direction. Some of these trends are an update to a previous trend which expels all its drawbacks while some are totally new to the field.  Artificial intelligence - Whenever there is a mention of the future of web development, you cannot lack the topic of artificial intelligence. In recent years, AI has undergone a lot of research and advancements. AI-enabled chatbots can be the cutting-edge enterprise digital assistants of your brand on the internet. The programmers will embed machine learning algorithm and APIs in the web applications to influence them to convey personalized and rich user experience. Establishment for Apps to Build Responsive Web Apps - This new framework called \u2018Foundation for Apps\u2019 is turning into the favored decision for building responsive (and single page) web apps and depends on leading technologies (with AngularJS and Flexbox). To make the task of developing responsive applications in an easy and quick manner is comes with all the necessary components. Internet of Things - Presently, Internet of Things is prepared to change the way we browse websites. Many developers do not understand the enormous number of devices that could possibly show web content to people in the future. Clearly, the IoT is a complete breakthrough in web development. These are the fundamental three web development trends that tell about the challenges that web developers will have to face in the future. They provide the insight into how the new technology developments will make the process of developing web solutions a lot simple and easy. ",

The jobs that will be left will be flooded with applicants fighting for lower and lower pay. Lets face it, programming as a profession is going to be limited to developing programs that create other programs. AI, machine learning and languages like C and Java will dominate. Anything that reduces the human capital cost of using technology. For example, Oracle and Microsoft may have 100,000 engineers so that you company can get by with 0. Web dev is just too damn easy to justify the high salaries of the past. The money is going to move like it has been to the innovation products that require very high skill development talent. I guess what I am saying is we are already into a complete disruption of the development world, it will just take a few yers for it to spread all the way. ",
