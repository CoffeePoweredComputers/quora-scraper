            "answer_text": "Most people respond positive to taking care of the environment. The problem is that the climate activists have included \u201cenvironment\u201d into the political driven climate hysteria to sell the climate hypothesis and to make a wild idea more trustworthy. This make a lot of people see \u201cenvironment\u201d as a whole as a bad and extremely money consuming idea , feeling like you have green bugs with stupid slogans all over your body. It will be hard to separate thiose two because the climate activists and the climate industry know that the whole ting is buildt on a weak theory . To prove that is just to read yourself the \u201cClimatgate\u201d E-mails how the climate scare was constructed and the discussion about how to do it. And make up my our own mind about mixing this stuff into the environmental work. Page 36 and onwards should take of what is facts and what is fiction in the noble art of climate science: https://www.inhofe.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/Consensus%20Exposed%20The%20CRU%20Controversy.pdf ",
