            "answer_text": "As pointed out, it\u2019s difficult to answer such an undefined question, especially one that can have several meanings. For example, I can interpret your question to be that you were asking how someone created electronic tech. Or you could be asking about technology as an idea and how it came out back in the stone age. Or you could be asking how technology has advanced through the ages. To be entirely honest, I\u2019m not sure which of the above options you\u2019re actually trying to ask, so for funsies, I\u2019m just going to pick one. Because I can\u2019t answer all three in one answer\u2026.that would be a novel. The most fun to ponder for me is the last option, which is generally wondering how we get to computer chips when our ancestors were hitting stones against each other to start fires long ago. This is a fun one to talk about not just because of the growth of ideas from one generation to the next, but also because of all the stumbling blocks along the way\u2026and all the gaps in history where we simply have no idea how we got from one idea to another. If you\u2019re asking about how electronic tech was created, this answer is basically the same idea. Ideas build upon each other, like bricks. One day, someone gets the idea to build a fence to mark the edge of his land. He decides to build a wall out of the rough stones he dug up while tilling the soil. As a merchant pulls his horse and wagon along the road next to the rough rock wall, the merchant gets the idea that it would be a much nicer wall if the rocks were more uniform in size and shape and it happens to come up in conversation with the blacksmith two towns over. Unbeknownst to the merchant, the blacksmith had recently been charged by the lord to create a new armor that is lighter and more flexible, and the blacksmith gets an idea from the merchant\u2019s rock wall idea. Boom. Chain mail is created. Now, to clarify the above story is entirely fictional, but shows how one idea might influence another idea that may or may not be related to the original idea. Without even realizing it, any of the men in the story had an idea that started with another\u2019s ideas, thoughts, or actions. Science is built on ideas and the testing of them. In the course of history, for a long time it was normal for people to learn a trade from someone who had been doing it for a long time. It\u2019s called apprenticing, and it\u2019s something we modern humans quickly brush off as antiquated, backwards, and doing the same old thing. However, expert tradesmen were not just experts, they were innovators. They always needed a better, safer and faster way to accomplish their task or to advance in skill and reputation. They were always on their toes looking for new ideas, but also learned to rely on techniques they knew could work. With this balance of new and old, they built cathedrals, forged katanas, and produced beautiful and awe inspiring products, art, architecture, tools, books, and all sorts of things that we can\u2019t replicate today with the tools they had in the past. We actually don\u2019t know how they did some of things they did because their techniques and technology were more advanced than we give them credit for and in our search for the future, have forgotten some of our past. But we are here because of them and their ideas. ",

            "answer_text": "In a nutshell, technology can be seen as the collection of techniques, skills, methods, processes and their development for practical purposes. We tend to see technology as limited to humans. This could not be farther than the truth. Isaac Asimov in his seminal book Chronology of Science and Discovery gave the example of Chimpanzees stripping leaves from twigs and then use the bare twigs as devices for capturing termites. It is also common to see a buzzard cracking an eggshell with a small stone to eat the inner components of the egg. But what really makes the difference between these animals and us, technologically speaking, is that they are tool users and NOT tool makers. Homo habilis, one of our hominid ancestors created sharp edges stone tools to kill animals and tear away their tough hide. Later, more tools were further developed by Homo erectus, Homo sapiens and now the sky is the limit. This is to say that technology started some 2,000,000 years ago. In my recent book Technology and society \u2013 Rewards and Challenges, I have defined technology as the expression of our will to live. Nobody can deny that our lives have substantially improved over time because of our creativity. Hopefully we will have the wisdom to continue to do so. ",
