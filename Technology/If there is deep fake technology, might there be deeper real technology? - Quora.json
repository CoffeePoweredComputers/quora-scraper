            "answer_text": "\u201cDeep fake\u201d is called \u201cDeep fake\u201d because it is based on something called \u201cDeep learning\u201d. \u201cDeep learning\u201d is called \u201cDeep learning\u201d because it uses \u201cDeep neural networks\u201d. A \u201cDeep neural network\u201d is opposed to a classic neural network because it uses more hidden layers (making it deeper). There is no defined threshold for a neural networks being called a \u201cDeep neural networks\u201d. Usually something with 3 or 4 hidden layers is already called a \u201cDeep neural network\u201d. Some \u201cDeep neural networks\u201d use 50 hidden layers. They are still called \u201cDeep neural networks\u201d. Not \u201cdeeper neural networks\u201d. But if you create your own variant of Deep fake with a bigger neural networks with more hidden layers, calling it \u201cDeeper fake\u201d would be a good idea. ",
