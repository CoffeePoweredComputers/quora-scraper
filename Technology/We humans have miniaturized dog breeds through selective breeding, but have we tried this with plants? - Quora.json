Can keep them smaller via pruning or other methods rather than requiring selective breedingBonsai trees are genetically identical to big ones, but pruning and potting techniques can keep them tiny for literally a hundred years.  That said, there are cases where we do want naturally smaller plants either to fit into smaller spaces (dwarf fruit trees, dwarf roses), or to reduce the non-product parts of the plant (dwarf wheat). These varieties have been achieved by basically all of the methods we know how to use with plants - grafting, cross-breeding/cross-pollinating, gene editing, and even blasting with radiation to produce novel mutations we can select between. Dwarf fruit tree ideal for tiny spaces  Dwarf wheat spends less energy getting tall so it makes more grains faster and is more wind-resistant.  ",
