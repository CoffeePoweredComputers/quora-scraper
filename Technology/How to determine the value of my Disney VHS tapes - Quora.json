If anyone tells you they\u2019re worth more than that, if your intent is to sell, you will end up hanging onto it forever. Any smart capitalist knows collectors, just like everyone else, are generally cheap. I am still firmly convinced most of the multi-thousand dollar Disney VHS eBay auctions people cite, are probably some really clever scam artists trying to artificially inflate the value of these tapes, because some people out there are potentially that gullible to buy, and there\u2019s no risk involved to find that out, and it would he a brilliant idea, because these tapes are often acquired for cheap. The Black Diamond appears on quite a few Disney videos from 1980s & 1990s Not every release with a Black Diamond is suspect to value If it\u2019s sealed, brand new, it might fetch some dollars depending on title. Most sealed new Disney releases after 1990 I can never sell for more than $10 The ones I find that tend to sell consistently, are Disney\u2019s 1st VHS releases for each film These are easily identifiable, they have a \u201cpuffy\u201d clamshell case, and the artwork cannot be removed. Most of the cases were black whereas all the later Disney Releases (aside from Fantasia) came in a white clamshell. They generally sell for about $10-$40 (a few examples below)    Some of early 80s white clamshell Disney also sell   And of course, this \u201cbanned\u201d artwork version of the Little Mermaid sells often. But in the $5-$20 range  ",

            "answer_text": "I think what\u2019s happening is probably a \u201cTulip Mania\u201d style market bubble. Though many of the sales in the thousands of dollars are probably fakes meant to create the illusion that these tapes are worth that much, I think many of the sales below $1,000 are real. And I think the overwhelming majority of those buyers are going to be sorely disappointed sometime in the future to discover that their \u201cinvestments\u201d are worthless. First, here\u2019s what I think is happening. A seller lists a worthless tape for, say, $15,000. Using a fake ebay account, they buy the tape. But then they don\u2019t pay for it. Then, when the time alloted to pay is up, the seller initiates a complaint with ebay. The fake buyer doesn\u2019t respond to the complaint. Ebay closes the fake buyer account, and refunds the fee for the sale to the buyer. Importantly: The seller is not out any money.No real person got in trouble with ebay.When a prospective buyer searches on past sales for that item, they\u2019ll see that $15,000 completed sale, and it will look real. It doesn\u2019t say there that the buyer never paid. If there are several such sales, and the prospective buyer is naive, they might think that means there are people out there willing to pay that much for these tapes.So what happens next? Now the seller, perhaps with a different seller account not used for those $15,000 sales, offers that item for, oh, say, $800. If you\u2019re under the misapprehension that people are actually paying $15,000 for the same item, $800 might look like a great deal. Maybe you\u2019ll keep it long term as an investment, or maybe you\u2019ll turn it around for a quick 14 grand profit. Right? So the naive buyer buys it for $800. And pays for it. Even if their plan was to turn it around quickly, it may take a few weeks before they understand they\u2019ve been had. And by then it\u2019s too late to do anything about it \u2014 except resell it for whatever they can get. Maybe the same $800, minus ebay and paypal fees? Maybe only $500, to a less well funded naive seller? But if they can sell it, even at a big loss, to another naive buyer who thinks it\u2019s worth $15,000, they\u2019ll take much less of a loss than otherwise. Their scruples go out the door trying to cut their losses. But if their plan was to hold on to it long term as an investment, they\u2019re in for some pain when they try to sell it years later, only to find that by that time, the bubble has popped and they\u2019d be lucky to get a dollar for it. Of course, some Disney VHS tapes are probably actually valuable. Meaning maybe, say, $50. Or who knows, maybe even $100. This would be mainly titles never released on laserdisc, DVD, or blu-ray. And perhaps titles that were also released on laserdisc but not on any later format, if the laserdiscs are rare and pricey. It could also include titles that Disney changed for DVD and later releases. They often change colors \u2014 a good example is Jungle Book. And they often cut scenes that have come to be seen as inappropriate. Collectors will pay a lot to get the original version, in any format. But for titles that weren\u2019t significantly changed, what\u2019s the value in a VHS? Even a DVD is far better, and now that blu-ray or 4K discs are available for most of those titles, today Disney DVDs are pretty cheap. And anyway, today most people are probably streaming those Disney movies on Disney+ rather than viewing them on any home media. VHS, on the other hand, degrades a bit with each time it\u2019s played, and degrades just sitting there as the magnetism on the tapes transfers ghost images to parts of the tape right next to it on the roll within the cassette. To find out of a VHS title is collectible for real reasons, just google; there is a lot of discussion out there. If not sure, post a question on one of the home theater forums. But don\u2019t pay $800 \u2014 or $500, or $100 \u2014 for a Disney VHS just because there are past sales for the same Disney VHS for thousands of dollars. ",
