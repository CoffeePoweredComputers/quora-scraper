            "answer_text": "We know that it is illegal for the government to spy on U.S. citizens in the U.S. without court permission granted on probable cause to suspect that the surveillance would produce useful evidence. We also know that it collects a substantial amount of meta-data on telephone communications, again when there is suspicion of illegal activity. This is done with the cooperation of service providers.
