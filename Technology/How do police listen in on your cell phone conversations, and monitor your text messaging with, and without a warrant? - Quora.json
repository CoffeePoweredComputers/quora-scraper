            "answer_text": "How do police listen in on your cell phone conversations, and monitor your text messaging with, and without a warrant? There are two ways to intercept the call content of a cellular phone. The first, and most common, requires the cooperation of the telecommunications carrier (telco). Pursuant to a court order, commonly called a Title III, the telco routes calls to and from the named handset to a monitoring facility designated by the intercepting agency. The monitoring facility may be either permanent or temporary. All of this is done with a few keystrokes at the telco. Once upon a time, we had to physically go to the telco Mobile Service Center and wire a card into each individual switch; now it\u2019s accomplished with software. The second way is by using a cell site simulator, commonly called a Stingray after the most common device, though it is no longer cutting edge. A cell site simulator \u201cswamps\u201d the cell site it\u2019s located in (hence the other name, swamp box) and forces all of the cel phones connected to that site to register with the cell site simulator, just as they would do with the regular telco cell site. Once the target device is registered, it can be intercepted and located. This method is less preferred because it\u2019s manpower intensive and, therefore, expensive. Monitoring without a warrant (Title III order) could be done with a cell site simulator, but, if you get caught, you\u2019ll be doing Federal and/or state prison time, regardless of who you are. Years ago, two agents, one state and one Federal, assigned to a joint task force in Las Vegas, were caught listening to calls by plugging headphones into a pen register (a device for recording dialed digits on an analog telephone line.) They were both convicted in Federal court and sentenced to five years. ",
