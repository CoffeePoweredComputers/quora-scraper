            "answer_text": "The biggest achievement of Humanity in 2020 is recognizing our true state. The pandemic showed us without any doubts that we evolved into a globally integrated and totally interdependent world. We also learned from our woefully inadequate individual, national reactions, \u201csolutions\u201d - which are still going on - that as long as we follow our inherently self-serving, self-justifying, egocentric and individualistic nature, program, we will continue sleepwalking towards an unprecedented global calamity. In a fully integrated, interdependent system we can't continue competing, fighting against one another, we can't continue succeeding, surviving at each other's expense. Moreover we can't base our economy on excessive consumption that disregards natural necessity and available resources. We have recognized that with our present Human system we behave like cancer towards each other and Nature! This is an extremely important achievement as now, finally, we can start to heal this \u201cHuman cancer\u201d by learning from Nature how Human society needs to be built on Nature's integral template. Thus the future is bright, as we have a clear path ahead, while Nature's system is dismantling the previous, present Human system, we already know how we need to rebuild it in a peaceful, fair and sustainable way. A qualitatively much higher, collective, truly Human - Nature-like - existence awaits!  ",

            "answer_text": "We\u2019ve endured. Billions of us the world over have made both great and boringly-constant sacrifices to help limit the spread of COVID-19. While politicians argue and boast that they have the answers, we know that it\u2019s our everyday vigilance \u2014 wearing a mask in public, washing our hands, forcing ourselves to socially distance even when it hurts \u2014 and our commitment to family and community that has helped mitigate the spread and the deaths. Some of you will argue the dismissive Trump view and lots of you will point the finger at the people who didn\u2019t give a shit, those that did nothing to help slow the pandemic. What\u2019s gotten lost in 2020 is that it has been a year of global human cooperation on a scale we have not seen in decades. ",
