            "answer_text": "Clean coal is a PR term. Coal is black and usually contains a very long list of heavy metals. Legacy coal plants will be with us for many years as sunk investment. Those investors are not going to willingly give up their nest egg so clean coal is the best way they can hope to convince the public not to shut them down tomorrow. There are hardware devices that can improve coal but when approached about cleaning up a legacy coal plant the power monopoly always comes back with we are going to shut that plant down anyway so why should we spend any money cleaning up our responsibility? Coal plants use steam as the working \u201cfluid\u201d and the total efficiency is roughly 1/3rd of the energy burned up is converted to sell-able electricity. 2/3rds is dumped into the cooling lake. So two improvements to help coal die would be to harvest the low level waste heat from the steam side of the coal plant and step two is clean up the stack emissions with known hardware designed to capture some of that black crap and unwanted gases coming out of the stack. The stack clean up process produces more thermal waste that would actually help step one. Again no power monopoly is going to reverse their lack of wisdom in building the coal plant and lose money in the process. They typically won\u2019t even build a natural gas pipeline over to an old coal plant to convert it over to natural gas. Cogen is the much better way to make electricity from natural gas and converting a once through coal plant to a non-cogen plant is not such a good option. Coal is stuck and presently going out of business. ",

            "answer_text": "There is no such thing as \u201cclean coal\u201d, apart from, perhaps, in the deranged mind of Trump. Burning coal produces CO2 as a greenhouse gas, and a whole range of noxious pollutants. Obviously the exhaust gases can be processed, but only at a high financial cost, and the bi-products are wagon loads of toxic waste to dispose of somewhere. Coal is a dead industry. It produces electricity at a higher cost than gas, and is less flexible when it comes to starting up and shutting down. Gas also produces CO2 and pollutants but is more efficient, and produces less pollution. Gas is also a dying industry, as wind and solar are becoming cheaper, and do not produce any CO2 or pollution. To avoid catastrophic changes to our environment we need to shut down the fossil fuel industry as soon after today as possible. We need 100% renewable generation, all electric vehicles, and homes, and massive investment in energy efficiency. So, forget about coal \u201cclean\u201d or otherwise. Coal is finished. ",

As the technology advances in the mining and consumption of coal to further make it cleaner for the environment, it's only remaining impact is on the \u201cgreen\" energy agenda and it's false prophets. That's it. The only negative impacts would be on the activists and their utopian campaign. Nuclear energy, LNG, and coal, can handle the energy needs of the entire planet. If people really want clean affordable energy, than let's give it to them. Destroying the one system that can make it possible is unintelligent at best. That system, that can produce the shifts into cleaner energy production, is capitalism! Capitalism is the only human invention that is capable of creating clean energy for the world. The markets and human ingenuity and creativity, propelled by competition, is perfectly capable of doing it. Boom! Done! ",
