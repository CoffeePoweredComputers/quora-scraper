            "answer_text": "Um. It depends on what you\u2019re considering. If it\u2019s applied, then it\u2019s Germany. They make the best cars and consumer products. You know what a Mercedes is like and at one time Miele were so confident you couldn\u2019t break one of their washing machines that they offered a 10 year guarantee of cost-free repair. There weren\u2019t too many Miele-certified technicians and in no way were they overworked. Whilst Hotpoint would be troublesome, and Candy even caught fire, nobody ever complained about a Miele in the three-and-a half years I was dealing with consumer appliances. Bosch were not quite as good; we had a Bosch dishwasher for eight years with no maintenance. When it broke, I managed to find an old part and got it going again for about another year, but when another part failed I scrapped it and got a new one. The trouble with the good German stuff is the initial expense in outlay. A Miele, at the time I was doing this, would last 10 years minimum. But it cost nearly \u00a3800. You\u2019d be lucky to get three years out of the cheapest Beko but it was \u00a3150. Assuming the Beko did last three years, you\u2019d be shelling out for a new one four times in that ten years, which is \u00a3600. BUT- you\u2019d be calling a plumber four times too. If he charged you \u00a340 a go, that\u2019s another \u00a3160. Of course, you\u2019d have to have the Miele plumbed, so an extra \u00a3120 on top making \u00a3720. If the Beko lasted only a couple of years, then that\u2019s five in the same time. \u00a3750 in machines and \u00a3200 in plumbers. Take off two plumber calls (as we are still assuming the Miele will last only ten years) and that\u2019s \u00a3870, and so over ten years you\u2019d be spending \u00a370 more on the Bekos. In fact that\u2019s not a very fair comparison because it\u2019s a top-end Miele and a bottom end Beko, and the Beko would likely pack up in 2.5 years whereas the Miele would likely do 14. But it illustrates the point; German engineering is good and in the long run it\u2019s cheaper to get it but it\u2019s no good if you haven\u2019t got the spare cash at the start. In more esoteric areas there\u2019s little to choose from between the two. The Challenger II tank and the Leopard, according to experts in the matter, are two of the best in the world and debate continues. In electrical, Germans have a slight edge thanks to Siemens, and in Jet Engines, the British lead thanks to Rolls-Royce. In R&D the British are far more adventurous as they go off on flights of fancy. Raspberry Pi was British; test-tube babies, cash machines, graphene, SMS, iris recognition, DNA profiling in fairly recent times. The Germans did MP3s though, along with other things. But Germans tend to build slowly on what exists. The British tend to go off on wild flights of fancy. Both approaches are good, but it means that the British mindset is more likely to produce off-beat stuff where the German one will give you a good, solid appliance. ",

            "answer_text": "It\u2019s quite hard to distinguish if one is more advanced than the other. Though a great deal of modern inventions came about in Britain during the Industrial Revolution, Germany modernised rapidly, especially when it came to medical, scientific and military areas. Their ability to do this is quite clear just from looking at how advanced their army was in WW2. Germany has a highly advanced scientific community, with multitudes of awards, patents and research papers in their name. According to Scientific American, Germany is second in the world for scientific endeavours, while the United Kingdom comes in at 4th. (The World's Best Countries in Science [Interactive]) Germany is also heralded by Business Insider Nordic as having one of the best healthcare systems in the world. (The 16 countries with the world's best healthcare systems) Sadly, the UK did not make their list. Though Japan is the world\u2019s most technologically advanced country (just take a look at Tokyo), most sources tend to cite both Germany and the United Kingdom as among the world\u2019s most advanced countries, and rightfully so. However, judging the two side by side based on advanced medical and healthcare services, scientific research corporations, energy and technology, I would say that Germany wins by a narrow margin.
