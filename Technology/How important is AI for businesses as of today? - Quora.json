            "answer_text": "Artificial intelligence (AI) is probably the most widespread notion in tech world. AI has been leading all the top lists since 2010. According to Statista, revenues from the artificial intelligence software market have grown twice since 2018 when it was $10 bln and will continue this growth at accelerated speed. By the 2025, it\u2019s expected to reach 126 billion dollars. (Statista report) Last year, in the US alone, $10 billion dollars in venture capital was invested in AI. And in the UK, 1,000 artificial intelligence PhD projects receive financial assistance annually. (How AI is transforming business in 2020 [Infographic]) Intriguing statistics, isn\u2019t it? But how does it all impact our businesses today. Are all of them enjoy the benefits of this technology. You\u2019ll be surprised, but 47% of business executives claim their businesses have leveraged at least one AI capability in their processes and just 21% say their organizations have embedded AI in several parts of the business. This means that despite the obvious AI enhancements, the actual business adoption still has some barriers. (McKinsey report) Let\u2019s have a look at those thriving AI adopters. \u2018How AI is transforming the businesses in 2020?\u2019 - Tasks and processes optimization The least expensive, thus, most accessible AI technology is robotic process automation (RPA). The implementation of this technology will help business owners significantly cut costs and improve workers\u2019 performance. RPA typically carries out the most tedious and tiresome tasks thus reducing the time and costs of every task and doubling the employees\u2019 productivity. - Reduction of human errors To my mind, the greatest implementation of AI that led to reduction of human errors was AI diagnosis in healthcare. Though the final decision still rests with the doctor, AI-powered devices analyze patients\u2019 symptoms and his/her medical history. This system not only saves the precious time, its main task to provide better services and make better-informed decisions. By 2020, AI-powered systems can interview the patients, gather and analyze all the data available, understand the earlier-made treatment prescriptions and provide clients and doctors with the most preferable steps. - Improved lead generation process In recent years, artificial intelligence impact has delved into lead generation processes and sales marketing, as well. A great variety of AI-powered lead generation software helps businesses worldwide improve their customer conversation, thus boosting their lead generation. AI technology enables corporations to make up the ideal customer that is a perfect match for them from massive databases. Then, AI-powered algorithms can generate the list of specific contacts that are highly likely to turn into sales. - Personalized customer experience It\u2019s probably one of the most widely leveraged artificial intelligent use case. With AI technology, business owners can provide their customers with highly personalized experience, including customized recommendations in online stores to AI-powered customer support to virtual makeup studio. Depending on your particular needs, AI solutions can improve your customer experience in a variety of ways. ",

            "answer_text": "AI is extremely important for businesses, even today when we\u2019re still in the stage of developing it. It is important, not in the sense that businesses won\u2019t be able to survive without it (your business can still operate without AI) but in the sense that it\u2019s an edge. When you have or use AI, your business is one step ahead. AI holds various advantages for businesses. It can take care of tedious, time-consuming tasks more efficiently. It reduces the margin of human error in business processes, by taking over mundane tasks such as data collection. It sorts, organizes and aggregates data. It basically does what we humans do much faster and more efficiently. Imagine: your company uses AI and your competition doesn\u2019t. Who would get to the customer first? Through the power of AI, your company identifies prospects and leads in a day. Your robots initiate contact through automated email functions. Your chatbots are on standby, waiting for website visitors curious to learn more about your product. Meanwhile, the other company is still on their market research, sifting through data that only took you a day to process. If you want to stay competitive, maintain your market position or even expand in the coming years, you should put AI on your tech stack. There\u2019s more we can discuss here, but it\u2019d be great to hear from other users. Our company, Tenfold, has also written on AI, and has even come up with a process audit for companies thinking of transitioning to AI. You can read that, as well as more information about our integration solution and how it supports AI, on the Tenfold blog. Would love to read more on this topic. ",
