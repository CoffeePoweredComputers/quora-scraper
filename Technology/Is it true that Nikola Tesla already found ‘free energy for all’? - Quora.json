            "answer_text": "No, it is not. Tesla invented and improved many electrical technologies at the beginning of the electrical age. It is safe to say that his development and advocacy of polyphasic alternating current is one of the most important advancements to modern life. But for various reasons, many people today have a variety of conspiracy theories about Tesla, mainly revolving around the idea that he developed miraculous technology that was suppressed by greedy industrialists. These conspiracy theories arise from a fertile pool: he was a brilliant inventor, he did feud with a wealthy industrialist (Edison) (though note he was also supported by another, Westinghouse, perhaps longer than he really deserved), and he did start making outlandish claims about possible inventions and physical theories as he grew older. This is fertile ground for conspiracy theories. After his popularity exploded in recent years (due in no small part to a webcomic called the oatmeal), these conspiracy theories reached a wider audience. But these are conspiracy theories, and people tend to make things up when they support those. Tesla did not develop a free energy source (equivalent to a perpetual motion machine). He did not invent effective wireless power distribution. He did not create a death ray. ",

            "answer_text": "This myth is the result of a poor wording of a well established physics concept. Thermodynamics was founded to study how to improve the efficiency of steam engines. While energy conserves itself, something doesn\u2019t and is consumed. This something is closely linked to energy. One of its avatar is \u201centropy\u201d, which measures something like the level of order, if a situation is likely or unlikely. Then, other concepts like enthalpy were introduced. And \u2026 free energy. Free energy means available energy or usable energy, the energy that is available to be harnessed. When you realise no reversible transformations, you reduce the usage energy, until there the free energy is null. In France, it seems that this Free Energy conspiracy isn\u2019t as popular as in the US. I suspect that language plays a major part. That\u2019s due to free meaning both costless and liberty. In French \u201c\u00e9nergie libre\u201d doesn\u2019t feel like a conspiracy of big oil to prevent you from having costless energy. ",
