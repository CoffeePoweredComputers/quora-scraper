            "answer_text": "The article on Allbusiness is a great read if you like to dive deeper into the topic.[1] Innovators are Everywhere Innovators are the ones who have brilliant ideas in the shower; entrepreneurs are the ones who do something about it after coming out of the shower. Entrepreneurs Don\u2019t Need The Best Ideas The best entrepreneurs just need a viable idea. It\u2019s really not a matter of who has the best idea, who contributed the most, or how many awards you won. The major difference between an innovator and an entrepreneur is their passion and persistence. Entrepreneurs stop at nothing to turn their idea into reality. Entrepreneurs Don\u2019t Need to Be Original Entrepreneurs don\u2019t care if their idea happens to be similar to another product or business that is already on the market. Competition is healthy as long as you have the right team to build an amazing product and succeed in the market. Entrepreneurs Need Grit Turning an idea into a viable product or business takes time and effort. Entrepreneurs know the risk of raising funds, securing patents or trademarks, recruiting the wrong people, supply chain issues and manufacturing. Entrepreneurs are Risk-Takers Entrepreneurs are aware of their slim chances of success. They understand the risk that it takes to start and build a business. However, they see a challenge as an opportunity. They thrive on negativity. Every NO makes them stronger.
