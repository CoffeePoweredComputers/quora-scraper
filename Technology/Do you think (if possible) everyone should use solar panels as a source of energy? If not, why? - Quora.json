            "answer_text": "Should everyone use and have access to solar power as one of a variety of competitive energy sources? Yes. Should everyone install solar energy collectors and manage the personal electrical networks that they need in order to supply the energy they need for their lives? No. Energy, just like other commodities, reduces in cost when you have a specialized industry focusing on it\u2019s production. Yes, in certain cases a personal network can be cheaper, especially for off-grid applications since costs associated to managing and creating connections to a large electrical grid can be cut, or when incumbent industry is lagging behind in technology, but in most cases small private collection arrays will not be cheaper without subsidy programs. Added to this, the time and effort to maintain such a personal network will add onto the personal responsibilities that a person needs to deal with in their lives. ",

            "answer_text": "So, the idea would be to do away with the grid, and try to fuel all our needs locally using solar power? Even for heavy industries and cars, ship, planes, etc? And during the night? Batteries? What about really energy hungry fields like aircraft? I don\u2019t think we have enough raw resources on earth for so many batteries with current tech. And the batteries wouldn\u2019t be nearly dense enough for many purposes. The man who will invent and develop an electricity storage system that is reasonably priced and can be used everywhere will change mankind. But until then\u2026 EDIT By the way, another idea could be an Earth-wide \u201csupergrid\u201d, transferring power from the morning to the night side and from the equator to the poles. But then we need something like room-temperature superconductors (that do not exist yet), undersea and overland to make this work. ",

            "answer_text": "Outside the limitation that solar energy cannot be used 24 hours a day without a storage solution, it is better than fossil fuels. The sun provides a free and renewable source of energy. And the efforts to harness that energy has very little impact on the environment, unlike fossil fuels. For most homeowners, installing solar panels will not result in roof damage as long as your solar installer is a licensed, qualified professional and your roof is in good condition. Go to my Profile and you can find all about Solar Panels material there... ",
