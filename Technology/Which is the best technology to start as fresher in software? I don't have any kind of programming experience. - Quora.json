There are all kinds of technologies and languages in use today (including Mainframes and Cobol), and every one who has a passion and mastery over any technology/language can still survive and probably make money. If you are really passionate about a career in software, you may try: Subscribe to a tutorial website like Pluralsight.Watch some of their courses in C#, Java, PHP etc. Get a taste of those languages.See what your heart tells you and follow that.",

If you understand bookkeeping, start with spreadsheets, Excel macros, and vBasic extensions. If you\u2019re a musician, start with a synthesizer, and Audacity, then write plug-ins. If you work with lab instruments, learn Labview. Etc. ",
