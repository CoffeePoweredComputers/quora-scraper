            "answer_text": "There are two ways to calculate heat transfer due to radiation in boiler. 1-First you can calculate directly by using heat transfer due to radiation formula i.e  q = \u03b5 \u03c3 (Th^4 - Tc^4) Ac Where,Th = hot body absolute temperatureTc = cold surroundings absolute temperatureAc = area of the object  and all other term represents their standard meaning. 2- And second way or we can say indirect method to calculate heat transfer rate due to radiation in boiler. As we know that heat tranfer in radiation zone is used to convert the saturated steam into superheated steam.from here we easily calculate change in enthalpy of steam at inlet and outlet of radiation zone which is equal to heat transfer rate due to radiation.Mathematically, q = h2 - h1Where,h2 = enthalpy of steam at outlet of radiation zone.h1 = equally of steam at inlet of radiation zone. 2nd method is practically easy to calculate heat transfer due to radiation in boiler.
