            "answer_text": "The account holder has to call up and ask to cancel. It can also be done via live chat but takes a while. Phoning is still the easiest way of doing it and you cane write in as is your legal right but that can take a week or more for your letter to be processed. You will need to give 28days notice so very likely you will have a last bill to pay so don\u2019t cancel your direct debit just yet. Best to be honest with the agent if you want to cancel and have no interest in deals or offers then say please so it will save lots of time. The quickest way to leave is to say you are moving house and can\u2019t have sky at the new property. If your doing a Martin Lewis then your best being honest with the agent and tell them you want to leave to get a better deal with a new provider and the agent will do their best to do you a deal. ",
