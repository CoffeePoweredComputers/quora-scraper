            "answer_text": "Linux is an (re)implementation (and today the most popular implementation) of an operating system originally designed and developed in the late 1960s and originally published in the CACM in 1972 by Ken Thompson and Dennis Ritchie at AT&T\u2019s Bell Laboratories called the UNIX Operating System. The United States Courts in the AT&T vs BSDi/University of California case defined the UNIX Intellectual Property is owned and defined by AT&T, but because AT&T published the definition and how it was created it could not be claimed to be a trade secret and thus other implementations, such as Linux could be legally developed, released and marketed (if AT&T had won, Linux and many other UNIX \u2018clones\u2019 would have been unlawful to be made available - although how that would have worked out/what would have happened in practice is unknown other than at lot of lawyers would have made a lot of money and lot of arguments would have occurred). At this point it is not interesting. The courts are clear -> Linux is a modern Unix implementation. Please read my answer: Clem Cole's answer to How can the Linux Kernel be free and open source while Unix is not? Isn't Linux built on Unix? for a lot more details. ",

            "answer_text": "Unix and UNIX both are same except the latter can be referred as \u2122 symbol. Unix is actually a complete Operating system with properitory rights and closed licence. It is having a huge history since late 60s. Popular Unix OS are AIX, Solaris and HP-UX which is based on System IV BSD Unix. Linux is basically a kernel (a computing component) which is powered by General Public Licence packages band libraries which was invented by Linus Trovalds in 1991. There is not much difference between these to from a end user perspective. But as a System administration and architecture designing, there are lot of things to be considered. Similarities are.. Both are command based OS Highly scalable Secure Both follow POSIX standard (not all flavour if Linux) Both are highly tunable from OS (Kernel) perspective In modern days, Linux has completely overtaken Unix as it is free and open source and also it's ability to easily fit in cloud platform. Hope this helps ",
