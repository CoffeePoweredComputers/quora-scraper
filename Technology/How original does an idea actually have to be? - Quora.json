Facebook wasn't the first social network.Google wasn't the first search engine. Wikipedia wasn't the first online encyclopedia.  So, how Quora wins over Yahoo answers. I would say, by good moderation. Most of the time you would find sarcastic answers in Yahoo Answers. ",

            "answer_text": "Depends, if you can execute your idea more efficiently than the existing products then you don't need to be original at all. For example: there were always many burger restaurants, but McDonald\u2019s had developed the most efficient process so they won. Now if you lack the economic or leverage to be more efficient and you can't figure out how to bootstrap more efficiency than the competition, you need originality to keep the competition from swallowing you.
