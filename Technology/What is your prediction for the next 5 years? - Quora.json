But to share it with you i can say that in the coming 5 years Tesla is going to change the face of the automobile industry and space industry. Cryptocurrency will have it easier in Indian market. Antibiotic resistance will advance to a much more severe stage. AI would be in its final stage of completion. African countries will see sudden economical boom. Air travel will be cheaper than now and more frequent. North Korea might be a democratic in actual sense by then or atleast will be in the process. With the rising pollution level the business of oxygen cylinders for health at home would be the most profitable startup idea by then. Anywho if any of my above predictions offended you, i am sorry for that but these are just abstract thought processing of the future according to my perspective. ",

            "answer_text": "I think virtual reality is going to get better and become much more affordable. I am already quite impressed with where it is at right now, so give it another 5 years and I think we will be really amazed at what they will come out with. Also I think smartphones are going to have a breakthrough in battery life. I think it\u2019s clear that the #1 thing that consumers have been clamoring for when it comes to their smartphone is not things like thinness but instead longer battery life. Someone will fill this gap. Who it will be is anyones guess though. ",
