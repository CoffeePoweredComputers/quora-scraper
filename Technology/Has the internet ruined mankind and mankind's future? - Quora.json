            "answer_text": "If you consider access to all human knowledge, culture, all entertainment and (sooner or later) being able to communicate and understand every person on the planet the \"ruin of mankind\" then I would say yes. Even though people are able to misuse it, it makes more sense to say that it's the advent of mankind rather than its downfall. Let's look at guns for example. Are they the ruin of mankind? You can use one gun to kill a hundred people for no reason. You could also use it to save a hundred innocent people in danger. Are nuclear weapons the ruin of mankind? You can use them to blow up a whole city or even the planet. Or you can use them to end a war that took millions of lives and would have raged on, making the body count billions. Summa summarum: Tools, objects, things aren't good or bad. It's the way one uses them that determines the outcome. ",

            "answer_text": "Here's the thing about the internet... It has embodied and destroyed mankind at the same time. Put things into perspective as a human. You are fairly intelligent, and you have access to books. You need to read these books before hand to accumulate the knowledge required.  Welcome Interwebs.  The internet is not based on facts. Most information viewed in tandem is inaccurate. The neat thing is that it has a tendency to be community run, and it results in a vast amount of misinformation due to general consensus.  Just because everyone thinks it, its not true. We become feeble when we rely on a specific source, and don't challenge ourselves for the answer. If your response was met with resistance, would you back down? The internet has made us lazy. We cope, and search, and re-verify that there is an answer. Honestly, we are all stupid. We are going to fuck up our own future. Lets hope for more intellectuals.  ",
