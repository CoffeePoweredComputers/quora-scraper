            "answer_text": "Despite all the numerous advantages of video conferencing, it has some disadvantages: Less Personal Contact and Understanding Even though video conferencing allows people to see each other, it is not always capable of recreating real live communication. Nothing can substitute a hearty handshake or an exchange of smiles. That is why important negotiations often should only be set in a traditional in-person meeting. Network Instability and Time Lag It is an obvious problem with video conferencing. The connection may not always be perfect, which sometimes leads to blurry image transmissions and the loss of important visual cues. Sometimes you may not even hear other attendees, which is annoying at best and deal-breaking at worst. Technical Issues and Employee Training Not everyone will be comfortable using a video conferencing platform from the get-go. Companies and universities need to allocate time, money and human resources to train the employees. However, even after a thorough training, people will need days or even weeks to get used to the new mode of communication. More Stress and Less Organization The ability to contact anyone anywhere at any time has an often-overlooked dark side. When people know they can set up a video conference whenever they want, they are prone to being less prepared for it than for an in-person meeting. As a result, employees might be forced to sit in conferences outside their working hours, trying to clean the mess than could have been prevented with a bit more organization.
