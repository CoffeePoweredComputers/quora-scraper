            "answer_text": "That seems to be the case in most scenarios. While we don\u2019t have much to base this on besides the promises of a rich company looking to get richer, we do know a few things. Apple said that this was the most powerful chip they had ever created. Which means that this is probably more powerful than the A12Z, because Apple made both. Apple has said that the A14 is capable of ~12 Trillion operations per second, compared to the A12X\u2019s 5 trillion (again, how much of this is accurate is yet to be seen. I am doubtful that the A14 will deliver console-level graphics, yet Apple promises this.)This chip uses a 5nm process, which means that it is much more power efficient. The A12Z was built on similar architecture to the A12, which was first-generation 7nm technology. This alone proves that anything that you can do easily on the A12 would be more power efficient and faster on the A14, meaning that the A12Z probably suffers from this same fact.The A14 is newer. Apple has the benefit of 2 years of experience (the A12Z is literally just the A12X, a two year old chip, with an extra GPU core) and better manufacturing capabilities.Of course, you still need to address that the A12Z has many more GPU cores, but that didn\u2019t add up to much. Mobile GPUs are not that powerful, and Apple centers the majority of their focus into their CPUs. These are my thoughts on this. I could be wrong, we need to wait and see for non-Apple benchmarks to come out. ",

A: Yes, the new Apple A14 Bionic processor is significantly more powerful than the older Apple A12Z processor Not only is it more powerful than the A12Z, according to Apple: Overall Apple is promising the A14 Bionic will be twice as fast as the most popular Windows laptop, three times faster than the top-of-the-line Android tablet and a whopping six times faster than the leading Chromebook on the market.
