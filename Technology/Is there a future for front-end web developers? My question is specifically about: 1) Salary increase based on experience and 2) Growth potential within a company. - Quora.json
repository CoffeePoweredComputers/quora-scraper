            "answer_text": "My friend, whether you grow and get a salary increase does not depend on whether you are front end developer or not. Its about how much quantifiable value you\u2019ve added to the company. Also, having the right people know about the accomplishments. If you are working in a company where front end innovation is the core business and you can innovate, and lead a team in that area. Yes, you will be \u2018Most Valuable Player\u2019. For example, if you are working on a PWA (Progressive web app) technology product. In this case, your employer will probably give you a blank cheque to write your own salary. This is obviously limited to some companies because most companies are Back-end heavy (think Google, Facebook, Amazon scale). Unfortunately, The way you add x10 value there is not through the front end. Its through leading a team to optimize and improve the system performance. Also, have you noticed I didn\u2019t mention what you (as an individual) will do. I say \u201cleading a team\u201d because this is the only way to add a lot of value. These companies are also investing heavily into the following future disruptive areas: Machine learning / AIBig dataCloud technologyVR / ARBitcoinPWA**I think only Google is investing heavily into PWA not sure about other companies None of the above areas have much to do with front end innovation with the exception of PWA (progressive web apps) and maybe Big data visualization. Additionally, notice I didn\u2019t add React, reason ml or Vue.js. These are web frameworks not disruptive technologies. ",

            "answer_text": "Well, it will become more difficult to get a well-paid job since it is a very specialized field where you will generally use only HTML, CSS and Javascript plus knowledge of a whole lot of front-end libraries and frameworks. The competition is reasonably large, especially since there are many front-end developers out there who are barely skilled enough to do the job, yet their rates are ridiculously low. However, there are specialities within the front-end development that will require a lot of experience because you're required to use a specific framework or library. When you specialize in a few of those, you will have a bright future for as long as that framework or library stays popular. But front-end work is also moving away from basic web development. More and more companies are working with services and have different layers build on top of those. The web layer (Front- and back-end) is still the most common but mobile apps are also becoming interesting front-ends for these services. And so are generic applications for OS X and Windows/Metro environments where you have a thin executable connected to a web service. But these are different kinds of front-ends that will require more than just Javascript to work with. Thing is, it is hard to predict how popular web pages will stay in the future. Web services are very promising, but allow basically anything as a front-end, not just browsers. Companies like Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn and even Wordpress have invested heavily in App development for Android and IOS and with their services ready-to-use, it's just a small step to also create applications for desktop systems, like Windows, Linux and OS X. For now, such developments are still considered a bit expensive but the IT world is constantly changing. ",
