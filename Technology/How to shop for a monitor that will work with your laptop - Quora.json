LCD Panel Types Explored Once you have determined what kind of monitor you want, try to find one that will plug into your laptop. Keep in mind there are many adapters out there to convert the signal from one output to another. The output options could be one of the following:  Once you have determined the correct video output option you have available, take a look at various retailers like Amazon.com, Ebay.com, Newegg.com, TigerDirect.com, etc. for good deals. Take a look at the clearance, flash sales, rebates, etc. Make sure to check out their reviews as well. Some monitors may not fit your needs based on a factor that one specific review points out. An example would be a gamer looking for a monitor finds a killer deal on a monitor but finds that it\u2019s 60hz. Most PC gamers would opt for a 120+hz monitor as it makes a big difference. If you have an issue with glare in the room the monitor will be you may not want a glossy finish on the screen. These kinds of things are personal preference.

            "answer_text": "Thanks for A2A. As I\u2019ve yet to own a laptop that has anything other than DSub-15 video output, I\u2019ve never had an issue connecting any monitor that accepts this as an input. Most new monitors on the market these days are going to be FHD (1920) or True-2k (2048) and finding something in 4:3 instead of 16:9 is going to be extremely difficult. Certainly you would have to do some research on the graphic capability of the specific laptop before hitting the markets. If it supports HDMI output, you may find that it can\u2019t handle anything greater than True-2k so purchasing a UHD (3940) or True-4k (4096) could be a complete waste of money. If you\u2019re looking at a higher-end budget, are you considering OLED technology or sticking with traditional LCD? If you want wider viewing angles, consider making sure that the LCD falls into the IPS category. Apart from those technical issues, you also need to look at the physical size of the display which will probably be 23+ inch in measurement to decide if it\u2019s going to fit in your planned user space. Will you have to purchase a wall or deskmount VESA bracket to be able to use it? Is it flat shiny glass or matte finish that reduces glare? If you can\u2019t find a matte display will you need to re-arrange your lighting to prevent glare? Personally, I prefer the matte screens but these are going out of favor by manufacturers. ",
