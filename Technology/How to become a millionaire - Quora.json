            "answer_text": "One secret of becoming a millionaire, Secret#1, is the interconnection between income and assets. Being a millionaire means that you have acquired, one way or another, a million dollars in assets over and above any liabilities that you may have. In other words, a net worth, or equity. If you only look at income, you\u2019ll never become a millionaire. Your job or work or service performed will give you income. Then you\u2019ll pay income tax, and spend and live on the income. Do you save? Do you invest? That\u2019s an important way to become a millionaire: save and invest. Build assets. But that\u2019s a simplistic way. Saving some of your after-tax dollars and investing them is slow, hard, and not likely to make you a millionaire unless you make big bucks now, or unless you spend 30 years doing this, and are almost infallible in your investing selections so that you don\u2019t lose money on several of your investments. The secret is the interconnection between income and assets. An income property is worth a certain multiple of its net income. At that price, it yields a certain percentage of its price, called a capitalization rate or cap rate. So if you buy a property for $100,000., and it grosses $20,000 income and expenses of $10,000 leave you net income before financing of $10,000, that\u2019s a 10% cap rate. If you manage the property well, and increase the rents and cut the expenses, and now have $15,000 in net income annually before financing, then at the 10% cap rate, your property is worth $150,000. You only succeeded in getting an extra $5,000 in INCOME, but that $5,000 income created instantly and invisibly, $50,000. in ASSET value. Income morphed into asset value, and you could still spend the $5,000 income and yet keep the increased asset value of $50,000. That\u2019s a multiple. Multiples can make you rich. Prevailing cap rates in income property vary by area, city, type of property, and by the prevailing interest rates. If mortgage interest is, say, 4% per annum, then any earnings above 4% per annum are profitable to borrow against. So if your property yields 6% on its purchase price or cost, and you can mortgage it for 4%, you\u2019re going to be making money on the borrowed money. That\u2019s leverage which creates multiples. So another secret (#2) of becoming a millionaire is positive leverage. Borrow to get the asset or improve the asset, if the cost of borrowing is less than the income produced by the asset. Prevailing low interest rates have made cap rates drop. There is so much desire for yield, that buyers pay more and more for income properties, driving up the prices which means driving down the yields, the cap rates. Prime properties will have lower cap rates. So prestigious office towers might sell for a 3% cap rate. But suburban offices in a strip plaza might have an 8% cap rate. But regardless of the cap rate, the multiplier effect of yield from an asset increasing the asset value, has the potential to make you rich, or at least, a millionaire. In a business, there are also multiples, with different ones prevalent in different industries. In restaurants, I believe that on average, a small restaurant will be worth 3 times its earnings. So if the little sub sandwich store is making $100,000 per annum after expenses and labor, the owner could sell it for $300,000. or more. So if he increases his income by clever marketing, raising his prices, introducing new popular higher markup menu items, etc., and now makes $35,000 more per annum, the asset value of his business is worth $35,000 X 3=$105,000 more than it was worth before. Private equity firms have been buying up chains of dental offices at a 7 times multiple, ie approximately a 14% cap rate. So for every extra $100,000 income that the dentist generates, he secretly, invisibly, automatically increases his net worth by $700,000. How can he get rich doing that? Well if he\u2019s tweaked his office as best he can, to increase his bottom line, where does he go from there? Answer: he scales. He opens another office. Suppose it costs him $350,000 to equip staff and open his new office before it\u2019s running a $100,000 annual net income. His expansion added $100,000 in income, therefore $700,000 in asset value, and it only cost him $350,000 to do that. The bank loaned him, say, $250,000 of that $350,000, so he put in $100,000 of his savings, and thereby created $700,000 in increased net wort. But the new office, after he ploughs in new earnings into perfecting the new office, now generates $150,000 in annual net income. Presto, the sale value of that new office alone is $1 million. Scale, increasing the number of establishments, or rental houses, or rental apartments, stores, etc, has the potential to multiply wealth quickly. That\u2019s millionaire secret #3. Scale means play the numbers game. If you have 4 times the stores, you\u2019ll get rich faster. If you deal in larger numbers, like investment properties that usually sell for more than say, $5 million, instead of houses that sell for $500,000, you\u2019ll get richer faster. Scale also means the numbers of customers. When millions upon millions of people watch Canadian teen Bianca Andreescu dominate and defeat legendary superstar Serena Williams in the US Open Women\u2019s Tennis finals, that means millions and millions of eyeballs. Advertisers jump on the bandwagon. Bianca, 19 years old, gets a prize of $3.85 million, but also gets more endorsements. She\u2019s now apparently earned $8 million. Why? Scale. She enthralls, inspires, and wins the hearts and eyeballs of millions. Why are celebs millionaires? Because they impact millions. So if you sell barbecue brisket at your little restaurant, you can make a living, maybe. Hard to get rich. But if you scale by selling your sauces and rubs, with your own unique brand, and flavors, all over the US, then you can become a millionaire. It takes a lot of work, and good marketing. Millionaire secret #4. Multiply yourself with other people, their money, their experience, their brains, their talent, their muscles, their time, their labor for you. You could train yourself to become a good day trader. You sit at home and watch screens, do analyses, and trade. You may well make a living, or even a good living. But to be a millionaire, at least in a faster than 25\u201330 year time, you need to harness the benefits from other people. It can be by hiring. It can be by outsourcing. I can be by partnering, but that cuts into your profits and slows the process, and may even stop progress by reason of disputes. You want to work on your business,not in it. If you manage 3 rental houses yourself, you will probably become a slave to your tenants complaints, repairs, etc. Hire a property management co., and you are free to work on getting the next property, ie scale. Millionaire Secret #5. Giving, gets you back more. Most millionaires are generous philanthropists. It might be for selfish reasons. They learned by intention or accidentally, that when you give money away in a worthwhile charitable way, you end up getting back much much more from the universe. This giving principle affects Millionaire Secret #6. You have to give, to get. It doesn\u2019t matter what you think that the marketplace needs. What matters is what the marketplace wants, and isn\u2019t getting satisfactorily, in either quantity, quality, or service. So find needs and wants that are underserved in the marketplace, and figure out how to satisfy those needs and wants, at a price that can make you profits. Don\u2019t write a book until you do research and learn whether there is a desire for this book in the marketplace. Will it help or entertain a lot of people? Don\u2019t open a retail store, unless your research proves that there\u2019s demographics and economics out there with people craving what you have to offer, and they can\u2019t get it anywhere nearby, and they have the money to buy it. Don\u2019t try to sell ham sandwiches in a predominantly Muslim or Jewish neighborhood. Millionaire Secret #7. Riches are a butterfly. If you chase a butterfly, you\u2019ll probably never catch it. But if you carry on your activities, and give it no mind, it just might land on your nose. That\u2019s the way happiness is. YOu can\u2019t deliberately chase happiness. It will elude you. But if you engage in things you love, things that are productive, things that help others, all of a sudden you may pause and it dawns on you that you are happy. Same with riches. You can focus on making money by working. But it won\u2019t make you rich. If you instead, focus on providing people with goods and services that they want or need, and aren\u2019t getting elsewhere, then you\u2019ll suddenly realize that you\u2019re a millionaire. The butterfly will have landed on your nose, and you didn\u2019t realize it. If you go directly and aggressively after riches, they elude you. Millionaire Secret #8 Wealth is infinite. There is a limitless supply of wealth capable of being harvested. There is no limit to the ways you can give people what they need or want, for a fair price that they can afford. It is not a zero sum game. You don\u2019t only get money if your gain is the other person\u2019s loss. For wealth, the game needs to be win-win. Both gain. Don\u2019t ever fear not being able to make a living or not being able to get rich. It is built inside you. YOur soul gives you a connection to the Creator, and therefore the ability to tap into unlimited creativity. Also energy, wisdom, courage, strength of character, will power, discipline, focus, know-how, etc. The real truth is, God wants us all to be healthy and prosperous. If we are not, it\u2019s mostly our own fault. We turn away from God\u2019s grace, from the powers he gave us. God did not put us here on this magical planet, in order to live lives of poverty, suffering, and misery. He gave us everything we need. Just like he gave the birds everything they need to survive and thrive. Without clothing, without a bank account, smartphone, etc. They even know how to migrate thousands of miles away in the winter,and then come back in the spring. No GPS.No compass or map. And a corollary to this secret, a real deep but very significant secret: (I got this from Randy Gage, a brilliant guru). God does not give us the desire to have something, without HIs first giving us the means to acquire it. If you can dream it, crave it, fantasize about it, visualize it, then it\u2019s yours. The mental, emotional, spiritual manifestation has started. YOu need to put in the action, the effort on a physical plane, to get it. But you will succeed. Bianca Andreescu said that she used meditation and visualization to succeed in getting where she ended up: winning the world championship women\u2019s tennis Grand Slam at the US Open. You can succeed also. Have faith you can. Have faith in your faith, and doubt your doubts. ",

            "answer_text": "I always get a kick out of \"how to be a millionaire\" answers, especially the \"get rich quick variety\".   My favorite on this chain is \"become a professional athlete\".  The odds of actually making a living as a pro-athelete are very small.  It also takes a lifetime of practice and dedication to even play at the collegiate level, let alone be good enough to make the NFL.  Get rich?  Highly unlikely.  Quick?  Definite no. There are only 3 asset classes that reliably churn out wealthy people: StocksReal EstateOwning Your Own BusinessThere is also one, core path that reliably allows people to acquire those three assets. Live below your means - so you have money leftover to do interesting things with.  This is the golden key that gives you the confidence, safety, and capital to take on investment risk.  It's powerful and freeing to say,\"I don't NEED this money.  If something bad happens, I'll have more to try again with\".Reduce your financial drag - pay off all the high interest rate debt.  It's very hard to out perform even 7% post tax interest like the kind you pay on car loans and credit cards.  Take the guaranteed 7% to 15%+ return and pay off the debt.Invest - first, build up a 3 - 6 month buffer of cash just in case bad things happen, and then use the rest to invest in stocks, real estate, and maybe even starting your own business.Repeat - very, very few people get rich quick.  It often looks like it, but upon closer inspection, most rich folks got there over decades of slow but sure investing and business building.  Compound interest is also an amazing super-power and it takes decades for the effects to become really noticeable.How US millionaires are made has been well researched in a number of books, my favorite being:  The Millionaire Next Door: The Surprising Secrets of America's Wealthy: Thomas J. Stanley, William D. Danko.   Boring?  Yes.  Very high chance of successfully becoming rich over 20 - 30 years.  Also yes. Learn from those that have come before and follow their path...or maybe toss the football around in your front yard and hope to get noticed by a talent scout.  Your choice. ",
