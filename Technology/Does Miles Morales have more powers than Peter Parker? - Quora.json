            "answer_text": "Yes. His base powers is significantly weaker than Peter Parker. Peter Parker being older and in my personal opinion being the original Spider - Man gives him the advantage in strength, speed, durability, etc and it's by a considerable amount. Miles isn't a slouch as you will see below carrying the Rhino while swinging.  What Miles lacks in base stats he excels in energy projection. Think of an energy manipulatiing Spider - Man if you will. Miles Morales can\u2026 Camouflage  Venom Blast  Now Miles can also use Venom Blast in different variations including. Ultra Venom Blast.  This is a concentrated explosion, but he can change the output of the blast too.  Miles can use the Venom Blast as a type of webbing too.  Miles can use the Venom Blast as a beam of energy.   Also use it to augment his actual strikes.  Stream the Venom Blast through objects and his webbing   Can generate the Venom Blast being paralyzed and toward a singular target if need be.  You get the point though. Miles can manipulate the energy within him in all sorts of ways because although it isn't stated\u2026 yet Miles is an energy manipulatior.  Now it's also assumed that Miles has a better precognition than Peter also, but I wouldn't read too much into this yet. I have read every comic featuring Miles Morales and there is only one time he has used this power of seeing an event a night before (When he was 13 years old). Maybe he just hasn't learned it yet? I'm not sure, but until more proof comes out I won't state that's the truth. There is one other comic panel that could mean he does  In this panel it seems Mile's spider sense kicked in before anyone elses, but it could be because they were distracted and Miles was facing the dangers direction too, but you could also argue that being distracted shouldn't affect the spider sense. Too hard to tell right now. Edit: People also assume that this is a form of electricity, but it is indeed not a form of electricity! But whatever Miles needs it to be being concussive, soothing, electricity, even warmth. Bonus: \u201cWho would win between Peter Parker or Miles Morales?\u201d  This a lot more difficult to answer. Peter has: Base stats, experince, and better tech than Miles does. Miles has: Variety, power, and element of surprise ;Peter does not know of all Miles power's variations. He knows of camflague and Venom Blast/ultimate venom Blast, but doesn't know the extent of variations Miles can produce. To clear that up. My personal opinion (feel free to debate amongst comments, but be civil): Miles has the edge (6\u20137.5/10). Now, let me explain myself! Miles has an extreme hax with his Venom Blast. Miles doesn't need to be as strong, fast, durable as Spidey and I hope that never happens or it would make him even more OP. It takes one interaction from the Venom Blast to feel it's affects.   and this is a very small Venom Blast compared to his recent iterations, but Spidey knows this now so his best bet is to blitz Miles which Miles wouldn't hope to stop.  But, remember Miles can also activate it without touching you or being fully concious.  The Venom Blast also does extra damage to beings that are mutated or demons.    There's also a theory that Miles Morale\u2019s Spider - Man could be immortal since Ultimate Spider - Man and Green Goblin are confirmed immortal and they came from the same type experiment as Mile's has, but this is still speculation and not confirmed. Miles durability did increase also after being tortured and experimented on for a week straight.  So, I believe he should be able to take the damage from Peter before using one of his Venom Blasts to take him out and Mile's camflague won't hide him from Peter, but would make it harder for Peter to see length and motions of movement.  If this is a blood lusted brawl I give it to Peter though; There would be no way Miles survives this from Pete at max output (Think Kingpin x80).  Peter was still holding back or Kingpin would be a pile of mush. At the end of the day you could argue both sides! But they are mentor and mentee. Miles still has a lot too learn.  Hope this helped! Thank you for reading and thank you for the support! (: ",
