I had kept myself busy with my office work . Everyday used to console myself by thinking whatever happens , happens for a reason.. So stay positive and force yourself not to think about that person..

Tell them even if they are not aware of your presence.And if you are getting over someone because things didn't work out between you two (or someone hurt you badly and left) then I guess you should ignore it, your feelings will fade with time and you will feel better sooner than you think. (Been there, done that, that's how I know)Concentrate on your work and let the time pass. There nothing more you can do about it except wait it to be over. ",
