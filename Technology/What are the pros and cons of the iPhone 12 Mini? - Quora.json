            "answer_text": "Pros : One of the most compact phones (single hand use is comfortable)5GA14 Bionic (fastest 5nm SoC as of writing)Same dual camera as the iPhone 12Pro (the 12Pro also has a telephoto and LIDAR but the Wide and Ultrawide is same)2340x1080 476ppi (even crispier than 12 Pro) OLED display.Cons : Being a compact phone, battery is bound to be smaller due to smaller footprint. (Expect slightly more battery life than what the iPhone SE2 offers)The display while excellent in quality, is not very large, so you might not get the perks of a larger display (immersive movie viewing etc)Not exactly that cheap for a budget or compact phone. It\u2019s more near to a pixel 5 than 4A. Other brands aren\u2019t exactly comparable since they don\u2019t make compact phones. Compare the 12 to those models.",
