            "answer_text": "It really boils down to what you want to do. They share the same concepts and fundamentals, but differ some in implementation and use. Web development is going to be a really, really fast moving field. Lots of progress here in the past few years. But that also means a rate of change that can be difficult to keep up with. A new developer would do better to find an aspect and go deep. Something like API design or front-end work. Although, the market for web work is huge! Application development still moves fast, but not as fast. It may be a little more sustainable as far as rate of change is concerned. The market, while still large, is much smaller than web development. And you would certainly need to learn new languages and tools for each environment. Swift for iOS and Java for Android, for example. My suggestion is to study the core programming concepts. Learn program flow, conditional branching, object oriented design, debugging, etc\u2026 Then decide if you need web or application development to achieve your goal. Good luck! ",

            "answer_text": "Web development is way easier than app development. Web dev is really about developing websites, and non-technical people will call you a web designer. Salaries are in the $40k if you are lucky to find a job. However, app development also called software development, which includes mobile and web applications, is more complex (think of Facebook application). It requires more functionalities, data management and architectural design. Salaries start at $60k and go up to $200k. These are my two cents, hope it helps. ",
