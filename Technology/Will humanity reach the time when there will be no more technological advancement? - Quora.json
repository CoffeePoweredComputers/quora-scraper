            "answer_text": "It depends on a hypothetical scenario. If we are able to create artificial intelligence with quantum computers. We might not need to advance in any more technological advancements because they will be doing most of the work in that area. This will lead to a decrease in human technological advancement slowly to gradually until we have fully stopped advancing. Look up technological singularity which is due to happen within 50 years from now. The reason why is because A.I. computing and thought-processing would be about 1000000x faster than any human brain in the future. However, this could lead to our demise in the future. ",

            "answer_text": "So far, human beings are in a relentless race in developing technology and innovating to get the jobs done better at less cost. Competition has been the underlying strength of the market economy in intensifying the race. It\u2019s true that competition inspires firms to pursue technology innovation. But technology innovation increases the opportunity of monopolistic market power accumulation. By capitalizing this opportunity, dominant innovative firm starts offering increasingly better quality products at lower cost in making growing profit, while compelling competitors to take lower price to incur a loss. As a result, competition starts diminishing lowering the urge of further technology progression. In absence of smarter policy and regulation, market economy runs the risk of witnessing slowing down of innovation, which may not necessarily end up completely ceasing the technology progress. As a matter of fact, due to the growing role of software and connectivity the scope of market monopolization is increasing, weakening the innovation space. Monopolistic market power of Facebook, Amazon, Google or Microsoft are just a few examples. ",

            "answer_text": "This is an interesting question and a difficult one to answer. My instinct is to think that this will never happen, but that the rate of technological advancement may slow to almost a stop if our species is able to survive for long enough. I don\u2019t think we could ever discover everything that could ever be discovered, so to speak, because as we get closer and closer to reaching that goal, the length of time that passes between each discovery would continue to increase until it reached such a point that it was virtually infinite.

            "answer_text": "Normally no. Humans will always innovate no matter what. But there was a time when scifi movies focused on EMP based cataclisms where all electronics will stop. But even then, humans will still innovate with technology. My favorite on those movies is Cadilacs And Dinosaurs \u2014 they still found a way to make cars work. There is also the Time Machine movies where in the future human kind got almost wipped out and the decendands that remain don't have idea of science. But still, the wheel will be created and technology will move but at a crawling state from what we're use to. ",

            "answer_text": "In my opinion No there will be blips but as long as there are innovators however you may see slower leaps than before. I think the biggest jump forward will be in propulsion systems and space travel over the next 20 years on a macro level of technology. On the micro level this will continue to evolve as consumers demand more and more new ways of doing things ",
