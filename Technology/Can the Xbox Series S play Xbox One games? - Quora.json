            "answer_text": "The Series S will be the all digital version of the Series X. So if you have any One games on disc, you won\u2019t be able to play them on the Series S. However, Smart Delivery is one of the selling features for the next-gen system. It will automatically give you the best version of your games. So if you bought last year\u2019s smash hit Resident Evil 2, if you play it on the Series X, it will be updated to a Series X version. The best part of it is that you\u2019ll still be able to play the same games on your Xbox One, so long as they\u2019re actually Xbox One games. This is so you won\u2019t have to repurchase your entire library. A good thing for me, because I have several games on my Xbox One, and it\u2019d be cost-prohibitive to rebuy them. Especially with the price increase for the next-gen games. So if your One has digital games, you should be able to play them on the Series S. So long as they\u2019re on the list. I expect the library of eligible games to constantly be expanded, as more people decide to upgrade to the next-gen system, to be released this Holiday season.
