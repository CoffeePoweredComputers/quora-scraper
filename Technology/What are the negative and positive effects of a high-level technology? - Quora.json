            "answer_text": "Positive: Quality of human life increases. Humans are forced to learn, adapt, grow intellectually and perhaps physically. The environment around us suffers less damage and restores to unspoiled status.. Negative: Change itself causes damage. Humans and environment die from growth spurts of failed or unworkable high technology. Some areas and situations never recover and are gone forever. If you think this is a bit crazed, think on a future technology where mankind has the ability to create and move matter. We can already do it on a very small scale, but with high technological advancements in transportation (teleportation?!) and engineering you could literally build mountains, restore the salinity of an entire ocean, and genetically recreate deceased former life (honeybees, heath hens, whatever). 150 years ago it was people riding horses to send information. 15 years ago you could see someone on a large screen or talk to them in a small portable phone. Today, I can talk to you in person on a small square screen in real-time. Imagine 150 years from now. ",
