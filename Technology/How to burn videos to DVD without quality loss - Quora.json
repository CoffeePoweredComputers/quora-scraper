            "answer_text": "If you are using HD content - know that DVD\u2019s are standard def. So while they will look very good, the math and frame size isn\u2019t there. A 16 x 9 screen ratio on a DVD is still inside a 720 x 480 frame. DVD\u2019s are Mpeg2 encoding and while it has been optimized, mpeg4 is the current compression leader on quality. Apple Compressor, Adobe Media encoder, and others have different quality setting and these are related to bite rate and in the end file size. While a standard DVD-5 is supposed to hold a 2 hour video, I have never found it to do so [pretty close] at the highest setting. Professional movie DVD\u2019s are usually about 5 mbits per second, but they are starting with a very high quality master. While you can crank that number up - you may find that older DVD players can\u2019t really handle high bit rates very well. So again I refer back to what is your beginning quality? If it\u2019s family footage from 8mm or standard def tape, I don\u2019t think you will see a big difference if you choose high quality settings. If it\u2019s HD, it will be converted to standard def. In all the years I did DVD\u2019s as the primary way to distribute, I never saw a big quality dropoff\u2026 especially compared to where the industry had been. I always used uncompressed master files, but most people don\u2019t have that ability today. If you want higher quality master to Blu-Ray which is still Mpeg2, but designed for high def. ",

            "answer_text": "A playable DVD (on DVD players) must meet the DVD standard which requires that the video be compressed into a file which meets its specifications; hence, there is loss in quality. A DVD optical disc can also serve as a data disc (not playable on a DVD player but computer readable) which can hold video files without loss of quality up to the space available on the disc. ",
