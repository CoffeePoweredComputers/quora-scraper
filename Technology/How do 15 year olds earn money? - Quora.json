            "answer_text": "At your age you\u2019re going to have very little trouble with things like regulations and taxes and whatnot. Find a lawnmower. If you (or your parents have one) awesome. If not find a neighbor with a lawnmower. Offer to mow their yard for free if they let you use their mower. (I did this and ended up with a free lawnmower when they moved to an apartment with no yard 2 months later). If you have a bike and a rope you can pull the mower behind you to cover a greater area. Go door to door. Dress like as upstanding a citizen as you possibly can. If you\u2019re good at bullshitting (a legitimate marketable talent) come up with something wholsome you\u2019re trying to raise up money to do. An educational trip to the grand canyon, a christian retreat the next year, a trip to Europe, whatever. Just something convincing. It really doesn\u2019t matter, they\u2019re still just paying you for the job not for the story, the story just loosens their wallet/purse a little. Go door to door. Be polite, friendly, have a big ol smile. Ask them if they need someone to cut their grass. I was charging $20 for a regular sized yard, and on streets with more expensive houses I\u2019d charge $30. Sometimes I\u2019d say $35 and let them talk me down a little. With effort, your sure to find at least 10 houses that agree. You cut the grass, takes you about an hour, so 2 5 hour days of cutting grass with an hour travel-between-houses time each day and you\u2019ve cleared $200. No taxes, no fees, just refill your gas tanks and your good to go. I used my moms printer to print out crappy little business cards, they just had my name and phone number on them. After I\u2019d cut a yard, I\u2019d knock on the door and get the money and hand them one. Tell them \u201ctell your friends, I really wanna \u2018get that trip\u2019 (or whatever). See you next weekend.\u201d At one point I had so many houses that I was glad school was finally letting out for summer break. I\u2019d cut 4 or 5 yards a day. A friend one night asked me where I was getting all that money and a thought occurred to me. I told him I was cutting grass, asked him if he had a mower. He did, so I told him I already had all these houses lined up regularly, if he helped me do them I\u2019d share the money with him. I\u2019d give him like $15 for cutting a yard I didn\u2019t have to cut, I\u2019d still make the extra $5, and now I could keep adding houses to the list. I made so damn much money that summer it was crazy. Every week I was 16 and would have at least a few hundred dollars to blow at the movies or the mall. This lasted until almost the end of summer, my mower broke. I had been spending my money as I got it and didn\u2019t have enough to buy another mower. School was starting back up soon so I didn\u2019t bother, I told my friend to go for it. If I had the sense then that I do now, I would have invested some of that money. I\u2019d have bought a used riding mower or something, a weed eater, some garden tools, set up as a full landscaping service. Charge more, still all cash payments under the table, the work would have been easier, hire more people to do the bulk of the actual work for me, got some professional business cards made. By now I\u2019d be rolling in money hand over fist and doing pretty much none of the actual work myself. Hindsight is 20/20 lol. ",

            "answer_text": "Most people make money by working. By the time I was 17 I had been a dining counter clerk at Woolworth\u2019s, a waitress, hospital kitchen worker and summer camp counsellor. But then, I didn\u2019t start working until I was thirteen, not counting two years of babysitting. My daughter found her first job at ten, transplanting plants in a nursery. After that she sold ice cream, waited tables, coached gymnastics (for the Y, which made her get a Social Insurance number), and delivered advertising door to door. There is no law restricting children from working \u2014 only laws that insist they get an education and regulating how many hours they can work. If this were not true, movies would have to hire adults to play toddlers. Since it is already June, you are probably too late to find a summer job, but some of the early starters may have made their money by the end of July or been fired so don\u2019t be afraid to apply now. Wear clean clothes and bring along your resume. That\u2019s just a paper with your contact information, including telephone and email, some idea of your scholastic progress, and perhaps contact information for a few adults as references. ",
