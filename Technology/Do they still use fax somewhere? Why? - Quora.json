            "answer_text": "Mariella Cavadini has a good answer, but I disagree with her point on security. When faxes all went over the PSTN (Private Switched Telephone Network, aka POTS - Plain Old Telephone Service) it was very difficult to intercept a fax, at least without the phone company\u2019s help. Now many people have internet-based phone lines. Even some phone lines which appear to be POTS (plain copper phone wire) may be converted to IP (Internet Protocol) and sent over the internet by the phone company. A lot of people also use virtual fax systems, which may receive a traditional fax, but then deliver it by email. Since fax machines do not encrypt transmissions, the times when a fax goes over the internet make them much more easily hacked than when it was all PSTN. In my view this is a huge problem which those who depend on fax are ignoring. I think largely due to embedded assumptions from how faxes used to work. There are systems which can encrypt a fax, but they need to be operating at both ends (sender and receiver). This can be done either by using a web interface to upload at the sending end and download a the receiving end, or by using a box between the fax machine and the internet which encrypts the fax at the sending end, and decrypts it at the receiving end. The placing of the internet between fax machines also has degraded the confirmations which fax machines give. For example, if a fax is received by a fax service, that fax probably did not print out at the receiving machine. It was stored on a server somewhere. It may then have been emailed, or a notice of it coming in been emailed, but that is not actually a confirmation that the fax was received at the place where you intended to send it. So, I\u2019d say the two reasons people still use fax for sending copies of paper documents are: An assumption that it\u2019s secure, which may be wrong.The convenience of one-step sending (vs. scanning to a computer, then sending, say as an email attachment)",

            "answer_text": "I agree with all of the answers provided, but I'd like to point out a somewhat surprising example supporting the usefulness of that dinosaur fax machine you have tucked away in your company's supply closet. The company I work for sends faxes in order to reinforce the reach of our email campaign. For example, if we have an email list of about 3,000 addresses, inevitably, anywhere from 10-30% will bounce out, opt out, or arrive at general addresses (info@company.com, sales@company.com, etc.) where they'll rot unopened. We send a fax duplicate of the message we email to reach those businesses who were lost in the shuffle or were successfully delivered to inboxes, but not included in the 15-17% open rate. The fact that fax machines are seldom used works to our advantage because there's no inbox clutter. And prospects having a hard copy in hand help us to stay top-of-mind noticeably better.  We also target clients in certain areas of the world who have an office with 30 employees and one computer. Email won't meet their needs or ours and direct mail would be far too expensive, so these clients tend to correspond through fax more regularly. We recently received a fax-back of a form from the prospect we faxed it to way back in 2003. Apparently he kept the fax, and when the message became relevant to him, filled it out, submitted it to us, and subsequently bought our services. I used to be skeptical about the use of fax for marketing, broad scale communication, and other things that have, by and large, moved online, but after that example and others that are common and similar, I'm a believer. It doesn't fit every business model or communication strategy, but there is certainly still a time and a place for it! ",

            "answer_text": "In its heyday, fax and copy machines stood tall and evolved as the darling of all document transmission devices. Offices and even residences relied heavily on the capability of the fax and copy machine. However, like a soldier, fax and copy machines will never die but fade away in importance as other devices come into the real world. Their demise could never be catalogued as some parts of the modern society has not moved on and embrace the emergence of new technology. The baby boomers generation for instance belong to this, as they matured in conjunction with the fax machines. The technology that threatened the existence of fax machine is the Internet, as it evolved to be a better alternative. Take note that fax transmission makes use of the phone line to transmit information, and problems are aplenty concerning the use. Since fax devices transforms information into sound datum, the transmission protocol appears to be complicated aside from being very noisy. On the other end of the lever is fax messaging online, the new technology that makes use of the Internet to communicate. Messages are prepared in the computer and once completed are sent directly to the receiving computer printer setup. The receiver has the option to just look at the message encoded into the computer monitor or use the printer for a hard copy. The process is simple, easy and utterly noise free. With online fax messaging appearing to be a better option, why do fax machines still lives today? The reason could be nostalgic on the part of the baby boomers generation having existed practically together. Or certain applications mandates the use of fax machines over that of fax online. Doctors and lawyers for instance still rely on the age old fax machines to send documents and the reason vary. Doctors on one end are governed by the HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act), which mandates that documents transmitted between doctors, labs, and insurers have to be secure. Over time this HIPAA provision has been interpreted by most practicing medical professionals to mean only fax and copy machine messaging and not something else like email which is more secure. Lawyers on the other end, argues that fax and copy machines offer them convenience, since they do not have a list of email addresses making it doubly hard to send documents to clients. While fax messaging rely on the phone line, allowing lawyers easy access to addresses in the phone directory. Also with fax, sent messaging are provided with confirmation that it was received, while email recipient need to open the computer to read the message. From Why Fax and Copy Machines are still relevant today? ",

            "answer_text": "As it relates to fax machines (i.e. physical machines, whether they are stand-alone or part of a multi-function printer/scanner), there are three key reasons that haven't been mentioned:  ConvenienceImmediacyPaper-based WorkflowsSecurity has been mentioned, but the real reason for it is complex, so I'll leave that for another time. Convenience can't be overlooked. If what you need to do is send a piece of paper to someone, it's just easy to fax it (as opposed to scanning it to your hard drive, composing an email, finding and attaching the scanned file, and sending the email). Part of this too, is \"what people are used to\", but one step vs. three or four has some real benefits. Immediacy is something that email can't deliver. Yes, it's getting better, but delays in email delivery are still very common. Faxing is like texting something to someone--you send it and it gets there right away. For a great many kinds of transactions, that deterministic delivery time is critical. There are still a great many businesses and even entire industries with a significant potion of their workflows still involving paper. That's not likely to change any time soon (stories of the mythical paperless office have been around for years). And as long as the workflow itself involves paper, a significant portion of that paper is going to be moved around by fax. Of course virtual or \"efax\" services, as well as on-premise fax servers, offer the ability to fax via email, web, print-to-fax, and other methods--none of which require a physical fax machine. Many of the same reasons for their use are the same or similar, including the possibility that the person on the other end of the transaction is using a physical fax machine. ",

That is on the receiving end.  On the sending end, instead of needing: a scanner,a computer,a power source, andan Internet connection,again a fax only requires a fax machine, a phone connection and a power source. Signed documents are the primary reason faxes are still in use.  Faxes do have many liabilities.  Email provides a two way conversation, including a conversation thread.  Faxes offer only a one way send/receive process. As well, email has superior document storage, manipulation, and retrieval to fax transmissions. As photographed documents become more accepted as valid signed copy documents, as being led by banking institutions such as Chase and Wells Fargo, the use of faxes will continue to drop in popularity.  Now that mobile phones have cameras and sending photos out from our phones is simple, these photographed documents offer a nice alternative to faxing.  Yet until our cameras provide a clear and legible document image to rival the quality of a fax, photographed documents will still be a rarity.  It will be a ways out before the fax becomes 100% extinct. ",

(Because the client lacks an SSN, I cannot obtain an EIN online. I could submit the SS-4 by mail, but that would waste time.) BTW, I have been blogging about the challenges of this process for almost a decade. If you have time to spare and nothing better to do with it, you can check out Foreign Company Alert: Obtaining an EIN may be your Biggest Challenge in the U.S. ",

Because they are secure and allow one to deliver information fast. They are especially useful in cases when someone needs to receive a document, sign it and then send it back. This is one of the features the internet doesn\u2019t offer yet. Although there are some programs that can help you sign a document on your computer, they don\u2019t compare with hand-writing. Also, when sending someone a fax, you have the live proof they have received, while when sending an email, although you receive a so-called confirmation, you are not sure that the consignee has received it.

            "answer_text": "Fax machines are still used largely because of the security and immediacy they offer.  It\u2019s especially efficient if you need to sign and send back sensitive documents quickly, which is why so many businesses, like car dealers, medical, and real estate offices, continue to fax.   With that said, you should know that you don\u2019t need a fax machine to fax anymore.  Online fax (you may know it as email-to-fax or Internet fax) lets you forego the machine and phone line by using your Internet connection to send and receive faxes.  This means you can use your email or an online fax interface to send/receive faxes and maintain the security and timeliness of traditional fax.   If you\u2019re still asking yourself why you\u2019re still faxing, I recommend checking out http://www.slideshare.net/ChooseWhat/hellofax-google-should-businesses-care-that-they-can-fax-in-the-cloud.
