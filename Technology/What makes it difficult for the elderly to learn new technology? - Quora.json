            "answer_text": "Senior people have seen a lot during their lifespan. Now that they are old, there are some physical and psychological factors that makes them less adaptable to the technology. First of all, as we grow old, our curiosity is significantly reduced. Elders are much better at sharing their expertise and experiences than learning new things. Secondly, elderly people have really slow learning curve as compared to kids and teenagers. They can\u2019t grasp on new technology as quickly as we do. We have to teach an elderly person again and again until it becomes a routine. There are other factors like poor vision, shaky hands, unable to focus on one thing at a time, poor short term memory which are huge barrier for old people to learn about technology. However, elderly people today are leaning towards learning about technology. According to a research by PEW Internet, number of elderly people using modern technologies like smartphones and Internet is increasing. It shows that not only seniors are willing to understand the technology, but also willing to use it for their own well being. As a responsible person, it is our duty to educate seniors about latest technologies like wearable tech gadgets, smart homes, fitness trackers and more. It\u2019s a need of the hour to make them tech-ready for a better life in their golden years. Today, technology is shifting more towards the betterment of the elderly. There are many products that will keep track of senior\u2019s health, reminding them to take medicines, and conducting day to day activities like turning lights on and off, opening and closing the door etc. just using voice commands.  If you want to know more about the latest technology for seniors, refer digital health for elderly. I hope this information helps. Thank You. ",

            "answer_text": "Well I would not say it is difficult for them to understand. You can see many elderly people making use of gadgets at par with the younger generations. At the same time one does notice a slight apprehension at making use of new technologies. The reasons for above can be as discussed below: Elder people belong to a time when resources and power of purchase were less. Hence any equipment they bought had to be used with utmost care so that it would last long. Over the years this thought process became a habit and so now when offered to use some new gadget their first fear is what if it goes bad by my mistake.Unlike the younger generation who would prefer trying new ideas, equipments, technologies , the older generation is more conservative which is to say they resist change because change makes them uncomfortable. A very simple example is of mobile phones. While we enjoy using latest handsets , elder people prefer keypad ones even when they are no longer easily available. Thus to summarise we can say that the difficulty lies not in the complexity of technology but in the feeling of comfort they get in using older technology as compared to new ones.",
