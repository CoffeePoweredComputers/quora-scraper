            "answer_text": "there are various kinds of pencil,like charcoal pencil\uff0ccarbon stick,carbon strip,lead pencil,color pencil(black) and so on.every kinds of pencil have it\u2019s character just like human. here,I introduce these pencils briefly: the first photo shows the charcoal pencil. the material of the core of this kinds of pencil is differ to and darker than lead pencil. accordingly,the benefit of a charcoal pencil is that the picture it sketched would had stronger three-dimensional effect . however,it is very crispy ,expensive and the draw is hard to erase or rectify. another shortcoming is that this pencil only has three sub-kinds \u2014\u2014-hard soft and medium. if you want to buy charcoal pencils,it is necessary to make sure the market don\u2019t have violent transportation. I usually use the brand of Marie.  as a student major in industrial design, I prefer colorful pencil(black). compare to other pencils,it has hard core and not expensive so you don\u2019t have to cry over the poor easy-broken crispy pencils.compare to lead pencil,it is darker and easy to control the light-strong effects but a bit hard to erase. the next two pictures are my university homework finished by black pencil 399 (FABER-CASTELL, a famous pencil brand,) and sometimes I would use the 499 which is also black but softer and has water-solubility.   the lead pencil is the most common kind of pencil. the picture below is one of my works done by lead pencils in middle school(around five years earlier). every newbie has to learn how to sketch by lead pencil first,cos it is basis. lead pencil is cheap and easy to erase so is nice for first-learners to practice.because of the merit of easy-erasing,one can rectify over and over again to draw an amazingly delicate picture. there are many size of lead pencil.for a common learner,the size of 2B,3B,4B,5B,6B,7B,8B is recommended. we usually use 4B to draw the outline,and then we use 6B or 7B to set the bottom color(we always use paper-pencil or napkin to wipe large area. it saves time.if your paper is not so durable to erase and you are eager to draw delicate pictures,it is okay to draw line by line patiently),and we use the 7,8B to darker the shadows and use 2,3B to draw the details. it\u2019s important to draw big B before small B,because if you draw the small size at first,the silky surface is really hard to add the soft big B carbon powder thus you can\u2019t strengthen the effect. there are also HB,1H,2H,3H which are the size of hard lead pencils which the carbon proportion is low. the number increases,the proportion declines so the color is lighter.and the largest number I had is 14B which is really black.   sometimes one likes to combine these pencils to draw.the picture above is drew by charcoal pencil and lead pencil. to sum up,there are truly many kinds of pencil used in drawing portrait,which one to use depends on your bias and the things you want to draw. Hope my answer can help you,thank you! ",

            "answer_text": "It's not about what pencil you use but how you use it. I used to use graphite pencils but you have to be very good at them to achieve good results because it's a bit hard to get those really dark tones, that's why I prefer charcoal pencils. All the works I'm going to show you where done using only charcoal pencils:   And this one the only difference is the background where I used compressed charcoal that helps you get those really dark backgrounds. The feeling of light is because of the camera because the background is totally dark:  I usually use only soft and medium charcoal pencils and with those you can create anything you like. How to achieve this? It's ALL about the sum of small details, the more details no matter how unimportant they feel are the ones that make the work more realistic. That and the practice in using different tones, the more varied tones you use, also gives you the realistic feeling. That and the use of a good photo or if you can, a live model. I don't use live model, I'm very slow and it would cost me a lot so I always use photos, but you have to learn how to work with real models first. But I'm answering something else. About your question, use charcoal. But if you really like graphite, you can also achieve wonderful works with that, I have seen people who are masters with graphite. And again, it's not about the pencil, it's all about the technique. ",
