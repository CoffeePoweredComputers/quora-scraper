            "answer_text": "Last month, when the Australian government launched a smartphone app called COVIDSafe to find and alert the contacts of people infected with the coronavirus, Prime Minister Scott Morrison made a hard sell to the public. \u201cThe more people who download this important public health app \u2026 the sooner we can safely lift restrictions and get back to business and do the things we love,\u201d he said in a 26 April press release. Two million people downloaded it in the first 24 hours it was available. The idea is that such digital contact tracing will identify people potentially exposed to the coronavirus who should self-isolate\u2014and that they\u2019ll voluntarily do so. But so far, we only have epidemiological models to suggest such apps can help control an epidemic. Skeptics worry the apps will amount to a high-tech distraction. And even some advocates say they\u2019re only as strong as a health system\u2019s ability to follow up with notified users, test them, and offer support during quarantine.It\u2019s very appealing\u2014that you have an app that does all this work \u2026 and does it quickly,\u201d says Hannah Clapham, an epidemiologist at the National University of Singapore Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health. But she warns that an app can\u2019t replace the work of human contact tracers. \u201cI hope that it works. But I worry that we think it\u2019s going to save us.\u201d Australia was among the first countries to launch a national contact tracing app, and many more plan to do so in the coming weeks. As health departments weigh competing app designs and prepare their pitches to privacy-conscious citizens, they\u2019ll have to define success. It will be hard to prove an app has slowed the rate of infections and changed the course of an epidemic. But teams of epidemiologists, engineers, and behavioral scientists have many ways to put them to the test. Emerging apps of many flavors App-based contact tracing is appealing in part because the coronavirus\u2019 spread is so stealthy. Infected people can transmit the virus for days before they develop symptoms, and it can take several more days for public health investigators to learn about a case and confirm it with testing. These teams then have precious little time for traditional contact tracing: interviewing the infected person, tracking down all the recent contacts they can recall, and getting those people to self-isolate before they, too, pass on the virus ",

            "answer_text": "During this pandemic, the Indian government developed COVID-19 \u201ccontact tracing app\u201d to slow down the spread of infectious outbreaks. Contact-tracing technology is one that helps to track the virus and warn the workplace staff with consistent alerts. When someone gets coronavirus everyone they have been in prolonged contact with will be tracked down and potentially asked to self-isolate. How the Contact tracing app helps in preventing the spread of coronavirus disease:- Visitor screening-With the screening feature, You can screen the visitors before their entry on the premises. This app uses visitor initial screening with digital questionnaires asking their health and travel history. Screening determines the visitor is infected or not. Employees can approve or disapprove visitors with the screening using this app.Contactless visitor check-in-Contactless check-ins are the best practice to prevent the spread of infection in the workplace. Visitors use their smartphones for themselves check-ins without the help of any third person. Sanitizing the tablet and smartphones before using it. Visitors can check-ins using QR code.Automatic Alerts-The The contact-tracing system helps to track the infected person and warn staff with alerts. The contact tracing app notifies the employee if they have been in contact with an infected visitor.This app is specially designed for offices, industries, hospitals, and many other premises that are planning to re-open offices after lockdown. Conclusion The contact tracing app helps to stop COVID-19\u2019s spread. It tracks the visitors by \u201ctracing\u201d the entry of the visitor. The Indian Governments have set out a plan to remove lockdown and want to get people back to work by using digital tools. ",
