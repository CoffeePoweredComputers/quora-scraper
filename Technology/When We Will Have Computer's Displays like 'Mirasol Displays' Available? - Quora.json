            "answer_text": "The \u201cMirasol\u201d or \u201ciMOD\u201d technology is no longer being active developed by Qualcomm, the company which currently owns this technology, so it\u2019s unlikely we\u2019ll see any displays of this type in the near future. This is a full-color reflective display technology, but it\u2019s not particularly fast and so is not suitable for full-speed video screen. That makes it much less attractive for applications such as TVs, laptops, smartphones, or computer monitors. ",
