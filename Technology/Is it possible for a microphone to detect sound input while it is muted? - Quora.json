            "answer_text": "Absolutely.  In the situation you've described, the mic is still receiving sound and that input is being transmitted along the mic cable.  If, for example, you had an external pre amp that had insert channels as well as stereo outputs, you could take the mic signal from the insert channels and send it to another device and record it there.

            "answer_text": "The mic is sending the sound wave along the path that you've set up, until it reaches the mute. So, the pre-amp receives the signal, sends it to the converter, then the digital signal heads into your computer, and then is stopped by the mute button of your software. Depending on were that mute button is in the signal chain, you can probably still record what the mic is picking up. I hope that makes sense. ",
