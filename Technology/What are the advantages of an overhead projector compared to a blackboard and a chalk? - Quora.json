            "answer_text": "From my student days I\u2019ve watched it progress from blackboards, to whiteboards, to projectors to interactive touch screen boards. Blackboard and chalk isn\u2019t great in retrospect. You get an ungodly amoutn of dust everywhere, your writing can be thicker than you like so you have to end up writing larger than normal, one person can just accidentally wipe something off and suddenly they\u2019re covered in dust. Oh don\u2019t forget the lovely sound of chalk scraping against the black board. I am going to assume an OHP is the modern type you can plug into your devices and not the older style version which is clear plastic pieces of A4 with writing on shining through mirrors via light. One of my favourite things I have seen people do with OHP is to shine it onto a whiteboard, and simply write over whatever you are teaching. It leaves no mess (except what you wrote), it requires only power, not a constant supply of pens / chalk as you can even do your teachings on your computers mouse. I have also seen it where students can take over a lesson by bringing laptops up and plugging in for their own demonstrations to classmates or while they need to do talking projects. It also suits really well into computing lessons as a way for everyone in the same class to follow along to see where you click and what you are typing. Finally for media/english students, or even those students at the end of the year with nothing to learn and ready to leave school, they make for great indoor cinemas. The interactive touch screen boards are an interesting concept where you have a special pen which when clicked on this special backing wall (which you project onto) will control the computers mouse for full control without having to go back to your pc or draw on the screenwithout leaving any mess or require resources (except power). The only downside to a projector is that each tutor will need some form of PC or laptop to be able to use it which will have some form of cost. But in a modern age like today it is standard for everyone to have some personal device and can even be picked up on the cheap. ",

            "answer_text": " Time efficiency. Once I started teaching with an overhead projector 15 years ago I noticed how fast children could understand. Especialy in technical education when you want to teach something difficult. It is sometimes the only reasonable way to teach by using a visual image or a power point presentation or even a pdf. It not only can make the leson easier but also it can cut the lecture time in half allowing for the teacher valuable time to interact with the students. The students understand far better when you show them visual prompts rather than having to explain to them only in writen or verbal form. In the modern world that we live in there is everything in digitised form. It is necessary for the schools to move to the digitisation of their curriculum. In the picture is the Ghanaian teacher Okwura Kwadwo struggling to teach his kids ICT. He is very good with what he has but we need to do better. We need to change. ",
