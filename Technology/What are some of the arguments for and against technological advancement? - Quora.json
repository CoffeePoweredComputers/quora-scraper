            "answer_text": "Discussions about the merits of technological advancement aren\u2019t about technology. There isn\u2019t much debate about what technology does. Discussions about the merits of technological advancement are about human nature. Technology amplifies. It is a force multiplier. Great and terrible people are empowered to do greater and more terrible things. One man can create a vaccine that saves billions of lives, or create a bomb that incinerates civilizations. Production and destruction are magnified. One farmer can feed tens of thousands. One factory can destroy an entire ecosystem. Often, production and destruction happen at the same time. Technology means that some countries struggle to buy guns, while others have aircraft carriers. The powerless aren\u2019t as powerless, but compared to the powerful - gaps in power are exacerbated. In short, humanity does as humanity always has. Technological advancements just allow humans to much better do what they want. For some, that\u2019s writing apps to share information around the world. For others, it\u2019s creating weapons of mass destruction. Most people just want to make Excel spreadsheets at work so they can make more money to buy a device that plays Candy Crush, a tiny device built by laying waste to entire ecosystems halfway around the world.
