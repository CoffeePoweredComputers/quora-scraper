            "answer_text": "The evolution of hieroglyphic offers a fascinating post-mortem on the history of one particular script from birth to extinction. A hybrid phonetic/ideographic script. That alone, for linguists, historians, archaeologists, is a treasure. Okay, now, how does hieroglyphic impact us today even if we\u2019re not a bookworm or a scholar? It helps us understand one of the greatest civilizations. That alone is fundamental. Understanding the fate of past civilizations can help us cope with the many crisis that our modern world is going through. Just as Medicine benefited greatly from observing humans, dead or alive, we learn plenty of things from past civilizations, and Egypt was a pivotal, seminal civilization. That requires an understanding of hieroglyphic. Actually, understanding Egyptian civilization was impossible until circa 1830, when hieroglyphic was finally cracked.It helps us understand our roots. Egypt is a major component of Western thought. Egypt was seminal to the Judeo-Christian thought; it was seminal to the Greek and Roman civilizations. Freemasons revere all things Egyptian. Egypt is the blueprint for the Western world: state, bureaucracy, military, engineering, diplomacy, medicine, mysticism, libraries, tribunals, astronomy, economy, cosmetics and glamour, the arts. Understanding our roots is important to avoid making certain mistakes over and again.Did the Egyptian civilization leave a message for us, modern-day people? That looks like a wild assumption, and I agree it may be borderline thinking. However, the sheer view of the monuments of Egypt, their scale, their mysteries, pushes some people to question whether the Academic view of that ancient civilization is totally correct. Some of the Egyptian artefacts and techniques still defy explanation. And again, understanding hieroglyphic is the key.That last point 3 has a weak version, and a strong one. The weak version is: by reading hieroglyphic, we can understand Egyptian civilization, we can understand what went wrong, and learn something (mostly everyone will agree). The strong version is: some enlightened Egyptians knew that their civilization was doomed, they knew why, and wanted to pass the message so that another civilization, later, would heed the warning. We must read the writing on the wall! ",
