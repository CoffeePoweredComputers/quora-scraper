            "answer_text": "I am not a car expert, I just drive one. But to answer your question, there is already one segment here in the US that is changing due to the connected car feature: Insurance. Up until now, insurance companies hire PhDs in Math to try to come up with a mathematical model of how any one demographic would cost in terms of payouts, that in turn determines how much a rate would be for a 56-year old white male working as an accountant versus a 18-year old female student with good grades studying Engineering. Up until now, it is just a guess at how any one person would do based on the history of the entire pool of people that are similar in age, sex, profession, commute distance, etc. Now Tesla is offering insurance, and based on some reports, its rates are lower than other insurance companies. Tesla, who sells some of the most connected cars out in the market. I would contend that because the Tesla vehicles are almost always connected to headquarters, they have actual data on how the vehicles are driven, not just what events happen to the vehicles (accidents, traffic tickets, etc.). Other insurance are trying to do the same thing by convincing drivers that they get a discount if they would download an app to their smartphone, conveniently with GPS and accelerometers, to measure how that driver actually drives. Bottom line, I would see a change in automobile insurance rates based on the DRIVER\u2019s individual behavior, instead of the driver\u2019s DEMOGRAPHIC\u2019s behavior. ",
