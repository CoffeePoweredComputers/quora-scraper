            "answer_text": "I started using the internet back at the turn of the century and I\u2019d like to share some of my recent experiences with you. I watched a guy recruit workers for a no-content or low-content KDP publishing business on Amazon. He was earning 25k per month by uploading random words that were consumed by the bots infecting the subscription platform. He was living parasitically on the back of a parasite feeding off of the hard work of real authors. I watched the guy who plagiarized my first novel gain 90,000 Twitter followers over the course of a week for no discernible reason. He gets only a few likes on the things he posts, so they are clearly fake. In comparison, a truly famous author like Anne Rice who posts regularly has 180,000 followers. I watched a video about a guy who spent 250 Euro to get 25,000 Instagram (fake) followers. He was then offered 3000 Euros by a collection of marketing firms to promote their products. I visited a chatroom with 250 members and came to the conclusion that 90% of the posts came from an advertiser with 15 sockpuppets. It was a \u2018closed\u2019, \u2018private\u2019 mom\u2019s discussion group associated with the college I attended and many of the members did not seem aware that their \u2018friends\u2019 were advertising audiobooks and baby thermometers. I read about how Amazon sellers use Facebook chatbots to cheat their way to good reviews. You too can have a free cell phone charger if you leave a five-star review for these products! I read this post today on Twitter:\n@CaseyNewton Mark Zuckerberg posted a link to my story to 117 million people yesterday and got 58,000 reactions, an engagement rate of 0.05 percent. A Facebook follower truly ain\u2019t what it used to be. My kids used TicTok and now a Chinese company knows everything about my children. When I protested that they were underage and I wanted their profiles deleted, TikToc requested more identifying information from me in order to complete the request. My husband plays a video game called Clash of Clans and has had lots of conversations with his friends on the platform. The game was recently sold to a Chinese company that now knows more about my husband than I do. I just started my WordPress blog and find that it doesn\u2019t facilitate fast networking compared to my posts on Quora \u2013 as in, my posts don\u2019t get distributed as widely and I have to do the work of reaching out to other bloggers to get links forwarded. Maybe that is its strength as well as its weakness. It relies on human interaction rather than on an algorithm to determine distribution. Some people may think I am foolish for putting my face and voice on the internet since I practically open a door for bad people to find out everything about me. I understand that, but I have had some life experiences that gave me a more devil-may-care, memento mori attitude about my life. YOLO! I wrote some books with stories that I think will help people and I want people to read those stories. I am also creating videos and blog posts so that if anything happened to me, my kids would still be able to figure out who their mom was. Still, for everybody else, how long will it be before social networks start charging people to have their profiles deleted? How long will it be before YouTube decides to hit the self-destruct button because so many people are talking to their cameras instead of to each other? I\u2019d like to conclude this post by singing some songs about our love affair with social networks. If you scroll to the end of the reading of this post, you\u2019ll hear Mad About You by Hooverphonic and a song by The Sundays\u2019.  Talking to a camera for fun would typically be considered a sign of madness if not done to serve a higher purpose. I am trying to get people to take a look at the books I wrote and I view these videos as practice for more real-world public speaking.. so maybe I\u2019m not mad.. maybe. Maybe madness is not just a cultural construct and the internet has driven all of us off the deep end! ",

            "answer_text": "I use internet all day along while working for Quora and looking up Java code example and explanation from internet. Internet has become a tool for my survival and my best friend that brings me happiness and spiritual food to rely on in this world right now. There is nothing in this world which is 100% perfect. If there is a good side, then there is a bad side. When internet helps us to survive and brinhs us convenience and efficiency, at the same time, it causes concerns and even risks to our life. Internet is a medium for mass communication, what you write in the internet will reach many many people with different political or cultural opinions, attitudes, tastes and preferences. You would never know which single word you write would deeply offend someone and incur the fatal disaster to you or even to your family members or friends. However, if you work on internet and are not genuine and responsible for what you write, you would waste other people\u2019s time and even mislead them to make wrong judgement and conclusions. Therefore, I would say for me, writing the answers for questions on internet is a very very very tough job. I have to be very very careful and also must understand and know what people like and dislike to hear in order to be safe in working on internet. Unfortunately, most of the time, I have no idea what kind of people are reading my answers and how are their responses to them. If someone does not tell me the truth personally, I may never know the truth. Internet is a place where people can get information and learn new things. The thing is that we may never know whether the information we get is 100% correct although Google arrange the order in the search list based on very superior PageRank algorithm. Generally speaking, the generally considered valuable and good quality articles must be valuable ones that deserve our time and efforts to read. However, it is still hard to guarantee that all the data inside of them that can decide people\u2019s views and even affect their decision-making is one hundred percent reliable and trustworthy. Therefore, when I am searching for solutions to my answer, I always try to look for the information given by the well-known authorities such as WHO, US Department of Labor, National Bureau of Statistics, Harvard Medical School, etc. to give to my readers. I am not saying that information from other sources are not reliable. They may also collect data from these authorities. My point is that no one can guarantee that the information is complete correct on internet, even Google itself. We need to be careful and have a good judgement when reading information from internet. No matter how, the information searched from internet can give us a rough idea about what we want to know and expand our horizon. We should keep an attitude of \u201c\u4e0d\u53ef\u4e0d\u4fe1\uff0c \u4f46\u4e5f\u4e0d\u53ef\u5168\u4fe1\u201c - have a critical mind in making a conclusion through reading multiple sources and making multi-sided comparisons. From filling in our information to register an account to watching our favorite shows or movies, we are actually releasing our personal information at every second about preferences. People can use internet to provide these information to the company to make them improve their products so as to suit peoples\u2019 needs and requirements in a more effective and efficient way. Our personal information has been used to make more money by these merchants. If this is not a problem, then our Social Security number, bank card number, PIN number and the three digit security number on the back of our credit card can be recorded and utilized by others when we make the payment. Isn\u2019t this a serious problem that has already posted a risk to the safety of our financial condition? Online learning through the internet using Zoom meets, Google Hangouts and other video conferencing tools has a problem of mutual communication. When sitting in the classroom, we can ask the teacher questions related to the content right away by raising our hands. Through the facial expression and non-verbal communication cues, teachers can know their teaching and students learning effects right away so as to adjust the pace and teaching materials in a timely fashion. However, through internet, it is hard to do that although there are some software apps that can record the data about the engagement rate. Internet teaching and learning would never replace the classroom environment completely. Internet communication has always been a problem in deepening the mutual understanding among people. As we all know, internet of things are the physical devices that can collect and exchange data through the embedded software, sensors and internet connectivity. In healthcare, devices such as wireless blood pressure and blood sugar detectors, pacemakers, insulin pumps, cochlear implants, heart monitoring implants, infusion pumps, remote-controlled thermostats and various wearables and hand-held devices are connected through wireless network to send and receive information. Doctors can use the data to monitor the patients closely and do the data analytics in order to apply decision support rules to allow for earlier intervention in the treatment process. Making these medical devices connect with each other through internet is a dangerous thing from other aspects due to the cyber vulnerability and cyberattack. These interconnected devices can be harnessed by hackers to form a botnet which is an interconnected network infected with malware such as Mirai and Reaper without being detected. It spreads through the flaws in IoT software and hardware and the hackers use them to launch the Denial-of-service attack (DDoS) attacks. Mirai can scan for open telnet ports and attempt log-ins using a preset list of weak credentials to figure out the password. Reaper exploits and forcibly takes over unpatched devices and adds it to the hackers\u2019 command and control center. They can not only access to the patient private data information but also change the data and cause the deadly medical accident. In June 2015, Billy Rios, a security researcher in the Department of Homeland Security and his colleagues successfully hacked into the insulin pump and remotely administer a lethal dose of drugs surreptitiously.  (http://file:///C:/Users/Sophy/Downloads/Security_and_Privacy_Issues_with_IoT_in_Healthcare.pdf) In wannaCrypt ransomware cyberattack in 2017, at least 45 the National Helath Service(NHS) in hospital groups across the United Kingdom were taken offline. The ransomware attacks exploit a known software flaw called EternalBlue. This Windows flaw is one of many zero-days leaked by the Shadow Brokers hacking collective. The telephone network and IT system services were greatly disrupted. The routine outpatient appointments were forced to be cancelled. The switchboard in hospitals were affected and the ambulances were being diverted to neighbouring hospitals. This is another example.  (DDoS Attacks: In the Healthcare Sector) Other examples of problems associated with internet in medical fields include the vulnerabilities found in two models of hospital respirator and anesthesia machines models 7100 and 7900 manufactured by General Electric (GE). The attackers can send remote commands that can alter devices' settings to post risks to patients. In 2019, an employee of the Montpellier university medical centre in France opened an email containing a virus that infected more than 600 computers. Fortunately, the hospital used its independent internal networks, which prevented the virus from spreading to all of its 6,000 machines. In April 2018, an employee of Independence Blue Cross, an American health insurer, accidentally posted a file containing the personal and medical info of nearly 17,000 patients online. It took two months for the company to detect this human error. Privacy and security associated with internet happen in almost every field and bring loss to our work and daily life, especially in the medical field which is closely related to our human being\u2019s life. Cyber experts suggest to deploy access control to network access for the connected objects themselves. Create a virtual LAN (VLAN) to route traffic through a firewall to segregate the wireless network from the one used for the primary devices, such as laptops, desktops, or smartphones. \"Your fridge and your laptop should not be on the same network,\" the FBI's Portland office said in a weekly tech advice column. \"Keep your most private, sensitive data on a separate system from your other IoT devices,\" it added.  Besides, we can solve the security problem through device authentication by using digital certificates, two-factor authentication, and biometric to ensure that nobody can have unauthorized access to our devices. Internet is like a big cornucopia that contains countless treasures. However, when taking advantage of its benefits, we need to solve the problems associated with it and make it serve us to the maximum degree. Thanks for reading.

            "answer_text": "There are three pain points in the Internet development. First, in the information explosion, the match of the information and the user is not high; Second, the data quality differs greatly; Third, the high concentration of the platforms and their service. The Internet world can be reconstructed by blockchain technology. The problem of the Internet For nearly half a century, human invented computers and the Internet and brought the revolutionary changes to the information carrier and transmission. The Internet has changed the way of recording information and transmission, but it has only changed the carrier of information and has not promoted the value and dissemination of information. The wide application of the Internet technology have transformed many industries, such as information, retail, finances and our daily life. But the Internet has a flow thinking. Data becomes production means, computing is productivity, and the Internet has created a new production relationship that has affected the world. Five companies engage in the Internet among the top 10 companies in the world with the largest market value in 2018. However, the model of joint-stock companies has not changed. The purpose of commercial operations is to create benefits to the shareholders, not for the users on the platform. The origin of the Internet development is to provide a free and fair platform. However, with the development of the Internet, there are many conflicts in the process, such as giant monopoly and data loss. Even if entrepreneurs have made some innovations, they still face the dilemma of being crushed by monopolists. ",
