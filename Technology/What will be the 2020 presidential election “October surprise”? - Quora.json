            "answer_text": "Original Question: What will be the 2020 presidential election \u201cOctober surprise\u201d? Michael, I don't know that we are going to get one, at least not from the candidates or their campaign staffs. With Vice President Joe Biden being the presumptive nominee so early in the process I think all the juicy bits of oppo reasearch will have been used up before we get to October, perhaps even by August. It is going to get nasty, very nasty, and President Trump is certainly a crude and highly aggressive campaigner that doesn't mind getting in the gutter. Both camps have teams or agencies doing all the oppo research imaginable. Just as every one did in 2016 and 2012, etc, etc. But, we have two well known candidates with plenty of public history. I'm confident there isn't very much new at all to blast President Trump with from his past. The Clintons are very effective campaigners, and things like the Steele Dossier are under construction on both sides, but it is hard to find new dirt on old dogs. The Clintons would have used everything they could find in October of 2016, and nothing worked, nothing stuck. The October surprise may very well be that one of the candidates simply keels over. Which will result in an insane mess to name and \u201ccertify\" a new candidate, and then get them on the ballots nationwide. The two things I'm going to be watching this summer are, How well the Coronavirus economic recovery is goingHow well a second round of the virus is being managed or prepared forEconomically we are creating many problems right now on both sides of the aisle. Hell, we have people making double their working wage, from unemployment. Who the hell didn't see that as creating problems. One of my daughters is collecting over $900 a week on unemployment and her husband almost the same. In Tennessee that is an amazingly good wage, plus they aren't paying daycare. That is triple what a lot of people were making working 40 hours a week in dead end jobs. It is going to take an economic crowbar to get these folks back to work any sooner than they possibly can hold out for. It is going to be interesting to see the transition in the campaign as well. \u201cRight now President Trump is running against everyone's idea of a perfect President, in October he will just be running against Joe Biden.\u201d Susann Moy.

We\u2019re in the late stage of the last economic cycle, so maybe the October Surprise will be a big fat recession. Trump has really been infuriating the Chinese with his trade war, so maybe the October Surprise is China sinking an US aircraft carrier in the Formosa Strait. Of course that might start a nuclear war. Surprise! Maybe Trump\u2019s going to dump Melania and marry Stormy Daniels in a beautiful White House ceremony. Oh, the pageantry. Not impossible for a serial adulterer. If he remembers, maybe Trump will announce his Alzheimer\u2019s diagnosis in October 2020, leaving the Republicans effectively without a candidate for president. Super surprise there. This is kind of a long shot, since he probably won\u2019t be that far gone until 2021. Maybe a piece of border wall will fall on Trump during a dedication ceremony. Surprise to Trump too. Stupid low bidders. You can\u2019t trust \u2018em. The problem is that 100 meters of wall just isn\u2019t stable by itself, and that\u2019s all he will get built with funds stolen from other federal pockets. (Actually Trump\u2019s gotten several miles of wall built, though it was scheduled to be built before he took office.) Maybe the October Surprise is something Democrats will never see coming, because it isn\u2019t real. But it will be real to Trump\u2019s base, the ones watching Fox News and reading Breitbart. He can tell whatever story he wants, and a fair number of people will never believe it isn\u2019t true. So, 5,000 miles of wall built, all Democratic congressmen locked up, North Korea surrendering, The UK becoming the 51st state, and Christianity the State Religion. Talk about under-promising and over-delivering! ",

On the other side of the ledger, the collapse of the Collusion narrative has triggered an investigation by the Attorney General which promises to be deeply embarrassing to a wide array of Progressive politicians, bureaucrats and the Progressive media in general. The arrest of Jeffry Epstein and the unraveling of his circle of friends also promises to rip open a huge scandal including human trafficking, influence peddling and perhaps a host of other even less savoury things, If any of this has any connectivity to the Democrat candidate, they are sunk like the Titanic. Even the association of high ranking members or Party officials with Epstein is likely to have a severe negative influence. Unraveling the Imran Awan ring\u2019s penetration of the DNC IT network and the shielding of their access to the network (despite repeated warnings) by then DNC chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz could have a very negative impact, in particular if it is tied to (even by comparison) to the 2014 hack of the White House by Russian hackers or the penetration of the OMB database by the Chinese uncovered in 2015. So the Democrats can wrestle with 1970 issues like school bussing, or making promises that are blatantly against the self interest of middle or working class Americans; positions which already alienate many Americans, meanwhile outside their bubble a veritable tsunami of potential October Surprises exist on the horizon.

            "answer_text": "Well. Trump has had a number of meetings and secret phone calls with Putin, over the last couple of years. Trump has never been forthcoming about what is discussed during these suspicious meetings, so we are completely justified to assume, that among the topics, that they have discussed, is how Putin can help Trump win re-election. We can also assume, that Trump has offered something in return (in a quid pro quo transaction). Trump got away with conspiring with Putin in 2016, because of destroyed communications (page 10, vol one of the Mueller report), because of uncooperative witnesses (Manafort, Roger Stone, Papadoulos), or because certain key witnesses were never interviewed by Mueller (including Trump Sr, Trump Jr., Kushner, Eric Trump, Ivanka Trump, etc.). Robert Mueller Didn\u2019t Finish The Job, And We\u2019ll Never Know Why Robert Mueller Obstructed His Own Investigation As Much as Donald Trump 11 looming questions now that Mueller\u2019s investigation is over Mueller didn\u2019t subpoena Trump\u2019s financial records, in spite of Trump\u2019s decades long dependence on financial support from Russian sources, to prevent financial ruin. Therefore, it is still an open question, whether Trump is a Russian asset. His position as president, makes it more difficult to uncover any conspiracy he may currently be involved in, with Putin. Perhaps the number one reason that Trump has stonewalled oversight investigations by the House, is because he fears that the committees, may uncover the damning evidence, that Mueller\u2019s curiously narrow investigation, was unable to discover. We may never know for certain the extent of Putin\u2019s control over Trump, unless intelligence agencies (ours, or that of our allies) are able to use surveillance, to monitor Trump\u2019s communications. Another possibility, is that Putin may eventually seek to embarrass the US, by eventually releasing recordings of his interactions with Trump, when he no longer regards Trump as a useful idiot. It is supremely important, that steps should be taken to address Russian influence in the 2020 election, or the Russians may succeed in electing Trump again. We as citizens should be vigilant, and report any suspicious activity on social media, or any other signs of Foreign interference. For the time being, I will take advantage of quora\u2019s international reach, and ask that intelligence agencies of our allies, if you are listening, could you please monitor Mr. Trump\u2019s communications with tyrants like Putin? If you discover anything of concern, could you please share that information, with other allied intelligence agencies, and with the FBI? ",

November will be the season finale so I expect to see several good episodes leading up to a cliffhanger that gives us a preview of next season\u2019s attractions.
