            "answer_text": "You can't get a gaming PC for free but you can make it for cheap price Like first buy an old PC which is cheap and has CPU 2 or 4 cores and 2.9ghz or more And check if motherboard has PCIE slots (for graphics card)and check the power supply watts If your memory slot is ddr4 then you are lucky after buying just upgrade 1)graphics card(from1050ti to 1070) you can use amd cards also if it's cheap and good 2)ram(if it's less than 8gb)8gb is enough for gaming 3)storage if necessary 4)power supply if your GPU needs power from power supply because some of them(old graphics card) directly from motherboard.this step is not necessary if your graphics card is 1050 to 1060ti. Don't install expensive part. Only cheap parts. Or buy a console new or secondhand. because it is small and cheap than gaming PC ",
