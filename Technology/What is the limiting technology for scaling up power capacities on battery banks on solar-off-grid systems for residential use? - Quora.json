            "answer_text": "What is the limiting technology for scaling up power capacities on battery banks on solar-off-grid systems for residential use? If what you seek is storage enough for a typical suburban house to be off-grid then \u201ctechnical\u201d limitations really are practical limitations. Our inefficient home used just under 2,000 kWh of electricity last month. For simplicity, lets call that 70 kWh/day. If you expect to be totally off-grid then you need to figure out how long you need to be able to run on battery without any charging. This could be broken wires, your regulator fails, something wrong with batteries, etc. Again for simplicity say five days. Then you need 350 kWh of storage. That\u2019s roughly (converting to battery speak) about 30,000 amp-hours at 12V. (If I did my math right. Feel free to check.) You will be able to cut the size by about a third if you switch to all NiCD, but the cost will skyrocket. A good 8-D golf cart battery will get you 200Ah at 12V. So you need 150 batteries. And then you need to figure out how much acid you\u2019ll need, how often to replace some, what to do with the old cores since you can\u2019t just toss all that lead, and so forth. Most likely you\u2019ll wire them ten in series (to get 120V) and 15 across (to get your current.) That means lots of connections. More importantly you\u2019ll need a way to identify if battery 5X6 is the one that\u2019s not performing. You\u2019ll need to make sure your charge controller is in a fail-over configuration. It\u2019s the sheer scale of maintenance that is the main limit to the current technology. Good progress is being made with new ways of looking at the problem. Graphene, flow batteries, non-acid reactions, and so forth. You might look into complementary technologies too like slowly lifting huge weights to charge and lower them to discharge, or heavy flywheels, or even heating or freezing water. Then you would not need batteries alone. Off-grid residential is a great area to explore possibilities. The right solutions involve a good blending of environmentally sensible techniques. Edit 7/7/20 \u2014 Here\u2019s a great video I just stumbled over that talks about various storage technology. Enjoy.  ",

            "answer_text": "It depends on what you mean by \u201coff-grid\u201d, and what your climate is like. My brother is off-grid in the Colorado mountains, but he heats and cooks with propane, and in the winter he often charges his batteries with a propane generator. That\u2019s not \u201cenergy-independent\u201d it\u2019s just \u201celectric-grid-independent\u201d. He has both solar and wind production and probably 40 kWh of batteries. Our home in Wisconsin is very close to all-electric; heat (and air conditioning) are from a ground-source heat pump, and water heater, dryer, well pump, and cooking are electric. We use about 20 kWh/day in the summer, and over 50 kWh/day in cold weather. We also have a gas furnace that is required to qualify for off-peak pricing on the heat pump, but we use very little gas, usually less than 250 kWh (16 therms) per year. We have solar panels that produce about 45 kWh/day in the summer, and around 20 kWh/day in the winter. The big problem with independence in our climate is seasonal storage. Overall, we produce more than we use in a year, but with a big surplus in the summer and major shortage in the winter. So we would need something like 8 MWh of battery to be independent. That\u2019s industrial-scale, well beyond our budget. Would it be cheaper to dig a huge hole for an insulated water tank, and fill it with hot water during the summer? 10000 liters of water ( little over 2500 gallons) will hold about 11 kWh of heat per degree C. We could heat it to 90C and still have heat down to maybe 40C, so that\u2019s about 550 kWh. You would need a very large tank. You could get another 400 kWh if you extract heat from the tank with a heat pump, but that increases your need for electricity. You could also heat with wood, but that requires a significant amount of forested land (and a fair amount of labor) to be sustainable. Homes can be built for much higher efficiency than our 1970s house, you can cook with an induction stove, minimize your hot-water use, and either hang your laundry or switch to a heat-pump dryer. But there are many areas of the world where there is very little solar energy available during the cold season. So the answer your question ultimately involves detailed information about your home and climate. It can be done in many areas if you build from scratch with a significant budget and a focus on sustainability. ",

Given that there are already utility-scale battery banks in operation, there is (in any practical sense) nothing limiting the technology. We can build residential-scale batteries simply and easily. Bigger power capacity is no problem and has already been demonstrated in practise. We just can\u2019t build them cheaply enough for mainstream residential use, yet. ",
