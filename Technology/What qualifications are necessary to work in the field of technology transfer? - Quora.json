            "answer_text": "A good place to start would be the Association of University Technology Managers organization and their Registered Technology Transfer Professional certification: RTTP Benefits | If you want to get beyond the university and government agency realm, then you can look at the Certified Licensing Professional designation requirements: Certified Licensing Professionals, Licensing Profession,Knowledge and Standards | Certified Licensing Professionals, Inc Some places also like you to have patent agent registration as well, such as The Registration Examination in the US. These certifications aren\u2019t requirements for working in the tech transfer world, obviously. The minimum requirements are that you have a technical background in the IP field in which you will be working, a basic knowledge (or desire to learn) contract and IP law as well as negotiation techniques. A generally calm and even-keeled temperament is also helpful. Hope this helps. ",
