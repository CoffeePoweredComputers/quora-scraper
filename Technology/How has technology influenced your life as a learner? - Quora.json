            "answer_text": "One thing that comes to mind is how easy it is today to find and get information about various topics via internet. You can find tutorials, both written and video, within minutes. Not everything on the web is of good quality, but quite a lot is very useful. When I started as a test engineer in the mid 90s you either had to by a book and study on your own or sign up for a course. Buying a book via the company was a administrative nightmare and if you tried to buy the book yourself you still had to do a special order as the bookstores where I lived didn\u2019t have that many programming books.Stack Overflow didn\u2019t exist back then either. I also did a fair amount of electronic designs and for that you needed datasheets for the IC\u2019s you want to use.In the beginning the only source was the books from vendors like Texas Instrument, Maxim and others. If the department didn\u2019t have the book or it was too old = a nightmare to order one and 2\u20133 weeks waiting time. Later on came callback-fax from Elfa (Swedish component supplier). You called a phone number, typed in your fax number and the article number(s) of the component you wanted and a few minutes later you got a fax with the datasheet. This was sort of a revolution as you could get single datasheets instead of needing the whole book.These days almost everything is available at your fingertips. Just search for a component and download the datasheet. Books can also be bought as e-books which makes it almost instant to get it. So I would say that the biggest change is how easy it is to get information now compared to before the web exploded. Learning with online resources also makes it easier to schedule lessons to when it is convenient for me. You still have to be critical of the source of your information, but who hasn\u2019t had a useless teacher in school? ",

            "answer_text": "I consider myself a student, and will always only consider myself a student. There will never be a day that I can say I\u2019ve \u201cmastered\u201d anything. There is always something more to learn, or perhaps a new way of seeing information I\u2019ve already accumulated. Technology has made it easier than ever to study anything you wish. Excluding an internet connection for a moment, I can store thousands of books on a tablet or phone and take it anymore with me. From textbooks to reference manuals, all in my pocket, wherever I go. A library\u2019s worth of knowledge, in my hand. This same device, can also double as my camera and notebook. Without even connecting to the internet, I have access to as much knowledge as I could ever ask for. Now if we give this device an internet connection, I now have access to anything and everything. The worlds knowledge now sits in my hand. It is easier than it has ever been to learn multiple skills, and approach proficiency in each one. We can now safely say, the possibilities are infinite. It\u2019s unfortunate that my generation (Generation Z) only uses it for Tik Tok. ",
