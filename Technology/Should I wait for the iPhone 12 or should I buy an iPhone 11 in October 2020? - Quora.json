            "answer_text": "Do you need the phone right away (if your old one is broken), get an iPhone 11. If you can wait you should wait for the iPhone 12. Do keep in mind that the iPhone 12 will be priced much higher than the iPhone 11 and also that the 2 most popular online shopping sites are hosting discount sales in 2 weeks from now so you can expect the price of iPhone 11 to drop further, marginally.

I expect the new models to be launched by the second of this month and you should wait to see new iPhones before making a decision. ",
