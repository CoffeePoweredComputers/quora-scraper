They\u2019re totally silent when floating, and make only minimal noise when gliding. They do have a small propeller, which makes some noise, but since it does not need to lift the drone, the power level and the noise are orders of magnitude lower than that of quadcopters. Practically inaudible from a distance of 3m or so, and they look cute.  ",

            "answer_text": "Kind\u2019a. Look for gliders that can use Ardupilot firmware for its flight controller. It has an autonomous soaring mode. If conditions are right, the software will seek and use thermals on its own. That means sustained flight with the engine off. Mostly you\u2019ll have to DIY. It\u2019s not that making and flying acoustically quiet UAV is a secret. It\u2019s just that there\u2019s not much of a demand. ",
