            "answer_text": "Do these apps actually work? We asked Instagram directly if it \u201cwas possible for a third-party app or plugin to offer people a way of seeing exactly who looks at their profile pages.\u201d A spokesperson replied to the Huffington Post UK saying that while they \u201cdon\u2019t comment on specific apps. Our terms of conditions make it clear we don\u2019t support this third party use case.\u201d As these third-party plugins do not actually receive information from Instagram or Facebook directly, it means they are promising customers something that the platforms won\u2019t actually ever share with them. In short, these limitations mean they are going to be pretty useless at giving accurate data on who is checking you out. One of the most popular spy apps, \u2018Who Stalks - Super Spy Pro\u2019, which is available on the iTunes store, even issued its own disclaimer, saying: \u201cSuper Spy Pro are not associated with Instagram in any way. This is a unofficial product and is intended for entertainment purposes only. This app calculates the interaction to your profile, and tries to identify.\u201d But it isn\u2019t just their questionable functionality that users should be worried about.  ",

            "answer_text": "I really would like to know that myself. I really don\u2019t care about Instagram. If someone posts selfies of themselves up on Instagram all day\u2026they really shouldn\u2019t be upset if SOMEONE they don\u2019t know see\u2019s the pictures too. Most people on Instagram enjoy the attention of having strangers like the pics. I have an account and I hardly post anything. When I do it is decent, generic, pictures. No one is going to stalk mine that is for sure. I think it is slightly on the boring side but hey\u2026I don\u2019t post anything \u201ccontroversial.\u201d The internet is creepy at times and while there are stalkers out there\u2026if they are in a foreign country (like Europe) who really cares? The only way it would become scary is if I get phone calls, or letters. That is pretty scary. I have heard about \u201cInstagram Stalker Apps\u201d but they are there to get attention. If they tell you \u201cyou have a stalker!\u201d Then what? Big deal? What would you do to the person who is looking at your pictures? Remember, you posted them yourself. Just delete some of the pics if they are too private for random strangers to see. ",

            "answer_text": "Instagram never shares information like who have been visiting your profile, it only shares the number of profile visits for business pages and thus it is very unlikely for a 3rd party app or \u201cstalker\u201d app to be able to access such information in a legal way so I don\u2019t think such apps actually work. Some apps can only tell you who are your \u201ctop fans\u201d maybe, based on the number of likes and comments they make on your posts but definitely not who have been stalking you. ",

Instagram does not share this kind of data. But it is possible to find out who hides their stories from you and also you can watch others\u2019 stories anonymously, if you are interested in these features, I can recommend you one of our businesses (Check out our website or Android App). In order to prove, you can easily ask the person who hide his/her story from you and check if this information is true. Also you can find out story, profile, media insights by using the app. Stay safe! ",
