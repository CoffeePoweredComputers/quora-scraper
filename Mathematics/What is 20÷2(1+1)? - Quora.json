            "answer_text": "I initially was confident the answer was 20, but now I understand why the answer is 5. The reason I got it wrong at first was because I didn\u2019t understand the weird way brackets work: I thought that 20\u00f72(1+1) could be written as 20\u00f72x(1+1) and mean the exact same thing but type those 2 things into a calculator and you get different answers Now I think about it though, it makes sense that 2(1+1) behaves differently to 2x(1+1): When you do algebra like 10\u00f75y, if you were to find that y=2 you would naturally say that 10\u00f75y = 1 because you wouldn\u2019t think of it as 10\u00f75x2 (that would equal 4), you should really be thinking of it as 10\u00f75(2) which gives 1 as expected It seems that bodmas should really have an extra letter in it. The extra letter should go: bo(here)dmasThis extra letter is for this special situation where multiplication occurs BEFORE division occurs: When there is a number attached to the brackets, like 2(1+1) ",

            "answer_text": "I always learned (and taught) the order of operations in this manner: 1. Parentheses2. Exponents3. Multiplication and division (Left to Right)4. Addition and subtraction (Left to Right) In the case of 20/2(1+1) we would first solve for the parentheses: 20 / 2 (1+1) = 20 / 2 (2) Then solve for multiplication and division in the order they appear left-to-right, as there are no exponents in this equation. 20 / 2 (2) = 10 (2) = 20 This is the first I\u2019m hearing of \u201cdivision before multiplication\u201d as some are claiming PEDMAS and BODMAS dictate. Multiplication is reverse division (and vice versa) just as subtraction is the addition of negative numbers, so dictating a difference in order dependent upon whether a number is divided or multiplied is nonsensical.
