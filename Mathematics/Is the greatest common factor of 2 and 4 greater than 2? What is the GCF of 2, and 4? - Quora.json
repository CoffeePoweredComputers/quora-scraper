            "answer_text": "First of all, when we are discussing \u201cnumbers\u201d and their factors, we mean \u201cnatural numbers.\u201d The natural numbers are the counting numbers starting at 1.1,2,3,4,\u22ef1,2,3,4,\u22efNo fractions allowed! One number is a factor of another when the first number divides into the second number with no remainder. Every number is a factor of itself.All of the other factors are smaller than the number. A common factor of two (or more) numbers is a number that divides both of them (or all of them) with no remainder. It is a factor that they share, a factor that they have in common. The factors of 6 are 1, 2, 3, and 6.The factors of 9 are 1, 3, and 9. The common factors of 6 and 9 (the factors that they share) are 1 and 3. Now to your first question: Is the greatest common factor of 2 and 4 greater than 2? No number has a factor that is larger than itself, so the greatest common factor of 2 and 4 cannot be greater than 2.Answer: No. The greatest common factor of 2 and 4 is not greater than 2.Now your second question: What is the GCF of 2 and 4? \u201cGCF\u201d stands for Greatest Common Factor.The factors of 2 are 1 and 2.The factors of 4 are 1, 2, and 4.The greatest factor they share is 2.So the GCF of 2 and 4 is 2.Answer: 2",

GCF means Greatest Common factor..So, no factor of 2 can be greater than 2 2 has only two factors (1 and 2) so the GCF of 2 and any number can not be greater than 2 GCF Of 2 and any even number is always 2 Therefore,GCF of 2 and 4 is 2 ",
