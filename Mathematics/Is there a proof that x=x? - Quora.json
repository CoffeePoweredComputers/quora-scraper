            "answer_text": "It's a principle of logic as much as anything. When you've got a concept like equality, you have certain preconceptions about it that you would never consider abandoning. And this is one of them.  If you had a binary relation that didn't relate each thing to itself, you wouldn't call it equality, and you wouldn't use =, the sign of equality. There are four principles of equality that logicians and mathematicians agree upon. Reflexivity: Each thing x is equal to itself, x = xSymmetry: The order that you say two things are equal in immaterial, that is, if x = y, then y = x.Transitivity: Things that are equal to each other are equal, that is, if x = y and y = z, then x = z.Substitution: Things that are equal have the same properties, so that if x = y, and some property P holds for x, then P holds for y, in particular, for any function f, f(x) = f(y).Some other relations besides equality satisfy the first three principles, and they're called equivalence relations. At the level of symbolic logic, these four principles are usually explicitly stated in the rules of logic.  In mathematics, they're assumed along with all the other rules of logic. So, if you're looking for a proof that x = x, look in an introductory exposition on symbolic logic. ",
