            "answer_text": "Probability of selecting any two fuses is 20C2 = 190. Now as said, there are 5 defective fuses in box out of 20 fuses. So to select two defective fuses, we have to pick 1 defective fuse (that means 5C1) and then other defective fuse(now 4 defective are left so 4C1). Therefore probability is = 5C1.4C1/20C2 = 5*4/190 .\u2022. Probability = 2/19. I hope that you have got your answer and understood it \ud83d\ude0a\ud83d\ude09. ",
