            "answer_text": "The absolute value ( | | ) of a real number x is its distance (unsigned) from zero on the number line and is defined as follows: | x | = x if x \u2265 0 (Example: | 5 | = 5, i.e., 5 is a distance of 5 units from zero) | x | = -x if x < 0 (Example: | -5 | = -(-5) = 5, i.e., -5 is a distance of 5 units from zero) Therefore, the absolute value of -10 = |-10 | = -(-10) = 10 This result tells us that -10 is a distance of 10 units from zero on the number line.
