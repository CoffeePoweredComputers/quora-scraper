            "answer_text": "Hi guys, here we are having a simple pattern problem that we need to resolve. As we can understand from the pattern that: 1+1=5 Multiplying 1 by 5 one time. 2+2=20 Multiplying 2 by 5, two times and adding those numbers. 3+3=45 Multiplying 3 by 5, three times and adding those numbers. So, It's nothing but the square of the number(Multiplying the same numbers) in the question with 5. Hence we got our final solution as: 4+4=80 i.e. 4*4=16, and then 16*5=80. So, we got our final result of 4+4 as 80. ",

            "answer_text": "Here, we can see a pattern. In the first case, the number being added to itself is 1. So, we multiply 1 by one time 5. So, 1\u00d75=5 Similarly in the second case, the number being added to itself is 2. Here, since the number is 2, we multiply 2 with two times 5 [I.e. 10]. So 2\u00d710=20. Similarly, we multiply 3 by three times 5 [25]. 3\u00d715=45. So the value of 4+4 would be, 4 multiplied by four times 5 [20]. So 4\u00d720=80 [There are many ways to explain this pattern but the answer is the same] ",
