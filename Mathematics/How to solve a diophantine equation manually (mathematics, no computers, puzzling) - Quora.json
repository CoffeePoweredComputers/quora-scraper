The short answer is that there is no general approach to solving all Diophantine equations. We can generally solve Diophantine equations of 1st and 2nd degree, but there is no general solution to any Diophantine equations of higher order. There are some common methods - if you can find a unique factorization domain, you can use a variant of the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic to get some nice results, for example. ",
