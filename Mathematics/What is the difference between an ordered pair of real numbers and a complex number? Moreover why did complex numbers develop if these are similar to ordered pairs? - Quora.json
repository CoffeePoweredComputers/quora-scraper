            "answer_text": "Considered as sets, ordered pairs of real numbers and complex numbers are the same. Complex numbers, however, have additional structure that the mere set of ordered pairs does not have. Specifically, the complex numbers have an algebraic structure, which (roughly) tells us how exactly the elements of the set can be combined (using addition and multiplication) to obtain other elements of the set. If you take away that structure, it is no longer, strictly speaking, the complex numbers. It is just an unstructured set of ordered pairs. We can illustrate this distinction with a simpler example: the natural numbers. As a mere set, the natural numbers are simply an infinite collection of distinct elements. The elements are not ordered in any particular way. It is just an infinite multiplicity of things. But our notion of natural numbers is more than this. It is not just a set of things. To make this set into the natural numbers, we need to put the elements in order. We can do this by selecting one element as the first one, and another as the second one, and so on. So, we have an initial element, and the rule that every element has a unique next element. So now we have added some structure to the set, so it is no longer just a set. It is a set with a linear order. It is now the natural numbers. Strip this structure away, and one has a countably infinite unstructured set. When talking about the natural numbers, we often implicitly assume it also has more structure than a linear order. We often assume it also has operations of addition and multiplication. In this case, the additional structure makes the natural numbers into a Semiring. We need this structure to study the interesting properties of numbers such as which numbers are prime. A mere set, stripped of all structure, does not have prime elements. Similarly, the mere set of ordered pairs does not have all the interesting properties that the complex numbers have. It is the structures we add to sets that makes them interesting. ",

            "answer_text": "An ordered pair or real numbers is a representation. It can be used to represent two-dimensional vectors, binary relations between real numbers, functions from real number to real numbers, complex numbers, \u2026 When specifying operations for addition and multiplication, the representation can indeed be used to represent complex numbers. However, there are other representations, such as the form [math]a + bi[/math], or [math](\\rho, \\theta)[/math] (specifying modulus and argument; essentially using polar coordinates instead of Cartesian coordinates to represent the point in the Argand plane). For some tasks, some representations will make things easier. Sometimes we even get new insights from using a different representation, or switching between different representations in the middle of a derivation. The important thing to note here is that a representation of something is not that thing. To quote the great Belgian painter Rene Magritte: \u201cCeci n\u2019est pas une pipe.\u201d (\u201cThis is not a pipe\u201d), meaning: a painting of a pipe is not really a pipe. Likewise, an ordered pair of real numbers is not a complex number, although it can be used to represent one. ",
