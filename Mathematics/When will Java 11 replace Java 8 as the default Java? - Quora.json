            "answer_text": "I don\u2019t know that the word \u201cdefault\u201d is the right term. If you try to download Java, you\u2019ll be presented with Java 11, for example. In terms of adoption, however, there are still many companies using Java 7 for example. This is because companies are influenced by two major forces when deciding to upgrade or not: 1) The cost to upgrade and test enterprise applications to the newest version, 2) the risks of not upgrading. (New language features do not figure prominently in the minds of decision makers.) Until now, the cost of upgrading has been too high compared to the risks. Now, Oracle had announced the end-of-life of Java at the end of 2018 but has recently pushed that date back to 2020. This means that free security updates will be provided until then so the risks of not upgrading will remain low compared to the costs. Long story made short: adoption of newer versions will remain soft until Java 8 is no longer freely supported by Oracle. ",

            "answer_text": "Java 8 had a high adoption rate due to some new and anticipated language features. Java 9+ has been as much about reducing technical debt and making the platform more maintainable as adding new features. This improves the future of Java but isn\u2019t as easy to get excited about. With the faster, six monthly release cycle, you will see applications running on a range of versions from Java 11 to 17 (The next Long Term Support release) and between them they will be more popular than Java 8, but I think it will take a long time before there is one version more widely used than Java 8. I think by the time Java 17 has been in use for a year, that version will be more popular than Java 8. That is four years away. I suspect Java 11 alone won\u2019t ever be more widely used than Java 8. ",
