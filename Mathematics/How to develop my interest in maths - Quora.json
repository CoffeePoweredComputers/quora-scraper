            "answer_text": "This question is gonna be my one of the favorite :) Do you know all my life i had one fear in me that is of mathematics. My parents and relatives wherever i go, everyone used to say me mathematics is extremely tough subject. And from the fourth - fifth class i believed that yes i can't do mathematics and i will fail in this subject. As i grew this fear keeps on increasing because whenever i face this subject either i skip the classes or i used to cheat. You won't believe i used to by heart almost every questions and their answers including all the steps and write exactly in the exams, this is how i used to get passing marks in mathematics till my class 10th. It was my belief that i can do any subject, i can by heart any book you give me but i can't do mathematics. And because of that i thought i can't fight government exams because every exam include some maths in it. One fine day i started to fight against my false belief and start questioning myself why can't i? Is there anytime in my life i had given one single try to understand mathematics? Answer was no. That day itself i decided i don't want to do anything but destroy that belief and i did. It was really hard for me when i faced mathematics after these many years, i bought RS aggarwal book and start solving it, i was again doing the same mistake which i was used to do in school that is seeing answers and copying them in solution just to satisfy i had done this, then i asked myself this is how you are going to improve? I keep on solving without seeing solution, and start getting something that feeling was really awesome. You won't believe i solved percentage chapter for one and half month continously , and after sometime i realized i was able to make my own so called tricks and shortcuts. Mathematics is as transparent as water, it's just that you have to practice it without fail till you don't get right answer. Just have some patience and don't see solution try 100 times for the single problem if you have to, you will surely get everything you want just believe in yourself and start practicing. Never be ashamed of asking problems to your teachers, not matter how small the problem is just ask it. Don't do the same mistake which i had done in my school time. Best of luck :) ",

            "answer_text": "First and foremost, mathematics is interesting all by itself. Check out some YouTube videos from Numberphile and VSauce. I think those will give you interesting things to think about. The importance of maths: Everything you use came about because we have maths. Phones, computers, cars, etc. But honestly, that\u2019s the boring stuff. Being reasonably skilled in mathematics opens up a lot of interesting things. Engineers, physicists, chemists, biologists: They all have one thing in common. They\u2019re reasonably good at math (at least computations). I think the most important thing about math though, is that it teaches you discipline and critical thinking skills. There are multiple studies that suggest that practicing math makes you \u201csmarter\u201d, because it sharpens your mind and helps you be more analytic. To develop the skills, simply do it. Start with numbers. Add, subtract, divide, multiply. Do them in your head, too! Once you\u2019ve mastered arithmetic (make sure you read a little about set theory too), you can learn about Geometry and Algebra. Once you\u2019ve mastered these things, you can learn Calculus. Calculus is about as far as the careers above I mentioned will go (There is some linear algebra dabbled in as well). You can certainly go well beyond Calculus, as everything up to this point is largely computational mathematics. To get to the good stuff, you\u2019ve got to go farther. Beyond Calculus lies things like abstract algebra, real analysis, number theory, set theory, complex analysis, combinatorics, graph theory, algebraic geometry, applied mathematics, etc. The list goes on for quite a while, but gets a little less broad the farther you venture into more specialized areas. Think of mathematics like a spiral of knowledge. The really good stuff is on the inside, but to get there, you\u2019ve got to ride the spiral down to the center. On your way down, you\u2019ll learn all the basics. The more you ask \u201cWhy\u201d and find answers to those questions, the more you\u2019ll learn and love mathematics. It\u2019s really quite beautiful. ",

Maybe you don\u2019t like it because you feel like you\u2019re not very good at it. Maybe you don\u2019t see the point of understanding it. Maybe you come from a species of super intelligent beings and our Earth math is just too low level for you, causing boredom. Each of these differences would require a different type of answer. I would want to know what level of math you were in. Are you a geometry student who is doing proofs for the first time and they\u2019re giving you trouble because you don\u2019t like thinking the problems through? An algebra student who is not doing well with factoring polynomials? I would want to know what you think math is. Whether you see it as a collection of formulas or if you are starting to grasp that math is the language we can understand the universe with? I would want to know if you understood that we could use math to accurately describe something as predictable as the swinging of a pendulum or the path of a projectile, or as complicated as the shape of a flower or the rocks at the Giant\u2019s Causeway? There are a lot of reasons people don\u2019t like math. Sometimes people don\u2019t see the point of it, sometimes people don\u2019t get how to do it, sometimes people don\u2019t know how weird the world outside their window is and don\u2019t know they can explore that weirdness. People tend to turn off those educational inputs that challenge them or make them feel small, they also tend to turn off to those inputs that are presented to them badly. Try to figure out what it is about math that you don\u2019t like. It\u2019s such a broad field, it\u2019s in just about everything. Math is the language the universe speaks in. I would encourage you to get curious about it. There\u2019s a lot of universe out there, surely there\u2019s one corner of it you want to grasp better. ",

            "answer_text": "You cannot force yourself to love anything. It comes only when it comes. If you want to understand the love of math, it must come from the need to question certain things. For one, someone who loves math must hate mathematics instruction, always wanting to know why people are telling us that certain things work. A passionate mathematician starts their math instruction questioning everything they are taught, because \u201cIt\u2019s not enough to just be told all of this.\u201d Any answer along the lines of, \u201cIt just is!\u201d from a teacher should anger the student and put the student into a rage of proofs and analysis until he can come back with rational arguments for every question the student may have. Yes, you may be young and not have learned all of the prerequisites to fully understand why addition is commutative, but if you really want to be passionate about math, these are the exact questions that should keep you up at night.  Being a passionate mathematician is all about questioning authority. It\u2019s not the kind of anti-authoritarianism that most people talk about, being obstinate just for the sake of being obstinate, but instead being investigative, just for the sake of being investigative. In this regard, it\u2019s understandable why there were so many mathematicians that have been philosophers for so much of history. For me, it was finally asking the question: \u201cwhy are any two things equal?\u201d that led me to Type Theory, which I use all the time in programming. Hint: the answer is \u201cbecause we say so\u201d, but I leave it to the reader to understand why this is both absolutely correct, and also exactly the phrase that should drive you nuts at the same time!  Finally, you need to understand that what you are learning in school is not math, it\u2019s computation. This makes it so difficult to love math. This is exactly because there are 3 types of people learning mathematics in school: mathematicians, those who will use it to compute, and those who are doing it for mathematical literacy only. People have different interests in the world, and a spectrum of enjoyment with regards to mathematics also varies between individuals. However, I\u2019d like to suggest that it\u2019s possible you will be one of those people precisely because you are asking this question. It\u2019s the realization that you are not motivated, but you are motivated to be motivated, and that can lead to the actual motivation you are after. ",

            "answer_text": "The first time I was more seriously exposed to Math was in middle school with Euclidian geometry. We started off with a set of simple axioms that seemed very obvious and built up to statements that were far from obvious. Our professor was patient, kind and inspired in us a sense that we were in some way pursuing truth. At the beginning the truths were not so impressive or profound looking since they could be easily inferred from the axioms. But later on, our professor challenged us with problems that you really had to put some thought in, approach things differently, and see the problem in a novel way. I finally found what creativity meant in mathematics. Creativity for me means to see something in a novel way, beyond simply applying some pre-assigned rules. It\u2019s sort of a jump in thought, where the thought process is no longer linear but experiences a discontinuity. In any pursuit you can be more or less constrained. To convey an artistic, scientific, mathematical message, or life advice, or any kind of information, you are constrained. Mostly you are constrained by reality, which takes the form of physical laws or common sense principles. Take a piece of writing that should offer a piece of advice (like plenty here on Quora). Can the anwers to a question be multiple? Sure, but as long as the reader wants to take into account the social realities in which we live in, offer a reasonable opinion and be genuinely helpful, there are certain hard constraints that go into the writing. But each time, a Quora response can offer the same line of reasoning as many answers before, yet have something unique and novel about it. Every work of quality has certain constraints associated with it. Art is at one end of spectrum, with arguably very few constraints, but even then to make a work of art that can connect to as many people, one is confronted with - yes, you guessed it- constraints. Within a certain branch of thought there\u2019s really something like a ratio of how many constraints there are versus how free you are to do something novel. In Euclidian geometry, you can start with 5 logical statements which give you the constraints, namely any false statement will actually contradict one of your axioms. The fact that you can construct such a beautiful edifice starting from the 5 axioms is testimony to the beauty of Math. If you want to learn Math, the real Math not the one taught in American schools, you could start with Euclidian geometry like I did or with Analysis. Once you understand how to be creative within the constraints of Mathematics, you will stop hating it, and it will leave a mark on you, just like it did on me. ",

But then one day, my math teacher taught me this philosophy. \"You need to get math to love you, not you to love it\" I think that this philosophy can actually be applied to anything! what did I do : * Had an excellent teacher who explained it well . * Don't be frightened of looking stupid and asking and asking and asking ........ for help until you understand (Children, adults, teachers, online maths help, different maths books etc) as all will explain in a different way and one of them clicks), * Make your own notes in a revision book with examples to help you remember and constantly revise as it all is relevant to something else and the ability to recall easily really helps. (End of day revision easier too) * Think of ways to help you remember. Find what helps you to remember even if nothing to do with Maths. * Do stacks of examples and revision papers, (you will find you are beginning to get examples cropping up you have seen before, or can be easily transferred and addresses your solving maths problems in advance). * Find an aspect you really enjoy which for me was algebra, so do that as a bit of light relief which also builds confidence as you are usually getting something right, * Rip your text book up, punch hole and treasury tag so you can always have a chapter in your bag to work on in an odd five minutes waiting for the bus * Don't do too many questions without checking answers as if wrong you clearly haven't understood and need to go back. Often it is helpful to work back from the answer to help sort out how to do the question, and if you really can't get one answer get someone to check the answer is correct - I discovered quite a few errors that way after hours of blood sweat and tears! In the end it becomes more than trying to do homework, they are puzzles in the same way as doing a crossword puzzle. ]You become obsessed, fascinated, excited and a maths sad rather than maths petrified. All the very best. Been there, done it and achieved hope some of the above helps you too. ",

            "answer_text": "Mathematics is one of the tough subjects for students who fear it the most.None the less i will suggest you some tips which will help you develop interest in Mathematics. 10 Tips to make math an interesting subject: 1.Practice, Practice & More Practice: It is impossible to study maths properly by just reading and listening. To study maths you have to solve some problems. The more you practice answering math problems, the better you get. 2. Review Errors: When you\u2019re practicing with these problems, it\u2019s important to work through the process for each solution. If you have made any mistakes, you should review them and understand where your problem-solving skills let you down. 3. Master the Key Concepts: Do not try to memorize the processes. This is counter-productive. It is much better and rewarding in the long-run to focus on understanding the process and logic that is involved. This will help you understand how you should approach such problems in the future. 4. Understand your Doubts: Sometimes you can get stuck trying to solve part of a maths problem and find it difficult to move on to the next stage. It\u2019s common for many students to skip this question and continue on to the next. You should avoid doing this and instead spend time trying to understand the process of solving the problem. 5. Create a Distraction Free Study Environment: Mathematics is a subject that requires more concentration than any other. A proper study environment and a distraction free area could be the determining factor when solving complex equations or problems in geometry, algebra or trigonometry! 6. Create a Mathematical Dictionary: Mathematics has specific terminology with a lot of vocabulary. We suggest you create Notes or Flashcards with all the concepts, terminology and definitions you need to know. You should include their meanings, some key points and even some sample answers so you can consult them at any time and recap. 7. Apply Maths to Real World Problems: As much as possible, try to apply real-world problems when approaching maths. Maths can be very abstract sometimes so looking for a practical application can help change your perspective and assimilate ideas differently. 8. Review Old Tests and Classroom Examples: The work you do in class, for homework, and on quizzes can offer clues to what your midterm or final exam will look like. Use your old tests and class work to create a personal study guide for your upcoming exam. Look at the way your teacher frames questions \u2013 this is probably how they will appear on your test. 9. Use Study Guides For Extra Practice: Use study guides for standardized exams, such as the ACT, SAT, or DSST, to brush up on old material. Study guides usually come equipped with thorough explanations of how to solve a sample problem, and you can often find free ones online. 10. Learn to Work By the Clock: This is a popular study tip for people taking timed exams; especially standardized tests. If you only have 40 minutes for a 100-point test, then you can optimally spend 4 minutes on each 10-point question. Get information about how long the test will be and which types of questions will be on it. Then plan to attack the easier questions first, leaving yourself enough time to spend on the more challenging ones.

I feel this piece of quote gives the best explanation to what drives mathematicians to work on mathematics.  You need to create curiosity for mathematics. See some mathematical documentaries or math related movies. Explore various fields in mathematics.  If you are a high school student, look into books that are in bachelor level Mathematics. For instance, if you already know calculus, start reading Real Analysis or maybe read Abstract Algebra.  Try to understand the theorems presented in your own way. Question every part of the proof, remove some hypothesis from theorem statements and see what fails, develop intuitive understanding of the ideas behind the proof. Also, try to present your understanding to someone who is curious about mathematics. When you do these things on your own you start enjoying the taste of mathematics, it makes you sharp, you learn to give precise mathematical arguments and more importantly you will learn as how to think.  It is important to understand that pure mathematics is way too far from writing down ugly equations and manipulating them. It relies more on logic and has its own intrinsic beauty deeply buried within her. Its left to you as how much you explore her. :) ",

            "answer_text": "First of all, I\u2019d like to point out the obvious- this is a highly opinionated question. Not everyone finds Maths interesting. Even if they do, it can be for different reasons. However, I\u2019ll answer this question by explaining why I personally find maths interesting. Maths is my favorite subject for 2 main reasons: It\u2019s Logical- Every thing we do in math follows a logic. This means that if you follow the steps of the solution to a problem, you too can arrive at the solution. Moreover, there is almost always more than one way to arrive at the right answer. You won\u2019t have to memorize anything.Now, some of you may argue that we have to memorize the formulas and theorems involved. Let me clarify that we chose to memorize these formulas and theorems. There\u2019s always the alternate route of arriving at the theorem/ formula yourself if you comprehend the concepts involved. But this will take a lot of time- probably too much time. So we choose the easy way out of just memorizing these formulas and theorems that have been proven by great souls. It\u2019s everywhere- Every action of ours can be linked back to math some way or the other. Right from simple tasks like budgeting and time management, to more specific tasks like measurements involve math. If you think about it, you\u2019ll realize that Math is ultimately just a science that we as a society adhere to organize ourselves.",

            "answer_text": "There are many ways to learn to love math, some of which are based on the perspective of each individual. There are also some tips to keep in mind if you want to experience a personal yearning and love for the subject. These tips are ideas that I've used to help myself enjoy math more, even though I've always enjoyed it to start with (maybe because my father is a retired math teacher with 30+ years of experience :P). \u2022 Understand it. To be able to truly appreciate math for what it's worth, you'll want to learn the basic principles of how it works, and where it can be applied both theoretically and in the real world. An enthusiastic and intelligent math teacher can make a big difference for this one! \u2022 Look for the countless mathematical patterns that can be found everywhere you go, and in everything you do. These patterns are always there, but if you don't make an effort to observe them, they won't be automatically apparent to you. The most obvious embodiment of math in our surrounding environment is through shapes and their patterns. These patterns can become especially fascinating when you think about concepts that are hard to grasp. For example, say that you want to get from point A to point B. You travel half the distance. Then you travel half the distance from that point (1/4 of the total distance). Then you travel halfway again (1/8 of the total distance), and again, and again, etc. In theory, you could go on infinitely like that and never get to your destination. Simililarly, this can be visualized by the corner of a triangle, which also goes on infinitely. \u2022 Make your own mathematical theories. You don't have to be Einstein to think up your own crazy concepts, even if you think they aren't valid. Sometimes, just thinking about the possibilities math offers can get the neurons in your brain firing, and you'll soon be awestruck at how simple and fun math can be. \u2022 Don't think of it as work. Our education system has a habit of assigning students a lot of homework. This can lead to resentment toward any given subject, and it even caused me to think I might dislike math while I was in high school. Learning should be fun, but it's hard to make homework look fun, especially when you don't understand it. Mistakes are an important part of learning, and if you are able to go at your own pace, it can be a lot more interesting and a lot less grueling. Think of it as a fun experiment, like a hands-on lab in science class. \u2022 Talk to math majors. Once you start up a math conversation with a math major, there's no stopping! They'll go on forever... And the result will probably an increased interest in all areas of math. They will say things you never thought of, and that will cause you to think about all the possibilities and all the theories out there. \u2022 Watch YouTube videos about theoretical math. There are tons of videos out there that will amaze you! VSauce is one of my favorites, he makes math (and science) very very lovable. This tip is probably the easiest one :) Hopefully these tips will help you learn to love math! It really is amazing, because it describes how our world works and how WE work. The possibilities with math are endless and there are less rules than you think! ",

            "answer_text": "I hated math up until 9th grade in school. My family has always viewed me as a very creative person. I enjoy drawing, painting, making dream catchers, and other creative things. It came as quite a shock when I decided to be a double math major since I hated math for the majority of my life. I stopped hating math in 9th grade because of a great teacher I had. Typically when someone makes learning math fun, that\u2019s when the slightest interest will spark. It is very hard to make math interesting and exciting because, as you said, the answer already exists and creativity is limited. I found myself loving math in 12th grade when I was taking pre-calculus and AP Statistics. My love for math stemmed from pre-calculus because it involves graphs, shapes, and other visuals. The more you learn about how math affects the world, the more you realize how creative it actually can be. There are many creative ways math can be used in the real world, and also many creative ways to find the same solution. (As a side note: there is an app called grapher that will graph many different shapes in 2D and 3D. Very interesting to look at. Just look up some equations to type in and explore.) I\u2019ve noticed that algebra tends to be the \u201cleast creative\u201d and also the most difficult for me to love. I find that it is very repetitive and boring. As someone who considers themselves in touch with their left and right brain, understanding calculus might make math easier for you to love. Overall, don\u2019t push it on yourself. People find their own passions and love for things. If you can find a way to love math, good for you! If not, do what makes you happy and what you love. ",

            "answer_text": "High School math is essentially boring. And in most textbooks, it is decidedly cut from reality and nature. The good news is that it gets much more interesting after that. It is a language, it is a way to communicate. It is the most powerful instrument on earth. I am now reading Love and Math by Edward Frenkel. It is a lovely book that you should read. To me, the easiest way to be interested in math is through statistics. You cannot understand what is going in your life without stats. Where does your money go? Is it better to take a job in Atlanta or in Los Angeles? What is your standard of living? How is your health? How do you understand vaccination? How come there is so much difference in obesity between states of the US?  Fascinating, isn\u2019t it? It tells you something about the power of local culture. This comes from simple math with a lot of power. Here is a good book without any formula, that makes you understand all the hows and whys: Naked Statistics by Charles Wheelan. Easy as pie. I have heroes, such as a man called Bayes. I never went to London without doing two things: I go to the cholera pump on Broad Street (see why at 1854 Broad Street cholera outbreak - Wikipedia) and I go, like many people, reflect on the tomb of Bayes. (see Bayesian probability - Wikipedia): how can you predict an outcome with not much information? And this is only a tiny tiny tiny part of what math can do to improve your life. Then it explains the universe. ",

Then square the result: 55\u22175555\u221755 What is interesting about it? Well, 55\u221755=302555\u221755=3025  IIII Let\u2019s say we have a triangle abcabc like the first one on top left:  Now complete it with another same size triangle cdecde. Now if a=1a=1 and b=1b=1 thend=1d=1 and e=1e=1. Thus d+e=2d+e=2. With me so far? Cut cdecde into two smaller triangles. Thus f+h=1f+h=1 and g+i=1g+i=1. Right? Repeat this:j+l+n+p=1j+l+n+p=1and k+m+o+q=1k+m+o+q=1. Still same. Go on until the smaller white triangles become infinitely small. That is, now we can see at the limit (when they become so small as to almost disappear) the length is no longer 22, but c=1.41c=1.41 ! :)  IIIIII In case you think mathematics is all about numbers and shapes, let\u2019s try to undo that myth. Someone says to you: \u201cTrust me, I\u2019m lying.\u201d. What should your reaction be? If you trust them, then you have to distrust them. If you distrust them, then you have to trust them! Mathematics is ultimately about logic, with the special case that it has certain limits. Once it exceeds those limits, logic fails. So meaning that logic is not 100% failure-proof. Fascinating!  My point in the three examples is to demonstrate that mathematics is a better, clearer and more efficient way of thinking in terms of grand ideas, and secondarily it is also an applied toolset for the intelligent. Isn\u2019t that attractive enough? Best, Jan ",

            "answer_text": "I've multiple times been told by professors that you don't like what you don't understand and you don't understand what you don't like. And I do think that it's true. I used to hate harmonic movement, until I got it. I used to not understand electromagnetic waves, until I started to find it interesting. I used not to understand nor like optoelectronics/photonics, until I gradually built my understanding of and my interest on it. What does all that mean? You probably are looking at maths through a boring looking glass or not from high enough at your skills. Anything can be made boring - even the most interesting topics. And you naturally won't be interested at something you don't understand that well - most of what you see and hear won't make sense to you. I can't tell which is more like you - whether you lack some solider hold on concepts (like me with trigonometry for harmonic movement) or you lack genuine \u201cthis is cool\u201d interest (like me with harmonic movement for waves). TL;DR You likely do need to double check some concepts from previous maths classes/courses. You likely aren't exploring what maths concepts mean on your own either - which is what I particularly find the most interesting about it: you get to learn concepts and decipher how they lead you to certain conclusions. Bonus personal example: Me and my friends at college once studied something called convolution integral. The textbook itself (Lathi) had a small charge showing a group of students protesting against the convolution (with \u201cconvolution stinks\u201d, \u201cmake love, not convolution\u201d signs and all that) at their teacher's room, I think. But we studied it with an awesome teacher who help us get to the meaning of taking the convolution integral of something and found it to be such an amazing tool that we just love it (alright, some practice problems are maybe dull work at times but the subject itself is great) ",

            "answer_text": "I would suggest studying concepts of Calculus ( the concept of a limit in particular). Calculus is all  about the  change. If tou observe the world around you, you'll notice that EVERYTHING is changing in one way or another. Calculus is a tool to study these changes that otherwise would be impossible to describe using only words. Differential equations are a good example of the application of math to the study of change. Only by using Calculus, equations describing the fundamental physics can be obtained. (quick example -> Maxwell's equations ). After understanding the relation of physics to mathematics, how every phenomena can be described by using this tool...you'll be truly fascinated about this instrument mankind uses till this day to study and simulate the unknown. Heck, even such an abstract term as love can be described by math. Check this out : x^2+(y-(x^2)^(1/3))^2=1 - Wolfram|Alpha               :) P.S. Note that this comes from a guy who used to hate math and thought it was boring. When I got into the university I fell in love with Calculus because of it's beautiful concepts that kept expanding my imagination. However, there was a prelude to this. I've started to find math fascinating when I first stumbled upon this ->    also, this ->   The string theory also got me thinking about math differently. The idea that the Universe (maybe even everything beyound it)  can be described mathematically still blows my mind. So I totally encourage you to explore and rediscover mathematics for yourself just as I did. Last note. I think it's safe to say that without mathematics we would not have modern technology. No computers, no smartphones,  no computer games, no internet...NO internet! Imagine that now :)  There's no way you would be reading this message without mathematics. Good luck! ",

            "answer_text": " I think it\u2019s intuitive for teacher. We all know this: We are supposed to connect our content to students\u2019 interests. I was a high school math teacher. Niggling in the back of my mind was how to really hook students into learning the content I was teaching with what they were interested in. It regularly stumped me. Truth is, I never had a student come to class and ask me if today was slope day. You know\u2026 \u201cDr. Smith! Is today the day we learn slope? \u2018Cause I\u2019ve been waiting and waiting and I am so excited to learn the slope formula\u2026\u201d Never happened. So just how do we connect math content with students\u2019 interests? I want to suggest three general methods (there are more) with a few examples at different grade levels (Smith b&c, 2017). Connect students\u2019 hobbies and passions to concepts rather than skills.Sometimes thinking of a hobby that relates to a specific skill can trip us up, but thinking about bigger concepts in which the skill embeds can link to hobbies. For example: Addition and subtraction, which is really about joining and separating in elementary grades, naturally links to collecting things, which most elementary students do.Unit rates in middle school naturally connect with bargain shopping\u2026 and what middle school student doesn\u2019t want to buy something?Polyhedra in high school Geometry can be studied through art and architecture \u2013 especially sculptors, famous skylines, and monuments.These connections can be used to show the usefulness of the skills to be taught, or be the basis for word problems (make them personal and chatty when writing rather than text book-like) or a larger PBL or other assessment project. There was a research study that showed that changing the context of a word problem to something students were interested in (rather than the typical word problems often used), such as shopping, computers, music or cell phones resulted in students learning better, faster, and remembering it four units later! The numbers were not changed from the original problem, only the context. (Walkington, et. al, 2014). These connections can be used to introduce a unit as a teaser, as context problems to intrigue students throughout a unit, or as a formative or summative assessment. Use novelty for a change of pace.Brain research has let us know that we can hook students into content through connections (see point 1), appropriate challenge, and novelty (Sousa, 2015). Perhaps one of the greatest detriments in interesting students with mathematics is the sheer predictability of what will happen in class. Sometimes the thought of changing how we run class can be intimidating or overwhelming. What if it doesn\u2019t work or go well? What if I can\u2019t manage the class? Truthfully, it might not be perfect and it will definitely be messy. It\u2019s still worth it! Doing something out of the ordinary might be as simple as changing the order of your class routine. For example, in a mathematics workshop (and most constructivist math lessons) students begin with exploring a hands-on task that they have not yet been taught in order to start forming their own connections. These explorations could be: Rolling dice with a partner to make two-digit numbers, and then putting them in ascending order prior to formalizing the roll of place value in primary grades. Numbers can be ordered based on a hundreds chart if students can\u2019t count that high.Sorting shapes and creating categories for their groupings prior to learning names, characteristics and the hierarchy of polygons for intermediate students.Using two-color counters in various arrangements to wipe out \u201czero pairs\u201d in order for middle school students to discover the patterns for adding integers. This would be done rather than teaching the \u201crules\u201d for adding integers. Students might need to be told in advance what is a zero pair.Use a Concept Attainment model (These are functions vs. These are not functions) with high school students to have them determine what is and is not a function. Examples (both of and of not) would include graphs, tables, and equations to start, and may extend into context descriptions.Other ideas for novelty include dice rolling to generate problems, bringing in a large deck of cards to draw for partners or groups or even for typical probability problems \u2013 the size (very large or very small) of items adds novelty. Use video. The list is endless of ways to bring in a fresh approach and just do something a little different. Offer choice.Offering choice to students in how they will learn, practice, or demonstrate learning is by far the most common way we tap the interest of our students. In fact, research suggests that offering choice a minimum of 35% of the time in class will increase students\u2019 intrinsic motivation (Jensen, 1998). When designing choices for students, bear these principles in mind (Smith a, 2017): Be sure that every choice stays true to the learning goal of the lesson. It is possible to design a variety of activities that accomplish different goals without even realizing that has happened.Be sure that everyone has to address the essential understanding and conceptual basis of the topic regardless of the specific task.Take extra care that each option has the same rigor and effort requirements. If students choose a task because it appears easier than others, it should be because the structure of the task fits a comfortable way for them to learn rather than it actually being easier.Be aware of how long each option should take students to complete. There is nothing worse than having one task completed in much less time than other tasks!Organizing choice for students can be as simple as a choice board (list the options and students sign up) or more complex such as a Think Tac Toe. The following are examples from elementary and secondary classrooms. ",

            "answer_text": "It is a very common issue among many youths. And it is also true if you can\u2019t love science (especially maths), you can\u2019t able to achieve many things also you can\u2019t able to enter your favorite engineering college. So before entering my explanation I want explain you something through this figure  Many of you may not agree with me but I am telling my experiences. The three curves defines how fast you reach your target. The Blue one is the ideal one i.e Your target is fine also you take the right approach without any love.The Green one is the actual what is faced most of us i.e you take the target but you don\u2019t love the thing, which causes laziness and carelessness, and you take infinite time to achieve the target. Actually you can never achieve your targetThe third one is also real and you can do for your best i.e you love the subject and take the right approach. The overshoot indicates your preparation will complete well before your exam, and you perfected it very well and the curve approaches the target with full confidence and you get the success.So by this I try to convey you how it is significant to have love towards subject. Now the question is how to love the subject (here Mathematics) Here I am explaining my methods how I love Mathematics and for this love I able to enter IIT. Which is dream of every Indian Student. But please note this I am giving these suggestions only for only high school students and not college students. Please keep that in mind. Methods I Followed: Never do the same problem repeatedly : From my childhood, I feel boring when the same problem is given to me repeatedly. Except exams I mostly do any problem only for once.Try to Minimize the time in all aspect :You have to find the method in a way so that you need the least time, it is the need for exams. For me in a 3 hours Maths exam I need 1 hr 40 min to 2 hrs to finish the paper most of the time. How do you achieve this, read the most important next point.Solve Not only problems of your standard but finish your standard First and solve higher standard problems also:Some of you may not able to agree with me but believe me this is the key thing for me to excel in Mathematics.There are many problems which can take 1 page or more than that for a particular standard but the same problem can be done by 2 to 5 lines by the higher standard.In the question paper there were nothing written like - \u201c You have to solve the problems from that formulas or techniques only, which are done in the class or is in the syllabus\u201d. So if you solve the problem, which is marked say 10 for a problem of 7th standard because it takes 15\u201320 lines to solve it using 7th standard knowledge, in 5\u20137 lines using 8th or 9th standard knowledge. They have to give you 10, they have no choice. And thus you can finish the paper easily well before the other students and none can pull you out from getting 100/100 .Always Remember Each and Every Formula you Learned :In Mathematics many formulas we forgot and get trouble later. From my experience many students in my college forgot some basic algebraic formulas for 6th or 7th standard. It does not make you trouble directly but if you know them, your calculations will be much faster.Try to solve the problem with experience not by the instructions :Mainly in High School Maths, there is a chapter and all questions related to that chapter are put in a same place. So in most of the cases You know that we have to apply that formula or method in the problem and this makes a wrong habit as you don\u2019t think much how to solve. After some time when you are at 11th or 12th standard or exams, it will not mentioned which chapter it belongs to. Also a single problem can cover multiple concepts. So make a habit, you solve the problem only by the language of the question only. Not by the name of the chapter in whose exercise the problem is.If You can follow these tips and I think you will able to love the subject Mathematics. And you remember that \u201cIf you love any thing, it will return you the Love as well\u201d.  Always remember, if you able to develop interest in maths at high school level. It will be easy to carry in college level. \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026 With this note I want to finish.

            "answer_text": "here\u2019s an article that may help you How to Master Mathematics?  We are all aware of the word \u2018mathematics\u2019 or commonly known as 'math'. We daily come across several things in our life where we need to do calculations, which may be either some simple money calculation at grocery shop or a complex cumbersome calculation for calculating some rate of interest or calculation for tax etc. thus our day to day activities involve to a large extent use of the calculations or in particular mathematics. Mathematics may generally be defined as the abstract study of the different formulas including quantity, shapes, area and properties. There is no particular definition of mathematics. The course of mathematics may differ from the calculation of some simple multiplication problem and can be as complex as calculations for volume and surface area of a complex spherical figure involving in huge amount of calculation with lots of cumbersome formulas being put in by the calculating person. Through the use of abstraction and logical reasoning, mathematics developed from counting, calculation, measurement, and the systematic study of the shapes and motions of physical objects. Practical mathematic i.e. counting or calculation by practical means has been used from very long time probably since the time of early man. In earlier time\u2019s calculations were done with the help of stones, sticks, marbles or simply drawing lines for each quantity. During earlier times a person who needed to count his sheep\u2019s before taking them to graze didn\u2019t did the same by counting one, two and three. At that time there was no counting system and people use to count either by drawing one line for one sheep or by keeping one stone for the one sheep, and confirming the number of sheep\u2019s again at the time of his return from the very same source. Mathematics is used worldwide as an essential tool in many fields such as natural science, engineering and construction, medicine, and the research works. Another branch of mathematics that is concerned with application of mathematical knowledge to other fields such and research and designing and makes use of new mathematical discoveries has led to the development of new mathematical disciplines, such as statistics and game theory and is known as applied mathematics. There is no clear differentiation between pure and applied mathematics, and practical applications for what began as pure mathematics are often discovered. Mathematics as a Subject Mathematics play an important role in academics and the basis of mathematics are what students need to further understand some scientific subjects like physics and chemistry also. Mathematics in academics starts right from the beginning with teachers teaching students how to count and further teaching addition multiplication and tables. As the student further moves up academically the mathematic start getting more complex with introduction of various formulas and application theories like calculating SI, taxes, volumes and probability etc., the mathematics curricula being taught in schools has often been a topic of hot discussion among the various scholars that is it important in today\u2019s world of technology, to teach such lengthy and cumbersome techniques to students. Though response to the debate has been mixed, there can never be a one sided decision on this topic. Though mathematics may seem to be a bit stressful or difficult when a student starts, but given proper time and devotion it is not difficult to conquer mathematics which is a very important part of our day to day activities. In academic terms there can be further divisions of mathematics as: Pure MathematicsApplied MathematicsComputational MathematicsMathematics is a subject that may seem very interesting to some, and may be really boring or tough for the others. This all depends upon the understanding of the topic and dedication of a student. If a student is not able to pick up what is being taught obviously he/she would feel bored and won\u2019t be able to concentrate on the topic, on the other hand a student who is well in command of the facts being taught in class is really happy following every step and begins to enjoy the step by step problem solution. This difference of understanding level lies in the dedication of a student. Mathematics is a subject that requires a little hard work in beginning to get hold of formulas and problem solving technique. If a student is really dedicated in practicing the topic that is being taught to him then no one can stop him being in well command of the topic on the next day and it is guaranteed that the subject seems to get interesting and solving problems becomes fun if you have clarity in your mind, which would come only with practice. These days there are many problem solving tricks being taught and so many tutorial helps available for students thus making mathematics more interesting and fun to learn. Hence only way to master math is to practice, and more practice even harder. Mastering Techniques Every student thinks that is there any way to learn math without practicing or putting in hard work. Answer is no! There can be no replacement for hard work. One who thinks of skipping this hard work can never have a hold on the subject. Regular practice is must. It\u2019s not the only criteria for success in mathematics. You need to practice effectively. Some tips for getting started are: Get Hold on Formulas Mathematics is all about applying calculation work to a formula in a given procedure. There would hardly be any high school level student who would have problem with simple multiplication and division. Now the main thing that is left is formula and procedure, which are keys to solve a mathematical problem. The main reason for failure in a math or science exam is confusion with important formulas. If a student doesn\u2019t have his hold on these important formulas, he can\u2019t solve basic problems or understand the big picture. Result is failure in examination and hatred towards the subject. The key to excel in this situation is by putting in correct amount of time and effort from the very beginning of the session. If students start to memorize formulas from day one, they\u2019ll barely need to be worried about the exam. Hence once you get hold of these formulas it means you have reached half the way. Students may get started by keeping a separate notebook specifically for formulas and don\u2019t forget to highlight important formulas that are repeated again and again. As you tend to learn some new formulas, write them down in order to be thorough with them. Revise these formulas at least once a week when you are not practicing the same topic to keep them on your tips. Once you make this a habit you get use to it and start remembering formulas even for longer periods and you won\u2019t panic at the time if exam. Practice There is an old saying, \u201cpractice makes a man perfect\u201d. This saying holds very true with the mathematics. More you practice the problems of mathematics, more you tend to get familiar and thorough with the formulas and the procedure you need to follow. Regularly practicing the topic that was being taught has many advantages. If you practice regularly, you tend to get use to with problem solving and hence you start to think quickly as how the particular problem would be solved and you also get familiar with the problem solving procedure. Regular practicing tends to increase your problem solving speed and gradually you start enjoying the subject. Regular practice is an effective way of improving problem solving ability as well as speed. Once you get in habit of regular practice, this means you are very close to success in mathematics. If you learn your formulas well and practice well with the procedures, no one can stop you from scoring best grades. Variety of Problem Success in mathematics is directly related with the ability to solve different problems. The foremost key to success is to be thorough with your formulas; each related formula should be on your tips at the time of exam. Second is to practice thoroughly to know well the procedure involved and tricks to solve the question. Yet another aspect for the success in mathematics is to solve a variety of problems. As we all know effective way of knowledge is through experience, you cannot forget something that you have experience earlier. Same is the case with mathematical problems, more you solve more you remember. But the fact is that you need to solve a variety of problems to get in hold with the various tricks involved with different problems, as each problem is unique in itself. You need to try maximum problems possible so that you know what to expect in the exam. Try your best not to slack on problem sets during the year by collaborating too much or taking shortcuts. If you run into a problem you can\u2019t solve, reach out to your teachers or fellow students and make sure once they have taught you how to solve that particular problem, you practice it again thoroughly. Do Not Fear You need not feel afraid from mathematics. If you are not good with your academic mathematics, that doesn\u2019t mean that you cannot improve. Of course you have chance to improve and you can do following things to upgrade your grades: Learn as much as you can during the class timeAttend all your classes regularlyTry to sit in the front if you have problem understanding a subjectOrganize your notebook in a neat mannerTake down your notes completelyDo not hesitate to ask question about the facts that you do not understandYou can also make effective use of online tutorialsTry to sit with bright students and request them to help you out with anything difficultSit straight in a right postureHow to Create Interest Bored up or fed up of mathematics? Do not worry, there are many students who did not quite appreciate the subject in beginning but gradually begin to like it and managed some good grades too. First basic is that you should not fear the subject. It is difficult but it is not impossible. You just have to give in a bit of hard work and devotion to subject. But some student also complains of mathematics to be boring. For those students, we have a technique about how to get started: First of all be fearless in your mind and be motivated to learn.Be ready with all your formulas on a separate sheet, with formulas written neatly by your hands, even for first few days you can take that sheet as reference for formulas and gradually you may get rid of it once you are use to solving the problem.Be in a comfortable seating position to study so that you do not lack interest away from everything that can distract you.Now start with reading the problem thoroughly, and read it again and again till you have proper understanding of what you have to solve.Note down all the given information neatly to save time reading the problem again.Find out what the problem is asking you to solve.Now when you have all given values and you know what you have to solve, write down neatly all the formulas you need and begin with solving part.In beginning don\u2019t forget to solve the problem in points, and highlight any exception or trick which is a part of procedure.Make sure you are taking care of all the units.When you are done with answers quickly review all your steps so that you have clear pathway in your mind for the next time when you solve the problem.Conclusion Mathematics is a subject that may seem to be boring or difficult at the time you start, but gradually you tend to gain your interest when you start getting along with your course. To excel in mathematics you need to be dedicated and hardworking and remember practice is the key to success. So don\u2019t be afraid, all that you need is the hard work to score well. ",

            "answer_text": "Bored up or fed up of mathematics? Do not worry, there are many students who did not quite appreciate the subject in beginning but gradually begin to like it and managed some good grades too. First basic is that you should not fear the subject. It is difficult but it is not impossible. You just have to give in a bit of hard work and devotion to subject. But some student also complains of mathematics to be boring. For those students, we have a technique about how to get started: First of all be fearless in your mind and be motivated to learn.Be ready with all your formulas on a separate sheet, with formulas written neatly by your hands, even for first few days you can take that sheet as reference for formulas and gradually you may get rid of it once you are use to solving the problem.Be in a comfortable seating position to study so that you do not lack interest away from everything that can distract you.Now start with reading the problem thoroughly, and read it again and again till you have proper understanding of what you have to solve.Note down all the given information neatly to save time reading the problem again.Find out what the problem is asking you to solve.Now when you have all given values and you know what you have to solve, write down neatly all the formulas you need and begin with solving part.In beginning don\u2019t forget to solve the problem in points, and highlight any exception or trick which is a part of procedure.Make sure you are taking care of all the units.When you are done with answers quickly review all your steps so that you have clear pathway in your mind for the next time when you solve the problem.Source: Sudhanshu Jha's answer to How can I develop my interest in maths?

I\u2019m not familiar with your system as an American, but, in general, most under-18 Math isn\u2019t enough to prepare you for university-level Calculus. You\u2019ve also experienced a gap in your Math practice. I myself experienced a gap from age 19 to 26. I thought I could take on Pre-Calculus when I returned, because I had pulled off a C in College Algebra 7 years prior, but I was very wrong. I ended up starting with College Algebra. I\u2019ve done well (all As, save for Calculus II), but wish I had gone back to the basic fundamentals and ensured I was solid on them. You don\u2019t want to struggle with basics in Algebra, and you definitely don\u2019t want to dive into upper-level Math if your Algebra is shaky. Here\u2019s my list of what you should tackle, with books, Kahn Academy, etc.: Pre-Algebra MathematicsGeometryTrigonometryPre-CalculusCalculus (I)Calculus (II)Calculus (III)Differential EquationsLinear AlgebraProbability and StatisticsBest way to learn: Do it over and over and over and overUse online resources like Kahn AcademyBuy books and do all the problems in it, starting with odds since the solutions are usually providedUse Chegg, PurpleMath, etc.Anything further would depend on what route you want to take, and whether you\u2019re learning on your own or at university. The latter is definitely your best option if you can exercise it. ",

Just like if you wanted to \u201cget yourself to like reading\u201d I would say to start by finding one book you find interesting, so with math I say to go out and find some piece of math that is interesting. From there you can start looking for connections to the other branches (they are there, trust me). I personally still don\u2019t like formal mathematical logic, geometry, statistics, or differential equations very much at all. Doesn\u2019t matter - I love graph theory and did my master\u2019s thesis in infinite dimensional Banach spaces. I plan to teach a lot of calculus in my future. I love math, but there are parts that are much more fun for me than others. ",

Why do I need one?How can I take a past result that Somegoras said was true and validate it myself?Can I extend the Somegoras\u2019 results into another new result? How would I prove/disprove that?What really is a straight line? How was the first ever straight line drawn by man? How did they know it was straight? Hell, what does straight even mean?Why do we care about if a number is prime or not and what\u2019s all this fuss about factorization?If there are infinite integers and infinite real numbers is it possible one is a bigger infinity than the others? Really? Can infinity come in various shapes and sizes? Can there be infinity of infinities? WTF!What really are sets?

Just how does one come up with that weird little thing plaguing all of mankind?Alright, I can solve two equations with two unknowns, but can I do this with 1000 equations and 1000 unknowns? Can I do it effectively? How do I even know, before taking on the gargantuan task of finding the solution, if a solution even exists?What do vectors give/tell us that we couldn\u2019t know before?This is why you\u2019ll even enjoy math. Forget about it as a subject, only play with it as a system of inquiry. Question even the system - why should I inquire this way and not that way? How do I even know that this form of inquiry will actually help me? Can I validate this? Can someone else validate it if I present it to them? I developed my interest in math 20 years too late.

You could maybe try finding a subject or subjects that do interest you where math is extremely important. An example relevant in my case is programming. I used to make small video games (at first they were mostly graphical demos) that did a lot of graphically \u201cneat\u201d things. Later I came to realize math was very useful in other areas like finding paths to things, simulating physics, and much more. Even playing games can be another area where math can come in handy. Not just in video games either. If basic math isn't holding your interest enough some role playing games give you a fun way to practice doing lots of small operations quickly to keep the game going. Some other examples I can think of are: money (some people may find just assigning real value to the numbers makes it feel more important), sports stats, space (orbits, ship trajectories). There are many more examples out there but my basic point is that if math on its\u2019 own just can't hold your interest maybe look at something you do enjoy and see if there is some way math can help improve your enjoyment while gaining practice and habit in using math.

The lessons that are found in schools, require a basic knowledge, but that you see is a use of force. So doing the minimum required by a school, is not going to allow you to become familiar with math in a way that leads you to \u201clove\u201d it. The familiarity that leads to a love of your subject, comes from self-initiated and spontaneous research. An independent study of the History of Math, for example, can be a first step. Another independent study of the subject would be something like a personal commitment to master a certain domain within the broad field. For example, you might go to a library and get books or buy some books with the intended purpose of totally mastering absolutely everything there is to know about Fractions, Decimals, and Percents. Another challenge would be to study algebra, and find the different kinds of basic problems in different books. You might consider solving the problems in a way that people work Crossword Puzzles or study Chess. It can become a specific focus to prove that no problem can defeat your mind. Make it personal. Make it private. Also, we can examine a certain feature, common in human experience. Many people consider beginning some sort of study as I suggest, but they feel that in doing this, it needs to follow logically that they demonstrate that they are some sort of \u201cgenius\u201d. It just does not seem to occur to some that they can enjoy the acquisition of knowledge just as a subject of personal commitment. Unusual things can occur when one begins a study that goes beyond the lesson materials and textbooks used in schools. One can begin to discover, for example, that there are some very badly written books on the subject, and also discover that there are some very wonderful book published, but seem to have been ignored or abandoned. Love can also be experienced when the knowledge level is increased to the point that you are able to help others, and especially younger students who are struggling. As you develop the willingness to help and teach others, you may find that you find new friendships and that people enjoy being near you. Remember; Form\u2014-Follows\u2014-Function ",

Here are some of the ideas I could think of how to make mathematics interesting : Sudoku I think a lot of students is familiar with this mind-boggling game. Yes! It\u2019s definitely mathematics and if you learn higher statistics, you\u2019ll be able to come up a strategy to solve this puzzle without a migraine. Hahahaha. Toss CoinCan\u2019t decide? Toss a coin. Tossing a coin is the best illustration for studying Probability and its theorems, as well as rolling a dice.  Games (applications)  Logical ProofsThese are very useful in programming. :)  Binary CodingTo the IT experts there, mathematics really made a huge foundation in every algorithms you are working on now.  Graph TheoryThis is the Seven Bridges of K\u00f6nigsberg:  How to solve this problem? Using math, specifically Discrete Mathematics and Graph Theory. This problem can be applied to road problems. Interesting right? For me, it isn\u2019t just interesting, math is very useful. We can see it everyday, we are actually using it everyday, even standing on it hahaha! Math doesn\u2019t stop in finding x. When I was in High School, I don\u2019t understand math. I can still remember, I didn\u2019t pass any quizzes. That was how interesting math is for me, the very main reason why I took up BS Applied Mathematics major in Statistics. I challenged myself and yehey I graduated with this degree! Thanks for reading! God bless! ",

            "answer_text": "Interest can be born with curiosity. I remember my old days at school where I was forced to do maths. I hated it. I never realized its importance. In primary school, maths according to me was 2+2 = 4 and that's it. I couldn't find anything interesting in the subject. Ofcourse there are quite a few people who find 2+2=4 quite intrequinging and I used to and still envy them. But on the other hand, I had a lot of interest in science, physics and especially electronics. I love to understand how things work and how to make stuff work as I want them to. I had a lot of interest in electronics, I used to get these electronic hobby kits that were avaiable in market. These kits included a printed circuit board, all the components required and a manual that tells us where each component goes on the PCB. All we need to do is assemble the components and solder them. I made quite a lot of projects combining these hobby kits and I enjoyed working on them a lot. Later in high school, when I matured and when my knowledge about science reached to a point where I started to get bored with these hobby kits. Because all I did was a mechanical work. Someone had already designed these circuits and all I did was assemble them. I wanted to design my own circuits from scratch. I started doing some research on the same and I realised how much math is involved in Electronic. This changed the way I looked at math. For me now math was no longer 2+2=4. I looked at mathematics as a tool of science that can help to design some pritty cool electronic gadgets! From then onwards I went back to my basics and started learning maths out of curiosity and interest always thinking how I can use this knowledge, this tool best to my interests. Your interest may differ from my. You may want to become a scientist, doctor, an accountant or a software engineer. But you should always remember, be it any feild, maths will always be there. So find out how maths will be beneficial to you in your feild of interest. If you can't find any then understand that to achieve your ambitions, you have to get a degree first and you have to learn maths for that to happen. Don't look at maths as a hurdle take it as a challenge and i am sure you will love it. Good luck. ",

            "answer_text": "Here is my version of how to make easy.  1- Log onto book-selling websites like amazon, liberty books, oxford etc. and search for math books that may help you brush up your basics or books with titles like \"Math made easy\", \"Practical math success\", \"Math doesn't suck\", \"Math on Call: A Mathematics Handbook \", \"Mastering Essential Math Skills\" and select the book that suit you. Be sure to check out the local store as well. 2- After you have bought the book/s, study it and brush up you basic skills. Make sure that you complete all the tests given there and check your progress. Math basics are a key to success on so spend maximum time studying the book/s. 3- As soon as you are finished with the basics, do the math section of SAT practice tests. The topics covered in the sat are those you were taught in middle school. I think, this is the great way to make you math aptitude stronger. Solve as many problems as you can. 4- Before you move onto some advanced topics, try to through all the formulas(arthematic, geometry and algebra) you have been taught. see, how they are derived. 5- Gradually, move onto advanced topics that you are taught in class. It'll get tougher as you go ahead, therefore put in some more time. Start off with the easier things. 6- Get help from teacher wherever you feel some difficulty. 7- Get some book like \"101 Shortcuts in math everyone can do\" to improve your mental math. ",

            "answer_text": "Learning mathematics can be fun if done in the right way. All you need is a belief that you can learn anything. A lot of people end up hating mathematics because of the way it is taught to them. But as grown ups let's start taking responsibility for our learning. 1). No thing such as a math brain exists. The very first part is realising that people good in mathematics are not born with a \u201cmath brain\u201d. They have developed their interest and skills in mathematics by working on it. 2). Math is a lot more than what you think. Realise that mathematics is a lot more than solving equations. It involves a great adventurous venture of mathematical thinking. 3). Take your time. Do not make maths an arrangement to repeat memorised steps. Do not look for solutions written by someone else to stop your thinking process. 4). Make mistakes. Everytime you make mistakes you learn something new. 5). Make things visual not just numerical and abstract. We are all familiar with the algebraic identity. (a+b)2=a2+b2+2ab(a+b)2=a2+b2+2ab Boring. How about this. a2a2 is the area of a square of side a (same with b2b2) and hence (a+b)2(a+b)2 is the area of a square of side (a+b), calculated as  Hence the identity. Visualising is important to understand because our brain loves to think in images and it helps in better understanding. Be as imaginative as you can. 5). Go through the explanation given in your textbook properly. Biggest mistake that a lot of people commit is going to the exercises without grasping, thinking and imagining the concepts and the essence of the subject. Let's assume you are now good at maths. You are the star of local casino as you are the best card player with a strong grasp on the theory of probability. On the way back to your apartment you decide to have an ice cream cone and wonder in what manner to bite it to obtain a certain conic. You throw the wrapper into the dustbin and it follows a path in the air you know the equation of. On your way home you pass by the avengers tower. You wonder what it's height is. Just walking along its shadow on the ground and using your footsteps as the measuring unit you calculate the height of the tower using simple geometry. Unlocking your apartment your look at the edges of your room that you have imagined as the coordinate axes and owing to which the entire objects in the universe have a position. The coordinate geometry of the universe starts from your room. This is how exciting mathematics is. Have a great day and keep learning. Sumit Gupta ",

The logic behind it, the centuries of evolution and human development that leads to something so universal in our lives that basically everything we do is related to it?

It\u2019s amazing how the construction and development of this language called Math that begun whith simple algebra, understanding simple geometry like squares and triangles, to be able to describe the whole universe in the most simple yet complex ways. E=mc^2 it\u2019s a formula so simple yet it tells a story so complex that even the brightest minds try hard to understand or even refute it. Another important thing is not only the contributions to society but also to us individuals. When I was young I thought about the value that Math brought to the world but also the value it could bring if I try to understand it because I believed that studying and loving math would only bring good contributions to myself and the more I tried to understand, the more fascinated I would get. There is simply no harm in studying Math so why not study and understand it?

Keep plugging away and try not to sabotage your own efforts by dwelling on how hard you think the task is and in particular try not to identify yourself as the kind of person who is bad at this task . Repeating/reinforcing negative messages like this can have a strong disincentive (blocking) effect on your progress/focus. In contrast you should tell yourself you are committed to getting better and that you can get better with time/effort and that you are getting better at this challenging but entirely achievable task. Whilst this sounds \u201ctouchy feely\u201d it will make it much easier by reducing your challenge to a manageable program of learning/practice which is much easier than a battle with your own brain as you try to master something you've been telling yourself is not even natural for you to do \u201cbecause you are creative\u201d . Take a step back - think about why you want to acquire this skill, really list off the benefits when you get it done and with sufficient practice and patience you will nail this and enjoy your sucess. Oh, and before anyone comments \u201cit's easy for you\u201d let me say I was always terrible at maths in school and good at languages/music but I persisted, put my dislike (and fear) of maths aside and completed my computer science degree then later my investment banking masters and I hope to complete my Web Science PhD later this year. I finished my second album whilst studying for the PhD and just built my own electric guitar from scratch a couple of months ago. All the skills are there for you to acquire - they aren\u2019t always quick or easy to build up and you may never be the world\u2019s greatest but you can do it When people tell you (or if you tell yourself) that if I am good at X I must be bad at Y - don\u2019t believe it. I am not saying at all that I am the best mathematician, the best musician or the best guitar builder (far from it) but I have succeeded (in my own terms) at a very wide range of learning/skills and you can too. No special systems, no products, no magic - just patience, some confidence and some persistance/hard work. I\u2019d love to hear back from you when you nail this maths thing so you can share with us how you made it happen. I hope this helps.. ",

The formulas, equations, theorems, shapes, expressions, formulas for finding areas and volumes of shapes, formulas for finding specific angle measures or made measures for specific shapes such as circles, triangles and so on. I know this sounds a lot, but this is what makes math so interesting, there\u2019s is always something new to learn about. Math is all about PERSPECTIVE of a person. How did mathematicians create numbers? because they had a PERSPECTIVE. How did they find shapes? Because of their PERSPECTIVE. How were they able to find formulas for area and volumes of specific shapes? Because they used their power of PERSPECTIVE. There is a video about this I suggest if anyone can, they should check it out here it is:Math is the hidden secret to understanding the world. If you wanna keep yourself interested in learning math, then start off with learning the basics such as Pythagorean theorem, area, and volume of specific shapes such as prisms, circles, 2D shapes, and 3D shapes, etc. And don't just learn them, UNDERSTAND them and how they are so important as math is a very important skill to learn in an everyday life. Trust me, you WILL get interested in it. Just start by understanding the small steps before moving on to the big steps. ",

When I was younger, I did well in math class and tried to do well in competitions to please my parents more than myself. In some areas of life that will always be the case. However a few years later, in high school, I befriended kids older than me who were \"national math champions\". They participated on the National Anerican Math team and the like. However, they were not overly pretentious. So I used to go and talk to them and after math competitions were finished, discuss answers and how to solve problems with them. Over time I realized that their own giddiness for math was starting to rub off on me, and it really boosted me to start practicing on my own and start learning new things whereas I used to say there wasn't enough time.  Now I'm not saying this will help you practice more, in all actuality, that's up to YOU, but if you find time to spend with kids who actually love the subject, you'll find yourself loving it too. ",

It was hard to understand (and still kind of is), and it was time-consuming, and I mainly thought it was pointless, and so I hated it. But then I got to Pre-Calculus. I was prepared to hate it on sight as well. Then we started learning stuff, and I realized SO THAT'S WHERE IT ALL COMES IN HANDY OH MY GOSH THAT'S SO COOL because everything we had ever learnt in math came together in a big package and it was so satisfying. Also, I had an epiphany a while ago that went something like oh crap I should probably know how to calculate expenses and maybe learn how to design a house if I build my own and that's exactly when I started being interested in algebra and trig, even though it took hours to understand it, because I would be lost without it. Short answer: Math makes everything seem a lot cooler when you really apply it to the real world, because if you wanted to, you could be able to calculate the height of the biggest TV in Times Square using a phone calculator and mental trigonometry, while standing right in front of it, without using the internet. That's pretty awesome. ",

            "answer_text": "I just wrote a similar answer and I'm re posting here: Pamela Li's answer to Why do you like mathematics and doing mathematical research? There are so many practical reasons to like math, but mine is not. I started liking math when I was a kid simply because I was good at it. My mother is very good at math and she tutored my older sister throughout primary school (elementary in US). I learned a lot passively watching them work on problems. I didn't know I learned so much just watching until secondary school when I breezed through the first few years. Up til then (secondary school), I was not particularly good at anything. So acing all those math exams gave me a huge boost in my confidence. Because I liked the feeling of being competent, I practiced more. Then the more I practiced, the better I was which in turned boosted my confidence even more. This was a very rewarding positive feedback loop. Later on, I also found out that when I worked really hard on a difficult problem and finally got the answer, the sense of achievement was unparalleled. So I started from not particularly crazy about math, to liking math for the self-esteem boost, to loving it for the challenges. My advice to those who want to like math is to set yourself up for success. No one likes something if they keep failing it or getting the wrong answers. Don't start with the hard problems. Work on having a solid foundation in math basics. Then practice, practice and practice to create a positive feedback loop that makes you feel good about yourself and like math more. ",

New maths are invented to solve problems that currently were not solvable at the time. Most of the time you are being taught things using a lot of proofs and theory heavy lecture. Most folks do not learn that way(a least I did not), but they understand real problems in a context. Much of the basis of calculus was invented and used to solve problems, the formal proofs came much later. Math to me is made much harder to learn than it should be for lots of reasons like class size (my calculus I class had 300\u2013400 people). Crappy books that are super expensive. I had college differential equations class where the professor used a pre-published book and and handed out revisions to the book with corrections and updates weekly. Basically we were a test class.

I find this last approach is a great way of developing understanding of various mathematical tricks and strategies. If you have a need for a tool, it is somehow easier to master it than in the abstract. Personally it works for me. It might not for you. Try it. Even if you don\u2019t manage to solve your problem, what you\u2019ve learned in the attempt will stand you in good stead in further studies. You may feel a need to do a formal course in the subject as your expertise grows. Obviously, only you can decide when you reach this point. Look carefully at the content of the course and make sure you are prepared for it and have the basic tools needed for it. It can be very discouraging if you take a course beyond your level of capability. Good luck! ",

Biology: Not my strong suite, but I assume you need some grasp of mathematical concepts or logic to unravel DNAs secret to the universe. For my part, I try to look at math problems as puzzles. If you are good at math, maybe you lack challenge. Try to approach the problem as, what do I know, either using class work or textbooks or just memory for a challenge, that can solve this?

If you don't like math, there's a good chance that you are either struggling and thusly stressed, or don't like rote memorizing. You're thinking of math as do this, get this. And facts, like 2+2=4. Try learning about 'proofs'. That's what most teachers call learning the reasons behind why you should divide by cosine here or whatever it is you're learning.Or think of it like a puzzle. I like the logic in knowing exactly what you're supposed to do, rather than kinda guessing.Ask your teacher. He/She would have some more ideas and will be glad you took this initiative. Please don't listen to the guy who said to picture the teacher in their underwear.If it's about Math being boring, then it might be because it's too easy and you're in the wrong class. Again, ask your teacher. They might be able to help with that too. Drawing is better if you've resigned yourself to boredom; doodles actually help with comprehension (not full scale drawings when you tune out the world). Just make sure to get the notes down and do the problems.Have a nice day. :) ",

            "answer_text": "Fear of mathematics has to do with the things of the mind\u2026 It\u2019s even funny that they\u2019ve got a name for it, Arithmophobia. Mathematics is what we do every day, just like we eat, drink, sleep etc. I\u2019m sure you know the amount of change to collect after making any purchase. Mathematics has even become a part and parcel of our lives that sometimes we do them subconsciously. You can start loving mathematics by first admitting that you don\u2019t hate it, and you\u2019re not just studying it the way you ought to. That being said, there are steps you could take to see great improvement on being good at maths: As Gordon B. Hinckley said, You can't build a great building on a weak foundation. You must have a solid foundation if you're going to have a strong superstructure. You need to be honest with yourself that you do not only suck at complex topics, but also at basic ones, like Estimation and approximation, linear algebra, factorisation, expansions\u2026 once your basic foundation is strong enough, you can move to the next step.Read topics you don\u2019t understand often times till you understand it, or check youtube for more explanation\u2026 Everything is on youtube this days.Practice is key. Solve lots of problem till you can remember some solution offhand :) .Join a mathematics clubs, or subscribe to a nice mathematics channel on youtube.That\u2019s all to it. ",

            "answer_text": "I think there are at least two points of view. Some say it is possible to love science but not math, and some say loving science and to understand how things work means one must use math to describe and figure out how things work. Hence, in the second view, math and science work hand in hand. An analogy for the first view is that you could use an app or a black box to make things work, and you don\u2019t need to know how an app or black box work. Another analogy is that you could be a good pilot or race car driver without knowing the working of an airplane or race car. However, the proponent of the second view is that if you are consummate pilot or race car driver you would want to know everything about the plane or race car that would make them fly higher or race faster. This is what math is about. Math is a language that could describe how the different parts come together to produce the results. You could be a successful engineer or scientist if you could use the appropriate app or black box. Just think how far you could get if you could understand these black boxes and make better ones. ",

My deep feeling is that we have been teaching mathematics very badly for a very long time. Most of us who became mathematicians flourished under the techniques that had flourished for centuries. Unfortunately, these same techniques left many students cold, and teachers seemed unable to vary the way they did things. As an experiment, the next time someone tells you that they don\u2019t like math, ask when that started. I\u2019ll bet they can tell you exactly what grade or what subject lost them.

If you get the answer to a question do not stop there, find out more about how you reached to it. Derive the equation by yourself. Second thing, appreciate. It takes a lot of admiring to love a subject. You must admire and wonder about it. But this happens eventually after you follow the first step. When you come to know how mathematics work ,you will automatically be intrested and love it. MOST IMPORTANTLY: Do not get misdirected by the opinions of the people around you, about how they feel about a subject. Most of the time when a person cannot do it themself, they try to spread negative ideas about that topic to others. So stay focused and know why you do, what you do. ",

The most interesting part of maths is that, overtime it will become an integral part of your soul !Reason that many people don't love it is that, they thought, they will have to work very hard in practicing it. But to really love maths and science we don't need to work hard.  For learning something new first of all, I tries to know about its application.Then learn its theory and basic concepts.Then relax for sometimes and try to dream about it. And trying to evolve something new or contradicting the existing.Then solve some easy problems.Then try to solve some more difficult problems and continuously increase the level.Then the best part comes try to make your own questions, more and more challenging problems and extraordinary situations. Try to use each and every concepts. Relate your simple daily life situations with it.     This method is very applicable for science also. And knowing about  its application first really works, try it.

An engineer, physicist, pure mathematician, and applied mathematician may all be interested in Math but completely different things in in mathematics.Ask yourself why you asked this question. If it is necessity to do math, you will have to do it regardless of your interest. What really matters is that you invest some time discovering and exploring mathematics, and understanding if you really enjoy it. If you enjoy it then great, otherwise just get it done with.Do not form a stereotype and bias about mathematics. Often it is either high school, a bad teacher, a bad curriculum, peer pressure, or the type of math that you will typically enjoy is out of the curriculum, that drive people away from mathematics.

Everything we do as \"steps of calculations\" has logics behind them. More over people feel like formulas are inventions. Actually they are discoveries. formulae are like simple representation of a calculation made simplified. All the trignometric values are the real values. Simple example: Why tan 90\u00b0 equals infinity?? You would have known that tan value is calculated as opposite side by adjacent side. if the angle between the hypotenuse and the adjacent side is approaching 90\u00b0 and if the value of the adjacent side is 1.then opposite side length   is defined as tan 90\u00b0. if \u0398 =90\u00b0 then the length R becomes parallel to Y.and then you can't determine the value Y since they are parallel lines and are asumed to join at infinity. Hence tan 90\u00b0 is defined as infinity. ",

Continuing it follows that all numbers must be interesting. But math is pure logic. I remember taking a course in university course in symbolic logic that was given by the Philosophy department. (As a math major improving my knowledge of symbolic logic sounded like a good idea.) The philosophy students thought it was a tough course but math majors covered the entire content of that full year course in the first week of our introductory set theory class.

Most people think maths is just numbers that came from nowhere and we always need to solve them for no purpose. The truth is that maths has a lot more meaning. From the basic knowledge that can help you with your personal financial control later in life, to the more complex info assisting in creating new things like buildings, bridges, and even just normal everyday life situations. Once you have gotten an appreciation for maths, start practicing. Do as many exercises as possible, focus and do them with the intention of learning. Exploit the help of unlimited resources on the internet and teachers if you find it difficult to understand. PRACTICE, PRACTICE, PRACTICE Why?

So, you are correct, without love towards math, success in those areas is, in fact, a distant dream. However, even distant dreams can be achieved. One way to start to like math is to try taking different courses in math that have less to do with your pursuits. This sounds counter intuitive, but sometimes when we see math as nothing more than a necessary evil to be mastered as a tool, it is hard to see it as interesting or even beautiful. So, perhaps reading some stuff about math in a more ethereal and less practical sense can give you a perspective that might spark admiration and eventually an affection for something that can and often is quite inspiring. To kick start, I recommend Euler\u2019s identity. Also fractals in African villages. Simply search on these terms and start reading. I hope it helps. If nothing else, it can\u2019t hurt. ",

Just focus on how to solve any particular problem. Also try to learn some intersting logics or you can say shortcuts that makes it really interesting. Try not to use calculators where not required.

We take some stuff, describe it as precisely as possible, and then when we have a question concerning it, we can tear into each case without skipping any. By the time you\u2019re finished, if you\u2019ve satisfactorily checked your work, usually you can be pretty confident before you show it to others. Mathematics is not something you love \u201cbecause you love sciences\u201d, its something you love because you want to investigate objects and you realize its the most thorough way to do so. For instance, lets say we want to discuss a hypercube in NN dimensions, and imagine ourselves on each \u201ccorner\u201d of this hypercube traveling around. With some careful analysis, I can convince you that there are a set of \u201codd\u201d corners and \u201ceven\u201d corners, and any path around this hypercube following the ridges and resting on the corners will always go \u201codd\u201d, \u201ceven\u201d, \u201codd\u201d, \u201ceven\u201d, etc. The reason this is visible isn\u2019t because I tested it all out and because people over time developed this notion, like many other fields claim, but because I can describe this hypercube in an exact way by imagining that I take the 2N2N points I get in here: P={(b1,b2,...,bN)|bi\u2208{\u22121,1}}P={(b1,b2,...,bN)|bi\u2208{\u22121,1}} and connect x,y\u2208Px,y\u2208P if and only if they share exactly one component. Drawing out these points for some simple cases will convince you quite well that this is indeed the hypercube in NN dimensions. Now I\u2019ll argue that we can define the \u201ceven\u201d points by the ones that have an even number of 1s and the \u201codd\u201d points by those who have an odd number of 1s. Then clearly at each move, one either replaces a 11 with a \u22121\u22121, replaces a \u22121\u22121 with a 11, and either of these would take the number of 1s from odd to even or even to odd, respectively. Therefore no matter where I travel on the corners I can never have a path that doesn\u2019t have this \u201ceven\u201d, \u201codd\u201d pattern and we know that for every hypercube forever now. This is the type of reasoning that attracted me to math. ",

Lots and lots of things need math though, so at least that search won't be too difficult. If you have a mini Ipod, there is this game that is called \"Brain Challenge\" under the 'extra' section. Play with that and I assure you that you will have fun with math. If you don't have a mini Ipod, play math games so you can have fun with it and gain more confident in your math skills. You really have to practice and practice. math isn't hard. it's just application. as long as the formula's don't change, in theory, the computation has to stay the same. ",

Maths is fun - It can be one of the most interesting subjects. Every question in maths is like a small puzzle. Treat it like a game. Consider every topic a level; to clear which, you have been given weapons in the form of equations. So take it easy and have fun.2.) Practice makes perfect - Practice is very important if you want to learn Maths. Practise a lot for this will not only make you familiar with the concepts and equations but also give you confidence to do the next sum.3.) Solve Examples - After reading the concepts, reading and solving already solved examples will help you understand the concepts and how they are applied. This practice is very important from the point of view of examinations. Here is a good place to practise: Brilliant | Excel in math and science. In a nutshell, to learn Maths one has to keep a positive mindset, understand concepts and practice........... Good Luck! ",

Math can be beautiful, mysterious and useful. It can be frustrating since it takes perseverance to crack some ideas. What your path to sorting out a new relationship with math is, I can\u2019t say; I don\u2019t know you. But the beauty and utility are there. If you take a look through math the same way you might stroll through an art museum, looking for something of interest, but unhooked from the responsibility for the moment to be the creator, you might get a positive surprise. I have found that there are some really good books that can help an appreciation of mathematics for the layman. ",

Download an app on your computer or tablet that uses math to solve puzzles or complete different levels in the game. You can also play old-fashion board games, like Monopoly or Yahtzee, to exercise your math skills while still having fun.Learn math tricks. There are a lot of tricks in math that are fun to know because they save you a lot of time. They are often interesting, too.Connect math with your interests. You can promote your interest in math by exploring how math is related to something you love! For example, if you\u2019re interested in historical landmarks, like the Golden Gate Bridge or the Statue of Liberty, learn about the math that was involved in building these landmarks",

Slowly u will feel like u have started liking numbers..... And once u have achieved this, u r good to go with concepts and ideas... Clear each and every topic u pick up.... Don't just mug things up.... Be practical... Google something u don't know.... Ask your teachers about it.... No need to be shy to accept that u don't know something.... Just attain command over it by practicing again and again.... Master it.... And when u think u know almost everything related to it, move to the next topic... Focus on the methodology, the derivations..... Learn where to apply the concepts u have learned as this will help you retain it in memory..... Applications do matter.... Never cram formulas..... Just go through them once and start applying it in questions... U will automatically learn by doing this.... Crammed info can be forgot but applied one remains stuck in our mind.... Repeat this.... Gather as much information as you can as there's no end to knowledge.... U can't be a master of anything.... The process of learning goes on, forever.... Practice everyday.... Don't worry if it takes time.... Patience is necessary.... U can't attain anything just by thinking of it.... U need to work on it... Good luck and I assure you that Maths is fun..... :) ",

The only method to increase your interest is to challenge yourself that YOU CAN DO\u2026. Forget about disliking and thinking that you are weak. Start thinking that you have to master it, no matter how. Start practising and finding command on it. Initially you will face hardships thinking about mathematics the whole day.

When learning, I ask: What relationship does this model represent?What real-world items share this relationship?Does that relationship make sense to me?They're simple questions, but they help me understand new topics. If you liked my math posts, this article covers my approach to this oft-maligned subject. Many people have left insightful comments about their struggles with math and resources that helped them. Math Education Textbooks rarely focus on understanding; it's mostly solving problems with \"plug and chug\" formulas. It saddens me that beautiful ideas get such a rote treatment: The Pythagorean Theorem is not just about triangles. It is about the relationship between similar shapes, the distance between any set of numbers, and much more.e is not just a number. It is about the fundamental relationships between all growth rates.The natural log is not just an inverse function. It is about the amount of time things need to grow.Elegant, \"a ha!\" insights should be our focus, but we leave that for students to randomly stumble upon themselves. I hit an \"a ha\" moment after a hellish cram session in college; since then, I've wanted to find and share those epiphanies to spare others the same pain. But it works both ways -- I want you to share insights with me, too. There's more understanding, less pain, and everyone wins. ",

Math is not knowledge about the world, it is just a bunch of definitions of possible structures (orderings).   It makes it much easier to understand how things behave, because we recognise structures we already have thought through mentally from an easier direction and defined names for.  And with that understanding we build real machines like mobile phones that make our lives nicer or easier. What I love about math is that the teacher or textbook has to give you enough information so that it fully makes sense to you, otherwise they fail, because the goal of math is to make sense.  A description of reality can be true and important even if it does not make sense to anyone, and teachers can hide behind that even if their description is just unclear, but with math you can demand it makes sense because it is supposed to help understanding the world, not add to the confusion.

The answer is obviously no\u2026 You have to move on to the next ladder in mathematics and you can\u2019t even proceed without the previous ladder\u2026 Assume ladders are your courses in mathematics like Algebra, Geometry, Trigonometry, Calculus and many more\u2026 So, in order to excel in mathematics and love it you should make an ordered list of topics from fundamentals to the more advanced mathematics\u2026 I recommend using books by OpenStax for perfect understandable explanation\u2026You can download their books for free\u2026Complete the books in order and you will definitely love and understand the insights of mathematics in your near future\u2026 Remember that you have to COMPLETE THE PREVIOUS BEFORE YOU UNDERSTAND THE NEXT\u2026 ",

But once you know how to approach it strategically, you\u2019ll likely find it less frustrating ! I can suggest you some simple methods that I follow and it\u2019s work.. Make time each day to work on math. Even if you don\u2019t have a homework assignment every day, set aside at least 15 minutes to spend working on sample problems and reviewing your notes. Studying every day will help to improve your math knowledge in place and make it easier to access when you need it.Remember that studying math, unlike some other subjects, is about doing math, so your study/practice time is the most important to your success.Knowing the main idea and general concepts of the chapter before going to class will help you better understand, so keep up with some study materials like K.C Sinha, R.D Sharma etcAnd never hesitate to clear your doubts! Work with a tutor or study-partner, it will increase your interest.As we know practice makes a man perfect..so keep practicing :) BEST OF LUCK! Hope it will work for you as well.",

Remember mathematics can be owned through your mind and mental calculations. If you need calculator, paper and pen for your calculations, you are a long way from your goal. As a son of a shopkeeper, I was introduced to mental calculations when I was in second class. I could never solve algebra questions on paper in classes but always told right answer to them. My teachers and mates ask me for explanations of the solution but I can't explain. I scored 99 percentiles in DI and Quant in CAT without studying any maths after class ten.

As my case goes, I remember it was too pathetic for me and I used to lose marks in the subject. Till 9th standard it was a weak ling, but from then I started to develop interest in the subject. Things that changed was my approach towards the subject, I started to understand the concept in place of mugging them up. This helped me a lot , I started practicing maths on a regular basis and found it was the most interesting subject I have ever known and since then I have never faced much problem with it. In order to be good or develop interest in maths all u need to do is to start devoting time to it , stop running from the subject and don\u2019t just study it for the sake of scoring marks . Start practicing problems on a regular basis and sooner or later things will start turning out in your favor . Best of Luck;) ",

This answer will be relevant if you are considering mathematics as a hobby since I am no mathematician. One of the most crucial aspects of following deductive reasoning is explaining an argument to yourself in as clear terms as you can manage. Some people might say that this is too obvious to be said outright but we all have all our foibles and sometimes shielding ourselves from a mass of symbols through tactical retreat isn't the smartest one. Beyond that, read mathematics, follow along the arguments for proofs, and discuss them with people. The text might be hard to follow at first, but give it time and persevere. In time, I am sure you will come to have a better understanding of the subject. ",

Being an engineer i find it difficult to solve math problems as i did not brush much on my  basics of differentiation and integration. That's always been a problem for me. Depending on your age also people find it difficult to get use to problems on algebra. I would say, if you want to master math, you need to understand the problem and find out the given data and what you are asked to find very early. If you solve one problem in a particular type you'll understand the concept. Just make sure you don't make any mistakes in the sign. Make sure you enter the right sign as it may cause the entire problem to go wrong in many possible ways. Practice makes anyone perfect :) ",

Then try to solve problems on your own then checkout with given answer. Don't try to buy hot mathematics you have try to understand it.  For interest here I am giving simple equation for our lives .i.e.,Life + Love = Happy...............(1)Life  -  Love =Sad.....................(2)add (1) and (2) we will get the following2* Life = Happy +Sadi.e.,Life =1/2 Happy +1/2 Sad i.e., our total lives combination of 50% Happy and 50% Sad. maths can enter into any field so why we afraid of it.  For every challenging questions faced in the field of technology the final answer is given by mathematics only. here I am giving one more comparisonSuppose the building is constructed if the strong support came from pillars to it even though they are invisible . Here the technology is building and mathematics is pillar. ",

            "answer_text": "Let me first tell you a practical and real fact of life please think it later , i mean to say that the thing in life we know very well is interesting to us otherwise no interest. Moreover, it is not only your problem means it is the problem of lakhs of students but the main reason behind it is that ask your self how much time you give to maths, it obviously too less here time giving does not mean just sitting in front of book. Always remember there is three stages you have to clear before doing something or getting a success in life. Stage 1: You get motivated by someone advises for doing something for 2\u20133 days hardly then you leave it or your old habit resist you back so now you have to understand it means problem remain the same because we do not think it deeply Stage 2: Now the time has come to force yourself your own for 3\u20134 weeks means this is the backbone of getting a success in that field like in your case developing interest in maths because technically speaking; Interest is directly proportional to Spend time on a particular thing It means if you spend more and more time on maths then a stage come when you started solving questions very easily then you automatically feel interest into it. Stage 3: Now after crossing stage 1 and stage 2 you feel a deep interest and most important you become habitual of doing it like in your case it will become your habit of solving maths questions. Actually, always think practically what is interest ? Interest is something excellence So there is no shortcut to increase interest means you have to develop it as interest is same as habit and this is the most beautiful thing in life that we can convert our disinterest into interest. Now let me give you some advise that if you follow these i can say surely see the changes after just one month so the points are:- Fix just 1\u20132 hour for solving maths daily and it is not a very big dealTry to enjoy it even if you feel disinterest means train your mind like thatTry to apply the concepts practically on real life like i have remembered once i measured the height of a straignt tree even not actual measuring the height of that tree using basic trigonometryDo not shy to ask questions to teachers even most basic one. Moreover, this is the digital age you can also easily clear your concepts from you tube videos etc.Nobody is weak only some factors affect our interest so initially only you need to force you to create a interest till you able to do that work your own and then the interest will develop automaticallyThe most important trick to solve maths questions is just split the question into sub-questions and then solve it means then you will find it very easy to solveMake a pocket diary of formulas and cram all these every 3th-4th dayevery chapter or topic has 2\u20133 types of questions hardly so make a separate notebook for these and solve periodically means keep revising your done work otherwise it is blunderMust solve at least last 5 years question papers thoroughly if you are preparing for examsUnderstand the concept first then solve or just start solving but keep the concept in mind so that it will be clear during solving the questionsAt last i want to say that it is just your thought that you have disinterest in maths only the problem is this that you are not spending appropriate time for maths because reality remains reality as maths is a very interesting subject so clear this disinterest thought from your mind by following above steps.

            "answer_text": "Well, that you're asking this question means there is still interest. You long for the aptitude you had back in the day. You can focus on math for it's direct applications (e.g. finance, cs, probability, etc.) and/or you can focus on it for it's \"health benefits.\" I suggest focusing on it for the latter. Think of math texts as a bunch of weights and training devices you haven't picked up in a while. Avoid beating yourself up for not remembering the steps you had memorized back in the day for solving specific problems. That you don't recall them doesn't make you any less intelligent or capable. Just means you forgot the equivalent of some old recipes, you'll get them back very quickly and probably outpace your former self significantly. ",

Some years ago , I read about a study, which showed, that when somebody tries to solve a mathematical exercise then he is scared and as a consequence has a headache. You could say after reading this sentence, that it would be a good idea to stay away, because only somebody insane would stick to mathematics if he knew that. But, I am suggest you think the opposite way. Think of what kind of a person would end up solving those exercises. Exactly the kind of person that is willing to solve his problems no matter what, the kind of person that doesn\u2019t look for excuses and will stand on his feet. And guess how it feels, when you become that kind of person and successfully solve your exercises, easy or hard ones. Do you need something more than that in your life? ",

I started practicing a lot , and i rewarded myself everytime i understood something. Eventually you will get a hang of the process. If you just don\u2019t like it, i really don\u2019t think you can force yourself, but you can try to integrate Math into your everyday interests\u2014 if you like art, try implementing geometry.. if you like to animation, try coding and implementing your binary skill set Most of all, don\u2019t just force yourself to like it.. if you don\u2019t, let it go.

Now the STORY starts of my interest\u2026as when I promoted to class 10 my family promoted to me a coaching of maths [not less than the prison] where I have to sit for 2 hours daily and staring at the board with the different digits which has no meaning to my life But after one month of coaching maths teacher was replaced and a new jailor of the prison comes the new teacher\u2026of maths ..while solving the question he asked me a question. about the problem. But I cant answer and the teacher settles me down \u2026.i feel ashamed\u2026.n ot because I don't answer but my friend answers the same question I don't know how as he as so dumb at maths\u2026.more than me I thought\u2026then I thought about it and starts studying maths also then I have no interest but when I understand and solve the questions \u2026i take interest and here I am\u2026. Maths is a subject which is becomes very interesting when u understand.solve the more questions and questions.if u have no interest then I thought u don't want to understand or u don't have proper guidance\u2026just don't think that maths is harder or easier just try to understand you automatically grew interest\u2026 Again I say Maths is always intersting\u2026.\u2026. nothing can beat that\u2026 ",

The graph of e for example perfectly coincides with description if God, in the beginning(at x=0) there was One and then infinity happened. Math is nothing but our intellect distilled to it's purest that is why Math is NOT able to do anything at all with either 0 or Infinity because our intellect cannot handle either of these very well.

Therefore, prepare the first chapter which is in hand by doing a little more effort. Remembering the formula is most important in mathematics.

In the beginning, it was them flaunting their skills to solve the problems.And they\u2019d always be asking me to give it a try. I used to take the problem home, think over it. Because now it was a game, a competition. I had to win..I had to prove my superiority.. Now you are thinking over something completely new to you. There are two possibilities. First is that you get it right. In this case, you feel satisfied with your effort,along with a strange drive to test your limits. And so you go for another problem. Second possibility is you trying but failing at it. But when you get to know the solution and how close you got with it. You\u2019d want to give it another chance. This is what happened to me what kept me going. ",

However, many basic classes like linear algebra or calculus have a lot of applications in other fields--quite useful for anyone in STEM or simply interested in STEM. ",

You gain confidence in mathematics if you enjoy the solving problems. This is the only answer to you question. This answer is not limited to mathematics but valid for anything you want to learn. Try solving problems in mathematics. If you think, may be, that problems are boring then pick up some advance book on the same. Try to solve competitive problems. Try to explore the possibilities what you can do with the knowledge of mathematics. You can enter into data science field or towards research. All scientific problems, all science subjects like physics and chemistry required the knowledge of mathematics. By learning mathematics you can keep yourself out of the league of people who have mathematics anxiety. Mathematics is involved everywhere. You can learn mathematics for finance, or quantitative aptitude. You can enter into stock market if you are good with number. Although, you also required financial knowledge for the stock market. But all I am trying to say that learning the subject would not hurt you. And I think, this is enough to increase your interests for the subject. ",

I will begin with a simple idea: to appreciate a subject, start reading those biographies, or short notes at the end of the textbook, if they provide. They are an excellent source of wisdom, and the inspiration as of why are you even reading that topic. That will make you think more, as of how the original approach tot he problem was, and how the required formula became extant. Learn to read between the lines. Google things, don\u2019t be shy to look up those things which are a little more difficult concepts, even if you don\u2019t understand them (it s fine, though). Adopt this, and you\u2019re good to go. The only cons is that it needs a lot of patience. ",

This is such an open question that I will have to do a lot of guessing.:) Sounds like you lack interest in mathematics and, for some reason, think you should be more interested. Why would you think so? Why isn\u2019t your current level of interest in mathematics not satisfactory for you? Is it because some of the things you are interested in doing require mathematics? Or because of social pressure\u2014most techies around you seem more interested in mathematics? In other words, the main question should be, What is it that I want to achieve (learn, develop, execute)? Answering that will clarify for you where you stand with different areas of knowledge. ",

But solving these sums is the only way to score a decent marks in this subject. While solving sums, you can also listen to some soft music. Once I suggested the same thing for my sister. Now she is enjoying solving maths while listening to her favorite songs. You can also apply this trick. Solve minimum 50 sums in daily basis. Don't give up.

However, feeding curiosity with knowledge always creates only more interest; it's a recurring cycle. Most people lose interest in math because they face cumbersome formulae in early schooling. Once you start realising that math is only a mirror of the real world, you will find it challenging and rewarding to find mathematical solutions. Learning to understand, reason out and relate to abstract formulae and imagine mathematical scenarios does take effort, but the effort is overshadowed by the sense of accomplishment that follows. Depending on your age, you can explore and master different levels of mathematics to keep up your interest. Hope this answer helps! ",

If you try to get it right, right from the basics it will be much simpler and tactful.To understand it better, go step by step, trying to understand each annotation. Go into the depth of the subject, and believe me, you will start loving it.Try one easy question, look up the answer, get 10 answers right, and you'll be confident enough to get 50 in your next attempt. Don't lose your confidence, having said that, don't be too confident, and you'll make it out alive. Haha, happy learning :) ",

All through school it was just given a problem, generally a rediculously dumb problem, and was told how to solve it, then I would have a somewhat similar test question to solve. I believe that If during school I had some idea how why I need to know this and problems it solves, I would have been much more open to learning. Nothing against teachers, specifically high school and lower teachers, they just don't usually have any real world experience to teach from. ",

Once you hit gold on that front, you'll develop an interest to not only solve more sums but also solve sums in a much better/faster way. Most people view Calculus as the more difficult part of the syllabus in the ISC curriculum in India. It is, however, the reason I fell in love with Math. We are limited not by opportunities or time or abilities but by our laziness. I was pushed into solving not just one book but a total of 6 books (north of 700\u2013800 sums per topic to say the LEAST). With practise came perfection, and with perfection came the zeal to solve more and more problems. This is my story of how I fell in love with Math. To put it in a nutshell \u2014 I practised hard enough to not be baffled by - \u222b\u221a(tan x) dx Hope this helps. Cheers! ",

You should treat Math like a foreign language. You have to learn a new vocabulary and alphabet and practise it. Try and find fun ways to practise it if you can. However math is built up layer upon layer and becomes difficult for someone if their foundation is weak. I often found people who hate math do so because of a weakness in their foundation layers. It is too easy to skip over something you found difficult to understand or boring and then find that its required later on. I would suggest some assessment of your foundations and trying to strengthen them as it will make it easier. ",

Step 1-Before attempting questions do be thorough with the concept, this is something which i have been saying from quite a while(if you are having problem in understanding the concepts well then do refer to good teachers, good books, online vedios avaliable on you tube.) Step 2-After being thorough with the concept practice as many problems as you can,maths requries huge practice. Practice should contain quality as well as quantity problems. Step 3-Never undersistimate yourself, after learning concepts and solving problems there will be situation when you will not be able to solve some questions which others will be able to solve. Just keep practicing and never give up.. Best of luck\u2026 ",

It would get easier if you know the multiplication tables and additive pairs.Once you sink with the logic, you would automatically get interested in math.

I was pretty sure that I was going to fail in the exams as I was blank but then I gathered my courage and started practicing it.

That led me to find more Fibonacci patterns, more derivation, integration, and I was enjoying them, because I understood, and I worked harder in maths. But not really in a maths way but in a artistic way. What I suggest is don't force yourself to maths, but do it your way. If you like drawing look at maths related to that and go from there. This would apply to other interests as well. Once you do that it will be a breeze. ",

You are given pieces of information, a goal and the rules of game: that is the image of a unproven theorem in my mind. When it comes to solution of problems is nearly the same, because any problem is a very small bit of a theorem. Mathematics, therefore, makes you reason not only in an analytical but in a synthetical way. Then is some kind of training for the mind. Because of this, mathematics are not only numbers. Number theory, arithmetics and numerical calculations are only a tiny bit of the deal. Mathematics is also generalisation: what happens if you weaken your assumptions. Mathematics is also creativity: if you see that two apparently different mathematical objects share some formal behaviour, you ask if there is some connection and you create links between theories. Mathematics then gives you an advantage in the real world, not because you can calculate something, but because you can detect better misleading ideas, errors and fallacies. And you can avoid them better in your own reasoning. Isn\u2019t that very interesting? ",

Start with a topic that you actually quite enjoy doing; for example algebra (that\u2019s one of my favourites), then move onto the harder ones that aren\u2019t as fun. Sometimes working with/ against others also helps, because it gets you a little more fired up. Or\u2026 If you\u2019re a person who likes to do things for a reward, initiate a reward system, where the each math problem you do (and get right), you get something in return (it could be anything that will motivate you). Hope that helps. ",

Once you see the connections in math, it not only makes it more interesting but also worth exploring. You will find yourself asking why. Also remember, the original mathematicians were figuring out advanced problems at young ages, about 11 to 13 years old, mere children. If they could understand it, so can we. ",

After a while we reached the Geometry chapter about areas I tried to pull an answer of him. There was a revelation when he managed to answer correctly using only his intuition! After that he wanted to learn. Mathematics was now something in which he was good at. Something he understands and that's what makes something interesting. If you understand mathematics it is interesting. If you want to understand them, then again it's gonna be. However if you don't want to do anything with mathematics, it will remain an uninterested subject to you. ",

If you \u2018have\u2019 to learn to love it because your goals require it, I guess just put your mind to it, commit, get the best help via instructors or tutors, put time into understanding concepts via YouTube videos and tutorials\u2026.and push through your own limitations and biases to achieve your goals. *That* feels amazing, and is totally worth the effort. Good luck! ",

To begin building your equations, first you must declare variables. Let t be number of years, and x the amount of money in the account. Then, you start logically building your equations, before any interest, x =200, as that is your deposit. Then, after one year of interest, x = 200 * 1.05, sine you are gaining 5% interest. After two years, x = 200 *1.05*1.05. So it can be decided that x = 200*1.05^t. ",

I had a breakthrough with math one day when I found out that somebody figured out how to solve differential equations by exploiting the fact that an exponent is its own derivative. I thought that was BRILLIANT!  Suddenly math wasn't about learning formulas, it was things people had found, symmetries that they had understood. So for me the way to love it was when I saw that it was a way to find the abstract patterns in real things.  But I know different people love it for different reasons. Try and find out why they do, and one of their reasons will work for you. ",
