            "answer_text": "A Poisson distribution is one whose probability distribution is given by P(x) = [e^(-m) ]*[m^x]/x! , x = 0,1,2,3,\u2026, = 0 otherwise. m > 0 is the parameter of the distribution. For this distribution, mean = variance = m. This distribution is generally used to model a random variable X in situations where: i) the probability of occurrence of an event in a time interval of length h is a proportionate to h and is approximately say mh where m is the constant of proportionality ii) the probability of occurrence of two or more events in time interval of length h is negligible The variable X is the number of occurrences of the event in any fixed time interval, say t.
