            "answer_text": "Given tv price = 18500 Two discount 1)20% 2)5 % Lets find the first discounted price of a tv Tv price = 18500 Discount = 20% of 18500 Calculation = 20/100\u00d7 18500 Sum of discount price = 3700 Hence the actual price after deducting the 1st discount amount = 18500\u20133700 Sum of total 1st discounted price Of a tv = Rs.14800. Calculation of 2nd discount price Tv price of discounted amount = 14800 2nd discount rate 5% of 14800 Calculation = 5/100\u00d714800 We get the final discount amount of the tv= 740.
