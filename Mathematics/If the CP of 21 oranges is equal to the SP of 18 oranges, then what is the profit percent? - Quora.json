            "answer_text": "Simple job. Let cp of 21 oranges be 21 \u20b9 . So cp of one orange is \u20b91. Now sp of 18 oranges is 21, so one orange is sold for 21/18 i.e. 7/6 . so profit per orange is 7/6 -1= 1/6 So % profit will be 1/6 \u00d7100 =16.67. Otherwise there's profit of 3 oranges over 18 i.e.1/6 =16.67% ",
