            "answer_text": "A2A: When I took geometry in high school, I developed a mental block with regard to proofs. My dad walked me through the homework, problem by problem. My brain just wanted to turn it off. I felt like sleeping. But I had energy the moment we were finished. I barely passed geometry. In college I majored in physics. I wasn't required to take another geometry course until my junior or senior year. As a sophomore I tutored other students in a volunteer student-to-student tutoring center on campus. I tried to avoid tutoring geometry, but they had no one else for it, so I was asked to try anyway. My approach was to ask the right questions so that the student could discover the path to the solution. For a proof, I first asked whether the theorem seemed true. Then I asked why. Then I asked whether they had covered a particular theorem recently that might be useful. As I went through this process, the pressure was on the student and not on me. I noticed as I asked the questions that I already knew the answers. This surprised me, because I had been so bad at it before, and I had not learned any more geometry since then. Somehow I had learned the theorems and even when to apply them, without realising that I knew it. All I can say now is that there is a mood to get into. One has to stay calm, and transcend the text just a little. Think about where you are in the course, what has recently been taught. The exercise is likely designed to get you to use the most recent lesson. Richard Feynman had a good approach to theorems. With the first statement, he thought of an example. With each abstract statement he modified his mental example. In this way he had a quick intuition of its validity. If it happened to be false, he caught it quickly as his mental model provided a concrete counter-example. He describes this in more detail (and of course with examples) in his autobiography Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman!, in the chapter called \u201cA Different Box of Tools\u201d. ",

            "answer_text": "I used to suck at math. Like a LOT. I always try to get the passing mark and be done with it. That was me. But now I\u2019m different; I love math, especially Calculus. Here\u2019s what I can tell you after about 3/2 years of studying math extensively. Try not to remember formulas. Instead, what you should try is to find out how do those formulas came about? Every kind of operation you do in math is logical. For example, you can solve for x in 3x+5=0 by simply subtracting 5 from both sides the equation and subsequently dividing it by 3 which gets you to - 5/3, this is a completely legitimate thing to do because no rules are broken; the equality still holds. Try to be a skeptic when someone shows you a formula they think is true. Ask them how did they get formula(though I suggest you to do this within the confines of the internet world or with someone who tolerates this because your school teacher and friends might get tired of you).Important thing is to not only realize your mistakes but to ask whether or not can you recover from these mistakes. I used to be so down about my mathematical abilities; some students are just better at it than me. You have the ones who\u2019re born with it and the ones who worked hard for it. That\u2019s how it\u2019ll be. Can\u2019t do anything about it, reality is unfair. What matters is that is what you\u2019re learning enough to help you achieve your goals? If yes, great. If not, learn more. Learning is a journey, you\u2019ll spend a lot of time in that journey so try to allocate your time carefully. Don\u2019t dwell on the past too much. It\u2019s a waste of time. And time is not a luxury.Visualize more. I can\u2019t stress you enough how important this is to me. Yeah I get it, imagining mathematical expressions in your head won\u2019t give you the answer you wanted. True. But what it does give you is the intuition on how to get that answer you wanted; an approximation. Solving inequalities like |x+3|> 4x^2 +9x + 4 with your rough sketch in your mind can really help you solve them. This is really helpful. Seriously.If you have doubts, verify them. In math, we\u2019re very strict about our definitions. Don\u2019t bottle up your doubts, it\u2019ll accumulate more and more if you do. This could spell disaster as you\u2019re learning math because you now have \u201choles\u201d in your arguments . This could\u2019ve been avoided if you had just ask the questions you wanted. Keep this up, and you\u2019ll hit a \u201cwall\u201d during your mathematical studies which will impede you from gaining progress.Well that\u2019s all the advice I can offer you. The journey never ends, man. Just like you, I still have a lot to learn. ",
