I guess she\u2019s afraid you\u2019ll get a swelled head. Or maybe the two of you are just into a competition of who is smartest. Not a good idea for a good relationship. Focus on living rather than on proving to her (and yourself) that you\u2019re smart. Your question demonstrates intelligence. You\u2019re fine and don\u2019t need her approval. She\u2019ll never give it anyway. I\u2019m sorry about that, because we all want our mother\u2019s approval. I know, because I desperately sought it but never got it from mine. ",
