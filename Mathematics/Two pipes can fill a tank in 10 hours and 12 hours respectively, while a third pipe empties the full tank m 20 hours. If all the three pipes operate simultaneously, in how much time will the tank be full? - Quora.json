            "answer_text": "Let two filling pipes be A and B, draining pipe is C. Given that pipe A can fill a tank in 10 hours => In one hour it fills 1/10th part of the tank ( by cross multiplication method) And pipe B can fill a tank in 12 hours => In one hour it fills 1/12th part of the tank. And also given pipe C empties the tank in 20 hours => in one hour it empties 1/20th part. If all three pipes operate simultaneously work done by both pipes A and B in one hour will be added and C work is subtracted. Therefore work done by three pipes in one hour = 1/10 + 1/12 -1/20 = 8/60 In 1 hour 8/60th part of a tank can be filled. Then complete tank can be filled in 60/8 = 7.5hrs ( by cross multiplication) ",
