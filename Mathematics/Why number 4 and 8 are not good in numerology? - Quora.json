            "answer_text": "My answer is based on personal observation of acquaintances who are leading happy lives for me there\u2019re no bad numbers, any planet from (1\u20139) can be defective if it\u2019s on negative side We humans take birth due to our karma and got many things to do wave off the past negative karma, now coming to ur question everybody are scared of this sacred numbers, people are scared bcz they don\u2019t know how to make these numbers positive especially 4 & 8 people who don\u2019t know the magic or logic of these numbers are scared but who know what exactly it\u2019s are successful n sometimes even we call them as enlightened. So only a proper right knowledge helps, number 4 & 8 are magical numbers and these numbers can only get success when they follow their own right path, 4 believes in smart work and 8 believes in hard work, the more 4 gains knowledge and work on it they\u2019re successful as it\u2019s related to work with brains, coming to 8 it wants to become infinity unless physical work is applied, so it\u2019s better successful when 8 involves in physical activities. These numbers can negate the struggle when they\u2019re spiritual whole hearted following the right and correct path and they should stick to justice, if not they\u2019ll will be corrupted n disaster, so these numbers need to stick to spiritual practice with a positive note n later they\u2019ll get unexpected treasure where they become game changers to the world, these numbers are like Lord or Devil, when they\u2019re positive with good heart they\u2019re Lord if not they get stucked up with negative n act as devil with wicked mind. According to my observation people with these numbers being on a positive right path gained overnight success, like he worked today and next week they\u2019re on a top position with treasure, I have seen failures as well when they didn\u2019t choose right path, some were gangsters even , these karmic numbers stick to self realisation as they\u2019re pretty closely connected, I have seen a guy who\u2019s highly influenced with number 4 struggled during school n now he\u2019s millionaire within short span of time after realisation. There\u2019re many examples but can\u2019t type here, so what I conclude here is these number born or people keeping these numbers need to correct themselves as much as possible n follow the right flow of energy having faith in God , believe Me they\u2019ll be successful very fast and even we couldn\u2019t expect as it will be shocking for us lol, so leave the misconceptions and better we accept that we aren\u2019t much aware with right knowledge of numbers ",

            "answer_text": "WHO ARE NUMEROLOGY NUMBER 4 & NUMBER 8? 1 / 10  Who are number 4 & number 8? All those born on the 4th, 13th, 22nd or 31st are number 4 people. All those born on the 8th, 17th or 26th are number 8 people. NUMBER 4 & NUMBER 8 ARE NUMBERS OF KARMA 2 / 10  It is said that tough times follow number 4 and 8 individuals and those with these two numbers of karma, fate and destiny as their birth numbers will find these two numbers following them lifelong. As a general rule, these numbers create delays, hardships and many erratic and abrupt changes in their native's lives. On the flip side, their positive attributes are stronger and more potent than any of the other single numbers. UNDERSTANDING NUMBER 8 3 / 10  8 is the higher octave of 4 and contain twice the strength of the single 4: 4+4=8. 4 and 8 individuals are said to have chosen the magnetic birth channels of these numbers to neutralize and fulfil long-standing Karmic obligations by being placed in involuntary situations where past karmas can be balanced in present incarnation. DOS AND DON'TS FOR 4 & 8 4 / 10  Every other birth or psychic number save number 4 and 8 is advised to increase its power and take dates, names, house numbers etc. that make the value of their own number. 4 and 8 are advised not to increase their vibrations, instead, 4 should use the series of 1, 2 and 7 and 8 should use the series of 1, 3, 5 and 6. 4 VS 8 NUMEROLOGY NUMBER 5 / 10  If an 8 man marries a woman born on the 4th, 13th, 22nd or 31st of any month or whose name totals to 4, he is sure to face marital problems and it is most unlikely that the marriage will last, likewise vice versa. If an 8 man marries an 8 woman or vice versa, chances are this combination will enjoy longevity. NUMBER 4 SHOULDN'T MARRY A NUMBER 4! 6 / 10  4 marrying 4 could be harrowing as both are outlaws, revolutionaries, atomic and hedonistic. Number 4 women are more number 4 than number 4 men; they are more promiscuous, headstrong, dominating and times even cruel, they love to make people dance to their tunes, this is especially true if they are born in Aries or Scorpio. NUMBERS 4 & 8 WILL SIRE CHILDREN IN THE SAME SERIES 7 / 10  4 and 8 Individuals born either in April, i.e. 4th month or August, i.e. 8th month, will generally sire children in the same series. The vibration of 4 and 8 increases if the individuals are born in the sun sign of Capricorn or Aquarius since 8 is the number of Saturn who rules Capricorn and 4 is the number of Uranus who rules Aquarius. NUMBER 4 & 1 ARE CLOSELY ASSOCIATED 8 / 10  Number 4 is closely associated with number 1 and is written as 1-4 which is the number of the Sun. Number 4 individuals should use the dynamism of number 1 as much as possible. They should select important dates, names, house and car numbers and even partners that have 1, 10, 19, 28 for their numbers. The interchangeable numbers for number 4 are 2 and 7 and their series. WHAT IF NUMBER 8 CROPS UP IN NUMBER 4'S LIFE? 9 / 10  If number 8 should crop up in their lives as a vital number, number 4 should avoid the 2 and 7 series. 4 should neither increase the power of 4 nor take on the vibrations of 8. KING AND THE PAUPER 10 / 10  Number 8 is more powerful, fatalistic and dynamic than number 4 which makes it nobler, more self-sacrificing, hard working, sincere, loyal and trustworthy than any of the other numbers but also the least rewarded and appreciated of the lot. 8 is the only number that makes a king of a pauper or a pauper of a king ",
