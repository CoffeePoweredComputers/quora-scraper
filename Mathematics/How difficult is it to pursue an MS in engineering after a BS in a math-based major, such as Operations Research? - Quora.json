            "answer_text": "As I have stated in other answers when you desire to enroll in a graduate program different than your undergraduate major there will be certain prerequisites/background courses that an admissions committee will want to see. Just spot checking what a Mathematics major (Applied) at Cal Poly might have, I discovered an Applied Mathematics major at Cal Poly could take ME 211 (Statics) and ME 212 (Dynamics). Similarly a Statistics Major at CAL had some discretionary leeway as to choosing Cluster Courses (3 cluster courses - CAL expects them to be taken as a cluster with obvious relation to each other not an academic potluck). What I would expect to see of a BS in Operations Research would be to have Thermodynamics, Heat Transfer, a Material Science course, Statics, Dynamics, and possibly Fluid Dynamics, or Circuit Analysis (depending on which specialization in Engineering). If Electrical Engineering then Transmission Lines - use of a Smith chart, transistor circuits. So yes it is possible but a thoughtful backfilling of courses is necessary. ",

            "answer_text": "Depends on the school and on the strength and content of your undergraduate courses. I doubt that any reputable graduate school in electrical or mechanical engineering wil admit you without extensive undergraduate courses in their specific fields of knowledge. With an undergraduate OR or Math degree, you might be more eligible for a degree in Computer Science if you have extensive coursework in modeling and simulation as well as coding experience in two or more computer languages. You might want to consider terminal professional MS degrees in engineering management or even in OR itself.
