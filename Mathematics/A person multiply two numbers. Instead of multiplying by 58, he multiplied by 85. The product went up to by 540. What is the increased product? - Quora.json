            "answer_text": "Friends..! Let the number to which he has to multiply be X On multiplying with 58, this numver would have given 58 \u00d7 X But on multiplying with 85, it had given 85 \u00d7 X The product went up to by 540. According (85 \u00d7 X) - (58 \u00d7 X) = 540 85X - 58X = 540 27X = 540 X = 540/27 X = 20 The number was 20 On nultiplying with 58 it has to give 58 \u00d7 20= 1160 but it had given 85 \u00d7 20 = 1700 This the increased product was 1700 Answer the increased product was 1700 To check the correctness of answer, substrating required product from increased product, which should be 540 1700 - 1160 = 540 540 = 540 Means answer is correct ",
