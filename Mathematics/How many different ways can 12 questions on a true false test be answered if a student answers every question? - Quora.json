            "answer_text": "Um, permutations. Been a long time since I had to bother with these. You can work these out intuitively, though. If you say that there\u2019s only one question, then there\u2019s two possible ways. If you add another question in, there\u2019s now another two possible ways, and you have to multiply them. That\u2019s four. So you get TT,TF,FT,FF Aha, because a pattern emeges. Try three- that\u2019s another two possible ways, and 2 by 2 by 2 is eight: TTT, TTF, TFT,FTT, FFF,FTF, FFT, TFF. Right. It\u2019s powers of two, then. So for 12 you do 2^12 and get 4096. So many ways to get a fail! ",
