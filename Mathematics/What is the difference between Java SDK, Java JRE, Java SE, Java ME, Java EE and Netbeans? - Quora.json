            "answer_text": "SDK stands for 'Software Development Kit', a developers tools that enables one to write the code with more more ease, effectiveness and efficiency as there are a lot of APIs that make programmers work easy. SDKs come for various languages. The SDK for Java is called as JDK, the Java Development Kit. So by saying SDK for Java you are actually referring to the JDK. The Java Runtime Environment (JRE) is a set of software tools for development of Java applications .It provides the libraries, the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), and other components to run applications written in the Java programming language. Java SE refers to Java Standard Edition. This is a programming platform for Core Java. It contains all the libraries and APIs for java programs. Java EE refers to Java Enterprise Edition. This is a programming platform for Advance Java. It includes a variety of libraries in it that are HTML , XML, JDBC etc. It includes APIs for Enterprise javabeans, Servlets, Java Server Pages etc. Java ME refers to Java Micro Edition. This is the platform for developing applications for mobile devices and embedded systems such as set-top boxes. Java ME provides a subset of the functionality of Java SE, but also introduces libraries specific to mobile devices. NetBeans is a software development platform written in Java. Although the NetBeans IDE is designed specifically for Java developers, it also supports C/C++, PHP, and HTML5 in addition to Java , Javascript and JavaFX. ",

            "answer_text": "The JDK forms an extended subset of a software development kit (SDK). It includes \"tools for developing, debugging, and monitoring Java applications\". Oracle strongly suggests to now use the term JDK to refer to the Java SE Development Kit. JavaSE: is the standard edition, it is usually a good fit for client side software, normal applications, etc. JavaME: is the mobile edition, it is what small games on old phones was made with, but it's basically a \"smaller\" version of Java suitable for very low capacity processors. JavaEE: is the \"enterprise edition\". It is used to develop server side stuff, so it includes a lot of libraries used on server side. Netbeans: NetBeans is a software development platform written in Java. The NetBeans Platform allows applications to be developed from a set of modular software components called modules. Applications based on the NetBeans Platform, including the NetBeans integrated development environment (IDE), can be extended by third party developers ",
