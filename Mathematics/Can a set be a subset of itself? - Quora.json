            "answer_text": "Technically speaking, every set is a subset of itself, in the same way that every integer is divisible by itself. What you\u2019re talking about is a \u2018proper subset\u2019- a subset that is not the whole set. And in that case, no, by definition a proper subset cannot be equal to the whole set. In some versions of set theory, a set can be a member of itself, though. For example, the set of all sets is itself a set. However, these versions of set theory come with problems and paradoxes, specifically Russell\u2019s paradox: if we try to create the \u2018set of all sets that do not contain themselves as elements\u2019 we find it is a logical contradiction. There are ways around this issue but it can be a bit awkward. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, a set is always considered a subset of itself, a proper subset, however, cannot contain all of the elements of its parent set. Someone else will provide the formal proof of such. Where P is a subset or = Q. If P = Q then Q is a subset or = Q. It follows that Q is not necessarily, but sufficiently, a subset of Q. In my opinion if we considered a set S to define the exclusive whole of its elements, then S* might define \u201cS being qua being,\u201d an ontological affirmation of the set S as existent in and of itself.
