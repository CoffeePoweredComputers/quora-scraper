            "answer_text": "Industries and businesses who deal with international trade have to use metric measurements because the rest of the world does. So US business in general already uses it. It seems the general population of the US will resist forever. Being isolated in the world doesn\u2019t bother Americans. In Canada , we switched to metric in 1975 . Those who started school after that learned to live in a metric world and it seems natural to them . Those of us who were already out of school had to learn some conversion tricks to quickly convert from one to the other in our minds . Temperature and mileage/speed are fairly simple to convert. After 43 years of metric though , all people still say they are 5\u20328 instead of 176 centimeters for some reason. Even those brought up in metric. Millimeters to inches/feet is the hardest one to learn for most people. I learned the imperial measurements but by daughter started school in 1976 and only knows metric , so I always have to explain what something 50 feet away means in metric . Weather forecasts are a pain , I never know the temperature or wind speed without having to calculate the conversion. It\u2019s a bit confusing but in another generation or two , us dinosaurs will be gone and everyone left will be fluent in metric. It made packaging easier and cheaper for industries instead of one size for domestic use and another size for export. Less confusion and less chance of error also for airports having to convert gallons to liters when planes land from foreign countries. So, to switch systems and join the rest of the world, it has to start at the elementary school level then go up a grade every year, then slow but sure after 50 years or so , the conversion will be almost complete for the general public. It certainly isn\u2019t a fast process . Packaging and road signs changed over night and gas was suddenly sold in liters instead of gallons. For about a year as I recall , speed signs were in both , then the old ones were removed. Speedometers in cars since 1975 all show speed in kilometers with a second smaller ring on the inside showing miles , like many thermometers show both C & F . I don\u2019t think the American education system is even up to it so don\u2019t count on a metric conversion happening soon. The US education system has enough problems trying to stay in the top 20 in the world without adding something that many find complicated. ",

            "answer_text": "We have to distinguish between the American scientific community and the average American. In science, the metric system is already widely in use because of its evident advantages. The \u201caverage\u201d American however still mainly uses imperial units for everyday life and isn\u2019t used to metric units. I\u2019m not American so I don\u2019t know if this is changeing or if there are regional differences. I postulate however the metric system will eventually take hold and become more and more prevalent in the USA and part of American everyday life. Simply because of its many advantages and because of pressure from science, industry, and the rest of the world. The metric units are clearly and internationally defined (SI-units), as opposed to the imperial units which often don\u2019t have exact definitions but use certain artefacts as reference which can change under different temperatures and pressures etc., and also can change from region to region. Indeed, the only way to clearly define an imperial unit is to define it with metric units as a reference.The rest of the world, and all modern scientific research, uses the metric system. It's much easier if everyone has the same units. Because the US is involved in so much forefront research and development, it is especially important for them to use the metric system.In scientific publications, it is often required to use metric units in any recognised scientific journal.The metric system is just a lot more practical and easier to use. Conversions and calculations are much more straight-forward.The main obstacle to change, of course, is that the imperial measurements are so thoroughly ingrained into the minds of Americans. Much effort and time is be needed to make the population more familiar with the metric system. But with increasing pressure from science, industry and the rest of the world, it is only a question of time. ",
