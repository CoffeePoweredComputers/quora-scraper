            "answer_text": "What kind of answer are you looking for? I will have to assume that you are expecting to find the simplified form of the given equation, since I myself did go through the struggle of learning the FOIL method back in high school and am very familiar with that equation. FOIL stand for First, Out, In, Last. Begin by multiplying the first terms of each factor [math](a+b)\\times(c-d)=a\\times c...[/math] Next, multiply the outer terms of the equation,which is a and d and add it to what we currently have. [math](a+b)\\times(c-d)=a\\times c-a\\times d...[/math] Now multiply the inner terms of the equation, which is b and c and add it to what we currently have. [math](a+b)\\times(c-d)=a\\times c-a\\times d+b\\times c...[/math] Lastly, multiply the last terms of each factor and add to what we have. [math](a+b)\\times(c-d)=a\\times c-a\\times d+b\\times c-b\\times d[/math] Simplify the equation by adding like terms. Your choice of which terms to combine is up to you. It\u2019ll return the same result as any other valid combinations. ",
