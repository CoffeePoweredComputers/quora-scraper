            "answer_text": "Depends on what you want to do with it. Using a telescope and looking at the sky requires no math whatsoever, and even discovering new celestial objects using one is just a matter of recording exactly where and when you saw something. There is a lot of math involved in predicting where the objects will be in the future, but you can always leave that part to other people. I took a course in \u201cdescriptive astronomy\u201d in college that had some math, but not very much. Such a class isn\u2019t a path to becoming a professional astronomer, but it will help you understand the universe better. Some parts of it do have numbers, but the numbers aren\u2019t particularly hard. As the Hitchhiker\u2019s Guide to the Galaxy says, \u201cSpace is big. Really big.\u201d It doesn\u2019t require much math to understand that point. If you want to be a professional astronomer, then you are the one who will be making the predictions, and that does require quite a bit of math (typically a degree in physics). If that\u2019s where your interest lies, you can take the goal as a motivation to get better at mathematics. No one is born being good at math, and it is never too late to progress. ",

            "answer_text": "If you want to major in astronomy, your math skills will have to be on point. You're going to have to learn quantum physics, general and special relativity, theoretical mechanics, celestial mechanics, thermodynamics, optics, you name it. You'll have to be able to solve complex differential equations. If you want to have astronomy as a hobby, I recommend just knowing basic algebra and trigonometry. ",
