            "answer_text": "Can we imagine solving a game theory problem using a physical system of connected vessels and the mechanics of fluid flow?  For example, there is this famous bankruptcy problem from the Talmud which remained a mystery for a long time until Aumann and Maschler (1985) claimed to have solved it. Their mathematical explanation is quite rigorous. However, if you solve the same problem using hydraulic rationing, one can understand it easily. It is a nice way of solving a game theory problem in which: a player is replaced by a vesselutility values are replaced by equivalent amounts of a fluidstrategic interactions/sharing of payoffs are governed by pressure difference and capillary actionsgame theoretic axioms are internalised in the design aspects of the connected vesselsA good game theory project could be to analyse and solve many other popular games using hydraulic rationing.
