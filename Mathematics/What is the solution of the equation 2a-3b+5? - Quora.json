            "answer_text": "2a - 3b + 5 is NOT an equation! An equation is a mathematical statement which says that two things are equal, e.g., 2x + 3y = 8; however, the given expression, 2a - 3b + 5, is, instead, an algebraic expression which cannot be simplified any further; therefore, there's nothing to solve for unless and until the expression is set equal to something, e.g., 2a - 3b + 5 = 10, and, even then, with just one equation given, you can only solve for one of the variables in terms of the other variable, for example, solving for a in terms of b: 2a - 3b + 5 = 102a - 3b + 5 - 5 = 10 - 52a - 3b = 52a - 3b + 3b = 5 + 3b2a = 5 + 3b(2a)/2 = (5 + 3b)/2(1)a = (5 + 3b)/2 a = (5 + 3b)/2 If instead, you mean, \"What is the VALUE of the expression 2a - 3b + 5?\", then the value of this expression would depend upon the value assigned to \"a\" and the value assigned to \"b\". In other words, to evaluate the given expression, you must first know what the values are for the variables \"a\" and \"b\". For example, let a = 10 and b = 2, then: 2a - 3b + 5 = 2(10) - 3(2) + 5  = 20 - 6 + 5 = 14 + 5 = 19 is the result or the value of the given expression when a = 10 and b = 2. ",

            "answer_text": "This is an expression, not an equation. It doesn't assert that some expression is equal to some other expression or value. In the same way, [math]x^2-4[/math] is an expression and so cannot be \u201csolved\u201d, but [math]x^2-4=0[/math] is an equation that had two solutions x=2 and x=-2. Back now to your expression. If you intended to ask for a solution of the equation [math]2a-3b+5=0[/math] then in fact there are infinitely many solution because you have given us an expression with two variables a & b. If we play around with that equation a bit we can rewrite it as [math]3b=2a+5[/math] or [math]b=(2a+5)/3[/math]. Then if you pick an arbitrary value for a, let's say a=2 then we can solve for b and deduce that b= 3. And we can do the same thing with any real number as the value of a. ",
