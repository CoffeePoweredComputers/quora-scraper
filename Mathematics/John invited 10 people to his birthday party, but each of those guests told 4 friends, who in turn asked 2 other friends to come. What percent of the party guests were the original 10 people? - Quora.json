            "answer_text": "There is no way to determine that with the information presented. Inviting people doesn\u2019t mean they will actually show up, and the question doesn\u2019t state that any of them or any friends who were told about the party showed up. There is also no indication if any of these \u2018friends\u2019 were shared between the original 10 invited people and given social circles it\u2019s likely many of these friends were not unique and were told about the party by different invitees or their friends. Furthermore, simply telling someone about a party is not the same as an invitation. Unless of course the \u2018friends\u2019 are an irresponsible student who can\u2019t do their own homework and a rumor was spread that there were no parents at the party. In that case you can assume the answer approaches 0, as John\u2019s home is overrun by uninvited guests. So the real question is\u2026 How many kegs will John need to buy and how much will he need to charge at the door as a cover charge to pay for the kegs and the cleanup/repairs after the party. Show your work. (Work should not consist of: \u2018I asked a random stranger on the internet and they said\u2026.) ",

I may be wrong cause sometimes i missed out important details lul~~ ",
