To prove the triangle inequality and checking when the equality holds, we use the following fact For [math]m,n \\in \\R^+; m<n \\iff m^2<n^2[/math] Thus, to prove the triangle inequality ; it suffices to verify : [math]\\:\\:\\:\\:\\:\\:\\:\\:\\:|a+b|^2\\leq \\big(|a|+|b|\\big)^2[/math] [math]\\iff a^2+2ab+b^2\\leq a^2+b^2+2|ab|[/math] [math]\\iff ab\\leq |ab|\\:[/math](This is true.) Now in the above inequality, equality holds if and only if [math]ab\\geq 0.[/math] We simply used the fact that for [math]x\\in \\R; |x|\\geq x \\:[/math]and that [math]|x|=x [/math]if and only if [math]x\\geq 0.[/math]Retracing our inequalities bottom to top, the triangle inequality is proved with equality holding if and only if [math]\\:ab\\geq 0 . \\:\\blacksquare[/math] ",
