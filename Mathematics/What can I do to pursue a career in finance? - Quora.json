            "answer_text": "Start with some internal reflection. \u201cWhy do I want a career in finance?\u201d is a good place to start. Finance attracts young people that are eager to make big money, but it only retains those that are truly interested in solving financial problems. The first few years are a grind, and it\u2019s almost like a weeding out process. You\u2019ll make ok money early on, but it takes a lot of self-discipline and self-motivation to focus on the deep work that will move you forward. If you\u2019re still convinced that this is the right career for you, spend a lot of time learning the players. Figure out where you\u2019d like to work. Not just the company, but also understand what each division in the company does and how that aligns with your interests. For example, if you like agriculture, find the division of Goldman Sachs that makes farm loans. Then start befriending people in the industry. Networking can be a daunting task, but look at it with a long-term view. You must focus on relationship as opposed to a hiring transaction. The people you meet now could end up being clients or colleagues in the future so treat them like friends. Focus on adding value in every interaction. That should be enough to get you started. Once you\u2019re in, keep up with a relationship-centered networking strategy and make ample time for learning and professional development. The early years can be very administratively demanding so keep the development time sacrosanct. ",

            "answer_text": "Well I assume you are in India. Since you already have some job experience it is a worthwhile idea to explore the possibility of doing MBA especially if you can get admitted to one of the top 20\u201325 institutes. Another option, if you are not too old, which I presume you are not from your question you could directly try for a Bank Probationary Officer exam. You probably could join some good coaching institute and prepare for CAT & Bank PO exam at the same time. To some extent preparing for one will help in preparing for the other. Without a basic knowledge of accounting I wouldn't suggest CA or CFA. Depending on your age a few years in a Public sector bank followed by MBA could also be a great career booster in this field. I have no personal knowledge of other banks but from SBI every year a few officers get selected in one of the top 3 IIMS and they are mostly doing quite well. ",
