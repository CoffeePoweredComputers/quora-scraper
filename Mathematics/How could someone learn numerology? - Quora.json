You can learn more about numerology here: Numerology Calculator- The history of numerology calculation The basic use is to find your name meaning and your birth date meaning, but numerology can be used for much more than that. You can use numerology to find out your personality number, which basically tells you how others perceive your personality. Your heart number will tell you about your hopes and dreams for the future. You can calculate the name of another person to find out their compatibility to you, or whether or not this person could be your soul mate. Different days of the month have different energies based on their number, and different times of the day do as well. Numerology can tell you what day of the month is best for certain activities such as looking for a job or going on vacation. Different times of the day have their own energies as well, and using numerology can help you decide what time is best to, say, go shopping. Different modalities include combining numerology and astrology to give more information about your birth date, your current situations and your life path, as well as how other people figure in to your life as family members, friends, lovers etc.  There is a system of numerology that combines your soul number and your personality number to different colors in an exploration of creativity in your life. For this, different numbers correspond to different colors, and the idea that you can use color to enhance your life in many ways. Another area that combines two popular methods of life improvement is to combine numerology with gemstones and crystals. Many people believe that the energies of gemstones can enhance our lives, and one mode of numerology combines numbers with corresponding gemstones and crystals. This will enhance the energy of your particular number and the energy of the gemstone that goes with it. People use numerology to help them with many of life\u2019s tough decisions. If you are unemployed, then using numerology to help you know what day to look for a particular job, or even what type of job would be the best for you can give you a leg up. People have changed their names, both first and last names, in order to achieve more harmony and luck. People who play games have used numerology to help them win. Is that great new person you met the one for you? Do a compatibility reading of your name and theirs. Some people will choose a place to live based on the street or apartment number. Numerology is giving sense out of a person\u2019s life. If you believe in the power that numbers have then using them to your advantage only makes sense. You must simply choose the model of numerology that makes the most sense to you and begin to understand how to use it. It just makes good sense to use a numerology calculator to help you do this, to avoid mistakes that can give you a false result.  ",

            "answer_text": "Your best start is to calculate the basic numbers of your name and birth date. Any Numerology book will do to start. You will better off with the Numerology chapter of my book \"The Cycle of Growth\" for the meanings because there is a lot of disagreement in Numerology books, and the planet associations are mainly wrong. You need to study the planets and their related Zodiac Signs to get to the meanings. From there you will need to devise your own system. Start with yourself and relatives and friends. Numerology was one of the subjects that I found difficult to understand be reading the older books because there was so much disagreement. By comparing different areas of study, and using modern scientific discoveries, I have been able to reconcile differences where authorities on the subject disagree as well as arrive at new concepts not found anywhere else. Also, we cannot understand Numbers without referring to basic Mathematics and the relationship with the Creation of our universe.  Numerology began before the discovery of Uranus, Neptune, and Pluto. Until now it has been difficult to associate the Numbers with the \"new\" Planets. We can now correctly relate ALL the planets to Numbers. You will note that they appear in the order of their positions in relationship to Earth. This discovery was made from reference to The Kabbalah Tree of Life. ========================================================== Here is a brief outline from my book \"The Cycle of Growth\".  NUMBER ZERO  (Neptune. Evening. Dissolving. Sea. Collective Unconscious. Society as a whole) My 40 years research in comparing Numerology with other subjects like Modern Physics, Mathematics, Big Bang Theory, Astrology,  - and a lot of other things - has brought to light that we need to first consider Number Zero as the origin of all the other numbers. Number Zero did not come into use until around 7 AD. Evidence for this is that there is no \"Year Zero\". 1 BC is followed by 1 AD.  We have to go back to BEFORE the beginning of Creation when everything was a single whole. Everything was in balance, and static.  We have clues to what this means from the empirical scientists' description of The Big Bang and the Biblical story in Genesis - which, in a recent scientific BBC TV programme (September 2015), was given a \"B+\" grade. Number Zero was a relatively recent \"discovery\" at around 7 AD. It did not exist before then. For example, there is no \"Year Zero\". 1 BC is followed by 1 AD. Number Zero has only fully developed to become a number in its own right in the Computer Age. Number Zero relates to Neptune. The Astrological associations of this planet are completely in line with Number Zero. Genesis Chapter 1 - (\"Young's Literal Translation\") 1. In the beginning of God's preparing the heavens and the earth 2. the earth hath existed waste and void, and darkness [is] on the face of the deep, and the Spirit of God fluttering on the face of the waters, NUMBER 1  (Pluto. Conception. Positive Force. Nuclear Reaction) Number 1 is the first stage of Creation. This Stage was the appearance of a Singularity - Number 1 - which is a single point in the midst of the circle of no-thing. In Mathematics, a point has no dimensions. There was also a lot of energy produced which powers the expansion of our universe. Genesis Chapter 1  3. and God saith, `Let light be;' and light is. 4. And God seeth the light that [it is] good, and God separateth between the light and the darkness, 5. and God calleth to the light `Day,' and to the darkness He hath called `Night;' and there is an evening, and there is a morning day one. (The description of Creation in Chapter 1 continues in accordance with scientific evolutionary theory until Creation Day 6 when \"man and woman\" are created. We note that \"man\" as Adam - and Eve from Adam - did not come into being until Chapter 2. This is important in seeing the relationship between Mars and Number 4) We note that having produced \"Light\" (expansive Energy) it was necessary to have \"Darkness\" (Matter) to restore the original Zero balance [1 + (-1) = 0]. Einstein stated that energy and matter are really the same \"thing\". E = MC squared. We note that later on in Genesis, each of 7 \"days\" (cycles of time) of Creation produced 2 separate entities that require an \"EVEN-ING\", after which there could be another cycle (\"day\"). Scientists state that the first chemical element formed was Hydrogen (Atomic Number 1). Number 1 relates to Pluto, and its associations with Nuclear Energy. This energy in suns of the universe is still converting Hydrogen to heavier elements. NUMBER 2  (Saturn.Form. Negative force. Gravity. Structure. Building) Number 2 is the creation of Negative Polarity to balance the original Positive release of energy. We now have 2 forms of energy, and 2 Polarities which determine future development. Positive Expansion (Energy) and Negative Gravity (Matter. Form). The Bible calls the latter \"Darkness\".   At this stage of Creation all the matter in the universe (Hydrogen) existed as a kind of fluid, shapeless, \"soup\". Light would not be able to penetrate it. As the universe expanded there was a separation between Space and Matter as Gravity acted on the Hydrogen, and it began to collect together in clumps, which began to heat up as a result. At a certain stage the temperature became high enough for nuclear reaction to begin, and Stars were formed. Within these stars Hydrogen began to be converted to Helium (Atomic Number 2) - and eventually from there to all the other elements. This is still continuing today, with 74% of the matter in the universe still existing as Hydrogen and 24% Helium in stars. In Mathematics 2 points are needed to form a Line - which has only 1 dimension - Length. Number 2 relates to Saturn/Satan and its associations with the negativity of \"The Devil\" and Materialism challenging \"The Light of God\". NUMBER 3  (Jupiter. Expansive force. Social activity) Number 3 is the creation of a 3rd. principle as a result of the inter-action between 1 and 2. So \"Father\" and \"Mother\" produce a \"Child\" which is the relationship between them. Although 1 and 2 are \"opposites\" they cannot re-combine to make Zero because they are now separated by Time and Space due to expansion. So a chain reaction has begun. In Mathematics 3 points are required to define a 2 dimensional Plane which has Length and Breadth - but no Height. Number 3 relates to Jupiter - which is in accordance with traditional Numerology.  NUMBER 4  (Mars. Focused Energy. Individuality ) Number 4 comes as a result of the creation of Number 3. There is a new imbalance in the universe which requires \"even-ing\" to a Zero Balance.  In Mathematics 4 points are required to define a 3 dimensional object. We now have a solid object. Although Creation Day 4 in Genesis was concerned with the creation of physical Sun, Moon, and Stars, Number 4 also relates to the planet Mars as the 4th. planet in our Solar System after Pluto, Neptune, Saturn and Jupiter. Number 4 also relates to the creation of Adam in Genesis Chapter 2. That is, the first human being. NUMBER 5 (Sun. Creativity. Ego) NUMBER 6 (Venus. Attraction. Desire) NUMBER 7 (Mercury. Mental energy. Mind) NUMBER 8 (Moon. Mother. Soul. Home) NUMBER 9 (Earth. Matter. The final result) NUMBER 11 (Uranus. Individuality) Number 11 needs mention here. You will note that I have excluded Uranus, which is ruler of Aquarius, the 11th. Zodiac Sign. I have ascribed Number 11 to Uranus.  My book explains the reason for this, but, basically :- 1. Number 11 has always had a special place in Numerology because it can be kept as such, or reduced to Number 2. Until now, no-one can explain why. 2. Before the discovery of Uranus, Saturn was ruler of the 10th. Sign Capricorn AND 11th. Sign Aquarius. 3. I have ascribed Number 2 to Saturn/Satan as the negative polarity of The Big Bang. Gravity attracts us to Earth. 4. Uranus applies to the Jungian concept of \"Individuation\" during which an individual separates from collective society to become Whole. 5. At Cycle of Growth Stage 11 (Discontent) there is the \"choice\" between remaining in an undifferentiated state and continuing to follow a traditional path (Number 2. Saturn) or finding a more individual path beyond Number 10 to Number 11 Uranus. This is termed \"Transcendence\". NUMBER 22 Is a higher level of Number 4 (2 + 2 = 4). My book also explains why Number 22 can remain as such, or be reduced to Number 4, and why Number 12 - previously ignored by Numerology - is important too, as part of Transcendence and the newly discovered Jungian Individuation process.
