Let the number of towels = x Original cost of each towels = 180/origin tolar when in the same money, 3 more towels are obtained, then the reduced cost of each towel 180/(x+ 3) By the given condition, 180/x - 180/(x + 3) = 3 Or, (180x + 540 - 180x) = 3 * x * (x + 3) Or, x^2 + 3x = 540/3 = 180 Or, x^2 + 3x - 180 = 0 Or, ( x + 15 ) * ( x - 12) = 0 Or, x = 12, because x = - 15 not a valid answer. So, original number of towels = 12 Ans ",
