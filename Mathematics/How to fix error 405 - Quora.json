            "answer_text": "Unfortunately, 405 Method Not Allowed Errors are rather mysterious. They indicate what happened to your website, but they don\u2019t tell you why it happened, making it challenging for you to pinpoint its cause and correct the issue. Start With your website Backup. Restore your previous website and see if you find the same err if not then you might have mange some changes in your new website which is causing this err. Undo the changes that you recently did the new changes you did might have some bug or error on the backend programming part which shows this error. Or check server configuration files which you recently edited might be causing this error. Check for multiple url redirect. Check for unwanted database changes. Check of server logs. Best of Luck ",
