            "answer_text": "The best one is \u201cdo dichotomies actually exist?\u201d. It actually lies at the heart of mathematics. Alexander Alexandrov writes \u201cmathematics is the art of making the continuous discrete and the discrete continuous\u201d. Right there you see the problem: do we have data or continua? Surely the answer cannot be \u2018both\u2019! Either things are the same or they are different - if they are the same they can be associated and if they are different they can be separated. There is no solution (however complex) that allows both simultaneously. So, this leads to the paradox of mathematical pragmatism: we accept as true things which are complete and consistent in their definitions and functions. This is why logic depends on tautologies. However, mathematics is actually not tautologous - its philosophical foundation is the transference of identity via operations such that something that is actually the same may appear different and vice versa. A curve may be described as a set of points or an algebraic function - one is discrete, the other continuous. Spaces, types, transforms, logics - anything imaginable can be demonstrated to share isomorphisms with something else in some senses and not in others - hence, mathematics allows infinite rearrangement of objects into entities that possess infinite properties according to procedures that are actually both participants themselves and precluded from the process. The simplest example of what I mean here is Zero. So, do dichotomies exist? Is it true to say \u2018on one hand we have this, and on the other hand we have that\u2019? Well, to apply an ironic Moorean shift the answer is \u2018yes and no\u2019. If dichotomies exist absolutely then continuity does not, and if continuity exists absolutely then dichotomies do not. What exists absolutely? Nothing. Now, Isn\u2019t that something! ;) Everything is the same. Nothing is different. Mathematics solves this problem. You can count because one goes into two two times and those two ones make one number. Isn\u2019t that helpful?  Same vs Different. If there\u2019s really a dichotomy then anything can go together. If there really isn\u2019t then then everything falls apart. Either way the result is the same. Ironic, right? ",

            "answer_text": " The single most (and perhaps the only) interesting philosophical question about numbers is the ontological one: in what sense are numbers part of reality? We see quantities of things all around us all the time. In front of me now is 1 mug of yerba mate and 2 books. But the numbers 1 and 2 per se aren\u2019t in front of me. In fact, they don\u2019t really seem to be anywhere. Some people have said that they\u2019re figments of our imagination in the same way as the Constitution of the United States or the title to a motor vehicle. The Constitution and a vehicle title are more than just pieces of paper\u2014they are intangible things. If the physical Constitution were destroyed, the Constitution would still remain, because it\u2019s an idea independent of any physical manifestation. But if all people disappeared tomorrow, the Constitution would simply be a piece of paper. No one would be around to recognize it for what it represents to us now. On first thought, it seems like numbers are this way. We can talk about them and write them down, but if no intelligent beings were around to have such thoughts, then the written numbers would be meaningless. This leads us to a paradox, however, because it would imply that there were no numbers\u2014zero numbers to be precise\u2014and there we see that numbers still would persist even when intelligence is gone! That\u2019s not a rigorous proof that numbers aren\u2019t just ideas in our heads, but it does fairly convincingly suggest that numbers don\u2019t depend on anything else to exist. Even if there were nothing, well, that\u2019s zero of something. ",
