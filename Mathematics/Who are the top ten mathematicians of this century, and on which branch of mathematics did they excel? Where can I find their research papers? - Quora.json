Nevertheless, following names come to my mind. 1 Henri Poincare 2 David Hilbert 3 Srinivasa Ramanujan 4 Alexander Grothendieck 5 John von Neumann 6 Jean Pierre Serre 7 Michael Atiyah 8 Andrew Wiles. 9 Alain Connes 10 John Conway These mathematicians are considered from 1900 to 2000 ( this century has 80 years more to end). Wikipedia entry of each of these gives their contributions in their respective mathematical fields and sources of their research. ",
