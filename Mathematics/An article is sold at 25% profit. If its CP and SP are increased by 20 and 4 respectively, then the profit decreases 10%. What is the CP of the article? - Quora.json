(SP-CP)*100/CP is profit. {(1.25X+4)-(X+20)}*100/(X+20)=15 (1.25X+4-X-20)*100=15(X+20) 25X-1600=15X+300. Solving for X we get 190. So cost price is Rs 190.00 ",

            "answer_text": "Let its CP be x then its SP is 1.25x. When CP is increased by 20 it becomes (x+20)and when SP is increased by 4 it becomes (1.25x +4). In this case SP becomes 1.15 of CP ( given). New Equation:1.15 (x+20)= 1.25x+4 1.15x +23 = 1.25x + 4 0.10x = 19. Therefore x=190 Hence CP of the articleis Rs.190/-. ",
