            "answer_text": "This depends on what you mean by \u201cnumber system\u201d and \u201clarge.\u201d The complex numbers, denoted C, are larger than the real numbers, denoted R, in the sense that the reals are naturally inside the complexes as a subset. The real numbers R are the x-axis and the complex numbers C are the entire 2D plane R^2, all points of the form (a,b). The so-called \u201cimaginary\u201d numbers are the ones on the y-axis. These are rightly called \u201cnumbers\u201d because we can do the usual arithmetic operations with them in familiar ways. That includes adding, subtracting, multiplying, and dividing. If you are with me so far, you may ask \u201cOh, OK, how about 3D? How about points in space, R^3, (a,b,c)? Maybe we would have R inside C inside something bigger.\u201d Turns out that\u2019s not possible, *IF* you want to maintain the same arithmetic. Nor can you do it for R^4, R^5, or anything bigger. However, if you allow to drop some of the familiar properties of arithmetic you can get some kind of addition and multiplication on R^4 and R^8. If you are interested, google \u201cquaternions.\u201d Algebra is the part of mathematics that studies structures like this, notions of adding and multiplying and how they fit together and make sense. R and C are examples of what we call \u201cfields\u201d, when all the familiar adding, subtracting, multiplying, and dividing hold. If you relax multiplication a bit you can get \u201crings\u201d. If there\u2019s only one operation you get \u201cgroups.\u201d It\u2019s a big subject. ",

            "answer_text": "Probably not, but it depends on how you want to measure them. The real numbers are a subset of the complex numbers but the set of real numbers and the set of complex numbers have the same cardinality, which is the most straightforward measure of their \u201csize\u201d. To find a set with a larger cardinality, you have to look at things that most people wouldn\u2019t call \u201cnumbers\u201d (so, for example, the set of all subsets of the real numbers has larger cardinality than the complex numbers). In the same sense that the real numbers are a subset of the complex numbers, the complex numbers are a subset of the quaternions, which are a subset of the octonions\u2014and this process can be continued indefinitely, but those numbers aren\u2019t actually used for much of anything. The complex numbers are pretty pervasive in mathematics because they\u2019re \u201ccomplete\u201d\u2014you can find all of the sums, differences, products, quotients, exponents, roots, logarithms, and limits of expressions using complex numbers. But the idea of \u201cnumber\u201d in mathematics is (perhaps surprisingly) not precise. There isn\u2019t a formal definition of \u201cnumber\u201d\u2014just of particular kinds of numbers. That doesn\u2019t eliminate the possibility that other things might qualify as \u201cnumbers\u201d in various contexts, so there\u2019s no meaningful way to say what the \u201clargest\u201d set of them is.
