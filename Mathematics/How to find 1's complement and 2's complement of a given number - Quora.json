            "answer_text": "This is a topic in Discrete Mathematics. With a binary number, you find the 1\u2019s complement by inverting the numbers, switching bits. In binary you only have 1s and 0s. So if your number was 100101101 then the 1\u2019s complement is 011010010. The two\u2019s complement is the 1\u2019s complement with 1 added to the number. So for example, the 2\u2019s complement of 100101101 would be 011010011. The one\u2019s complement of 1010 would be 0101. The two\u2019s complement of 1010 would be 0110. ",

            "answer_text": "To find the 1\u2019s complement, just flip all the bits. To find the 2\u2019s complement, flip all the bits and add one. Example: 0010 0110 (that\u2019s 26 in hex, 38 in denary (or decimal) ): 0010 0110 --- now flip the bits to get... 1101 1001 is the 1\u2019s complement --- add one to get... 1101 1010 is the 2\u2019s complement ",
