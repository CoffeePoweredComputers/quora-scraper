            "answer_text": "Coordinates of the foci are S(-1,1) and S'(1,1) and coordinates of its centre C are {(-1+1)/2,(1+1)/2} or, C(0,1). [ C lies on y-axis as x- coordinate is 0.] The ellipse passes through O(0,0) , [Point O also lies on y-axis.] therefore CO is semi minor axis (b). b= CO b= \u221a{(0\u20130)^2+(1\u20130)^2}. b= 1. \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.(1). But 2ae = SS' Or, 2ae = \u221a{(-1\u20131)^2+(1\u20131)^2}. or, 2a.e = 2. Or. e = 1/a. \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026(2) Relationship between a , b and e is . b^2 = a^2.(1-e^2). or, (1)^2 = a^2.(1- 1/a^2). or, 1 = a^2-1. or, a^2 = 2. or, a =\u221a2. Genral equation of ellipse is (x-h)^2/a^2+(y-k)^2/b^2 = 1. where centre of the ellipse is (h,k). Putting a=\u221a2 and b=1 the required equation of ellipse is:- (x-0)^2/2 + (y-1)^2/1 = 1. or, x^2 + 2.(y-1)^2 = 2. , Answer. ",
