            "answer_text": "The general equation of a circle is x^2 + y^2 + 2gx + 2fy + c = 0, where (-g, -f) are the coordinates of the centre and the radius, r is given in r^2 = g^2 + f^2 - c. If, as you say, the equation of the circle is known, then the -g, -f and c can be read directly from the equation, for example, the circle x^2 + y^2 - 10x - 10y + 25 = 0 has centre coordinates of (5, 5) because equating coefficients of x and y with the general equation gives: 2g = -10 and 2f = -10, which yields g = -5 and f = -5 and so (-g, -f) = (5, 5) . Also the radius is easily calculated from r^2 = 5^2 + 5^2 - c = 25 + 25 - 25 = 25, therefore r = 5. ",

            "answer_text": "There\u2019s actually a sneaky way that doesn\u2019t require completing the square or anything. If the equation for the circle with center [math](a,b)[/math] is [math]f(x,y) = 0[/math] then it\u2019s [math](x-a)^2 + (y-b)^2 - r^2 = 0[/math] so [math]r^2 = -f(a,b)[/math] Pretty fast. There\u2019s only one catch \u2014 This assumed it was a monic second degree polynomial, meaning a coefficient of 1 on [math]x^2[/math] and [math]y^2[/math]. So in general [math]r^2 = - \\frac{1}{c} f(a,b)[/math] where [math]c[/math] is the coefficient on [math]x^2[/math] in [math]f[/math]. Let\u2019s test it out on [math](x-2)^2+(y+1)^2=5^2;[/math] say we were given center [math](2,-1)[/math] and [math]f(x,y)=x^2 - 4 x + y^2 + 2 y - 20 = 0[/math] It\u2019s monic so the squared radius is [math]r^2=-f(2,-1) = - ( 2^2- 4(2) + (-1)^2 + 2(-1) - 20 ) = 25 =5 ^2 \\quad\\checkmark[/math] ",
