            "answer_text": "Yes, it worked for me. I applied lemon juice on one end of the q-tips and placed it on the mole for around 8\u201310 minutes and then let it dry. I did it twice a day one in the morning and one before my bedtime. And after 8\u20139 days the skin around the mole began to peel off along with the mole and now it's completely gone. Don't forget to apply some Vaseline around the mole as it could harm the skin around and it's quite painful. Hope that works ! ",
