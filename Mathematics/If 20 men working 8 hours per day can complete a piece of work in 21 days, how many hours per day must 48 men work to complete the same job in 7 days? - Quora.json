Leaving the Question : 48 X 7 X n Equals 3360, or 3360 Divided by 336 Equals 10. So, the answer is 10 hours per day. Why,? Because simple multiplication tells us that 48 men working 7 days at 10 hours per day achieve the same output as 20 men working 21 days at 8 hours per day. (48 X 7 X 10 Equals 20 X 21 X 8). ",
