            "answer_text": "There is a cubic equation, but it is NOT easy. And, it is rarely used. One quick way (say on a test) is quickly sketch the curve, see where it crosses the x-axis, that is a root. Divide the polynomial by (x - the root) and you have a quadratic polynomial that you can easily solve. always keep learning, joe-  or you can create intermittent terms: p, q, and r p = -b/(3a), q = p^3 + (bc-3ad)/(6a^2), r = c/(3a) then: x = {q + [q^2 + (r-p^2)^3]^1/2}^1/3 + {q - [q^2 + (r-p^2)^3]^1/2}^1/3 + p ",
