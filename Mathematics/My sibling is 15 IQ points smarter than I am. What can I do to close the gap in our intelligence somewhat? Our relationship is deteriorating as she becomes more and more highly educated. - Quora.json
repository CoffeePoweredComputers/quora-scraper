            "answer_text": "First, you can\u2019t close the IQ gap. That is the hand you were dealt when you were born and it won\u2019t go away. Instead look at why your relationship is deteriorating. One possibility: as your sister gets more education, is she talking down to you, treating you like an inferior or being bitchy in general? Let\u2019s hope not and look at a second possibility and solution. Second: What is the age difference? Are you male or female? What is the nature of the deteriorating relationship? Is she older than you? If so, she may just be progressing ahead of you on the education spectrum and you\u2019ll catch up. And, a certain amount of sibling rivalry is natural. What are your plans for continuing your education? Do you both have some areas of common interest that would lead to activities you both enjoy? Doesn\u2019t have to be academic. It could be restaurants, museums, sports, travel, fashion, theatre, etc. If you are male, it might be a bit more limited unless you both like fashion shows, chick flicks, or other girly stuff. Your situation sounds like a phase that my younger brother and I went through and was at its low point when he was in high school and I was in college. Let me put that out here, in case there is some experience that can benefit you. We were 4 1/2 years apart in age and, like you two, at least 15 IQ points apart, probably closer to 25\u201330. At certain ages, like when he was in grade school and I was in junior high, 4 1/2 years is a big difference not only in age but social and intellectual development. People have different things on their minds at those ages. As you both get older a lot of that will make less and less difference through time. In our case, I was considered the \u201csmarter\u201d one. One thing that did not help matters was that a lot of people pointed that out, either directly, like our mom (she was from Germany and put a very high value on academics) and indirectly like our high school teachers who always pointed out to my brother \u201cwell, Kurt did well in math\u201d and \u201cKurt played sports\u201d and \u201cwhy don\u2019t you\u201d? Our dad, who was first to say that he was no scholar, but did well, had passed away at that critical time, so my brother did not have that support at home. Going to the same high school did not help at all. He struggled with most of his academic subjects and did not play sports (had asthma), while I had graduated early from high school with a 4.0 average and valedictorian and started college at 16. I had also been on the park district swim team, a varsity cross-country runner and captain of the tennis team. By the time he was a senior in high school I had two undergrad degrees, was in grad school and an adjunct lecturer in our division of continuing education. There was a great deal of resentment towards me mainly due to other people pointing out differences. So, if there are any external circumstances aggravating your situation, try to mitigate those. I encouraged him to go to college, when others didn\u2019t and invited him to come live with me and he enrolled also at SIU-C. While living together and sharing common experiences the rift began to heal. Unfortunately, he got screwed over by SIU being admitted as a probationary student and then enrolled in a physics for non-majors course where he did not have the proper background. While he flunked the physics course, he did well enough to get a C+ average, but they still kicked him out saying (after the fact) that he needed to get a C or better in each course. (I had my own problems there as well and would not recommend SIU-C to anyone). He felt really bad. So, I convinced him to enroll in the local community college. Turns out he did well there and turned around his life and attitude. We lived together for about three years until he got his AA and transferred to a four-year university to study history. Over the next few years we actually got a couple of opportunities to work together at a museum and a cultural resource management consulting firm, me as an archaeologist, him as a lab technician. So, we also found some common interests in history, some travel, B-grade sci-fi flicks from the \u201950s, warped sense of humor, cartooning and other things. It helped us get closer and encourage each other and we remain close even though our careers have put us geographically apart for the past 30 years. I continued my education and he didn\u2019t, but at this point in our lives it makes no difference. Depending on what interests you and your career path maybe you also get an advanced degree, but do it for yourself, not to\u201dkeep up\u201d with your sister. And, as you both do interesting things in your lives you will have more to talk about and share. So, there is hope for you and your sister. You need to find out what is really at the bottom of your differences and work on it constructively and positively. Don\u2019t give up. Find opportunities to have fun together. Maybe you need to make the first move, especially if she is not seeing the problem. And maybe some of this will pass with time and age. Best of luck. ",

            "answer_text": "See, you don\u2019t talk with everyone about the same things. Try to find things in which you can \u201cspecialize\u201d for that relationship. Maybe it can be about an activity, emotions or an interesting topic. What you can bring to her life? You can assess your personality Big 5 Aspects Scales test, that\u2019s probably better test but not free, that would give you some orientation on your other potential advantages. It can be helpful also because you will probably have to work on yourself, and I think that aiming to manifest only strenghts and counteract weaknesses of your traits is a good framework for that. In regards to being smarter, in my opinion it is possible to be as if you were 15 IQ points higher and probably even better (in terms of success, life choices, understaniding of the world) but it requires a lot of work on yourself. Starting points: sleep, exercise, diet (no refined carbs, a lot of vegetables, time restricted eating), improving patterns of thinking (e.g. asking better questions (see Tim Ferriss; a way to train it would be setting 10 minutes to think rigoriously about a problem (first minutes to analyze the words used in a question and underlying motivations - what do you expect from the answer), learning e.g. economy/psychology/philosophy with an aim to apply concepts to other things) ",
