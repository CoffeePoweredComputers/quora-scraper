If each goat was sold for the same price, what is the cost price of the goat which was sold at loss?Let CL denotes the cost price of the goat which was sold at loss.Hence from above data we get following relation,(1 - 20/100)*CL = (1 + 44/100)*(1008 - CL)or 0.80*CL = 1.44*1008 - 1.44*CLor 2.24*CL = 1.44*1008or CL = 1.44*1008/2.24 = 648 (Rs) [Ans]",

            "answer_text": "Let the CP of goat sold at profit be Rs X And let the CP of goat sold at loss be Rs Y CP of two goats is Rs 1008 (given) X + Y = 1008. \u2026\u2026\u2026(1) Sold goat Y at loss of 20% SP of goat Y = Y - Y/5 or 4Y/5 Sold goat X at profit of 44% SP of goat X= X+44X/100 or 36X/25 As per question if each goat is sold at same price ie SP of goat X = SP of goat Y, then we get 36X/25 = 4Y/5 or 180X=100Y or 180X -100Y =0 \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..(2) From equations (1) and (2) above we get 180X - 100 Y = 0 X. +. Y. = 1008 Now solving to find the value of Y, we multiply second equation by 180 we get 180X - 100Y=0 180X + 180Y=181440 By substracting second equation from equation one above we get 280 Y = 181440 Y = 648 Ans CP of the goat sold at loss is Rs 648 ",
