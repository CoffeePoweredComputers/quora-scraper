            "answer_text": "Ok,the answer is an i-pad Well first come to i-pad.For the last 6 months I am using ipad with the apple pencil and I am completely paperless. Pros: -awesome experience, you can use multiple colours. -you can use images from google or from pdfs,pathological slides -anytime can add anything on your notes -always can have a back-up -good experience with reading a pdf (I stopped buying books as its feel just like a book on my ipad) -all your notes for all subjects will be together,easily you can go to notes of any subjects  (My notes on my ipad) Cons: -limited storage(no OTG support ) -need to charge it along with the apple pencil Now come to laptop Pros: -massive storage Cons: -poor quality of notes as compared to ipad -you have to type your notes -your all notes will be in paper,so the source will be non handy \u2606With the recent ios13 update ipad now will support external storage devices (pen drives,flash drive,sd etc) So, i-pad will be better option.

I make my notes on my iPad, read books , watching series \ud83d\ude05 everything. There are a lot of benefits that I talked about in my answer : Yash Pathak's answer to Does a medical student need an iPad? Laptops are basically useless in med school. Yeah if you want to play games then go for it but for other productivity purposes iPad can be a game changer. Plus now iPad supports pendrive so why not ;) You can draw too :  A few of my notes :   \u2014-Yash ",
