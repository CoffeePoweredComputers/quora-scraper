            "answer_text": "You ask why the empty set is considered to be a set. The answer is convenience. Three of the mathematicians who developed set theory were Dedekind, Cantor, and Peano. Two of them, Dedekind and Peano, required their sets to be nonempty, while Cantor considered the empty set to be a valid set. Why did it happen that Cantor\u2019s position ended up being dominant? There are advantages to excluding the empty set and only accepting sets if they have at least one element. The advantages are similar to excluding 0 from numbers and only accepting positive numbers. For example, when Dedekind constructed real numbers from rational numbers, he used what we now call Dedekind cuts of rational numbers. A Dedekind cut of the set of rational numbers consists of partitioning the set of rational numbers into two nonempty subsets so that all the elements in one of those subsets are less than all the elements of the other subset. If you don\u2019t consider the empty set to be a set, you can leave out the word \u201cnonempty\u201d in the definition of Dedekind cuts. So, for that and other reasons, it can be convenient to require sets to be non-empty. But there are advantages to including the empty set as being a set. The biggest one is that intersections of sets always exist. If you exclude the empty set as a set, then disjoint sets don\u2019t have intersections, and that means every time you use intersections of sets, you have to consider two cases: the case where the sets are disjoint and don\u2019t have an intersection, and the case where the sets are not disjoint and do have an intersection. Cantor had another reason as well to include empty sets. They worked out well in his theories of ordinal and cardinal numbers. Always having an intersection is enough of an advantage. Cantor\u2019s position won out. Hilbert, Frege, Russell, and Zermelo all accepted the empty set. It\u2019s not that set theory couldn\u2019t be done excluding the empty set, but it would be much more complicated to exclude it than to include it. When it is actually required that a set needs to be nonempty, that can easily be done by including the word \u201cnonempty\u201d. ",

            "answer_text": "This question is similar to the question, \u201cWhy is 0 a number?\u201d The answer is that you want to be able to subtract two numbers and get a number. What number is 4\u20134? The result is a number called zero. Given two sets A and B, the set A-B is the set of all elements that are in A but not in B. Thus, if you have a set and \u201csubtract\u201d the set A from itself, you get all elements of A which are not in A. Thus A-A is a set with nothing in it. The result must be a set with no elements, so in order to subtract one set from another, you need something with no elements, referred to as the empty set. You also need the empty set to take the intersection of two sets A and B, since it is possible that A and B have no elements in common (for example, if A is the even integers and B is the odd integers). So you need the empty set in order to say that the intersection of any two sets is a set. Your question used the phrase \u201can empty set.\u201d There are of course many empty sets \u2014 for example, the set of all integers that are both even and odd, the set of apples on my table (take my word for this), the set of computers that always behave (that you can prove for yourself), the set of even prime numbers bigger than 2. All of these empty sets are different from one another, since each has its own definition. However, each of these empty sets has the same elements as each other empty set, so from a mathematical perspective all of these empty sets are the same. From a mathematical perspective, there is only one empty set. So, from a mathematical perspective, you should have used the phrase \u201cthe empty set\u201d instead of \u201can empty set\u201d. From a philosophical perspective, the examples I mentioned above are all different; after all, how can a set of apples equal a set of numbers? This reflects the perspective that the definition is \u201cintentional\u201d \u2014 that is, it is not the members of the set that are most important, but the kind of members that it has. The mathematical definition of a set is \u201cextensional\u201d \u2014 all that matters is what is in the set (its \u201cextent\u201d) not how the elements got there (its \u201cintent\u201d). This may be more than you wanted to know. ",

            "answer_text": "I am dissatisfied with the answers so far, as they amount to, \u201cthe empty set is a set because it is a set.\u201d I would like to offer a more global perspective. Let's talk about categories. They are collections of objects, together with collections of morphisms between the objects. We can compose morphisms when they are end-to-end, and this composition is required to be associative. Lastly, each object in a category must have an identity morphism from it to itself, which doesn't tamper with other morphisms under composition. Now, a very useful and arguably the most quintessential category is the category of sets. Its objects are sets, and its morphisms are functions. Functions can of course be associatively composed, and each set has an identity function. The category of sets enjoys some very nice properties; it has all small limits and colimits (roughly speaking, any reasonable \u201cequation\u201d in the language of sets has a universal solution that is characterized by that \u201cequation\u201d), and in particular it has an initial and terminal object: every set receives precisely one morphism from the empty set (the null function), and every set offers precisely one function into any set with one element (they are all isomorphic, so who cares which we choose?). It has a swathe of other delightful and useful properties reflecting why sets can formalize mathematics, too: it is something called a Cartesian closed category, meaning it has a notion of an \u201cobject of morphisms\u201d from one set to another (the set of functions), and the operation of currying exists, which lets us turn functions into function sets into functions out of products of sets. All of this would look quite different, if it were even still there, if we removed the empty set. We would still have statements saying how [math] (A^{B})^{C} \\simeq A^{B\\times C} [/math], but it wouldn't enjoy the same universal properties and overall things would be kind of broken. To fix things in light of removing the empty set, it would make sense to start requiring that every set be instead equipped with a fixed element it contains, and then require functions to preserve this basepoint. Doing this would give sets a different class of nice properties, but then we are left with questions such as, \u201cwhy are sets commonly defined with a basepoint?\u201d Another perspective is that sets act like domains of discourse for predicate logic. The category of sets is in fact dual to the category of complete atomic Boolean algebras; this means that any fact stated about sets reflects a fact about logic, and visa versa. The empty set reflects the fact that a statement can be false, and removing the empty set from set theory would in a sense trivialize its connection to logic. This even gets to the root of the Lambek-Curry-Howard correspondence, tying category theory, logic, and computer science together. The initial set didn't do anything wrong, and while its existence may be empty and pointless, it's certainly not useless! ",

If I remember my Set theory course correctly (but it\u2019s been 15 years+ and it wasn\u2019t my favorite subject), the whole theory is built around the Null Set: You axiomatically define a Null set.Then you allow a set to contain a set as its element.You then declare that the \u201csize\u201d of a Set that contains a null set as its element is \u201c1\u201d. This gives you a meaning for the number \u201c1\u201d.You also define the operations for joining, intersecting and subtracting sets, and explain how the \u201csize\u201d of a set increases in each of those cases.And finally, you say that nothing is called a set if it wasn\u2019t formed by (repeatedly) applying the previously defined rules.Since the above is simplified, I would\u2019t advise anyone to use this as their sole resource for studying. Instead, you should read the proper axiomatic system, such as: Zermelo set theory - Wikipedia This was groundbreaking, because without such system, paradoxes were popping left and right (you probably heard those paradoxes such as \u201cImagine a SET which contains exactly those sets that don\u2019t contain themselves. Does this set contain itself?\u201d) The Set Theory does not allow such set to be formed and thus avoids the paradox. ",

            "answer_text": "It makes sense to define set theory starting with the existence of an empty set for reasons roughly similar to why it\u2019s useful to have number systems which include zero as a core element of numeric sets. Even though these represent an \u201cabsense\u201d of something, in a certain sense, they are important to help establish the logical foundations, the definitions and axioms from which number theory and set theory can be built. Several millennia ago, the understanding of numbers arose principally from commerce and the planning of major construction works. So it was common to have a basic knowledge of numbers, counting up to whatever was in the realm you\u2019d need, with no need for an explicit \u201czero\u201d value in those systems in the Western world (other cultures included the concept of \u201czero\u201d in their mathematics). It wasn\u2019t until the mid-nineteenth century that mathematicians went back and looked at number theory and arithmetic from the standpoint of pure logic and axioms. From the exploration of this topic, Peano\u2019s Axioms were born: the logical foundation for all modern number theory, including arithmetic. Peano\u2019s axioms can be summarized quite succinctly to establish the set of natural numbers (positive integers beginning with one), or as I\u2019ll do the set of whole numbers, as I tend to refer to them (non-negative integers beginning with zero). 0 is a whole numberFor every natural number n, there is a succ(n) which is also a natural number. Thus for every natural number there is a successor. Thus succ(0)=1, succ(1)=2, and so on.succ(n)=0 is always false. That is, there is no natural number whose successor is zero; there is no predecessor of zero, in other words.Then there are several axioms I will skip over regarding equality and reflexivity as they willll clutter the discussion, but you can find them on Wikipedia[1] or Wolfram MathWorld.[2]From these axioms, you can build up the logical definitions of addition as repeated application of the succ(n) function, and from that you can define multiplication as repeated addition, and exponentiation as repeated multiplication. You can also define the \u201cinverse\u201d functions of these basic operators, such as subtraction, as in a\u2013b, but we need to make sure that b\u2264a so subtraction is closed across the whole numbers, or b<a for subtraction to be closed over the natural numbers. And so on for division (thou shalt not divide by zero!) and so on\u2026 We also note that under those operators, zero behaves in a special manner under addition since it doesn\u2019t change the value you\u2019re adding it to; so it\u2019s referred to as the additive identity. Similarly one is the multiplicative identity. Zero also has the special property that if you multiply anything by zero you get zero, so there are logical ramifications from that since you can\u2019t \u201cundo\u201d multiplying by zero; there is no multiplicative inverse of zero which is where the \u201cThou shalt not divide by zero!\u201d requirement comes from. All well and good, but how does this apply to set theory and the empty set? I\u2019ve taken a considerably roundabout way to get to set theory, talking first about the logical foundations of number theory and arithmetic. But when Georg Cantor and Richard Dedekind laid out the foundations of modern set theory in 1870, they did so with a similar logical approach built upon core definitions and axioms. When you consider the union of sets, for example, in a sense that is roughly comparable to addition. We always end up with a set which has the same or higher cardinality (number of items in the set). So in the same way that zero becomes quite useful as an additive identity, the empty set is a useful concept since taking the union of any set with the empty set leaves the original set unchanged. In a similar fashion, set difference is roughly equivalent to arithmetic subtraction, but actually it\u2019s a bit different. The set difference involves removing the elements which are common to both sets (the set intersection), and then the difference is what you are left with. Here, the empty set can be used in two ways: If you take the difference of any set with the empty set, you always end up with the original set unchanged. This is similar to a\u20130 = a in arithmetic terms. If you take the intersection of any set with the empty set, you always end up with the empty set. So this is analogous to a\u00d70 = 0 in arithmetic terms. Once you are comfortable with these basic definitions and axioms, you begin to appreciate the existence of zero, and the existence of the empty set, as all of the theory is logically consistent and there are no surprises to be encountered. Yet both types of mathematical theory can lead to exciting explorations of complex phenomena and natural properties. The set of prime numbers, for example, which have known properties arising from the pure logic of Peano\u2019s axioms. When folks encounter complex numbers, with the definition of this mysterious value equal to the square root of \u20131, folks tend to trip up on the idea that such a beast may exist (and it doesn\u2019t help that mathematicians have dubbed this as an \u201cimaginary\u201d number). Once you are comfortable with that axiomatic definition as a way to extend the real number set and arithmetic operations, then complex numbers, which have imaginary components, become a powerful way to tackle new problems efficiently using these new, logically-consistent, arithmetic tools. So too, as you explore even higher branches of mathematics, such as group theory and abstract algebra as an example, you need to allow for the core definitions and axioms to exist, and then explore where each new branch of mathematics can go with from those logical foundations. Hope this helps; sorry that it may be a bit overlong. __________________________________________SOURCES [1] Peano axioms - Wikipedia [2] Peano's Axioms -- from Wolfram MathWorld ",

            "answer_text": "It took centuries to accept the idea that 0 is a number (and to accept to calculate with negative numbers). As the other answer says, it would be very complicated not to have an empty set to deal with.I\u2019ll give you one example. Think of this nice little theorem which states that [math]\\left|A\\cup B\\right|=\\left|A\\right|+\\left|B\\right|-\\left|A\\cap B\\right|[/math] (where [math]\\left|X\\right|[/math] designates the number of elements of the set [math]X[/math] - or more generally it\u2019s cardinal).  12 = 6+9\u20133 In plain English, the number of elements of the reunion of the sets [math]A[/math] and [math]B[/math] is the sum of the number of elements of these two sets minus the number of el\u00e9ments in the intersection. It is quite obvious, as when you add the numbers of elements of the two sets, you count their common elements twice, so that you must substract the number of common elements to get the correct number of the union. If you did not have an empty set, you could not express it so nicely and simply. It would work only when there are common elements, et you would need a second theorem for the case when the sets [math]A[/math] and [math]B[/math] are disjoints. By the way, you can see om this example the correlation with the number 0\u2026 Coming back to the axiomatic theory of sets, a set is by definition defined by what elements are in the set or not. The first one to be constructed is precisely the empty set, and there is only one empty set. Moreover, there is one way to describe the theory where one assumes that all the sets can be constructed starting with the empty set, then the set containing the empty set as it\u2019s only element, then all the sets you can build with those two first sets, and so on. The classical way to represent the natural numbers within set theoriy represents them as sets this way (and you obviously need the empty set to do it!): [math]0=\\oslash,\\,1=\\left\\{ 0\\right\\} =\\left\\{ \\oslash\\right\\} ,\\,2=\\left\\{ 0,1\\right\\} =\\left\\{ \\oslash,\\left\\{ \\oslash\\right\\} \\right\\} ,\\,3=\\left\\{ 0,1,2\\right\\} =\\left\\{ \\oslash,\\left\\{ \\oslash\\right\\} ,\\left\\{ \\oslash,\\left\\{ \\oslash\\right\\} \\right\\} \\right\\}[/math], etc. ",

And that\u2019s where the answer to your question is hidden. After all whenever someone describes a new theory (or something similar), it\u2019s their moral responsibility to ensure that they can make sense out of such a thing. In other words, they must not describe a theory of something which cannot exist (maybe because it\u2019s existence can be refuted or otherwise). Now in the first place to provide the existence of a set it is needed to describe a set without making use of something that the theory plans to introduce, and thus a set that is not composed of anything \u2014 the set that has nothing (a.k.a. the empty set). Then one can play with this empty set and use axioms such as the axiom of union and the axiom of power sets to build \u201cbigger\u201d sets. Further the empty set is unique. Here\u2019s a quick proof : Let A,B be two empty sets. Then the statement x belongs to A is false for each x (by each x I mean each x we can speak of) and by the ex falso quodlibet it follows that x belongs to A implies x belongs to B. And in a similar spirit we get : x belongs to B implies x belongs to A. And hence the axiom defining the equality of sets (Axiom of Extensionality in the Zermelo Fraenkel theory of sets) tells us that A and B are identical sets. Hence we conclude the uniqueness of the empty set. ",

All natural numbers are either even or odd but none are both, therefore, the answer is the Empty Set. Because empty sets are used to prove properties of other sets and set operations. Given that A is a subset of B, what is the set of elements in A that are not in B? By the definition of subset, there are no elements of A that are not also in B. The answer is the Empty Set. Thus the empty set helps us prove containment. Given the Set of Irrational Numbers, what is the set intersection of the Irrational Numbers and the Integers? Since there are no numbers which are both Integers and Irrational Numbers, the answer is the Empty Set. Thus the empty set helps us prove disjoint-ness between sets. Given two parallel lines in the plane, what is the set of points of intersection in the plane between the two lines? Again, there are none, so the answer is the Empty Set.

            "answer_text": "Why is an empty set called a set? In most set theories, like ZFC, it\u2019s axiomatic. In others, there\u2019s usually an axiom saying every subclass (or entity containing some or all elements) of every set is itself set. Thus the subclass containing no elements is a set. You may then ask: why define set theory this way? As far as I can tell, there are a few answers. It keeps many operations on sets well-defined for all sets. Consider two disjoint sets, [math]A[/math] and [math]B[/math]. Consider also the familiar intersection operator [math]\\cap : \\mathbf{Set} \\times \\mathbf{Set} \\rightarrow \\mathbf{Set}[/math]. The only sensible value of [math]A \\cap B[/math] is [math]\\varnothing[/math].In the von Neumann construction of the ordinals, every ordinal is a set and each successor of a given number is its powerset. This makes the empty set a natural (ie: isomorphic to any other) choice for representing 0: there is no need to define other numbers by fiat.The empty set gives the categories [math]\\mathbf{Set}[/math] of all sets and [math]\\mathbf{Top}[/math] of all topological spaces strict initial objects, which is essential for keeping these categories cartesian closed, which makes their equational theories much nicer. This point is in some sense a generalization of the first.",

There is rules that decides what a set is, but essentially a set is an object in which other objects are member of (in set theory, a set contains other sets). Take a set S, and an object o. We will note \u00ab o \u2208 S \u00bb if o is a member of \u00ab S \u00bb and \u00ab o \u2209 S \u00bb if o is not a member of S. For a set S, define \u00ab being empty \u00bb as the property that for all objects o , \u00ab o \u2209 S \u00bb . Usually the rules of the theory of set imply that there is such an object. \u00ab S \u00bb exists, is defined by set theory, and is empty \u2026 it\u2019s the empty set. Either there is proof that it exists, see ZF: (Formal) Proof of Empty Set from Separation or it\u2019s an axiom that there is such an object Axiom of empty set - Wikipedia and you just say \u00ab there is an empty set \u00bb. An idea of proof could look like \u00ab you can always remove an object from a set and gain a new set \u00bb. Take a set that contains 5 elements. Remove one element, then remove one element from the obtained set. Repeat that. At some point you can\u2019t remove anything, and you got a set from the operation of removal. You\u2019ve got an set.

            "answer_text": "My little brother had trouble with the concept of empty sets when he was first learning about them in high school. This is how I explained it to him (this might not be entirely mathematical, kindly correct me if anything I say is not logical): A set is like a box with some stuff in it. It is a well defined collection of objects. When you look inside the box, you should be able to tell if something\u2019s in it or not, there should be no ambiguity. Now let\u2019s consider an empty set. It\u2019s a set with nothing in it. So, it\u2019s like an empty box. A box is still a box even if there\u2019s nothing in it! I used this analogy because my brother was having trouble understanding why the cardinality of [math]\\phi[/math] is 0, but the cardinality of [math]\\{\\phi\\}[/math] is 1. In the first case, we have an empty box, so the number of items in it is 0. In the second case, you have an empty box inside a box. Now the number of items inside the (bigger) box is 1.  ",

Semantics apart, essentially because it\u2019s a convenient extension of the idea of sets with elements in them - just as zero is a convenient extension of the counting of things. Mathematics also has this rather strange convention that all empty sets are the same, regardless of context. By analogy, consider a load of baskets of fruit, but without any bananas; yes, we have no bananas - all these baskets are empty of bananas, even though they might contain the odd apple or orange (or grape) so are not per se empty. The set of {baskets with bananas in them} would be empty. But, there there are, different. Best not mention this to any mathematics teachers, though; they might get upset and start quoting text-books. The conventional theory is that all emptiness is the same. The notional \u2018basket\u2019 in set theory is intrinsic to the boundary of the set, though, it is not a separate woven thing. If the boundary in contained in the set - made up of things within the set - the set is closed; if not, the set is open (yes, there can be semi-open \u2018soft\u2019 sets). Because an open set has nothing in it that might be in it, \u2018the\u2019 empty set is therefore always open. ",

In particular, given any two sets [math]A[/math] and [math]B[/math], I would want their intersection, [math]A\\cap B[/math], always to be a set. Were it not there would be endless special cases to deal with [math]\\ddot\\smallfrown[/math] Having said that, there is nothing stopping you defining a new object, let\u2019s call it a sset. Ssets have exactly the same properties as traditional sets except for the fact that they always contain at least one member. If you actually bother to define ssets like this, and start using them in your mathematics, you will quickly see why traditional sets have the Empty Set amongst their number. ",

            "answer_text": "The empty set needn\u2019t have its own axiom. The axiom schemata of (restricted) comprehension implies its existence. Therefore, it has just as much ontological footing as subsets of very routine sets like the subset of all even natural numbers or the subset of all prime natural numbers. In other words, one single axiom implies both that the empty set exists and that the set of all even natural numbers exists. Perhaps why it is considered a set lies with us wanting to always have that the intersection of x and y exists (i.e., is a set). If our set theory is rich enough for more than one set, it is possible that x and y are disjoint (e.g., the set of even numbers intersected with the set of odd numbers). The intersection of disjoint sets can be safely regarded as the same type of thing as the two inputs for the binary relation whose output is their intersection: sets. Since the intersection of two disjoint sets is the empty set, something strange would happen with the intersection of x and y for two sets x and y: sometimes it would be a set and sometimes not, depending on whether they are disjoint. I guess its just either a nomenclature issue or a philosophical issue. ",

If you don\u2019t want to consider an empty collection, a collection that\u2019s up to you. But there\u2019s nothing wrong with calling it a collection. It\u2019s just a word. And it\u2019s convenient, it allows you to do algebra with sets in the same way you can do arithmetic and algebra with numbers. In fact the empty sets does the same job as zero does among numbers. ",

If you have two sets, their intersection is itself a set. It has a nice unambiguous description, as the set of all elements in common to the two given sets. It shouldn\u2019t be hard to conjure up two sets that you (or your audience) view as non-controversial, but which are disjoint. My go-to example in class: let E = the set of people who lived in the Eighteenth Century, and let T = the set of people who were at one time considered television stars. Their intersection is the set of television stars who were alive in the eighteenth century. Also known as the empty set. A more mathy example might be the set of all real solutions to the equation [math]\\frac{1}{x} + 2 = \\frac{4+2x}{x}[/math] ",

There's nothing very natural about it, but the idea allowed us to conceive of the negative integers and the place value concept in the decimal system. With sets, we want to be able to define union and intersection operations, but without the empty set, intersections wouldn't always be defined. So I agree the notion of an empty set isn't something obvious or natural, but it is very useful. Hence we extend the concept to include a set without any elements. ",

The empty set is really useful in discrete math because it is the neutral element of union (empty set union another set is always another set) , but the absorbent element of intersection (empty set intersection another set is always empty set). Like the concept of 0 in natural numbers sometimes you need mathematical elements that allow you to represent properties of the domain. ",
