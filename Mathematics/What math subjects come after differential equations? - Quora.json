            "answer_text": "Differential equations is basically the end of where math is \u201csequential,\u201d and begins where math becomes more parallel.* Thus, the short answer is \u201ceverything else.\u201d If you\u2019re just looking for another subject to study, reasonable next extensions (assuming your already know linear algebra and multivariable calculus) are complex analysis, partial differential equations, differential geometry, and abstract algebra. *Arguably, it\u2019s even before that point; linear algebra could be taken as early as alongside calculus, and multivariable calc alongside ODEs.  Let me use an analogy with English class, specifically when learning to write. The first thing you learn in English is grammar. This is a basic foundation for almost everything else you do, and is a necessary first step. Then you learn to write basic stories. Maybe some basic poetry as well (limericks and haikus). Then come the five-paragraph essays. Now your writing has an overall structure to it, with a definite beginning, middle, and end. Of course, you gradually leave this specific structure over time, but the idea of having structure at all is important to understand. From there\u2026 well, it\u2019s all about learning new skills. Should you learn how to set a tone for your writing before or after you learn how to cite things in MLA? How about compared to developing an extended vocabulary? To a reasonable degree, once you\u2019ve mastered the basics, all of those things should be done simultaneously, in parallel. For that reason, English doesn\u2019t have \u201cnext classes\u201d when you reach high school.  Now, a little secret that\u2019s hidden from you for most of your academic career: math doesn\u2019t either. Like English, there are some prerequisites - and, in all fairness, there are, in fact, far more. You can\u2019t do differential equations without calculus. However, math is also not \u201csequential.\u201d If you have the tools, you can go off in whatever direction you choose. [On the flip side, in any particular direction, you\u2019ll run into barriers, so to some degree it\u2019s advisable to probe every direction at once. Math is very interdependent.] What you actually run into after differential equations is that there\u2019s no bureaucratically canonical choice anymore; that is to say, there\u2019s no specific option that has become institutionally standard. Instead, you can take a variety of specific classes to your taste. By direct analogy to how you don\u2019t have to worry about whether to take creative writing before a class on grammar, or U.S. history before or after Roman history, you also don\u2019t have to worry about whether to take complex analysis before or after abstract algebra. Do both at the same time, if you want! Many of the subjects that one could claim come \u201cafter\u201d ODEs actually run in parallel to it. Topology and abstract algebra, for instance, could both easily be learned even before calculus!  Of course, if you\u2019re just looking at courses to take, that\u2019s not helpful to your specific situation, necessarily, so allow me to be more helpful to you: ask an advisor. It depends on what you want to do and what else you have taken, as well as your school\u2019s specific classes. Usually, after calculus comes linear algebra, multivariable calculus, differential equations, and some sort of introduction to proofs, so if you haven\u2019t done those things, do those. From there, basically everything else in an undergraduate curriculum is available, so you can probably pick whatever looks interesting. ",

            "answer_text": "Why partial differential equations of course! Differential equations comprised of partial derivatives. These have three or more variables. The goal is usually to reduce them to an ordinary differential equation (containing two vartiables and no partial derivatives) that can then be solved. They can be extremely useful as the real world contains more than two dimensions. Unfortunately, they are generally much more difficult to solve, when they are able to be solved. ",
