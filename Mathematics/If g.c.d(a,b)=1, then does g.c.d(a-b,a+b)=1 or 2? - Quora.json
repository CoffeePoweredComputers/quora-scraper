            "answer_text": "Given the fact that gcd(a,b)=1. So, we can inference that a and b are relatively prime to each other. Let's take some few cases to get this;- Case1: we know consecutive numbers are relatively prime to each other. So, taking a,b as consecutive no.s. (a>b) gcd(a-b,a+b)= gcd(1,2a+1) =1. Obviously the gcd would be one. Case2: Which we take as the numbers will just remain on the fact that gcd of a and b is equal to 1. If you take two consecutive odd numbers a,b and perform the operation of a-b and a + b, where a>b. You can easily see gcd(a,b)=1. Also, gcd(a-b,a+b) = gcd (2,2a+2)=2 So, I think you got what I said by the few cases taken. And here you go, gcd(a,b)=1 doesn't ensure that gcd(a-b,a+b) is not stagnant at 1 or 2, but will change amongst these values as accordance with the cases. ",
