Then 10-(10+b)=b 10\u201310-b=b 10\u201310=b+b 0=2b switch sides (it is comfortable, but not necessarily) 2b=0/2 b=0, because if you divided 0 any numbers then answer is 0. Replace b for 0 in one equation. In example one. Then 10+0=c and c=10 Check Check always both solutions. 10+0=10 10=10 correct 10\u201310=0 0=0 correct Answer: b=0 and c=10 Other methods how to get same answer: Put numbers in a and b Then 10+b=c And 10-c=b Get a system. Get one type letters in one side. 10+b=c + 10-b=c Do stitching 20=2c Swap sides (not necessary but it is more comfortable) 2c=20/2 c=10 replace c one equation. In example first. 10+b=10 b=10\u201310 b=0 Control control always both solutions. 10+0=10 10=10 correct And 10\u201310=0 0=0 correct Answer: b=0 and c=10 There are more methods how to get a right answer, but I showed it two more basically answer getting methods. [Others is interval, graphic (not recommended, the most inaccurative method) and there will be some more. ",

If we \u2018just guess\u2019 what b might be (say, from 1 to 100) and also guess what c is (say, 100 to 1), and plot the results, the scatterplot lines will give both B and C.  Where the blue line crosses the x axis, this is b. Where the 2 lines intersect, this is C. The answers below confirm this to be the case (but we could check using algebra). The nice thing with this approach is one doesn\u2019t need to get bogged down with algebra, the solution presents using simple logic (and Excel can lend a hand for plotting purposes). In conclusion, b = 0, and c = 10. Confirming this: 10 + 0 = 10 check 10\u201310 = 0 check ",
