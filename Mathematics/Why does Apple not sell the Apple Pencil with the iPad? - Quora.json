            "answer_text": "Because the Pencil is a huge selling-point for the iPad, artists and note-takers often buy one because of the Pencil, it's a wonderful design\u2026but it's not part of the interface. The iPhone was a game-changer partly because Jobs had the vision to look at the things with styluses and little fiddly keyboards available before the iPhone and think \"there's a reason these things are niche products for geeks and business people\", at which point he decided as a definite choice that he didn't want to bring out just another Thing With A Stylus. And lo, he brought out the iPhone, and told people that it responded to the touch of a finger. So did the iPod Touch. So did the iPad. Pick them up and use them, no extra fuss required. I think Jobs would have liked the Apple Pencil, given a proper demo. He would have seen that it wasn't a general-purpose interface getting between the user and the device (what he didn't like about styluses), but a specific interface for fine control, particularly for artists. So you don't have to have the Pencil to use an iPad. It's not like the touchscreen on a mobile device or the keyboard on a computer. There's no sense in driving the price up for something not everyone will use. And anyone and everyone are free to add a Pencil to their modern iPad/Pro at any point later. I'm not an artist, but I use the Pencil and I get a lot from trying to draw. However, I wouldn't like to have the Pencil getting in my way the rest of the time. ",

            "answer_text": "Marketing and profit. A lot of people don\u2019t need an Apple Pencil, so they just buy the iPad.Also, adding the Apple Pencil would add 100 dollars to the iPad, leaving a lot of consumers out. The Apple Pencil and iPad probably don\u2019t cost that much, but selling them separately makes it seem reasonable, because it makes the Apple Pencil a \u201cpremium\u201d product, much like the AirPods.Hopefully in the future they would sell iPads with a cheap pencil like the EarPods, and leave a premium one, which has like twenty extra features, out.
