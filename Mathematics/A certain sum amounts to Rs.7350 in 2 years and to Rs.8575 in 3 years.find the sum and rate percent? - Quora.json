Now interest of third year = 8575 - 7350 = 1225; means principal for this interest is 7350 if comound interest is takenIf 7350 is the principal interest = 1225 if 100 is the principal interest=(1225/7350)*100 =50/3% When a thing increases for two successive times the overall increase on initial amount = a + b + (a * b)/100 Therefore overall interest for two years = 50/3 + 50/3 + [(50/3)*(50/3)]/100 = 325/9 % Therefore amount after 2 years = 100 + 325/9 = 1225/9 If 1225/9 is the amount principal =100 if 7350 is the amount principal =(900/1225)*7350 =5400 So sum = 5400; Rate = 50/3 % ",
