            "answer_text": "First of all, let me clear that why you asked such question. Whenever we ,the non english background students come to such questions we have no clue from where to start and how to form the equation if the question provided is in English language. So, What I have learnt sofar is : TRY TO MAKE THE EQUATION AS IT READS.PEASE NOTE THAT IS,WAS,WERE,HAS,HAVE,HAD,WILL,SHALL ETC.STAND FOR \u2018=\u2019 SIGN.Means specifically in this given situation the process will go like this: For twice a number : let say the number is \u2018n'. Therefore twice a number will become \u20182n\u2019.For five lessthan twice a number: \u20182n-5\u2019Now the last step. As it says that five less than twice a number \u2018IS' 9. This \u2018IS' stands for \u2018=\u2019 sign. So,the final equation will look like \u20182n-5=9\u2032. Now anybody can answer it very easily. The answer will be \u2018n=7\u2019.So,the bottom line is that solving the equation is not a problem. But framing the equation becomes the real hedache sometimes for non English background students. Hope you liked my solution. And will never face a problem while framing such equations in future.",

            "answer_text": "Another way to operate is to invert \u201ctwice\u201d and \u201cless\u201d operations. As others stated you have an unknown X. On this number you get the double and then subtract 5. The result must be equal to 9. In math language 2X - 5 = 9 But there is another way to think at the problem. As we stated before we can invert operations. Inverting operations means that you start from 9: the number you know. You can add 5 ( instead of subtracting ) and then divide by 2 ( instead of multiplying ). So you have ( 9+5 ) * 2 = X Remember in algebra sum is calculated always before multiplication. Those two equations are mathematically equivalent. This means that each lead to the other through mathematical operations, even if you solved the problem in different ways of thinking. This is why math is a strong tool to model our reality. In other answers is explained how to get from the first to the second. ",

For five less - add five in nine = 14 For twice a number - do half the number 14 = 7 So, the answer is 7. If we go by algebraic method then suppose x is our answer. Then twice a number = 2 x And five less is equal to nine. So, our equation is 2x - 5 = 9 And 2x = 9+5 = 14 And x = 14/2 = 7 same answer. This is my first answer in Quora. One Mr Alessandro made right equation but answer is long. Mr Csaba's answer is also right. But I don't know why this simple question is asked in Quora.
