            "answer_text": "There is none because in spite of there being an = in the middle, this is not a valid equation. In order to be an equation, both sides must be true, and variables must only have a singular value. Neither of these conditions have been met. x=x+1 x-1=x+1-1 x-1=x So if this equation were to be accepted as valid, then x=x+1, and x=x-1 as well. This would mean that x+1=x-1 x+1=x-1 x+1-1=x-1-1 x=x-2 or x+1=x-1 x+1+1=x-1+1 x=x+2 So apparently x is equal to x+1, x-1, x+2, and x-2 equally. Well that can't be good. I could continue this until I get x=x+10000000. Or simply accept that there is no valid answer because a variable can only equal itself. ",
