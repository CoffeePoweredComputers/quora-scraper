            "answer_text": "I really can\u2019t say. She might be back at her starting point. Or she might be almost 75 km away in a direction very slightly East of North. Or anything in between. You see, the question is poorly defined. You say, twice, that she turns right. You possibly meant that she turns 90 degrees to her right. But you didn\u2019t say that, and it would be foolish for anyone to assume it. Maybe she only turns a fraction of a degree each time. So she\u2019d continue in an almost straight line for 75 km. Maybe she turns a little over 90 degrees each time. Her path now is an isoceles triangle with two sides of 30 km and one side of 15 km. She ends up back at her starting point. ",
