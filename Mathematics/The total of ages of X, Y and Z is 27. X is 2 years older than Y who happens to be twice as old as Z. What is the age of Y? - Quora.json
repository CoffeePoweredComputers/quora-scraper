            "answer_text": "Mathematically, the above information can be written as: 1)  X + Y + Z = 27 (Sum of their ages) 2) X = Y + 2 (X is 2 years older than Y) 3) Y = 2 x Z (Y is twice as old as Z)  From Equation 3, we can replace X with Y + 2 (From Equation 2) Substitute X and Z by their relationship with Y, in equation 1. We know X = Y + 2 and Z = Y \u00f7 2 Equation 1 can then we rewritten as: (Y + 2) + Y + (Y \u00f7 2) = 27 Multiply with 2 on both sides: 2 (Y + 2) + 2Y + Y = 2x27 2Y + 4 + 2Y + Y = 54, or    5Y = 50 and Y = 10 To verify that the answer is correct,  X = Y + 2 = 12 Z = Y \u00f7 2 = 5 Sum of X, Y & Z is 12 + 10 + 5 = 27!

So in this case, z = z y = 2z x = 2 + 2z                     (where x,y & z represent the age of X,Y & Z) According to the question : x + y + z = 27 From the above simplification : (2 + 2z) + (2z) + (z) = 27 2 + 5z = 27 z = 25/5 = 5 Hence, y = 2(5) = 10    ---The age of Y (the answer) And similarly you can find the ages of X & Z.
