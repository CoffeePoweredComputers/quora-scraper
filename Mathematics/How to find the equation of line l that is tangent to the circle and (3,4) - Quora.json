            "answer_text": "A2A by Adrianna Cauthen, I\u2019m going to tackle this from an algebraic point of view, with just a little bit of calculus. The equation of the circle is [math]x^{2} + y^{2} = 25[/math]. So let\u2019s find the equation of the tangent line at some (x, y). Take the derivative implicitly; [math]2x + 2y\\frac{dy}{dx} = 0[/math] So, solving for [math]\\frac{dy}{dx}[/math], [math]\\frac{dy}{dx} = -\\frac{x}{y}[/math]. Which gets us to the starting point of all the other answers, that the slope of the tangent line at (3,4) is [math]-\\frac{3}{4}.[/math] Using point-slope form, [math]y - y_{0} = m(x - x_{0})[/math], [math]y - 4 = -\\frac{3}{4}(x - 3)[/math] This simplifies to [math]y = -\\frac{3}{4}x + \\frac{25}{4}[/math] ",

            "answer_text": "Note that the slope of the line from the origin to (3, 4) is: [math]\\frac{4}{3}[/math] Since this line is perpendicular to your line, its slope is the negative reciprocal of this. Therefore, it is: [math]\\frac{-3}{4}[/math] So the equation for this line is of the form [math]y-y_1=\\frac{-3}{4}(x-x_1)[/math]. Since your line passes through (3, 4), we can substitute these in to get: [math]y-4=\\frac{-3}{4}(x-3)[/math]. This can also be written as: [math]y=\\frac{-3}{4}x+\\frac{25}{4}[/math]. ",
