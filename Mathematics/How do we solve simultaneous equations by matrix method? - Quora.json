            "answer_text": "I view a Matrix as a compositional structure of numerous informational metric points. One could say that it\u2019s a Grid of co-ordinate values, akin to a \u201c3D Cube\u201d consisting of these respective co-ordinate values. Another describtion could be a arbitrary Topological formation and structure - that adheres to very specific structural interplays depending on the type of the Matris. The reason i put it as \u201c3D Cube\u201d is that, some Matrises do not allow for such a topological structure in terms of formation and the rules adopted by such systems can disallow certain compositions that would \u201crender a 3D Cube\u201d. There are other Matrises - as well, some of which are lower dimensions. As in - they can described as being \u201cflattened\u201d or \u201c2D\u201d - as in, a simplar dimensional structure. In a sense - they come to be related to arrays, then - sort of - except that the difference is in dimensions of limitation and designation of rules/interplays of different operations. For instance, a Matris has far more rules related to it - than say a Dictionary or a Array. Which in turn is defined by sub-compositions of different matrises. Another - is to consider it a grid mesh net that \u201cmaps\u201d values from other composite systems unto it, to create a junction point of several intersecting Matris systems. And that\u2019s where the fundamental kernel allocations, topology and the co-ordinate systems/function of/forming of function etc. - comes to really be a thing of itself. Then there are ill-formed Matrises, there are different values relating to them (like Eigenvalues, Eigen vectors, Diagonals, Inversion rules etc.) For instance, a Matris could be a system that is sub-compartionalized by Vectors. There are other forms of ways of seeing Matrises, i am sure - and there are some fundamental rule sets that are more restrictive on based on the Co-ordinate system you are refering to (Cartesian comes to mind) But however - this is my view of Matrises, in General.

            "answer_text": "You first settle on some scalars, like real numbers, or rational numbers, or complex numbers. You just need to be able to add and multiply them. The addition needs to be commutative, and associative, and there needs to be a 0, with the usual properties for adding 0 and multiplying by 0. Multiplication needs to be distributive over addition. Then you define an N vector to be a function from N to the scalars, where N is any set. You probably want N to be finite, or maybe you want the function to be 0 except for a finite number of elements of N. So an N vector assigns a scalar to each element of N. We can add N vectors pointwise. This addition is again commutative, and the function which is 0 for all n in N, is the 0 N-vector. An M x N vector is called an M x N matrix. Here M x N is the usual product of sets, consisting of all possible pairs (m, n) with m chosen from M and n chose from N. Since an M x N matrix is an M x N vector, we can add them. If A is an M x N matrix, and B is an N x P matrix, we can define AB to be an M x P matrix, by defining (AB)(m, p) = the sum of A(m, n) B(n, p) taken over all n in N. The sum is finite, because all of the terms are zero whenever A(m, n) or B(n, p) is zero, and the sum is well defined because addition is commutative. If you take your sets to be {1, 2, 3, 4, \u2026, n} and {1, 2, 3, 4,\u2026, m} and {1,2,3,4, \u2026, p} you get the high school formulation. For the more mathematical, there\u2019s an interesting fact. If f maps a coproduct of A_i\u2019s into a product of A_i\u2019s, then we can compose f with an injection of any A_k into the coproduct, and with a projection from the product into any A_j, thus f is a matrix of maps from A_k to A_j.
