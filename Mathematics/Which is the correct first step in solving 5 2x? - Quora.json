To get something solvable out of that, I could make it any of the following: 5\u20132x=0, which I'd solve by carrying 2x to the right thus getting 2x=5 and then dividing by 2, but nothing prevents you from dividing first and carrying later;5+2x=0, and again the steps are carrying something to the right and dividing by the coefficient of x, I'd carry the 5 and then divide by 2;5=2x, where there is just one step, namely dividing by 2;Any of the above with \u2264 or \u2265 instead of =, and the steps are the same.",
