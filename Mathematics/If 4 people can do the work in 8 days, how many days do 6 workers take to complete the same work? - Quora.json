            "answer_text": "It\u2019s not always mathematical. There are many tasks that need to be done sequentially. For instance, no matter how many people you have pouring concrete or making the cake batter, the concrete is still going to take a certain amount of time to set and the cake will still take the same amount of time to bake. You might be able to get more concrete poured and more cakes baked, but it won\u2019t shorten the time required exponentially. Some tasks can only be split into a finite number of steps to achieve a reasonable outcome. If too many people get involved, you\u2019ll run into the age-old problem of too many cooks spoiling the broth. Take any assembly line and you will be able to see that there is a logical progression and a method to how the task is divided up. And lastly, some tasks depend on specialised knowledge. If only 4 people know how to do the job and you insist on adding two people to the team, what is likely to happen is the process gets slowed down because your 4 experts are going to have to spend time teaching the newbies what to do. Some skills are easier to master than others: at one end of the scale - learning to wrap a present neatly, and at the other end - embroidering a wedding dress. ",
