            "answer_text": "The other answers here have given you the \u201ccorrect\" answer, but they don't factor in lunch and coffee breaks, and so on. Assume these painters are regular employees. They have an 8 hour workday, mandated by OH&S, with a half hour lunch break, a morning smoke break and an afternoon smoko of 15 minutes apiece. That's 7 hours of \u201cproductive\u201d time on the first day. But! There's going to be a certain amount of setup and cleanup time each day. Say they each heft their own paint cans and brushes/rollers/etc, and it takes them 15 minutes to get set up and cleaned up. Down to 6.75 hours of pproductive time. The second day, they'd have another 7 hours of that 15 hour estimate. They skip afternoon smoko to just get the job done and go home \u201cearly\". That's 6 hours of productivity. That's 40.5 productive man hours on the first day, 36 the second for a total of 76.5 productive man hours. 76.5/5=15.3 But add back 1.25 hours for the first day (setup/cleanup, break 1, lunch, break 2) and you're at 16.55 hours, so that pushes us into a full second day. Add 1.25 hours on the second day (same deal) and we're up to 17.8 hours. That gives us 1.8 hours left for the third day. Screw it, we'll just crank it out and forego break this morning. But add 15 minutes for setup/cleanup. 18.05 hours in total. This changes if the setup/cleanup is left to an apprentice/buttmonkey though. Due to economies of scale on dishing out tools and materials in one fluid task, let's say it takes only half an hour *total* to setup/cleanup\u2026 You gain back an hour of productive man time in the six man job, making it 7 pmh for five of them, but 6.5 for the buttmonkey. Total 41.5 per day. Knock off an hour per man on the second day, you have 35.5pmh, for a total of 77pmh to get the job done. But for the five man crew, same buttmonkey setup, it's 7pmh for 4 plus 6.5 for one. Total 34.5 per day. That's 2 and a quarter days productivity. Add back your breaks (2h on those first 2 days) and you're up to 2.5 days, or 20 hours. Initial setup per day totals out to 1.5 hours. And of course your morning break on the 3rd day\u2026 Grand total, 21.75 hours. I\u2026 I messed up there somewhere. Lesson learned: get your painters to do their own setup. ",

            "answer_text": "This is a basic inverse variation problem. Essentially, time to complete a work, varies inversely with input. The more input(workers) added, the less time needed to complete. Thus: y(time) = k/x(workers). k = constant of variation. In this case: 15 = k/6 k = 90. So, 90/5 = 18 hours<<<<<<Answer ",
