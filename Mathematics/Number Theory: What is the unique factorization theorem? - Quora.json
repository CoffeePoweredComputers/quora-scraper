Usually it is stated roughly as the following: Every integer greater than 1 either is prime itself or is the product of primes, and, although the order of the primes is arbitrary, the primes themselves are not.  For proofs, generalizations, applications or something else that's general like that, I recommend you see Wikipedia's page on it (Fundamental theorem of arithmetic), you should find plenty of information there.   where p1 < p2 < ... < pk are primes and the \u03b1i are positive integers.
