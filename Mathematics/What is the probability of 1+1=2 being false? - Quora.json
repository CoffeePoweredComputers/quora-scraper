            "answer_text": "The probability of a certain event is one. Maths is based on certain axioms and assumptions , but 1+1=2 is not an assumption (there by eliminating the probability of it being wrong), its a fact . It will always be true under our current maths , unless someone defines new axioms and make new assumptions and make new maths (it might be false in that maths ) It is proved that 1+1=2 will always be true (hence its probability of being false =0) you can google the proof or visit my answer for a shorter version. Nilesh Jha's answer to Do you need 300 pages to prove that 1+1=2? Edit : Earlier I wrote \u201cThe probability of a certain event is zero .\u201d By mistake Thank you @Zachary Taylor for pointing it . ",

            "answer_text": "Does the OP want something different from the regular answer? [math]1+1=2[/math] is always true as long as we are in the complex number field. We have one field [math]\\Z_2[/math] in which [math]1+1=0[/math], or in base [math]2[/math], where [math]1+1=10[/math] So, I am at least getting [math]2[/math] cases where this becomes false. So what\u2019s the probability? We have an infinite number of fields. [math]P(A)=\\dfrac{2}{\\infty}=0[/math] So, its still zero. This basically tells us that, we usually think up to complex numbers and not finite ordered fields when performing this simple addition. Please correct me if I wrote something wrong. My knowledge of Modern Algebra is getting a bit rusty. ",
