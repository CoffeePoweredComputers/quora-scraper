            "answer_text": "The area of a circle is pi x r x r. A circle with a diameter of 6cm has a radius of 3cm because the diameter is two times the radius. Therefore, the area of the circle with diameter of 6cm would be pi x 3 x 3 or (9 x pi)cm^2. An approximation: pi is approximately 3.14. Therefore, the circle with diameter 6cm would be approximately (9 x 3.14) cm^2 or approximately 28.26 square cm. ",
