            "answer_text": " For all f of x equal to summation of b n into sin of n pi x upon L from n equals to 1 to infinity, where x lies in the open interval of zero comma L; Parsvel's Identity states that 2 upon L into integral of f of x squared dx from zero to L is equal to summation of b squared n from n equals to one to infinity. For all undergraduate purposes this identity is accepted without proof. Let a function f of x be defined on the closed interval of minus pi comma pi. Using the well knwon Euler's formulas, cos phi equals to e power i phi plus e power minus i phi upon two and sin phi equals to e power i phi minus e power minus i phi upon 2; we can write the Fourier series of the function in complex form as f of x equals to summation of c n into e power i n x from n equals minus infinity to infinity. c n is called complex Fourier coefficient and is defined by the formula c n equals to one upon 2 pi into integral of f of x into e power minus i n x dx from minus pi to pi. Here, n may take any integer value. However, If necessary, to expand a function f of x of period 2L we can simply use the following expressions by simply multiplying the f of x equation's power with pi upon L and replacing the intervals of pi with L.
