Here\u2019s the way for solving all thia type of questions..[BODMAS] B - Brackets O - Of D - Division M - Multiplication A - Addition S - Subtraction So let's see your questions : = 8\u00f72(3\u20131) So as per our rule we will first focus on BRACKETS\u2026 = 8\u00f72(2) Now as we solved brackets , we will move to OF ,but as there is no of in question , moving to DIVISION\u2026 = 4(2) [Here , we did (8\u00f72) = 8 SO FINALLY WE GOT OUR ANSWER 8. HOPE YOU UNDERSTOOD\u2026AND FEEL FREE TO ASK OTHER QUESTIONS\u2026. ",

Hence, the answer is 2. If you think the answer is 8, then by your logic it should be 8 multiplied by 2 and then divided by (3\u20131), which is not the case. OR If there was a bracket around, 8\u00f72 then it would have been the answer, 8. As, then the answer would have been the product of the constants obtained by solving both the brackets. Thank you! ",

The multiplier should be seen as \u201cof\u201d and that  the \u201c2\u201d and the \u201c(3\u20131)\u201d are strongly coupled.  Had the author of the expression desired a weak multiplication \u201cx\u201d he/she would have explicitly written a \u201cx\u201d or \u201c*\u201d symbol there.  A  number preceding a bracket should be seen as a strong multiplier, such as \u201cof\u201d which has a higher priority than \u201c/\u201d under the BODMAS protocol This question is appearing too frequently in quora.  I thing we should accept the definition as given above and stop further discussion. ",

(1) In the United States, the acronym PEMDAS is common. It stands for Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication, Division, Addition, Subtraction. (2) Canada and New Zealand use BEDMAS, standing for Brackets, Exponents, Division, Multiplication, Addition, Subtraction. (3) In the UK, India and Australia are BODMAS meaning \"B\"rackets, \"O\"f or \"O\"rder, \"D\"ivision, \"M\"ultiplication, \"A\"ddition and \"S\"ubtraction. So according to first one the answer is 2 and according to second & third, the answer is 8. Generally BODMAS is preferred. ",
