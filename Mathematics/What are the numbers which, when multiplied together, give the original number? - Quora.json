            "answer_text": "The question looks partial, and as it stands it is very vague indeed. One possible kind of answer is \u201cthe factors of the original number\u201d, but even then one can't just pick any odd collection of factors and see it work. Some selections of factors work, and some don't. It depends also on whether the original number is zero or not. Some domains produce only uninteresting factorisations, because essentially everything factorises; fields, such as the rational numbers, are a good example, though not the most general kind of example.

            "answer_text": "Any number \u201ca\u201d multiplied by 1 or the equivalence of 1 (2/2,3/1/3, 2^0) will return \u201ca\u201d, the original number. Zero or its equivalence multiplied by any number will return zero. And, in division, a quotient multiplied by a divisor plus the remainder will return the dividend, the original number.This answer is not exhaustive of all the cases where numbers multiplied give the original number.
