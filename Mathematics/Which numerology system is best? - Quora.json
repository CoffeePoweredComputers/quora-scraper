            "answer_text": "For whom? For the practicers of numerology, it's irrelevant. They will skin their marks using any system, either devised by some ancient superstition or by simply making it up. Even if they're true believers in their divination craft, the fact is that they have never been able to show one shred of evidence regarding the magical powers they adscribe to it. I would do the following: choose a name like \"Janis Joplin\" (of course, don't use this one, we have professional numerologists watching) which is 1+1+5+9+1+1+6+7+3+9+5=48 4+8=12 1+2=3 and tell numerologists you have a person that means \"3 in Pythagorean numerology\". Ask them what this person's claim to fame is and their birth date, their age, their sex, their health problems. Don't offer any other information to the numerologist, none at all. See their failure. Laugh and repeat until you get the fact that numerology is useless except to transfer money from nice, credulous people into the pockets of numerologists. It is quite interesting to note that numerology is one of the most capricious superstitions. The word \"god\", which should mean the same in all languages, gets (in the Pythagorean system, which Pythagoras had nothing to do with) these values. In English god=7+6+4=17 1+7=8; in Spanish dios=4+9+6+1=20 2+0=2; in French (dieu) 4+9+5+3=21 2+1=3... so out of 9 possible numbers, you have that \"god\" could mean at least three of them (and probably all 9 if you check enough languages). So the word could mean literally anything the numerologist chooses. One other thing, seriously: can someone really believe that there are only 9 outcomes for every situation in the Universe and that someone can really know what the outcome will be by adding up numbers randomly assigned to a few letters in the Latin alphabet without Scandinavian (\u00e5, \u00e4, \u00f6),  Spanish (\u00f1) and other additions? It's absolutely whimsical, a base superstition fit for people who could add but had no idea about the complexities of our universe. ",

            "answer_text": "I feel as with anything, the one that is the best is the one you connect with and leads you in the best direction. We are all different from our gender, upbringing, culture, religion and beliefs. I found Numerology many years back and it made no sense. I was not open nor ready at that point in time. However the second time it crossed my path it made so much sense that it started to turn my life around. I looked at Chaldean after I looked at Pythagorean, there are differences. I chose Pythagorean as my main teaching because I felt connected to Pythagoras from school with Maths and the Pythagorean triangle. I needed strong proof, connection and understanding. Yes Numerology has changed the way I think and act or was I spiritually awakening and was evolving anyway. Either way after using Numerology to understand my past and that of my family and friends with great accuracy, I chose to use it to future plan. I dipped in and out however the more I meditated, the more intuitive I am becoming. I can see that unconsciously I have been living out the numbers energy each year, month etc so now each day I connect consciously and this enables me to live more in the upper vibration and when in the lower vibration I recover much quicker. I coach, teach and use Pythagorean Numerology as it found me. ",
