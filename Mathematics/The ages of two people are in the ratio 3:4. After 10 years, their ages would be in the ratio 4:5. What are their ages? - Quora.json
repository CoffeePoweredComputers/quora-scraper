            "answer_text": "Let the rational between ages of two people be x. Hence their ages are 3x and 4x. After 10 years, their ages would be in the ratio 4:5. What are their ages? After 10 years their ages would be (3x + 10) and (4x + 10) and their ratio 4/5. (3x + 10) / (4x + 10) = 4 / 5 Cross multiplication 4 (4x + 10) = 5 (3x + 10) 16x + 40 = 15x + 50 16x - 15x = 50 - 40 x = 10 The rational is 10, therefore their ages. 1st person 3x = 3 \u00d7 10 = 30 2nd person 4x = 4 \u00d7 10 = 40 Thus their ages are 30 and 40 respectively. Answer their ages are 30 and 40 respectively. ",

            "answer_text": "Use the information you have to set up two equations. Let their ages be x and y. Today, 4x = 3y, or equivalently, x=(3/4)y In ten years each age has increased by 10, so we can write this as 5(x+10) = 4(y+10) 5x+50 = 4y+40 5x + 10 = 4y (5/4)x + (10/4) = y From the first equation, we know x=(3/4)y, so we plug that into our second equation for x\u2026. (5/4)(3/4)y + (10/4) = y (15/16)y + (40/16) = (16/16)y (40/16) = (1/16)y 40 = y Back to our original equation, where x=(3/4)y, we use our derived value of y to solve for x: x = (3/4) (40) x = 30 So the ages (today) are 30 and 40.

            "answer_text": "30 and 40 now, 40 and 50 in 10 years. Since you didn't specify which part, felt it necessary to give both. Knowing the ratio needed to simply be 0.8, I set about an Excel table to do the work for me. Column A would have the the age of the first individual at the first age point, or basically the multiples of three. Ditto Column B, except with multiples of four. Column C would be 10 years later as our age of person A, so A+10, our numerator. Column D did the same with Person B, or B+10, the denominator. The final column, E, simply was C/D, given the desired target was 0.8, or 4/5. Drag, drop, and it matches up perfectly with 0.8. Furthermore, we can verify this in reverse. 30 vs 40 is a 3:4 ratio. Good. Now we add 10 to each side, and 40:50 is also 4:5. Both sides satisfied. Success! ",
