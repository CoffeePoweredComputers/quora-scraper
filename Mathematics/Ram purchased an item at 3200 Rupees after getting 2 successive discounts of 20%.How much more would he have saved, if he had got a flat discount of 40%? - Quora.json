So, m * {1 - (20 / 100)} * {1 - (20 / 100)} = 3200 m * 0.8 * 0.8 = 3200 m = (3200 / 0.64) = 5000 Had it been there a flat 40% discount; Ram would have purchased the item for [5000 * {1 - (40 / 100)}] rupees = 3000 rupees. And, in this case, Ram would have saved (3200 - 3000) rupees = 200 rupees. ",

So, original price = (4000/80)\u00d7100= Rs5000 If one time discount was 40% then selling price will be 5000\u2013[ (5000/100)\u00d740] = (5000\u20132000) = Rs 3000 So Ram can be saved 3200\u20133000=Rs 200 ",
