            "answer_text": "The required single discount equivalent to the discount series of 20%, 10% and 5% is 31.6% Now you must be curious as to how this came (coz that's the reason you posted this question, right? :-P ) Here\u2019s the detailed explanation behind your answer: Step 1: For ease, let\u2019s consider the initial amount to be Rs. 100 Step 2: Now the first discount is of 20%. So 20% of Rs. 100 = (20/100)*100 = Rs. 20 Step 3: Now left amount = 100 - 20 = Rs. 80 Step 4: Now the second discount is of 10%. So 10% of Rs. 80 = (10/100)*80 = Rs. 8 Step 5: Now left amount = 80 - 8 = Rs. 72 Step 6: Now the third discount is of 5%. So 5% of Rs. 72 = (5/100)*72= Rs. 3.60 Step 7: Now left amount = 72 - 3.60 = Rs. 68.40 Step 8: So the overall discount offered = 100 - 68.40 = 31.60 Step 9: So the overall discount % offered = (31.60/100)*100 = 31.6% Hence, The required single discount equivalent to the discount series of 20%, 10% and 5% is 31.6% Approach 2: Formula If the first discount is x% and 2nd discount is y% then,Total discount = ( x + y - xy /100)%If there are three discounts as x%, y% and z% then find the total discount of x % and y% first and using it find the total discount with z%Discount after x and y (d) = ( x + y - xy /100)%Total discount = ( d + z - dz /100)%Solving your question with this approach: Here x = 20, y = 10, and z = 5%.Therefore, Discount after x and y (d) = ( x + y - xy /100)%= (20 + 10 - 20*10/100)%= (30 \u2013 2)%= 28%Total discount = ( d + z - dz /100)%= (28 + 5 - 28*5/100)%= (33 \u2013 1.4)%= 31.6%Hence, The required single discount equivalent to the discount series of 20%, 10% and 5% is 31.6%",

            "answer_text": "Let the marked price of an item be \u20b9 x Then, selling price after 20 % discount ( first discount) x - ( 20 / 100)x = x - 0.2 x = 0.8 x A further discount of 10 % (second discount) on this discounted price will bring down the selling price to. 0.8x - (0.8 * 10 / 100) x = 0.8 x - 0.08 x = 0.72 x A further discount of 5 % on 0.72 x will further reduce the selling price to 0 72 x - ( 0.72 * 5 / 100.) x = 0.72 x - 0.036 x = 0 684 x Let this series of three discounts be equivalent to a single discount of d % on the original marked price, x. Then, x - (x * d / 100) = 0.684 x Or, x ( 1 - d / 100) = 0.684 x Therefore, (1 - d / 100) = 0.684 Or, ( 100 - d) /100 = 0.684 Or, 100 - d = 68.4 Or, d = 100 - 68.4 = 31.6 % So, a single discount of 31.6 % shall ve equivalent to a series of three discounts of 20 %, 10 % and 5 %.
