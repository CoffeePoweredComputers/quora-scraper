            "answer_text": "Here\u2019s a simple example (in the Cartesian plane):  In general, the points which satisfy  form a circle with radius r centered at . If , only the single point  satisfies that equation. (And if , no points satisfy that equation.) Similarly, in Cartesian space (three dimensions),  is the single point . Additional detail: The above gives two examples of when an equation represents a point, but does not give a general characterization of when that happens. There are so many ways for that to happen that is difficult to get too specific, but this probably covers most cases\u2014although it is so (necessarily) vague that it might not be all that useful: Consider a function  with domain the Cartesian plane  (or some subset thereof) . The level curves of F are solutions to the equations  for some constant C. Therefore, a level curve represents a single point if there is only one solution  to . In particular, if F has a maximum (or minimum) value which is achieved at exactly one point, then that maximum (minimum) value yields a single-point level curve.The first example above uses the level curves of ., which has a global minimum value of 0 at . For a more exotic example:  has a global maximum value of approximately 0.396653 at . When does an equation represent a point? ",

            "answer_text": "When you have a point with 2 variables, generally one pair of equations have a solution (x,y) in a coordinte system For example 3x+4y=8 6x+y=48 By reduction; Solutions: 3y=-40 3x+4(-40)=8 3x=168 x=56 In this case the equationi lineal Then the point y in cartesian coordinates determinate a set of points (x,y) One x generally differen for every y. In this case there are only one case, the equiation is determinate, and not a tautolgy, then it have only one solution: it is the point:(56,-40/3) It is not strange, 2 linear equations in different directions in a plane obly have on solution But you can apply in all the situations. Sometimes it will be many solutions, another one only or no one. You can do it the same transformation to 2 members of the equation. But remember, in the final equation can be various solutions that are not valid for the one. The reciprocal is not true ",
