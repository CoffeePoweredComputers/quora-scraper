            "answer_text": "Statistically speaking in terms of pure theory, \u201csampling\u201d as a process can be undertaken across space and time and any other dimension. What needs to be specified is the parent \u201cpopulation\u201d, including the unit of measurement: and the method of taking samples. Sampling theorems appears to be the application of sampling theory to data which vary with time. The most famous application appears to be in signal processing: where continuous wave signals, are converted to a series of discrete time samples? The sampling interval, or time between two observations/data points, needs to be specified, which is usually written as T or Theta? The continuous function which would usually appear as a wave in a graphical representation, is then broken down or sampled, in discrete bits of data? It would be useful to look at the applications in sound engineering, to get a better understanding ",

            "answer_text": "A band limited signal can be reconstructed exactly if it is sampled at a rate at least twice the maximum frequency component in it. The minimum required sampling rate is called Nyquist rate. In practice signal are over sampled, where the sampling frequency(fs) is significantly higher than Nyquist rate to avoid aliasing. ",
