            "answer_text": "So, assuming that they are painting at the same rate throughout the whole thing, six people will take one day to paint 1/8 of a wall. So, one person would paint 1/48 of this wall in one day, and four people would paint 4/48, or 1/12, in a day. Which means they would take 12 days to paint that wall, painting at the same rate as the six people painting. ",
