That means, neither a^2 can be negative nor b^2 can be negative. Now, adding (1) and (2), a^2 + b^2 >= 0 Now for this inquation to hold true, both a^2 = 0 and b^2 = 0 So, a = 0 b = 0 ",

            "answer_text": "The only possible value of A & B is 0. If we take any number except 0 it will not equal to 0. If you take any negative value, it's square will become positive. To make A\u00b2+B\u00b2=0, you need one negative value and the same value in positive. And square of negative value will become positive. So, if we take A=B=0 Then, any power of 0 will become 0. So\u2026 A\u00b2+B =0\u00b2+0\u00b2 =0+0 =0 LHS=RHS That's why A=B=0. @Mathematics ",
