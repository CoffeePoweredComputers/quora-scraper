Where 'n' is any integer But the function x is both injective and surjective in any real domain as it is always an increasing function in the real interval . But the given function f(x) is the sum of the functions x and sinx. So f(x) is a bijective function in the interval. (-oc,oc)\u03a0[n\u03c0,2n\u03c0] So the interval in which the function is a bijective is [n\u03c0,2n\u03c0]. For all n is any natural number. ",
