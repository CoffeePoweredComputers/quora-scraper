            "answer_text": "All of the science disciplines can change the way you think. I loved studying English at school and found great release in writing, using my imagination. We had a crap Physics teacher, who taught it like a branch of engineering. I came bottom but one with 19%. Then I got to like Chemistry, we had a very charismatic young Chemistry teacher. Finally, at university, I realised I hated Organic Chemistry and changed to theoretical physics. Lots of maths and super interesting. so I would say do what you get to love, that could well change as the years go by. To finally answer the question. Maths will make you smarter, in the sense that you will think in more depth. But what changed my way of thinking most was computer programming. It\u2019s been said that unless you can program a maths/physics problem, then you don\u2019t fully understand it. And even commercial programming makes you think logically. I used to be hopeless at chess at school and always lost to my friend, who became captain of a big chess club. Years later, after programming for years, I took his queen! I hadn\u2019t played any chess in the meantime, just been forced to think logically with programming. The downside of logical thinking can be the loss of ones imagination. That happened to me. I think it\u2019s a terrible price to pay. We are more than robots. I\u2019m desperately trying to get my childhood imagination back. ",

            "answer_text": "No. Studying math will not make you smarter (i.e., increase your IQ, etc.). But studying math will make you better at and more knowledgeable about math in general and most likely will increase your average performance on math quizzes, (standardized) tests and examinations in school and in college. Also, consistent and regular study and application of math and mathematical concepts and principles will definitely make you a more proficient and competent mathematician either as an amateur enthusiast or as a professional (should you ever decide to degree in mathematics at college in order to embark on a position or career that utilizes it). Although, what is true about the continuous and conscious study and application of math is also true about any other subject or discipline you can name or imagine. For the more you work at anything\u2014whether a subject like math or a skill\u2014the better you will be at it. I hope this brief answer to your query suffices you.
