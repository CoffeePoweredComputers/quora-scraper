            "answer_text": "NO, -5 is not greater than 0. To understand this let us consider the case of loan and in hand money. For any amount of money you have in your hand you give them the numbers 1,2,. Etc depending upon the amountIf you dont have any money in your hand you are at the 0 (zero) stateIf you have to pay any loan then you need to give the money to that person first before spending it on yourself. Thus, this amount will be treated as a (negative) - for yourselfTherefore, The number increases from minus infinite to plus infinite when we move from left to right on a number line with zero in between.
