            "answer_text": "What is 45\u00f745? If this is a serious question, continue reading. If this is not a serious question then skip a little. There is a pattern to be seen. [math]4\\div 4[/math] is the number that you multiply 4 by to get 4. Well, that\u2019s 1. [math]8\\div 4[/math] is the number that you multiply 4 by to get 8, and that\u2019s 2. [math]top\\div bottom[/math] is the number you multiply bottom by to get top. I have digressed. Let\u2019s concentrate on your question. [math] 5\\div 5[/math] is the number you multiply 5 by to get 5. Yes, its 1. Now see the pattern. [math]8\\div 8=1[/math], [math]12\\div 12=1,[/math] [math]4023\\div 4023=1.[/math] Your turn, [math]45\\div 45=?[/math] In general, [math]almosteverything\\div almosteverything=?[/math] But why just almost everything? 0 does us a lot of favours but also causes problems. What is [math]0\\div 0[/math]? I claim it is 7 \u2014 my favourite number. Why? [math]0\\div 0=7[/math] because [math]0\\times 7=0.[/math] There, it checked out. So [math]0\\div 0=5,[/math] my second favourite number. You were to jump to here if it was not a serious question. Using logic similar to an old Ma and Pa Kettle routine, to divide 45 by 45, start by saying that 4 divided by 4 is 1 and then 5 divided by 5 is 1. So the answer s 11. To check it , multiply 45 by 11. Well, 1 times 5 is 5 and the other 1 times 4 is 4 so 11 times 45 is 45. It checked out. The last paragraph was not true. It was a joke. But Google Ma and Pa Kettle Math. ",

            "answer_text": "It clearly depends of who performs the operation. A youngster learning \u2019rithmatics will answer \u201c1\u201d. All those trained in mathematics, subsector algebra will answer: anything divided by the same number (lest 0) equals 1. 45 is not equal to 0, so 1. Those trained in computing will start out to define the operand \u201c:\u201d and add the exclusion that anything devided by \u201c0\u201d (zero) might by anything else, so therefore zero is excluded from the set of divisors. And then loop back to the preceding paragraph. If however you ask a lawyer to distribute 45 objects, e. g. 45 shares to 45 people, he first will take away his share, e.g. 15 and distribute the rest more or less equally, so the answer is 0,6 to 0,7, or so. ;-) ",
