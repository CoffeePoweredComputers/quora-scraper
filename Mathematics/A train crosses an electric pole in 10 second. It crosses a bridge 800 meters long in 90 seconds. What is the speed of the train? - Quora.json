            "answer_text": "Distance is Bridge 800 metres in Time of 90 seconds Train crosses a static electric pole in 10 seconds x the travel rate of the train. Length of Train is therefore 100 metres Total Length is 900 metres in 90 seconds = Travel Rate of 10 metres per second. 3,600 seconds x 10 metres per second = Speed = 36 km/h or 36,000 metres per hour Static Pole Time of 10 seconds is x 10 metres per seconds = Train Length is confirmed correct at 100 metres in length..

            "answer_text": "Let speed of the train be v m/s Length of the train = v\u00d710 m ( as it took 10 sec to cross a pole) To cross 800 metre bridge train has to cover 800 + 10v m of distance (800 m of bridge and 10v of its own length) v=(800+10v)/90 On solving this above equation we get v=10 m/s Hope this will help!!!
