            "answer_text": "There is more than one answer.Imagine Rubick\u2019s cube 5x5. We can take out this cuboid in more than one way. Cube surface is 6*5*5=150cm^21. From the edge: cuboid and cube share 5cm edge.Area of remaining cube is smaller 150cm^2-2*2cm*2cm=142cm^2 2. From the side: cuboid and cube share 5x2 side of cuboid.Area=150\u20132*2*2+2*2*5=162 cm^2 3. From the side: cuboid and cube share 2x2 side of cuboid (hole in the cube).Area=150\u20132*2*2+4*2*5=182 cm^2 4. Cuboid\u2019s aligment is tilted with angle compare to the sides and edges of the cube (not like Rubick cube). 5x2 squrae is inscribed in 5x5 square. One side of cuboid is element of cubes side but edges are at different angles\u2026 ",
