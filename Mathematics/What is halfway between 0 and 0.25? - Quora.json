            "answer_text": "if you have a 4 sliced pizza pieces and if your friend ask you to share pizza pieces equally then you would simply separate the two pieces along the diameter of circular pizza. And eat them . am I right? Similarly think if you had only one piece of pizza then you would cut 1 piece through corner of the piece to circumference of the pizza piece. That shape what you get is nothing but the half way of 0.25 and 0 numerically . The example can be stated numerically as: 0 + 0.25/2 (\u00f7 2 because there are 2 persons) 0.25/2= 0.125 ",

            "answer_text": "Well, you can find the halfway between any two points by finding the mean of them. The usual formula for the mean is:[math]( a + b ) / 2[/math] In your case \u201ca\u201d is equal to zero and \u201cb\u201d is equal to 0.25, so\u2026 [math]( 0 + 0.25 ) / 2 0.25 / 2 0.125[/math] There you have it.
