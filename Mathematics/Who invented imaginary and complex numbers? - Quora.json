            "answer_text": "It's actually difficult to say who actually was the first to come up with the idea of complex numbers or for that matter any mathematical findings because in mathematics there is no sort of 'inventions' since everything is believed to have existed in nature since the time of inception, just that with more advancement and evolution of human minds men were able to solve the mysteries out of these unknown physical phenomenon. But yes there definitely are some people who gets to see the day light faster than others and we remember them as the pioneers of those respective fields and complex numbers too was no exception in that regard. The very first account of the square root of a negative number is actually found in a book called Stereometria by Heron of Alexandria (1st century A.D)and he is regarded as the first man to have encountered such ambiguous mathematical notations (there may be some early Egyptians too in this regard but those are not recorded). Next significant mention of square root of a negative number is found in the works of Diophantus in his book Arithmetica . However this men are not credited with the tag of pioneers of this field because mathematics not being so advanced back then they could not proceed further with their findings and thought their work to be wrong. Then real work probably began with Luca Pacioli , Scorpions del Ferro, Cardano who managed to provide some mathematical hint of complex numbers through their works on solving of cubic equations . However the term complex numbers was not used by any of them until the arrival of the great (one of the greatest ever) mathematician Leonard Euler who introduced the term iota and gave the symbol [math]i[/math] and made significant contribution in field of complex numbers and story has still not reached its climax yet and is witnessing appearance of several new actors with every passing year. In this regard I would like to request the interested readers to go through this blog of mine if you are know the history of this beautiful area of mathematics because I have done a fair bit of study on it for complex numbers fascinates me more than anything else in mathematics.Soumajit Das's post in Mad-e-matics Thanks for reading!!

            "answer_text": "It\u2019s hard to really say, but among the first in the West who were known to do so were three 16th-century mathematicians named Niccolo Fontana Tartaglia, Gerolamo Cardano, and Scipione del Ferro. All three were interested in solving the problem of cubic equations \u2014 equations of the form [math]ax^3+bx^2+cx+d = 0[/math]. It was known since antiquity how to solve quadratic equations, but no one knew how to solve cubic equations. What\u2019s worse, while quadratic equations like [math]x^2+1 = 0[/math] have no solution, it was also apparent that every cubic equation had at least one solution. So working independently on the problem, Tartaglia and del Ferro found general solutions to the problem. Cardano talked Tartaglia into revealing to him his solution with the promise he wouldn\u2019t reveal it. A few years later, Cardano saw an unpublished, but earlier, solution by del Ferro that was the same as Tartaglia\u2019s, and decided that released him from his promise not to reveal it, and he published the solution known to both Tartaglia and del Ferro independently. The solution of the cubics goes in several steps, doing many variable substitutions necessary to reduce the complexity of the problem, until at the end, you end up with an equation that is quadratic in [math]u^3[/math], where [math]u[/math] is one of the many variable substitutions involved. You can then solve that quadratic to get two values of [math]u^3[/math], take the cube roots, plug those back into the previous formulas, etc, etc, etc, and eventually get 3 values out for roots of the original equation. However, there\u2019s a problem which stymied many earlier mathematicians which tried this path: Quadratic equations sometimes have no solutions, and you need solutions in order to use this method. So what Tartaglia and del Ferro did in their solutions was that they knew that they were going to be doing further calculations with the \u201croots\u201d of the quadratic, so they simply pretended that the non-existent, imaginary roots were genuine, and continued to do maths with them. What they found, much to their delight, was that at least one of the imaginary roots would completely cancel away, leaving at least one \u201creal\u201d solution to the original cubic. Furthermore, they noticed that when the original cubic was known to have one real solution, their procedure would give one real solution and two imaginary ones, when it was known to have two real solutions, it would give one real solution and two copies of another real solution, and when it was known to have three real solutions, it would give all three real solutions \u2014 the imaginary bits fully cancelled out! Cardano, in his 1545 book Ars Magna, acknowledged the existence of these imaginary numbers, but openly did not fully understand their properties. He used them in del Ferro\u2019s solution to the cubic, and in his own student, Lodovico Ferrari\u2019s solution to the quartic equation ([math]ax^4+bx^3+cx^2+dx+e = 0[/math]). After Cardano published Tartaglia\u2019s solution, other mathematicians started to play with these \u201cimaginary\u201d numbers, and the mathematician which successfully figured out everything and published first was Rafael Bombelli. Rafael Bombelli published his book, Algebra, in 1572 which fully taught how to work with imaginary numbers. Bombelli is generally regarded as the inventor of complex numbers, as he worked out the rules for working with them better than anyone before him, using them to solve problems that even Cardano, Tartaglia, and del Ferro had given up on.
