            "answer_text": "Asking these type of question reminds me of, a student in our class who just to pretend that he understand everything the teacher teaches us in class; ask silly questions. Anyways for your question i have more than 3 methods to solve and more or less all are same method but technique used seems different. Method I: Compound Interest = = [P (1 + i)^n] \u2013 P P=10000 n=3 Years i=2 % per annum Therefore; {10000(1+2%)^3}-10000 Or 10000(102/100)^3 - 10000 Or 10000(51/50)^3 - 10000 Or 10612.08 - 10000 = 612.08 Amount = 10612.08 Method 2: R= 2% Find the ratio proportion of it i.e 2/100 or 1/50 if 50 is principal then 1 is Interest. By the same logic we will write it like this:  Method 3: Find the Rate of actual interest with respect to 100 FOR CUMULATIVE BASIS which is not feasible for these type of questions.
