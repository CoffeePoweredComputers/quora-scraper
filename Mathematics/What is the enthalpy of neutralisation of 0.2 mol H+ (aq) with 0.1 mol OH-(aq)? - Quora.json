            "answer_text": "So we have 0.1 mole OH- and 0.2 mole of H+ So 0.1 mole H+ reacts with 0.1 mole OH- leaving behind 0.1 mole H+. Thus, the change in enthalpy is equal to the enthalpy of neutralization of 0.1 mole H+ with 0.1 mole OH-. Thus, the enthalpy change associated is -5.762 kJ at 25 \u00b0C or 5.762 kJ of heat is released(since enthalpy change for neutralization 1 mole of H+ with 1 mole of OH- is -57.62 kJ/mol at 25 \u00b0C, that is, the reaction is exothermic). I HOPE IT HELPED !! ",
