            "answer_text": " Let\u2019s start with a good news, being bad at math is completely fixable, all you need is some mindset shift and put in some work. The bad news is that there is no quick-fix. Here are a few things you can do to fix it. Get rid of the limiting belief \u2018I\u2019m bad at math\u2019 Being bad at math doesn't mean you're inherently stupid, or born hopeless at math. It just means you haven't put in enough effort learning it and didn't learn it properly. Limiting beliefs are beliefs that holds us back, like \u2018I\u2019m never good enough\u2019 or \u2018I\u2019ll never do well in studies\u2019. Holding that belief is like shooting yourself in the foot before starting a marathon. No matter how hard you try to push yourself to learn, your limiting belief will give you a thousands of reason on why not to learn and give up. So get rid of that belief, instead of thinking \u2018I\u2019m bad at math\u2019, replace it with \u2018I have limitless potential at math, I just to work on it step by step\u2019. Adopt the Growth Mindset In her book Mindset: The New Psychology of Success, Carol Dweck discusses the importance of adopting the growth mindset when studying instead of the fixed mindset. The fixed mindset is the belief that intelligence is fixed, something you're born with. If you're born stupid then bad luck, you'll be stupid the rest of your life. As it turns out fixed mindset is just a form of limiting belief which holds us back from learning and improving. On the other hand, adopting the growth mindset, the belief that intelligence is like a muscle that can be grown through hard work and effort, is more helpful. Dweck found that simply adopting this mindset, students improved steadily and is more likely to do better in their studies. As it turns out, there is also more truth in the growth mindset than the fixed mindset, our mind do have the capacity to grow. Recently neuroscientist, using the MRI brain scanner, discovered that certain regions of the brain grows denser as people learn a new skill. The ability for the brain to change is term neuroplasticity, as opposed to neurorigidity, and opens up many possibilities for all of us. Take baby steps and celebrate every small victory As I mentioned at the start, there is no quick-fix at being good at math. However I can guarantee progress if you take baby steps and improve bit by bit consistently. Math is a skill that requires practice. Very often we get impatient and want to master it quickly and get the good grades. Mastering math doesn't work this way. Instead be real with yourself, analyse objectively where you currently stand, give yourself challenges that well match to your abilities, and work on it. Most importantly, celebrate every small victory. Learned a new concept? Celebrate. Tackled a problem? Celebrate. Did revision? Celebrate. Very often when we did the work and made small improvements, we find it not enough, we feel inadequate and not learning fast enough. We want to reach the end quickly, but don\u2019t enjoy the journey. No matter how fast you learn, this feeling will always loom. It\u2019s ironic that such small steps are necessary to make progress, and we have a tendency to beat ourselves up when taking small steps. It\u2019s very tempting to skip steps and try to find shortcuts to success. In reality however, doing so is detrimental, will only lead to more frustration, and hurt your progress as you'll miss out critical details along the way. Remember being bad at math is nothing to be ashamed about, and can totally fixable by adjusting your mindsets and study habits. Follow the tips I\u2019ve laid out and I can guarantee you'll improve if you follow the steps! For more study tips, check out my blog at Nerd of Passion! ",

            "answer_text": "Being bad at maths is a state of mind for many people. People in many countries e.g. UK find it easier to relate to other people when they say \u201cI am not good with numbers\u201d. The secret to being good or normal at maths is to (i) know how to think (ii) practice. A bit like a sport, you need to know what you are trying to do, and then practice makes perfect. It is normal for us to start finding solutions when there is a problem. In order for that to work, we must fully understand the problem before finding solutions. Sometimes, due to the way things are taught to us, we start finding a solution before fully comprehending the problem. This messes up the whole thinking process. When I started in product management, I had recently finished an MBA and I also had an MSc in Engineering so I used to feel very proud of my numbers skills. When I joined the team, a very experienced product manager showed me a business case which basically was supposed to show me if a certain business idea made financial sense. Business case is all numbers and calculations as you can imagine. When I looked at that business case, I found it really hard to understand. In fact, I couldn\u2019t really understand the calculations. That experienced product manager made me feel as if it was my fault that I was not getting his calculations. It did impact my confidence level at the time even though I was a proud maths guy. Now after more than a decade of doing business cases in many global organisations, I realise that the business case that I was shown by that experienced product manager, was done in a very poor way. I teach maths to my son who is in primary school. Sometimes when I look at the kind of maths challenges/questions they are given, I feel that I would have approached some of those challenges differently. As a result I am compiling our weekly \u201clectures\u201d in the form of books. Have a look at this first one we have published on \u2018factors & multiples\u2019. Just have a look at the free preview pages and see if it makes sense to you. I have tried to focus on \u201chow to think\u201d part so that the readers approach the problem in the right way. Amazon.com: Maths Like a Pro \u2013 Factors & Multiples: An adult\u2019s guide to primary school maths eBook: A Ghayas, Commsbrief Limited: Kindle Store We all understand things in different ways, so just because you are finding something hard, doesn\u2019t mean you are bad at it, it just means you need to look at it from a different perspective.
