            "answer_text": "Your question seems to be incomplete. Your question that asks, \u201cWhat is A={a,b,c,d}?\u201d is similar to asking, \u201cWhat is purple?\u201d In this case you are more than likely asking about set notation. Set notation is a way of listing items/elements in a set which is usually the precursor for follow on algebraic questions. An example would be Fruit: apple, banana, cherry, date. There are four elements to that particular set, and of that set you can make many different combinations. In this case A is a set containing the elements a, b, c, and d. Many questions usually are derived from set notation include how many subsets are there (2^n) or how many proper subsets are there ((2^n)-1), etc. For the equation asked the possible subsets are : those that include no elements: {none} those that include just 1 element each: {just a}, {just b}, {just c}, {just d}those that include 2 elements each: {a and b}, {a and c}, {a and d}, {b and c}, {b and d}, {c and d} those that include 3 elements each: {a, b, and c}, {b, c, and d}, {a, b, and d}, and {a, c, and d} and those that include all 4 elements: {a, b, c, and d}. For the original equation there were 4 elements, therefore 2^n would be 2^4 or 16, so there should be 16 subsets, which we have listed. Proper subsets are all subsets where the subset doesn\u2019t equal the original set, as in the last of those includes all 4 elements which is the same as the original set therefore, the last is not a proper subset (hence the -1 after the 2^n, you are subtracting the last set which is the only one equal to the original set). Anyways, that should get you started. ",
