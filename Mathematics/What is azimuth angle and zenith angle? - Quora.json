            "answer_text": "If you are observing the Sun, or the Moon, or another celestial body, or a satellite, you can construct a 3D coordinate system with X- and Y-axis as the horizontal axes, and Z-axis the vertical one; then you can draw a vector starting from the origin of the coordinate system and pointing to the celestial body, and this vector will have a projection in the X-Y plane. Now the angle between the vector and the Z-axis is the zenith angle, and the angle between the horizontal projection of the above mentioned vector and a horizontal direction of your choice (e.g., negative direction of the Y-axis) is the azimuth angle.
