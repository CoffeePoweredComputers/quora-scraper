            "answer_text": "The core idea is that all units should: be tied to reproducible physical quantities whenever possible, so that anyone can calibrate their measurements against nature (still working on a good kilogram, but meters and seconds are solid, for instance), andget bigger and smaller via powers of ten.For instance, the meter started out as one ten-millionth of the distance from the North Pole to the Equator if you ignored things like mountains. The Earth vibrates after earthquakes, though, so once you need more precision that one part in a million, a better thing is needed. The current standard is the wavelength of light from a very stable atomic transition, just count off the right number of wavelengths and you have a meter. The second already existed, so they just formalized it as one 86400th of a day. But just like the Earth vibrates, it also speeds up and slows down slightly in response to various stuff. So the second is now defined as the time it takes another atom to oscillate between states a certain number of times. The powers of ten thing just makes calculations and conversions easier. Instead of inches, feet, yards, and miles, you have centimeters, meters, kilometers. Just pick the prefixed version that is best for what you\u2019re measuring, or stick to meters and use big or small numbers. A lot of the older systems used conversions that were easy to divide into halves, thirds, quarters, and so forth. 12 inches to a foot and 16 ounces to a pound are convenient if you\u2019re trying to split stuff up and don\u2019t have a calculator. But it\u2019s a lot easier to program a machine to deal with just a single number in one kind of unit. ",

            "answer_text": "The metric system was implemented as a geographic system, and generally uses concepts that the smarter eighteenth-century would put in. We suppose the earth is a sphere, and that one minute of arc is a mile. This is actually how we get the nautical mile. This mile is 6080 ft, but Cassini and others divided this into 6000 feet. So on your GPS, the seconds and hundredths of a second, make the 6000 feet in the mile. You can pick any sphere. The British mile of 6080, comes from the sphere of equal surface or area, the metric 1852 metres comes from the size of the minute at 45 degrees. If you decimalise the quadrant (90\u00b0) to 100 degrees of 100 minutes, the geographic measure becomes a kilometre, dividing into 1000 metres, etc. The actual quadrant is too long for the practice, because triangulation is used to create a difference from astronomical measurements, because of creeping errors. The area and volume are derived by products of length. A litre is meant to represent a decimetre cube, but as a measure of capacity. Capacity is space by pouring liquids and pourable solids, is much more accurate than geometric volume. The unit of weight is a litre of water, called a grave, or \u2018chog\u2019. You can see from this name, that if used, the kc to mc replaces tons to grams, in the same way that km to mm replaces miles to inches. Fineweight or troy weight, is weight by trail, (ie using delecite scales that jewellers and apothecarians would use). The grave is a kilogram troy weight, the gram is the more usual, but descends to milligrams. Money is derived from fine-weight of silver, but the implementation was largely abandoned as costing too much. The people revolted, and so a \u2018system usuelle\u2019 was introduced. This displaced the use of graves as avoirdupoise units, and when the systeme usuelle was repealed in 1840, the idea of separate avoirdupoise and troy weights had fallen out of favour. The metric troy was extended upwards to kilograms. For lack of prefixes, the myriagram, quintal and millier or tonne extends the series. The metric system then entered a state of cost-inspired decay, until the current system. I\u2019m afraid that this decay is still all too rampant. ",
