            "answer_text": "Answer: The reciprocal of the other number. For any nonzero number \"a\", there exists a number 1/a, called the reciprocal or the multiplicative inverse of a, such that (a)(1/a) = 1, which is the multiplicative identity. Example 1: The reciprocal of 5 is 1/5, i.e., one-fifth, and ...5(1/5) = 5/5 = 1 Example 2: The reciprocal of -3/4 is -4/3, i.e., negative four-thirds, and ...(-3/4)(-4/3) = 12/12 = 1 Example 3: The reciprocal of 4 + 3i is: 1/(4 + 3i) = 1/(4 + 3i)[(4 - 3i)/(4 - 3i)] = [1(4 - 3i)]/[(4 + 3i)(4 - 3i)] = (4 - 3i)/(16 - 9i\u00b2) = (4 - 3i)/(16 + 9) = (4 - 3i)/25 Then, ... (4 + 3i)[(4 - 3i)/25] = [(4 + 3i)(4 - 3i)]/25 = 25/25 = 1 ",
