            "answer_text": "11 To say that a number is divisible by another number is equivalent to saying that the number is a product of the other number Intuitively 11*9=99 which is 1 less than 100. Thus products of 9 occur 11 times in a 100 number range. To be certain we can take 12*9=108 which is the first product of 9 in the range of 100 to 200. Then we can calculate the last product of 9 in this range to be 198 which equals 9*22. The occurences of products of 9 in the range of 100 to 200 is 12 to 22 which turns out to be 11 products. The answer is most definitely 11. ",

            "answer_text": "Quick answer: 11 Really this one is pretty easy, divide the numbers in your set by 9. In this case its 11 with a remainder of 1. So you can have 11 or 12 if the first and last value are divisible. Spoiler alert, the last one isn\u2019t. The answer is 11. Feel free to use your fingers to count the values to verify. ",
