            "answer_text": "A directed graph only flows one way between nodes. One example is rivers merging and splitting over a landscape. They aren't going to flow backwards. An undirected graph example is a graph of academic collaborations on papers. If you share a paper with person X, they share a paper with you by default. There aren't one-way relationships. ",

            "answer_text": "A good example of a directed graph is Twitter or Instagram. You can follow a person but it doesn\u2019t mean that the respective person is following you back. You have a connection to them, they don\u2019t have a connection to you. An undirected graph is Facebook. You befriend a person and you both become friends. It\u2019s both ways: you can see his/her posts, they can see yours. ",
