            "answer_text": "It's 4. There are two ways to do this. 1)Begin division from the bottom. So we have8/4/2. So at bottom we have 4/2 solve it and you get 2. Replace the answer with original equation. We have now 8/2=4 2)We have 8/4/2. In situations like this when you have a/b/c, the format of answer will be a*c/b. So 8*2/4=16/4=4. Proof of method (2): When we divide one number by another what we actually do is multiply one number by multiplicative inverse of other. But we only do such things in equation. So let's prove it. So let's take the numbers 8 and 4/2(without reducing 4/2 to 2). Let's consider 8 and 4/2 as two terms instead of three (8,4,2). I am dividing 8 by 4/2 so I am actually multiplying 8 by 2/4 (inverse of 4/2). So we get 8/1\u00d72/4=8\u00d72/4=4. When doing simple division there's no need to go this deep. But when faced with irrational numbers/equations OR HOTS(High Order Of Thinking Set) you should use method (2). Hope this helps. ",

            "answer_text": "The customary order of operations applies operations of the same type from left to right. That would mean that 8/4/2=8\u00f74\u00f72=(8\u00f74)\u00f72=2\u00f72=1[math]8/4/2=8\u00f74\u00f72=(8\u00f74)\u00f72=2\u00f72=1[/math]. However, it is not good practice to write expressions that appear confusing or require a careful application of conventions to evaluate them. The notation of mathematics is intended to be clear and unambiguous; if you find that something you are writing is unclear or potentially ambiguous it is better to add clarification. This can usually be done with parentheses. For example, writing (8/4)/2[math](8/4)/2[/math]makes the meaning of this expression much clearer. We all want to be able to focus on the actual mathematics, not worry about the notational detail. ",
