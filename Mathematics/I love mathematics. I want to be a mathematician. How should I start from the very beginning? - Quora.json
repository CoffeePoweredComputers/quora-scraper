            "answer_text": "I admire your interest, desire to learn and for having a commendable goal in your life. Two important points before answering the actual question  Mathematics just by itself is a HUGE subject with dozens of domains (as your folders demonstrate roughly) and each again dozens of subdomain, then each subdomain with some dozens of important open problems (one of which will constitute your Ph.D. thesis if you go down that road).An important skill in your journey to become a true expert of any topic (be it mathematics or chemistry or linguistics) is the skill to learn, the skill to find your own references, materials from which to learn independently, from which to seek answer. So you need to develop that skill as well.Anyway, from the categories you gave, I will advise you to start with  Abstract algebraReal & complex analyses of which calculus is a simplified version Probability & statisticsAll three of them together provide good foundations to build further, and while you build, just remember that the sky is the limit in both depth (delving into a narrow domain) and breadth (broader knowledge about very different domains). Of course, you may not find all of them equally challenging or interesting, or suitable for your career (unfortunately you may have to make a living out of it, rather than just doing it at your home as a hobby). So depending on these different parameters you may choose to dig deeper into some of the specialised fields than the others. Typically I believe topology will come in only after you got some comprehensive idea of abstract algebra, linear algebra and analyses (real & complex). So if you have only a high school level background (even though I don't know how does the high school curriculum look like in your country) it does not make much sense to go for topology straightway.  As for discrete math, graph theory etc. they fall more in the domain of theoretical computer science oriented course. While interesting they are, they might be considered somewhat niche in the pure mathematics community.  In the end, my advice would be to get into the undergraduate curriculum of a good university (which I am sure you aim to do eventually). Any good university will have their undergraduate curriculum organised in a pedagogical manner, which will expose you to a wide variety of domains in a suitable order. Following the curricula should give you the idea about your own interest and career path you want to seek. (But by all means, you can continue to learn on your own while following the curriculum.)  By the time you graduate, you will be in a better position to decide which is the sub-field you are most interested in, whether you want to pursue graduate study & research or whether you want to join some other profession. And by then, you should acquire the skill to do independent studies from your references. Other people (your professors or quora posters) can hold your hand only until you learn to walk. They cannot run with you. ",

            "answer_text": "Your motivation and passion for your subject is commendable. Infact, you are halfway there. Now you need to focus on particular topics. At first, you will feel that everything is discrete nothing is connected but once you can use all the tools of mathematics together you will be enlighted. I will suggest you one book from one of  the best authors. His way of teaching is exactly what you need since you love math. You are not doing it for the sake of grades. This book will help you get real sense of math not just formula. He explains math with actual physical meaning. Also, Like mentioned by Swagato Barman Roy, math is huge. You will have to focus on few topics you love. But dont worry that will come to you automatically.
