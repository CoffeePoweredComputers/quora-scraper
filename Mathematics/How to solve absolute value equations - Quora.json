            "answer_text": "For an equation , remove the modulus function and replace with . Then check all of your solutions in the original equation. Half of them shouldn\u2019t work as they\u2019re outside the range of the function (but are solutions when you pretend they\u2019re two separate functions). Keep the ones that still work. A graph will likely help. ",
