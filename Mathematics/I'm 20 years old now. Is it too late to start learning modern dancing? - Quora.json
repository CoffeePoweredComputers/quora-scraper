            "answer_text": "If you mean Modern Dance in the sense of Martha Graham, Paul Taylor, Mark Morris, it might not be, depending on other factors such as your level of fitness and any background in martial arts or gymnastics or the like. Modern dance is often taught in colleges and there isn' t as much urgency to get somewhere and audition the way there is with ballet or Broadway dance. But you may have some catching up to do. ",

            "answer_text": "NO!! Depending on you any age is a good age to learn dancing. Weather it\u2019s modern dancing or not. My parents were in their 70\u2019s and were dancing. my parent started me dancing when I was 8 or 9. I would practice at home dancing with my Mother, my sister, even with a pillow. I\u2019m in my 80\u2019s now. Don\u2019t really care for the modern music or style of dancing. I liked the old fashion way wear you held onto each other and danced cheek to cheek and gave your partner a \u201csmooch\u201d on her ear or her neck\u2014\u2014maybe even a \u201cbelly\u201d rub or two!!
