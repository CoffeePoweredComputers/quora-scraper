Now suppose there is another measure \u03bd\u03bd on (\u03a9,F)\u03a9,F) such that \u03bc\u226a\u03bd\u03bc\u226a\u03bd and a probability distribution qq such that q\u226a\u03bdq\u226a\u03bd. Then, it is not guaranteed that q(A)=a.s.\u03bd1q(A)=a.s.\u03bd1 So, the condition that an event \u201chappens\u201d is dependent on the underlying probability measure of the probability space in which the event is being framed. This is akin to an \u201calternate reality measure\u201d and this is how measure spaces can play havoc with geometry ala Banach-Tarski type theorems (paradoxes) and the existence of sets of measure 00 via the AC.

A good example. The probability of flipping nothing but heads when you flip a coin N times is (1/2)^N. If you look at this the larger N is the closer to 0 it gets. In the infinite limit the probability becomes 0. However it's not truly impossible to get an infinite sequence of nothing but head flips. It still exists and still is possible, just infinitely unlikely. It's more a consequence of the fact that probability when you are dealing with infinite possibilities doesn't act like probability when you have only a finite number of outcomes. ",
