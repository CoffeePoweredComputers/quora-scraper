            "answer_text": "Please refer Anirban Ghoshal response for the answer. For a very related question - why not the answer is [math]\\binom{5}{2}*\\binom{10}{2}?[/math] For this, you can read below. Let us take [math]r_1, r_2, r_3, r_4[/math] and [math]r_5[/math] as 5 red balls. Let us see if we can split the problem into two steps Selecting [math]2[/math] red balls from [math]5[/math] red balls.Selecting [math]2[/math] more balls from the remaining [math]10[/math] balls.If the above steps considered are independent of each other, then number of ways of doing them are respectively [math]\\binom{5}{2}[/math] & [math]\\binom{10}{2}[/math]. Let us consider the tasks as below. Task 1 : Select [math]r_1[/math] & [math] r_2[/math] in step 1; [math]r_3[/math] & [math] r_4 [/math]in step 2Task 2: Select [math]r_3[/math] & [math] r_4[/math] in step 1; [math]r_1[/math] & [math] r_2 [/math]in step 2Since the problem is about number of ways to select, the above two tasks are one and the same. But multiplying [math]\\binom{5}{2}[/math] and [math]\\binom{10}{2}[/math] treats these two tasks as different. Hence, one can not use [math]\\binom{5}{2}*\\binom{10}{2}[/math] to get the required number of ways. If one is interested in splitting the task into two steps mentioned above, one can follow the steps as follows. # of ways to select 2 red balls = [math]\\binom{5}{2}\\binom{7}{2}= 210[/math]# of ways to select 3 red balls = [math]\\dfrac{\\binom{5}{2}\\binom{3}{1}\\binom{7}{1}}{\\binom{3}{2}}= 70[/math]# of ways to select 4 red balls = [math]\\dfrac{\\binom{5}{2}\\binom{3}{2}}{\\binom{4}{2}}= 5[/math]The terms in the denominator is to get the number of distinct ways and to avoid the duplication of types shown in the above example ([math]r_1, r_2,r_3,r_4)[/math] Total number of required ways = 210+70+5=285 ",

            "answer_text": "You decline to mention whether balls of the same color are identical. If they are, then you have only [math]9[/math] ways to do so. Why? Two positions are dedicated to red. For the remaining two, you can have red, blue or white (all are sufficiently numerous to allow that) and so that's [math]3 \\times 3 = 9[/math] ways. If, on the other hand balls of the same color are non-identical, then you can select four balls of any color is [math]\\displaystyle \\binom{5 + 4 + 3}{4} = 495[/math] ways. No red ball is selected in [math]\\displaystyle \\binom{4 + 3}{4} = 35[/math] ways. Exactly one red ball is selected in [math]\\displaystyle 5 \\times \\binom{4 + 3}{3} = 175[/math] ways. Thus, you select at least two red balls in [math]495 - (35 + 175) = 285[/math] ways. ",
