            "answer_text": "For a number to be a multiple of 8, it has to be 8 times an integer. First I will check the boundary conditions. 100/8 is 12.5 which is not an integer. The next integer is 13, so the first required multiple is 8*13. 500/8 is 62.5 which is not an integer. The last integer was 62, so the last required multiple is 8*62. We could have any integer from 13 to 62 for us to have a multiple in the required interval. How many integers are there from 13 to 62? To count them we subtract, but then we have to add one to include the number 13. For example if we were counting the integers from 13 to 17, 17\u201313=4, but if we count manually we get 13, 14, 15, 16, 17 which is 5 numbers. If we count the integers from 13 to 14, 14\u201313=1, but if we count manually we have 13, 14 which is 2 numbers. Hopefully you can see why we add 1 now. Therefore, for this problem we get 62\u201313+1=50 ",
