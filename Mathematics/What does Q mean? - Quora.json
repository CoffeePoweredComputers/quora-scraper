            "answer_text": "The diagram appears to show two positively charged pendulums being held separate by electrostatic force. Start by determining what all the forces on the pendulum are. In particular you need to find the horizontal component of the force of tension applied by the string, because this horizontal component is what must be balanced by the electrostatic force [math]F_{e}[/math]. Next, calculate the distance [math]r[/math] between the two pendulums. Once you know those two quantities, you can use Coulomb\u2019s Law to determine what the charge [math]Q[/math] must be. ",
