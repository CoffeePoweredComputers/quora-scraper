            "answer_text": "This might be lengthy answer...please be patient  Application Areas of CombinatoricsCommunication networks, cryptography and network securityPermutations are frequently used in communication networks and parallel and distributed systems . Routing different permutations on a network for performance evaluation is a common problem in these fields. Many communication networks require secure transfer of information, which drives development in cryptography and network security . This area has recently become particularly significant because of the increased use of internet information transfers. Associated problems include protecting the privacy of transactions and other confidential data transfers and preserving the network security from attacks by viruses and hackers. Encryption process involves manipulations of sequences of codes such as digits, characters, and words. Hence, they are closely related to combinatorics, possibly with intelligent encryption process. For example, one common type of encryption process is interchanging--i.e., permuting parts of a sequence . Permutations of fast Fourier transforms are employed in speech encryption Computer architectureDesign of computer chips involves consideration of possible permutations of input to output pins. Field-programmable interconnection chips provide user programmable interconnection for a desired permutation . Arrangement of logic gates is a basic element for computer architecture design  Computational molecular biologyThis field involves many types of combinatorial and sequencing problems such as atoms, molecules, DNAs, genes, and proteins  One-dimensional sequencing problems are essentially permutation problems under certain constraints.LanguagesBoth natural and computer languages are closely related to combinatorics . This is because the components of these languages, such as sentences, paragraphs, programs, and blocks, are arrangements of smaller elements, such as words, characters, and atoms. For example, a string searching algorithm may rely on combinatorics of words and characters. Direct applications of this can include word processing and databases. Another important application area is performance analysis of these string searching algorithms. The study of computability--what we can compute and how it is accomplished--draws heavily on combinatorics.Pattern analysisIn a broad sense, all the above-mentioned areas can be viewed as special cases of pattern analysis. Molecular biology, for example, studies patterns of atoms, molecules, and DNAs whereas languages treat patterns of sentences, words, and strings. Patterns can have many other forms; for example, visual images, acoustic signals, and other physical quantities such as electrical, pressure, temperature, etc., that appear in engineering problems. Patterns can also be abstract without any associated physical meaning. These patterns may be represented in various ways such as digital, analog, and other units. Some of these types of patterns can be associated with combinatorics. There has been extensive research on combinatorial pattern matching (Combinatorial, 1992-2005). Computer music can be a specialized application domain of combinatorics of acoustic signals.Scientific discoveryFor certain types of knowledge discovery problems, generation of combinatorial sequences may become necessary in the process of yielding candidate solutions. For example, in scientific discovery, we may want to have a sequence of plausible chemical/biological reactions and their formations . In each step of the sequence, we may generate combinatorial sequences of chemical/biological radicals, bases, and molecular compounds as candidate solutions and may select the most likely ones under certain rules and constraints. In another example, certain areas of mathematics, such as graph theory and number theory, may generate combinatorial sequences as candidate solutions. Databases and data miningQueries in databases are multiple join operations that are permutations of the constituent join operations. Determining an optimal permutation that gives minimum cost is a common and important problem . Data mining or knowledge discovery in databases is a relatively new field that aims at distilling useful information, often from large databases. In this area, techniques employing symbolic AI can manipulate combinatorial sequences of atoms or information elements. Non-symbolic knowledge discovery techniques, such as genetic algorithms and genetic programming, most commonly deal with solutions in the form of sequences of bits, digits, characters, and sometimes Lisp program elements. Neural networks, another domain of non-symbolic AI, sometimes deal with combinatorial patterns. Knowledge discovery techniques under uncertainty, such as Bayesian networks, Dempster-Shafer theory, fuzzy logic, and rough set theory, may have combinatorial solutions  Operations researchMany optimization problems in operations research (OR) involve combinatorics. The job scheduling problem is essentially a sequencing problem to determine the order of jobs to be processed in an effort to minimize the total time, cost, etc. Here, jobs can be in a computer system, network, or processing plant. Many problems involving graphs or networks also deal with the order of vertices and edges. The traveling salesperson problem is to determine the order of cities to be visited to minimize the total distance . The shortest path problem of a graph is to determine a sequence of edges, the total length of which is minimum. Oftentimes, these problems are computationally difficult--e.g., NP-complete or NP-hard--and, therefore, require extensive research.SimulationPermutations and combinations can be employed for simulations in many areas. Permutations representing various genotype-phenotype associations are employed in genetics simulations (Doerge and Churchill, 1996). Other areas that employ permutations and combinations for simulations include networks, cryptography, databases and OR.Homeland securityThis is a very specialized problem domain that has become a major national challenge after 9/11. To confront this challenge, many intelligent computing techniques have been applied, including intelligent pattern analyses of human faces, X-ray images, chemical components, data from a distributed network of wireless sensors, etc. Natural language processing and data mining techniques have been applied to sift through and monitor the tremendous Accumulation of electronic communication data. Since combinatorics are extensively applied to these intelligent computing techniques, there is a wide spectrum of potentials for the national security issue. Some specific examples may include string searching algorithms and their performance analysis in communication data, pre- and post-analysis of combinatorial sequences of information elements, and combinatorial pattern matching.Credits : Application Areas of Combinatorics, Especially Permutations and Combinations ,Toshinori Munakata(2005) ",

            "answer_text": "Here are a couple of examples. First, anyone reading this should know that a permutation refers to an arrangement (i.e. order matters), and a combination refers to choosing a group of items (i.e. order doesn't matter). 1) You are a judge in a cat beauty contest. There are 50 cats, and you must pick the prettiest, the 2nd prettiest, and the 3rd prettiest. (Our sweet cat, Persia, is not available, because it wouldn't be fair). In how many ways can you do this?  ANSWER: Note that order matters here, so this is a permutation problem. There are [math]50[/math] ways to pick the prettiest cat, [math]49[/math] ways to pick the 2nd prettiest, and [math]48[/math] ways to pick the 3rd prettiest. So there are [math]50*49*48[/math] ways of picking these cats. In general, the number of ways to permute (arrange) r items from a set of n items is [math]\\frac{n!}{(n-r)!}[/math]. 2) You want to buy 3 cats from a pet store that has 50 cats. In how many ways can you do this?  ANSWER: Note that order doesn't matter here, so this is a combination problem. (Mathematically, we are asking for how many subsets of size [math]3[/math] there are from a set of size [math]50[/math]).  One way to answer this is to think of it first as if order does matter. You'd likely do this anyway by picking your 1st cat, your 2nd cat and your 3rd cat. Then you'd get the same answer as above: [math]50*49*48[/math]. But you could have chosen these cats in any order. So you must divide this result by the number of ways these [math]3[/math] cats can ordered. And that is [math]3*2*1[/math]. So your final answer is [math]\\frac{50*49*48}{3*2*1}[/math]. In general, the number of ways to choose [math]r[/math] items from a set of [math]n[/math] items is [math]\\frac{n!}{(n-r)!r!}[/math]. This is called a binomial coefficient and is usually written as [math]\\binom{n}{r}[/math].  ",
