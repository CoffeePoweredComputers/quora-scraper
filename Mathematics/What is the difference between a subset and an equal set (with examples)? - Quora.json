And B is super set of A But they are not equal two sets are said to be equal if all the elements in A are in B and all the elements in B are in A For example A={1,2,3,4,5} B={1,2,3,4,5} then both the sets are said to be equal ",

For example, the set of natural numbers is a subset of set of whole numbers which is a subset of integers. ",
