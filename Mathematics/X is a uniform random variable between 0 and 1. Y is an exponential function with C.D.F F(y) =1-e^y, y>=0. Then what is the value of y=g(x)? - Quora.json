            "answer_text": "If  is a uniform random variable between  and , and  is a random variable that is distributed exponential with parameter , then it is not necessary that  can be written as  for some . For example: when  and  are independent, then there is no relationship between  and . However, if we change the question to: Given a random variable  with uniform distribution over the interval , can we find a function  such that  is exponential random variable with rate parameter ? Answer to this question is yes. In fact there are many such functions. Let me present two of them. (1) Consider the function . Distribution of  is exponential with parameter . Proof: CDF of   at  is:  (2) Consider another function . Distribution of  is exponential with parameter . Proof: CDF of   at  is:  As an exercise, check that the function  will also work. Hint: First show that  is uniform over  when  is uniform over , and then the result will follow from (2). ",
