            "answer_text": "Doron Greenspan \u200f@DoronGreenspan: Whats the best way to become smarter? ANSWER: The best way to become smarter is to become stupid. Like, really really stupid. First off, almost everything you learned in school was either insufficient or a lie. And it was also just facts. So being smarter involves starting today with a blank slate. Everything you\u2019ve learned in the past is either incorrect or a lie designed to manipulate you. Think of all of your commonly held beliefs, for instance. Every one of them. Assume they are all wrong. Now start from scratch. This applies even to basic words and vocabulary. Believe it or not, the more words you know, the more stupid you might be. For instance, take a candle. What if you forget the word \u201ccandle\u201d. So now you\u2019re confused. You see some wax and a string. A study was done: you\u2019re given a match and a candle and two metal rings. You\u2019re told to make the metal rings into a figure eight. The people who were told they have a \u201ccandle\u201d solved the problem about 50% less than the people who were told they have \u201cwax\u201d with a \u201cstring\u201d at the top. How come? Because the people who were told \u201cstring\u201d tied the rings together. The people who were told \u201ccandle\u201d tried to use the match to melt the candle enough to cement the rings together but the rings wouldn\u2019t hold together. What a stupid thing to do despite their bigger vocabulary! Take everything you see \u2013 try to rename it into it\u2019s components. Unlearn the macro words. Take every emotion you feel and do the same. Take all your relationships and do the same. What does that mean? It means if you are angry at someone, look at the situation from their shoes and really accept their anger. What does this have to do with being smart? It means your mind gets less clogged by your anger, which is nothing but shit stuck in the pipes. Eventually a plumber has to come in there and clean things up or the water won\u2019t flow. All of your resentments, jealousies, anxieties clog the pipes and make you less smart. Accept the anxieties. They are part of life. But say hello to them and let them move on. If you can. Practice that. And then  go outside and look around. Don\u2019t name anything. Don\u2019t name the sunrise, the people, the mountains, the fresh air, the flowers. Those are just words you were taught. That was all part of the brainwashing. Take a deep breath. Enjoy. Note: I answer this and similar questions in http://www.jamesaltucher.com/category/askjames/ ",

            "answer_text": "You might be under the impression that intelligence is a fixed quantity set when you are young and unchanging thereafter. But research shows that you're wrong. How we approach situation and the things we do to feed our brains can significantly improve our mental horsepower,getting smarter doesn't necessarily mean a huge commitment of time and energy. So, here are some steps which you can follow to became intelligent. Dedicate yourself to became a lifelong learner-The process is not as simple as just learning some new vocabulary words, though. It takes time and effort to learn how to engage more deeply and critically with the world around you.Follow your passions-People learn most effectively when they are passionate about their subject matter. If you are passionate about something, you are bound to want to understand it more deeply; it is this kind of focused, sustained investigation that leads to increased intellect. True intelligence involves deep mastery of a few subjects, rather than a shallow understanding of a broad range of them.Was Albert Einstein equally gifted in physics, anthropology, linguistics, geology, animal behavior, and literary criticism? Of course not.Challenge yourself-If you\u2019re not struggling, you\u2019re not pushing yourself. Learning shouldn\u2019t be torture. It should be rewarding, though, and it probably won\u2019t be if it doesn\u2019t require much effort. Push yourself to master new ideas and enter unfamiliar intellectual territory.Think about how you think-This is called \u201cmetacognition,\u201d and it is something intelligent people excel at. Metacognition allows you to understand how you learn, and to apply those strategies from one context to another.Learn a language-This will force your brain to negotiate new ways of constructing meaning, and increase your intuitive and conscious understanding of language systems. Thinking more about language also has the added benefit of improving your facility with your first language, and learning all those new words will help improve your memory.Read the news- While keeping up with current events may not exactly increase your intellectual capacity, a truly intelligent, curious person should want to engage with the world she lives in. Having new ideas often involves building on existing ones, so it is always wise to understand as much as you can about the problems the world faces, and the ways people are trying to solve them. Remember, all news sources have a bias of some sort; make sure you get your news from a variety of sources, and never accept something as absolute truth just because it is in the newspaper.Rely less on technology- The ease with which we can obtain information today makes our lives much more convenient, but it can also make us stupider. The neural pathways involved in reading maps, for example, are probably much weaker in Millennials\u2019 brains than in the brains of their parents. This is because most Millennials rely heavily on GPS navigation to help them find their way, while older generations had to get out an atlas if they got lost. In the same vein, if they can\u2019t remember what a word means, many people are more likely to quickly Google it than they are to sit down and focus on trying to remember. Instead of strengthening their ability to recall information, they can effortlessly obtain the information with almost no thought. Try to rely on your phone less, and your brain more.Write down what you learn-It doesn't have to be pretty or long, but taking a few minutes each day to reflect in writing about what you learned is sure to boost your brainpower. \"Write 400 words a day on things that you learned,\" suggests yoga teacher Claudia Azula Altucher. Mike Xie, a research associate at Bayside Biosciences, agrees: \"Write about what you've learned.\"Get out the Scrabble board-Board games and puzzles aren't just fun but also a great way to work out your brain. \"Play games (Scrabble, bridge, chess, Go, Battleship, Connect 4, doesn't matter),\" suggests Xie (for a ninja-level brain boost, exercise your working memory by trying to play without looking at the board). \"Play Scrabble with no help from hints or books.Explain it to others-\"If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough,\" Albert Einstein said. Make sure you've really learned what you think you have learned and that the information is truly stuck in your memory by trying to teach it to others. \"Make sure you can explain it to someone else.",
