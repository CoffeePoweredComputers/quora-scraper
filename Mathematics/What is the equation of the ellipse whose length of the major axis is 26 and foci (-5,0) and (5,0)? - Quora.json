            "answer_text": "The general equation of an ellipse is given by [(x-xo)/a]^2 + [(y - yo)/b]^2 = 1 where (xo , yo) is the center of elipse and a and b are the axes of the ellipse along x- and y- directions. Substituting the given numeric values you get the equation as (x/13)^2 + (y/12)^2 = 1 ",
