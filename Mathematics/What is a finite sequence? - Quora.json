            "answer_text": "A finite sequence is a sequence of numbers that is a fixed length long. For example, {1, 3, 2, 5, 0} is a finite sequence because it has five items. The sequence {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, \u2026} is an infinite sequence because it keeps going, and going, and going, forever. The sequence {red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, violet} is a finite sequence because there are exactly seven items. The first names of the children in your family could be turned into a finite sequence. My parents\u2019 name sequence was {john, david, paula}. What other finite sequences can you come up with? Presidents of the USA: {Washington, Adams, \u2026, Bush, Obama, Trump}Kings and Queens of the UK: {\u2026, Elizabeth II}Hurricanes in 2017: {???}",

            "answer_text": "A finite sequence is an order of numbers that has a beginning and end. An example would be this: {10,9,8,7,6,5,4,3,2,1} This is the sequence of all natural numbers, \u2115 (starting from 10) going down. This number has a beginning which is 10, and an end which is 1. Here\u2019s an example of an infinite sequence: {1,10,100,1000,10000, \u2026} This sequence DOES have a beginning (1), but it has no end as these numbers approach infinity as the sequence continues. This is an infinite sequence and there is no end value like the first one I listed above. ",

            "answer_text": "In mathematics, a sequence is usually meant to be a progression of numbers with a clear starting point. Some sequences also stop at a certain number. In other words, they have a first term and a last term, and all the terms follow a specific order. This type ofsequence is called a finite sequence. ",
