            "answer_text": "You don\u2019t specify the HV voltage, so your question is incomplete. Lets go with 11 kV which is a common distribution voltage in English countries. A Three Phase 100 kVA transformer will draw 5.25 Amps at full load over the three phases. These TX\u2019s are normally fused at 8 Amps (drop out fuses) or 10 Amps (HRC) at the primary side to allow for some overload. ",
