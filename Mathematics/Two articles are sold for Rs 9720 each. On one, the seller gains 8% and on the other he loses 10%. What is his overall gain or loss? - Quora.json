            "answer_text": "When percentage is asked we can just start playing with any number. 9720 is not required. I will take CP1 as 100 so SP1 should be 108. SP1 and SP2 are given equal, so CP2 should be 120. Total CP = CP1 + CP2 => 220, and total SP = SP1 + SP2 => 108 + 108 that is 216. So there is loss of 4 on 220 that is loss of 1.818% Let me know Thanks ",

            "answer_text": "Let, cost prices of these articles be m rupees and n rupees respectively. So, 1.08 * m = 9720 and 0.90 * n = 9720 So, m = 9000 and n = 10800. So, total cost price of these two articles = 19800 rupees. And, total sell price of these two articles = 19440 rupees. So, overall loss = (19800 - 19440) rupees = 360 rupees. Overall percentage loss = (360 / 19800) * 100% \u2248 1.82%. ",
