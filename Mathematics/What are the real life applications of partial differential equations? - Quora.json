            "answer_text": "Plenty. Fluid mechanics, heat and mass transfer, and electromagnetic theory are all modeled by partial differential equations and all have plenty of real life applications. For example, Fluid mechanics is used to understand how the circulatory system works, how to get rockets and planes to fly, and even to some extent how the weather behaves.Heat and mass transfer is used to understand how drug delivery devices work, how kidney dialysis works, and how to control heat for temperatute-sensitive things. It probably also explains why thermoses work!Electromagnetism is used for all electricity out there, and everything that involves light at all, from X rays to pulse oximetry and laser pointers.You can certainly weakly understand these things to an extent without partial differential equations(PDEs), but understanding the partial differential equations allows a much better understanding and much broader applications (since the PDEs generalize the concepts across time and space more than the non-PDE simplifications). And that is probably very far off from a comprehensive list of applications. ",

            "answer_text": "Another person responded to you that partial differential equations and calculus are not used in real life. This is ABSOLUTELY FALSE!! Perhaps they are confusing \u201creal life applications\u201d with \u201cused by laypeople on a daily basis.\u201d These aren\u2019t the same. I tell the students I work with that it is a shame that more people don\u2019t get exposed to calculus, because that is where you finally get to see how math can be used to study and understand things in the real world. Nearly every real world system is a system under change, and calculus is the mathematics of change. If these concepts were not used, nobody would study them. Scientists and engineers would not be REQUIRED to have some familiarity with these concepts. Physics, chemistry, biology, economics, the engineering disciplines, architecture, weather modeling, search engines\u2026all of these require an understanding of calculus principles. This is not meant to be an exhaustive list. You need to understand that without calculus, your life would be very different. Many of the things which you take for granted likely would not be possible, because people wouldn\u2019t have the right language to describe the underlying systems in a way that would enable manipulation and prediction. Now, could you get by in life without understanding this level of mathematics? Of course. But you would likely end up being just a consumer of technology rather than a contributor to technological advance. And that is fine, but there is a price to pay for that. Many people feel left out with skills which can not be applied anywhere anymore because technology has outpaced them. This is only going to get worse as time goes on. For young people, not trying to keep abreast of technological advances, and the mathematics that underpin them, is going to cause those people to be left out even sooner. ",
