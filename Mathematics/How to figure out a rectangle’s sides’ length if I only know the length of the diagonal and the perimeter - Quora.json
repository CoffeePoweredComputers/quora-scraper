            "answer_text": "Hi!!! Let us assume that there is a rectangle having a diagonal as 5 cm and perimeter as 14 cm (This is just an example. However, this framework can be used for solving such type of questions)  Perimeter = 2(x+y)=142(x+y)=14 x+y=7x+y=7 \u2014(i) Squaring both sides, x2+y2+2xy=49x2+y2+2xy=49\u2014(ii) Also, by Pythagoras theorem, x2+y2=25x2+y2=25 \u2014(iii) Substituting eq (iii) in eq (ii) 2xy=49\u221225=242xy=49\u221225=24 xy=12xy=12\u2014(iv) x+7/x=12sincey=7/xfromequation(iv)x+7/x=12sincey=7/xfromequation(iv) Thus, x2+7=12xx2+7=12x x2\u221212x+7=0x2\u221212x+7=0 Solving this equation we get x=4 or x=3 When x=4, y =3 Also, when x=3, y=4 So, the sides of the rectangle are 4cm,3cm or 3cm,4cm. Pls upvote!! Cheers!!! ",

Then 5*2 = X*2+(7-X)*2. Then solve the quadratic equation. In this case X is 3cm so the sides are 3and 4cm long ",
