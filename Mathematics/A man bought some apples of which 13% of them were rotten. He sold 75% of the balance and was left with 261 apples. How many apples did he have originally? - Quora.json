He sold 75% of the balance and was left with 261 apples Let us consider that this man bought x apple. 13% of x apple were rotten. It means 13/100 x apple were written , which is 0.13x. Balance apples = x - 0.13x = 0.87x He sold 75% of 0.87x apples, thus he was left with 0.25 of 0 87x unsold apples, which are equal to 261 apple. Accordingly 0.25 \u00d7 0.87x = 261 0.2175x = 261 x = 261/0.2175 x = 2610000/2175 x = 1200 apples. This this person bought 1200 apples originally Answer this person bought 1200 apples originally ",

            "answer_text": "1200. Assume X apples as the total number. Subtract the 13% from this number, leaving 0.87X apples as the balance. He sold 75% of this, so he should be left with 25% of the balance which equals 261. 0.25*(0.87X) = 261 By solving the above, you would have found the X you were looking for. ",
