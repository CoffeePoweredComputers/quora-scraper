            "answer_text": "It's never too late if you are keen, the biggest blockers are probably: Can you commit to studying? Are you passionate enough? As we get older, committing to study gets harder, but when people dive in they can succeed.Do you have the time? Can you make the time? Work commitments, social commitments, family? All these things can eat into your ability to study, but if you make time, it can happen.Money, can you support yourself or can someone support you while you study?There are many courses out there that accept mature students and you aren't even that old, I had students that were older than me when I was a lecturer, it's not uncommon now for people to decide that they want to study in their later years. It's more uncommon in your late 20s or early 30s because people are usually doing other things, but when people settle they sometimes come back to study. Pick a course you think you could do, make the time and then dive in. If you have work and other commitments you might start with online or remote study courses. There are services like Udemy which provide a rich range of courses you can study at your own pace, or more formal education like the Open University. The main barrier to your success is you, how will you get yourself in order? Overcome that and you can succeed. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes people that are good with math are young prodigies that are experts by the time they are five you just realizing that you like math is weak you will not be able to compete with child prodigy\u2019s who are wizards you should use your newfound passion for math by studying to become an engineer or some other profession that utilizes math basic math because a 20-year-old realizing that they like math unless you\u2019re a genius like Albert Einstein you will have no chance of competing with someone who is realized that they like the math when they were three years old ",
