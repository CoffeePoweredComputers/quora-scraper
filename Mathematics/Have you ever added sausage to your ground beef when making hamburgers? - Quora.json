            "answer_text": "Yes, though with turkey instead of beef. When my wife and I regularly cooked beef for hamburgers at home, we often did mix the ground beef with pork breakfast sausage, too. I always do the similar mixing when we make hamburger patties at home. As both my wife and I have lipid problems, we use ground turkey in making hamburgers ( yes, turkey burgers, with no Hamburg steaks, I know) at home. So we also use turkey breakfast sausage in the ground meat patties we make. By experimenting, we found a satisfactory mix, of 3 pounds ground turkey and 2 pounds turkey breakfast sausage, which works well and to our taste. I mix these, and then make 4 ounce patties from the combined meat, wrap each in plastic wrap and into the freezer. Works fine. ",

            "answer_text": "No. A myriad of other things. Bacon grease is a great flavor enhancer. Onion, but not too much. It really depends if your grilling or on a flattop or in a pan. You can\u2019t blend in cheese if you\u2019re on a grill, you\u2019ll have a sticky mess. Try the bacon grease (a little) instead of sausage. ",
