            "answer_text": "Let's say you found a way to factor a 2048-bit number that is the product of two 1024-bit primes, in an hour. Keep in mind that this would be an incredible breakthrough, and is almost certainly not going to happen. But that\u2019s not related to the question. So what should you do, presuming you are an American citizen? Talk to a good attorney and have him find an attorney or group of attorneys that would approach the National Security Agency (NSA) for you. Your attorneys tell the NSA what you're able to do. They also say that you are a patriot and would not think about selling your algorithm to a foreign country. The NSA guys laugh and say oh yeah sure. So your attorneys ask them to give you a 2048-bit number for you to factor. They bring it back to you and you factor it and they go back to the NSA the next day and show them the factors. The NSA guys will pass out for 10 to 15 minutes. (Be sure to catch them so they don\u2019t hurt themselves). Once they are awake, the NSA says, \u201cWe\u2019d really, really, really like this algorithm, and we really, really, really want it to be a secret until we\u2019ve modified our encryption algorithms.\u201d Your attorneys say they completely understand. And for 100 million dollars their client would give you the algorithm and promise to keep it a secret until the NSA decides to reveal it. There might be some negotiation there, but you will end up a millionaire and remain a patriot at the same time. The bottom line is that you will be rich and the NSA will be very happy with you. Whatever movies you\u2019ve seen, the US governmental does not send out black ops operatives to kill Americans with certain kinds of knowledge, unless they are traitors. (Even then, you are most likely to be arrested by the FBI if you are in the United States). Our operatives do kill. But they only kill those who have harmed the United States, or are threatening to do so.  Here\u2019s a story related to this question. Most mathematicians consider John von Neumann to be the best mathematician of the 20th century, and one of the best of all time. Among many, many areas, Von Neumann worked on both the development of the atomic bomb, and the hydrogen bomb. If he were a traitor to the United States, it would have been a disaster. (He was born in Hungary, but became an American citizen). Sadly, he died of cancer in 1957, at the age of 53. Before he died he was in the hospital for a few days or weeks. He was also given medications that would reduce his pain possibly resulting in him saying very classified information without realizing it. Therefore, his hospital room had a military guard detail, that was with him 24/7 until he died. Of course, if he started saying classified stuff, they would have cleared the room of any visitors. (This never happened). As a result of his many contributions to the US Dept. of War, he posthumously received the Presidential Medal of Freedom by President Eisenhower in 1956. ",
