            "answer_text": "A variable x following a Poisson Distribution with parameter \u03bc, is a discrete variable and assumes integer values on the +ve  axis of X. It represents \" rare\" events or occurrences and the probability p(x<=k ) is given by the summation,Being discrete variable , it is the summation and not an integral. That , probability is given by \u03a3p(x), where you already have probability expression. With a known, \u03bc or the best unbiased estimate of it. Where the limits on the summation is from x=0,1,2,3,4 .....k. For a large n, that is as n tends to infinity, the Poisson distribution tends to a Normal distribution. Which, by the way also involves an exponential function. You can look up the proof in any text book on Mathematical Statistics. In such a case, the probability can be approximated by the Normal, specifically from the probability tables of the Standard Normal Variate. ",
