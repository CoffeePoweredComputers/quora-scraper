            "answer_text": "I believe an engineering degree, especially in electrical engineering is more valuable than pure computer science degree. I graduated with a BSEE back in the early 90s and will say that almost every electrical engineer I know is involved in some sort of software job. I have worked in a couple of industries, factory automation and telecom. The factory automation job was an interesting mix of electrical / mechanical engineering, project management, and software development. I left because of all the travel. I was on road 80\u201390 days a year. Now, in telecom I started out in engineering where I was responsible for telecom equipment design and installation. After a couple years, I took another job at same company supporting IT systems behind E911. So, I understand computer science might provide a little more background in algorithm design, but at least electrical engineers can design systems AND program them. Flexibility is a good thing in my book. Especially with all the IOT stuff coming on board in the near future. That will largely be a mix of pure engineering and software development. Now I will say, there are some really complex algorithms being used to catch and prevent cyber crime, stop spam, figure out consumer behavior, etc. The computer science major might be a little better prepared for those complexities right out of school.

            "answer_text": "Logically and commanding job wise, a CS degree would be recommended. CS is the most commanding job system in the engineering community and the pay is quite amazing, even for a fresh CS graduate. The great this is, you don\u2019t even really need all of your degrees to still become accpected for a job, even first year degrees are hired. Since you\u2019re learning programming languages like java, python , Ruby, and so on it makes your career choice even more popular and powerfu. Also, the Commanding requests are so high that it\u2019ll nearly last for 5years straight! So if you ever do major in CS you\u2019ll definitely have an increased chance at finding a job quicker than usual. But I also recommen that you choose both, since they are each very useful! ",
