            "answer_text": "The answer depends on the pentagon and on the vertex in that pentagon. As long as you were not mentioning precisely what kind of pentagon you were talking about, we do not have sufficient information to answer that question. The other colleagues answering your question took it for granted that you asked your question about a regular pentagon, but without mentioning that explicitly, any number above 0 degrees (in the case of non-convex pentagon) and below 360 degrees at a single vertex of the pentagon, is possible , is possible.
