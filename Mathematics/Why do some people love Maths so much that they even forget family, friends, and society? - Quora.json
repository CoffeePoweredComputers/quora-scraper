            "answer_text": "I love Math. However, majority of the students whether in elementary, high school or college don\u2019t have the same feeling as mine. A great number of students nowadays consider this subject as the most difficult one for no good reasons. Unlike other disciplines, Mathematics requires a different level of thinking and this the reason why many students hate it. However, they do not know that taking the challenge to love Math brings you to a higher level of learning. It has offered a lot of benefits. In this post, we will explore 3 good reasons why do I love Math and why you should love it too. Reason # 1: Math enables you to become a problem solver in this world plagued with problems. Problems are everywhere \u2013 at home, work, school, relationships, finances, and all around us we always encountered problems in life. And what does it entail? This means that we need to be a problem solver. But before we can solve these problems, we need to understand them so we can weigh the consequences and come up with for its best solution. We need to prioritize things, order them from least to greatest and focus on the greatest need and solve it first rather than focusing on others that are not so important. Now, is there something that Math can do for this? Direcly, nothing. But indirectly, it does. The mathematical problems we always encountered at the classroom, the exercises and the assignments that our teacher has given \u2013 these are all directed to exercise our mental powers, preparing it for bigger and more challenging problems in real life. Reason # 2: Math is really fun. Now think about your language class where you memorize all the rules for the subject and verb agreement in sentences. Or maybe in a literature class where you analyze Shakespearean plays, noting its every details and even performing it as well. And think about a Math class where you are dealing where you are given problems in real life like buying and selling. Which has more fun? Undeniably, Math classes has more fun compared to any other classes in school. I remember the song my Grade 3 teacher taught us. And my teacher is right. Mathematics is really fun to be with and it can make us wise. The problem is just our mind set. Change your mind set and it will change the way you react. It is not difficult to love it because its ideas are useful and fun to be with. Reason # 3: Mathematics is life. Maybe you may wonder why I said this statement. But try to think of the things you\u2019ve always done everyday. Though we are not using formulas and we are not using variables like x and y, but we always face situations like we need to make decisions, analyze and weigh things regarding its relevance. All of these things are related to Mathematics. So how could you say that you don\u2019t love Math? Mathematics is life, so how could you say you hate it? If you don\u2019t love math, it\u2019s tantamount that you don\u2019t love life itself. ",

            "answer_text": "Let's solve a riddle first. You can see me in water, but I never get wet. What am I? To solve this you need to think. But the domain over which you think should be under the range of thought of what the person who gave the question is. Like, there is this substance called Novec1230 which literally don't get wet. But you need to be conventional to get the typical answer which is reflection. This isn't just for riddles. It happens in most of the things we see every day. An engineer is restricted by several factors ranging from least count of instruments he use to budget he will be alloted.A doctor can never conform a particular disease/illness for sure. They just relate the symptoms to closest form of illness they remember.Now, the list will go on and there are many people out there who doesn't like to think to fit into the closest thing they can imagine. So, is there anything we can do, that is so perfect that, you can play with it with a gift we have called logic and it still remains unaltered ?Luckily we have one and we call it mathematics. You can think in every possible way you can but still you get the same conclusion as everything in it is absolute truth. Another important thing is you need completely minimal knowledge to solve things as you can derive or make your own things at any point of time. Above plays key role in making people interested in mathematics. But what makes it addictive is it's aesthetic nature. So, yeah math isn't just a subject but it is also like a form of art, So I wouldn't hesitate to call mathematicians as artists. We literally get mental orgasms doing math. Here's a quote from bertnard Russel. \u201cMathematics, rightly viewed, possesses not only truth, but supreme beauty \u2014 a beauty cold and austere, like that of sculpture, without appeal to any part of our weaker nature, without the gorgeous trappings of painting or music, yet sublimely pure, and capable of a stern perfection such as only the greatest art can show. The true spirit of delight, the exaltation, the sense of being more than Man, which is the touchstone of the highest excellence, is to be found in mathematics as surely as poetry.\u201d You need not have a PhD to be a mathematician. Every one who loves math is one. Just the way every one who loves to paint is an artist and the absoluteness and aesthetic nature of it is the thing which drives us! ",
