            "answer_text": "By way of comparison, the M.S. in Finance requires at least 10 courses in finance, while the MBA in Finance usually permits a max. of 5 courses in finance. The M.S. in Finance goes into much more depth in the finance field. If your career goals are to work in the finance field, other than investment banking, you should probably pursue an M.S. in Finance. If your goals are to work in management, or management consulting, or investment banking, an M.B.A. in Finance (finance is your major) would be preferable. Other than investment banking, unless you have a strong interest in finance, there is no preference to select finance as your major in your MBA program. I am retired now, but worked in management consulting for 40 years. I have a BSEE and an MBA in Finance. When I completed my MBA in mid career, I had already established my consulting career. I took the MBA mainly for the additional credential. I selected finance as my major because I had a strong interest in the field. ",
