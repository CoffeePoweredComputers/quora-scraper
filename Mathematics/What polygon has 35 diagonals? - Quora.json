            "answer_text": "Number of diagonals in polygons of n sides = n(n-3)/2. Here, n(n-3)/2 = 35, or n(n-3) = 70 So n = 10. So a decagon has 35 diagonals. 360/10 = 36. So sum of all interior angles = (!80\u201336)*10 = 144*10 = 1440 deg. 1440/180 = 8. So at any one vertex we can draw 8 diagonals and thus form 8 triangles at each vertex. ",

            "answer_text": "In any polygon with n sides each vertex can be connected to n-3 other vertices (not to itself or either adjacent vertex) by a diagonal. Thus, there are a total of n(n-3)/2 diagonals (the division by 2 is to avoid double counting each diagonal, once from each endpoint.) So we want: n(n-3)/2 = 35 or n^2 -3n -70 = 0 which is readily factored as (n-10)(n+7) = 0, which has the two roots n=10 and n=-7. Discarding the negative root, we have the only answer, n=10, a decagon. As a quick check n(n-3)/2 = (10*7)/2= 35. Check! ",
