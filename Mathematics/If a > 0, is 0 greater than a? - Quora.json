            "answer_text": "To your initial question, no. To explain the symbols in a simple manner, their shape actually indicates the relationship so this is easier than it seems once you notice that. The greater than symbol is > The less than symbol os < When i was a child this was explained to me that a hungry alligator would always turn towards the larger number if he really wanted to fill his belly, so if you see the symbol as open jaws, thats one way to look at it. If you were comparing the sizes of a bowling ball to a grain of sand you could draw one line between the top edges, and draw another line between the bottom edges, and you would get a similar shaped result. You can think which side has the bowling ball and which side has the grain of sand. > Notice the shape and think from left to right. If the left is the bigger side with the opening, and the right is the pinched off pointy side, then from left to right you would say the left side is greater than the right side. < If you notice the aligator jaws eating the symbol to the right, then which side is bigger and which side is smaller? Reading from left to right you will say whatever the left side is. So if the aligator jaws are not eating it, then its smaller. The left side is less than the right side. I hope this helps. ",

            "answer_text": "I must confess that when I read the question, I translated it all into words thus: \u201cIf [math]a[/math] is greater than [math]0[/math], is [math]0[/math] greater than [math]a[/math]?\u201d I got confused, because of course not (unless in both cases the comparisons include equality, and if both size comparisons with equality are true, then in fact they are equal: [math]a\\ge b[/math] and [math]a\\le b[/math] implies [math]a=b[/math]). But here the inequalities are strict. So the answer is that no, it\u2019s the other way around. If [math]a[/math] is greater than [math]0[/math], then [math]a[/math] is greater than [math]0[/math], which is a tautology. But then obviously the meaning of the symbol [math]>[/math] is in question. My way of understanding it visually is that the open jaws of the [math]<[/math] or of the [math]>[/math] symbol are a direct size comparison: the side of the symbol which is tallest (the open side) corresponds to the quantity with the greatest value. Lest this be confusing also, \u201cgreatest value\u201d means that if both quantities are positive, the one furthest from zero is greatest; if both quantities are negative, the one closest to zero is greatest; and if one is positive and one is negative, the positive is greatest. From which you can infer that zero is greater than any negative number and smaller than any positive number. One useful thing to do in your mind is to learn to translate mathematical symbols into phrases (though they are very technical and precise phrases). Every symbol corresponds to a word or phrase so that when a mathematical expression is read aloud it makes grammatical sense. This is what caused me that moment\u2019s confusion above. For example, here is a mathematical sentence and its prose English translation: [math]\\displaystyle{\\qquad x^2 - 3x + 2 > 0 \\implies x < 1 \\lor x > 2}.[/math] \u201cIf [math]x^2[/math] minus [math]3x[/math] plus [math]2[/math] is positive, then [math]x[/math] is less than [math]1[/math] or [math]x[/math] is greater than [math]2[/math].\u201d (The symbol [math]\\implies[/math] can also be read directly as the word \u201cimplies\u201d, so an alternative reading is \u201c[The expression(s)/condition(s) on the left] implies (imply) [the expression(s)/condition(s) on the right]\u201d.) (Bonus marks if you can prove the above claim!) When you\u2019re writing mathematics, you should always try to do so in such a way that it translates to valid sentences in the prose of the language you\u2019re using. Doing so, you\u2019ll also drill into your head exactly the kinds of meanings you\u2019re asking about - and asking questions like this when you\u2019re unsure is the way to go! ",
