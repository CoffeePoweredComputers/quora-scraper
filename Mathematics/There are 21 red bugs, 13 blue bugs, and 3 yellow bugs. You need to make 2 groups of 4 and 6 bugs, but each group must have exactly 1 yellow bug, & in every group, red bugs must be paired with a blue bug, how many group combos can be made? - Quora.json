            "answer_text": "If each group can have just 1Y bug and only pairs of R+B bugs, group combinations with even numbers of bugs are simply not possible. Therefore consider groups of, let\u2019s say, 3 and 5 bugs. Possible group combinations of 3 bugs, being 1R+1B+1Y bugs, are: 21*13*3 = 819.Having selected 1 such group, there are now 20R, 12B and 2Y bugs remaining. Possible group combinations of 5 bugs, being 2 (R+B)+Y = [20!/(!8!)(2!)]*[12!/(10!)(2!)]*2 = 25,280. Possible group combinations of 3 bugs and 5 bugs as requested = 819*25,280 = 20,704,320. ",
