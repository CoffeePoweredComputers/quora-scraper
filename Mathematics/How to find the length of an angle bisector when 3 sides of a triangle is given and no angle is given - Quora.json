            "answer_text": "Taking the 3sides of the triangle ABC with sides a,b& c relating to the corresponding angles A,B, & C respectively. Constructing the angle bisector AD bisecting side BC (a) at D, as proposed by the question it is to find AD. From the theorem of angle bisector for any \u2206, states to divide the corresponding base of the angle bisected as in the ratio of the two adjacent sides of the \u2206.Hence for the angle A side BC (a ) is divided by AD ,the angle bisector , in ratios equivalent of AB & BC. So c:a= BD:CD BD+CD =BC. From which it could be computed for AD as bc-{a^2(bc)/(b+c)^2}.The derivation on hand note below.  ",
