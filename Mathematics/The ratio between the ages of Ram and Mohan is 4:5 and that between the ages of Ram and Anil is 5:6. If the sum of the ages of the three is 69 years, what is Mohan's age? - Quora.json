            "answer_text": "Friends\u2026! The ratio between the ages of Ram and Mohan is 4:5 and that between the ages of Ram and Anil is 5:6. Ratio between Ram and Mohan = 4 : 5 Thus ratio between Mohan and Ram = 5 : 4 Ratio between Ram and Anil = 5 : 6 As Ram is common between two ratios, let us equalize the ratio of Ram\u2019s age Multiply the ratio of Mohan and Ram with \u00d75, the ratio 5 : 4 will be 25 : 20 Multiply the ration of Ram and Anil with \u00d74, the ratio 5 : 6 will be 20 : 24 Now the ratio between Mohan, Ram and Anil will be 25 : 20 : 24 Let the rational between ratio of ages be x, thus their respective ages are 25x, 20x and 24x The sum of the ages of the three is 69 years, 25x + 20x + 24x = 69 69x = 69 x = 1 The rational is 1, therefore their respective ages are Mohan's age 25x= 25 \u00d7 1 = 25 years Ram\u2019s age 20x = 20 \u00d7 1 = 20 years Anil's age 24x = 24 \u00d7 1 = 24 years Answer Mohan's age is 25 years.

But the total ages have been given as 69 Therefore 69x = 69 Or x = 1 Hence the ages of Ram, Mohan and Anil are respectively 20, 25 and 24 Hence Mohan\u2019s age is 25 ",
