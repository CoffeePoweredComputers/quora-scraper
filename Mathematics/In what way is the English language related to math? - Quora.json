            "answer_text": "There were many great mathematicians before English even became a language, notably writing in Greek and Arabic. There were also Indian and Persian mathematicians. Later, when English was around, there were great German and French mathematicians. So English is a language spoken by some mathematicians, but is by no means required. There are a great many people who speak English, but have little or no knowledge of mathematics. The language was not formed with mathematical rules. The only limited relationship I can think of is that high level programming languages tend to use English words. However, this is a matter of historical convenience as there have been equivalent programming in French and German with interpreters (the computer conversion program) which change those words into the actual machine instructions. Otherwise, it beats me. ",

            "answer_text": "Short answer: in no way. I learned mathematics in Dutch and only later found out that you can express the same ideas in German and French, still later in (medieval) Latin and ancient Greek, and still later in (surprise) Russian. Using induction my conjecture is that you can express mathematical thought in any well developed language. That is a language that allows a level of abstraction. Oh, I forgot English. Silly me. ",
