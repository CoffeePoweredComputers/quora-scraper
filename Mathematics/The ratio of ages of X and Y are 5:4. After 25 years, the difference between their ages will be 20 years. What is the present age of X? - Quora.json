Let the rational between the ratio of ages of X and Y be x Thus X present age is 5x and Y present age is 4x After 25 years, the difference between their ages will be 20 years. After 25 years their ages, X age 5x + 25 and Y age 4x + 25 Difference in their ages (5x + 25) - (4x + 25) = 20 5x + 25 - 4x - 25 = 20 5x - 4x = 20 x = 20 The rational is 20. This their age X's age 5x = 5 \u00d7 20 = 100 years Y\u2019s age 4x = 4 \u00d7 20 = 80 years Answer the present age of X is 100 years ",

The ratio of ages of X and Y is 5:4, so let\u2019s say their ages are 5a and 4a. The difference in age between 2 people would always remain the same. Therefore, even today also the difference in their age is 20 years. So, 5a - 4a = 20, which is nothing but a = 20. Since a = 20 and age of X is 5a, it\u2019s nothing but 5*20 = 100 Years. ",
