So their ages are 4x and 5x Eight years from now the ratio of their ages will be 5:6 8 years from now their ages, 4x + 8 and 5x + 8 Their ratio is 5 : 6 4x + 8/5x + 8 = 5/6 Cross multiplication 5 (5x + 8) = 6 (4x + 8) 25x + 40 = 24x + 48 25x - 24x = 48 - 40 x = 8 The rational is 8, their ages Anu\u2019s present age 4x = 4 \u00d7 8 = 32 years Raj's present age 5x = 5 \u00d7 8 = 40 years Answer the present ages of Anu is 32 years and present age of Raj is 40 years.

Therefore (4a+8) : (5a+8) = 5:6 solve this (4a+8) / (5a+8) = 5/6 => 6 x (4a+8) = (5a+8) x 5 => 24a + 48 = 25a + 40 => a = 8 So their present age would be 4a = 4x8 = 32 5a = 5x8 = 40 ",

Age of Anu is 4k+8. Age of Raj is 5k+8 . The ratio is 5:6 i.e. 4k+8/5k+8= 5/6 24k+48 = 25k + 40. k = 8. The present age of Anu is 4k = 32 and present age of Raj is 5k = 40 . So, the present ages of Anu and Raj are 32 years and 40 years respectively. Hope this answer helps you. Have a good day!!! If you like my work , please upvote my answers \u270c ",
