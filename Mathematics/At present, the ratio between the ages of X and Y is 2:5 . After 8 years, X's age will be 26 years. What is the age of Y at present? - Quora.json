            "answer_text": "Given: x:y = 2: 5 After 8 years, x\u2019s age will be 26. x+8 = 26 Find the value of y at present. Solution: Find the value of x first using the equation: x+8 = 26x+8=26Transpose positive 8 in the right side of the positive 26. Please be reminded that whenever we transpose a number from right to left / left to right, of a certain equation which is in between of the equal sign, the sign will always change from its original (e.g. a positive number will become negative and a negative number will become positive). So the equation will now become x = 26\u20138. Meaning to say, the value of x in the present is 18.Find the value of y in the present using the given ratio.x:y = 2:5 or x/y = 2/5Substitute the value of x in the ratio. (18:y = 2:5 or 18/y = 2/5)To come with the value of y, apply the criss-cross multiplication method. How to do this?Our given: 18/y = 2/5. We have two numerators and also two denominators. What we have to do is just multiply the first numerator to the second denominator and multiply the first denominator to the second numerator in between of the equal sign.18 (1st numerator ) to be multiplied by 5 (second denominator) in between of the equal sign, the y (first denominator to be multiplied by the 2 (second numerator).18*5 = y*290 = 2y.Divide both sides by two to find the value of y.90 / 2 = 2y/2y = 45To check our answer. Substitute the values of x and y in the given ratio of x:y = 2:5 or x/y = 2/5.18 : 45 = 2: 5 or 18/45 : 2/5Apply again the criss-cross multiplication method.18*5 = 45*290 = 90.Therefore, the age of Y in the present is 45.I hope, this simple solution helps you guys a lot. :) ",

            "answer_text": "x:y => 2:5 This means that 2x = 5y, which implies that x = 5/2y. After 8 years, x will be 26. => x + 8 = 26 Substitite the two equations into each other: x = 5/2 y x + 8 = 26 5/2y + 8 = 26 5/2y = 18 y = 36/5 y = 7.2 Therefore, y is 7 years old. ",
