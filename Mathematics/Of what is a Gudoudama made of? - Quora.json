            "answer_text": "Guduodama, otherwise known as Truth-Seeking Balls, are orbs made of black chakra which can alter their form and characteristics in various ways.  Those who awaken Six Paths Senjutsu can wield Truth-Seeking Balls. Hagoromo and Hamura \u014ctsutsuki appear to have possessed this power naturally, whereas others may obtain it by becoming the jinch\u016briki of the Ten-Tails, or by receiving it directly from Hagoromo. Truth-Seeking Balls can be controlled individually or combined; in both cases, by understanding the power of \"all things in nature\" (\u68ee\u7f85\u4e07\u8c61, Shinra Bansh\u014d), the orbs can be shaped into a variety of forms. The orbs can also wrap around the user's body to form a protective shell.  Or can become a Truth-Seeking Umbrella (\u6c42\u9053\u5098, Gud\u014dkasa). The Truth-Seeking Balls are also transformed into weapons by several of their users, such as:  Obito\u2019s shakuj\u014d  Madara's shakuj\u014d  The Sword of Nunoboko  Naruto's B\u014d  Black Recievers.
