            "answer_text": "Great question! Let's start by choosing a definition of \u201calgebra\u201d: Algebra is the precise study of operations that relate objects. (Please don't give me too much flack, but I don't want to choose a definition that is too \u201cout there.\u201d) Now, what could the objects be? Numbers, functions, spaces, anything really. When your objects are structureless labels, you get pure algebra. When your objects are homotopy classes of continuous functions, you basically get algebraic topology. When your objects are themselves universes of objects, maybe you get category theory? What could the operations be? When you have a rule for turning two things into one thing, you get magmas, semigroups, monoids, groups, et cetera. So we can study symmetries with \u201calgebra,\u201d as well as time evolution (dynamical systems are spaces equipped with an action by the real numbers under addition, for example). When you have two different binary operators, you get rigs, rings, and fields. When you have scalars and you can still add objects, you get modules and vector spaces. What if we can't combine any objects, but only ones that are allowed to be combined? You get categories and groupoids, which are loose models of directed and undirected spaces, or models of universes of objects (places where higher logics live). Algebra is also dual to geometry in a fairly precise sense. If you have a type of algebra, it's probably perfectly represented by some sort of space. Algebra is how mathematicians talk about many, many ideas. This is a tough question! ",
