To prove it false, assume it's true and then proceed to use a counterexample\u2026 the cool thing is you only need one of them, so here's one: let A = 4, B = 5, C = 6. Assume A - (B - C) = (A - B) - C is true. So\u2026 4 - (5 - 6) = (4 - 5) - 64 - (-1) = (-1) - 65 = -7\u2026 which we can see is false, so the original statement is false! ",

First you need to define what \u2018-\u2019 and \u2018()\u2019 are, then you need to pointed out which set does this equation should be applied. Is it natural number set, integer set, real number set, or any other sets? (No, this equation is not always right or wrong under different sets. You can even carefully build a set that allows a-b-c=a+b+c, although that set could be useless) I recommend you to read Analysis I by Trence Tao. The first 4 chapters should be enough to awnser your question, or at least give some clues. ",
