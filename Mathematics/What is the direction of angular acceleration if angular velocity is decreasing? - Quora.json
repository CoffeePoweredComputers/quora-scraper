            "answer_text": "Firstly, we remind ourselves that the direction of the angular velocity is directed perpendicular to the plane of rotation. We find it using the right-hand rule: we curl the hand in the direction of rotation and the thumb then points in the direction of the angular velocity. Now, assuming we regard angular velocity and angular acceleration as vectors, then if the angular velocity is decreasing, then the direction of the angular acceleration is opposite to that of the angular velocity. Conversely, if the angular velocity is increasing, then the direction of the angular is equal to that of the angular velocity. For an intuitive (non-algebraic) explanation, we can say that, in order for angular velocity to decrease, an opposite acceleration needs to take place. In other words, the arrow for angular velocity can only become shorter if there is another arrow working against it, i.e. in the opposite direction. The angular acceleration is thus negative if we regard the angular velocity as positive (until it becomes zero). ",

            "answer_text": "Angular Velocity [math]\u03c9[/math] is decreasing. That has two scenarios: [math]\u03c9[/math] is less than [math]0[/math], (the object spinning clockwise) and [math]|\u03c9| [/math] is increasing. That is, it is becoming more and more negative. (Or going away from [math]0[/math].) The [math]\u03c9[/math] points in the negative z-axis.Or, [math]\u03c9[/math] is positive (the object spinning counterclockwise). So [math]|\u03c9|[/math] is approaching [math]0[/math]. The [math]\u03c9[/math] points in the positive z-axis.In the first case, spinning speed is increasing, and in the second case, spinning speed is decreasing. But, Angular acceleration is acting in the negative z-axis, in both the cases. You see, in the second case angular acceleration is supporting the motion. This is another way to interpret why [math]\u03c9[/math] and angular acceleration are in same (i.e. negative z-axis). But, if we are said that magnitude of [math]\u03c9[/math] is decreasing, then, the angular acceleration points away from the [math]\u03c9[/math]. That it, it is trying to oppose the [math]\u03c9[/math]. And after some time, we will surely see that [math]\u03c9[/math] will equal to 0, and then increasing magnitude in the direction of angular acceleration. ",
