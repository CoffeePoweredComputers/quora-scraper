            "answer_text": "The inch - a measurement that has been around since Roman times at least (and has the same root word as ounce, both meaning one twelfth) was inexact, and in fact probably varied somewhat over the years. Like many imperial units it related to a real, if poorly defined, object (think feet, hands, chains, stone) - thought to be the length of the first joint of the thumb. More formally defined as the length of threw barleycorns laid end to end, you can see why it needed to be pinned down a bit more precisely. All units of measurement are essentially arbitrary - if we all agree on a length of stick, the actual length doesn't matter so long as we all know what it is. The best ways to define units, though, doesn't rely on a physical object (we still have a physical official kilogram mass in a glass jar in Paris but even that varies a bit over time - not ideal).  The metric  system tried to do this as sensibly as possible by taking the whole earth as our standard and calling one ten-thousandth of the distance from equator to pole a kilometre. They measured wrong which is why the circumference of the earth is just over 40000km, not exactly, but that was the idea. Once we got the unit and the system though, it got formally defined in terms of the physical laws of the universe (they don't change!) as the distance light travels in a vacuum in 1/299792458 of a second.  And now that the clearly more precise and elegant metric system was properly defined, the inch got formally defined in terms of that so as to avoid unnecessary work - inches and centimetres measure the same thing after all - length. So as of 1959 an inch is 2.54cm exactly. By definition. ",

            "answer_text": "As others answered, the inch has been redefined as exactly 0.0254 meters or 25.4mm since 1959, but the inch has had many previous definitions (such as \u201cthe length of three barleycorns\u201d). With the official adoption in France, on 10 December 1799, of the \u201cmetric system\u201d (now called \u201cSI\u201d), the metre \u201cwas defined to be one ten millionth of the distance between the North Pole and the Equator through Paris\u201d[1] \u2014 which is approximately 39.37 inches. Notwithstanding the fact that Napoleonic France discarded their own metric system in 1812 (and readopted it in 1840), many revisions to that \u201cstandarde\u201d have since occurred with the latest definition being \u201cexactly 1/299,792,458 of the distance that light travels in a second\u201d[2]. However, nearly a decade earlier (1790) than the French adoption of a \u201cmetric system\u201d, comprehensive proposals were introduced in the U. S. Congress to adopt a decimal \u201cStandard of Weights and Measures\u201d[3] (as enumerated in Article I, Section 8, of the Constitution). The legislation included systems of new measures, such as: LENGTH: 10 inches to the new FootLet the foot be divided into 10 inches; the inch into 10 lines; and the line into 10 points.Let 10 feet make a decad; 10 decads one rood; 10 roods a furlong; and 10 furlongs a mile.MASS: 1 Ounce = the mass of one cubic inch of pure water1 Pound = 10 Ounces = 100 Double-Scruple = 1000 Carat = 10,000 Minim = 100,000 Mite1 Hogshead = 10 Kental = 100 Stone = 1000 Pounds = 10,000 OuncesVOLUME: 1 Bushel = 1 cubic new footdefined so that a bushel of water weighed 1000 ounces.TIME: The seconds pendulum at 45\u00b0 latitude was used as the basic reference.These proposals were prepared by the Secretary of State, at the request of President Washington \u2014 in order to carry out the mandate expressed in Article I, Section 8: Congress shall have power \"To coin Money, regulate the Value thereof, and of foreign Coin, and fix the Standard of Weights and Measures\". Sadly, Congress failed to pass any legislation establishing weights and measures. as a result of Secretary Jefferson's report. As noted in \u201cThe Metrication Timeline\u201d[4], \u201cIt is remarkable that Congress never established [a] traditional method, or any other method, as the mandatory system of weights and measures for the United States.\u201d Fortunately, Congress accepted that decimal currency had been agreed between the states in 1785 but that uniform standard measures remained a problem. Since then, a decimal system of currency similar to ours ($1 = 10 di[math]_s[/math]mes = 100 cents = 1000 mills ~= 1 oz. Ag; $10 = 1 Eagle = 1/2 oz. Au.), has been adopted nearly every other country in the world \u2014 including our former \u201cmother country\u201d, which discarded its own system (i.e., 1 Pound Sterling = 20 shillings; 1 shilling = 12 pence; 1 pence = 4 farthings; not to mention Crowns, Guineas, Florins, Tuppence, Thrupence, Groat, Tanner, Ha\u2019penny, and Mite!) Unfortunately, the USA \u2014 which was the first nation to consider a decimal system of weights and measures \u2014 remains one of the only countries in the world without one, and the \u201cinch\u201d remains exactly 2.54 cm.
