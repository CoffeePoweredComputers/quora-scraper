            "answer_text": "Under the current wording of this question, I am going to assume that you are looking for a real number kk that satisfies these constraints. I will claim that there is no such kk that satisfies the equation x2\u22125x+k=0x2\u22125x+k=0 such that 44 is the only solution. Here\u2019s a simple proof by contradiction: Assume x=4x=4 is the only solution to the equation x2\u22125x+k=0x2\u22125x+k=0. We know as a direct result that (4)2\u22125\u22c54+k=0(4)2\u22125\u22c54+k=0 k=4k=4 Therefore, our original equation is now x2\u22125x+4=0x2\u22125x+4=0 But wait a second, this equation also has a solution of x=1x=1 which contradicts our previous assertion that x=4x=4 is the only solution. Therefore, no such kk can exist that satisfy these constraints. ",

            "answer_text": "For a quadratic equation x2\u2212px+q=0x2\u2212px+q=0 to have a single solution, the left hand side needs to be a square polynomial. Hence it is necessary (and sufficient) to have the condition q=(p2)2q=(p2)2 fulfilled. In which case your quadratic polynomial reduces to (x\u2212p2)2(x\u2212p2)2 and the solution is x=52x=52. x=4x=4cannot be the only solution. Please note that the condition that x=4x=4 is a solution does already determine the value of k. Maybe that is what you meant by your question. If x2\u22125x+kx2\u22125x+k has 4 as a root, then the polynomial is divisible by (x\u22124)(x\u22124). Carrying out the division, or using trial and error, multiplying (x\u22124)(x\u2212r)=x2\u2212(4+r)x+4r(x\u22124)(x\u2212r)=x2\u2212(4+r)x+4rshows you already that r=1,r=1, your solutions are 1 and 4, and k=4k=4 ",

            "answer_text": "By plugging X=4 into the equation, we have 4^2\u20135*4+K = 0, or 16\u201320+K=0, ie, K=4. However, X=4 is not the only solution to X^2\u20135X+4=0. By factorization, we see that (X-4) (X-1) = 0, ie, X=1 or X=4. That is, there is NO UNIQUE SOLUTION for this equation if X=4 is one solution. The quadratic equation delineates that the \u2018determinant\u2019 (or discriminant function), b^2\u20134ac, must be zero to have a unique solution (-b/2a). In this situation, the discriminant is (-5)^2 - 4(1)(K) = 25\u20134K. If we set that to zero, the only unique solution occurs if K=25/4. (And X=5/2 is the only solution). ",
