            "answer_text": "I decided to answer this question because I see so many answers that refer to applying yourself, when the truth actually lies more in psychology, and a difference between male and female in our culture. I was one of those fortunate people who got great grades even though I seldom had to apply myself. I was a straight A student, teachers pet. I\u2019ve always loved playing brain and logic games, so I\u2019ve taken a lot of IQ tests for fun, and always score above 160 on standardized tests. I have a passion for learning, and I love researching things to such a depth, that I find a truth much deeper than what most people are aware of. Quick example, 9/11: Most people see \u201cplanes hit buildings, buildings fall down\u201d. I look at structural engineering, and that Building 7\u2019s symmetric collapse at free fall speed doesn\u2019t fit the government\u2019s \u201cfire\u201d story. But the one thing that contrasts me most to truly dumb people is that, I know that most people know things, that I\u2019ll never comprehend as well as they do. A hillbilly, living in the backwoods of Tennessee, who can\u2019t even write his name, will have more knowledge about living off the land than I ever will. There are two factors that most people aren\u2019t considering when it comes to your sister\u2019s grades and intelligence, compared to yours. 1. Men tend to internalize their thought process. In our hunter / gatherer days, the women stayed safe in the village doing chores, watching the children, and had the freedom to verbalize everything. Men on the other hand, fought wars and did the hunting. If men verbalized freely, they would scare off the prey. So they internalized their thought process, and spoke minimally to convey only important information. So, when a woman speaks, a man listens to the first words that come out of her mouth, and wonder \u201chow can she be so ignorant to come to that conclusion?!\u201d But she hasn\u2019t come to a conclusion yet. She has just started her thought process, that men internalize, and she needs to talk it out. If men would learn this, they would find the bond with women become incredibly strong, because you\u2019re a \u201cguy who listens\u201d, and respects her intelligence. 2. Women understand that most men are insecure, with very fragile egos. Their nurturing and compassion (unhampered by an evolutionary duty to kill) leads women to pretend to be dumber than they actually are, so not to hurt men, and threaten them with their intelligence. A woman who outsmarts men is a threat in our culture. So a smart man advances in his career, a smart woman\u2019s career can be stifled, if she doesn\u2019t learn how to cater to men\u2019s egos, while proving the value of her intelligence (ie. giving her boss credit for her accomplishments). So, the logical conclusion is, when your sister takes a test, she\u2019s not verbalizing her intelligence, and threatening a man\u2019s fragile ego. Giving her freedom to show just how smart she really is. The fact is, your sister is smarter than you, but for the reasons above, she only shows it when she\u2019s doing school work. Guys, stop being threatened by a woman\u2019s intelligence. Embrace it. Encourage it. Reward her for it. Your fragile ego shouldn\u2019t be her problem. ",

            "answer_text": "Women are more likely to do what they are asked and nothing more, to get good grades and \u201calleged\u201d admiration. I\u2019m of the understanding men have generally higher IQs than women. I know women\u2019s math and science scores diminish after puberty, according to the CDC. Many men want to learn, not just get good grades thus it is probably a matter of focus, rather than intelligence. It took me awhile to understand that if I do exactly what the professor says, and learn what they want me to, I got better grades then if I was trying to learn everything presented in the textbooks. It\u2019s why I\u2019m not very enamored with the teaching and testing systems in our country. I don\u2019t know how to improve the system but it would surely be focused on what each individuals interests are rather than trying to come up with what people in general should or shouldn\u2019t learn and know. Women want security/money/love and thus focus on getting those rather than establishing long lasting careers and the knowledge it takes to achieve success. Most women with college degrees don\u2019t utilize their education in their careers. I\u2019m obviously not talking about technical educations like being a dental hygienist. According to the \u201cThree Pound Universe, women also have more cells between their hemispheres causing the crossing of emotion and logic. I really just think women are more focussed on obtaining security by their nature. Women can remember what I said to them 10 years before. My wife know more about who\u2019s married to whom, where I could care less. Our differences surely even affect our political ideologies. Women are much more likely to embrace more socialistic policies than men. The teachers unions dominated by women are one of the largest contributors to the Democratic Party. ",
