            "answer_text": "Let the first pipe be P1 & the time be T1 Let the second pipe be P2 & the time be T2 Here the common for both of the pipe is filling the tank full of water which is considered as volume as 100% The time taken by both of the pipes are variable & diameter of the pipe depends on time, lesser the time more the diameter of pipe or vice versa. Here, dimensions of tank, diameter of pipes, velocity of water, viscosity etc are not taken into account it's logic depends upon time & imaginable diameter of pipes. P1 x T1 = 100 P1 x 12 = 100 P1 = 8.333 eq.(1) This is the percentage of water filled in tank by pipe P1 at 1 min. P2 x T2 = 100 P2 x 20 = 100 P2 = 5 eq.(2) This is the percentage of water filled in tank by pipe P2 at 1 min. Both of pipes P1 & P2 fill the tank for some time (T3) & pipe P2 alone fill the tank for totally 10 min (T4), thus filling the tank by 100% (P1+P2) T3 + (P2 x T4) = 100 (8.333+5) T3 + (5 x (10-T3)) = 100 T3 = 6 min Hence, the first pipe P1 opens for 6 min If both of the pipes combined together, (P1+P2) T5 = 100 (8.333+5) T5 = 100 T5 = 7.5 min This both pipes combined will fill the tank in 7.5 min (or) 7 min 30 sec.
