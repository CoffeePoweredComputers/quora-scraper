            "answer_text": "To clear the difference between proper subset and subset let us take an example. Let A and B be sets given by A ={2,5,6,8,9} and B={5,6} then all elements of set B is in set A so in that case we can say B is proper subset of A. If we set a definition then we can say if any set having more elements ,contains all elements of another set having lesser elements than set contain more elements is called super set and set which contain less elements is called proper subset. If we consider set E={3,6,7,9} and H={7,6,3,9} then all elements of H is in E. So H is improper subset of E. This is main different. But your question should be\u201d difference between proper and we subset\u201d. ",

            "answer_text": "See let me take an example and explain to you. That shall make things more clearer to you. See consider a set S{1,2,3,4,5}. Now there are two subset say A{1,3,4,5} and B{1,4,3,5}. Both A and B are subset of each other. Like the elements which are present in A are also present in B. So this is the subset part. Now for Proper Set. Suppose A is defined as A{1,2,3} and B consists of {1,2,3,4}. Here A is a proper subset of B. You can make out through the example I\u2019ve given. Hope this helps. :) ",
