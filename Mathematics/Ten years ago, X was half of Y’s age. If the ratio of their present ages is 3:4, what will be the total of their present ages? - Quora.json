            "answer_text": "The ratio of the present ages is 3:4 Taking 'm\u2019 as the common rational between their ages, let the present age of x be 3m years and the present age of y be 4m years. 10 years ago, x's age would have been 3m\u201310 and Y\u2019s age would have been 4m-10 years. 10 years ago, x was half of y\u2019s age. So, (3m\u201310)=1/2 (4m\u201310) 2(3m-10)=4m-10 6m-20=4m-10 2m=10 m=5 Thus, the present age of x is 3\u00d75 = 15 years and that of y is 4\u00d75= 20 years. The sum of their present ages is 15+20=35 years. ",
