            "answer_text": "A set is countable if it can be placed in surjective correspondence with the natural numbers. So a proof of countability amounts to providing a function that maps natural numbers to the set, and then proving it is surjective. It is not necessary that the function be an injection: you can map several different natural numbers to the same number in your set. You only need to make sure that there will be nothing in your set that doesn\u2019t have a natural number mapped to it. To prove your mapping is a surjection, you only need to provide a right-inverse for it: a function for taking an element of the set in question and finding the natural number that maps to it. There are other ways of showing that every member of your set gets hit by your function, but this is the most rigorous in my opinion. As an example, you can prove that a countable Cartesian product of countable sets (e.g. [math]\\mathbb{Z}^\\infty[/math]) is countable, by providing the function that maps 1 to the first element of the first set, 2 to the 2nd element of the first set, 3 to the first element of the second set, 4 to the third element of the first set, 5 to the second element of the second set, and so on. In general, you map the nth triangular number to the first element of the nth set, one less than the n+1st triangular number to the second element of the nth set, two less than the n+2nd triangular number to the third element of the nth set, and so on. We know that this function is a surjection because we know that the ith element of the nth set is mapped to by the natural number i less than the n+i-1st triangular number. ",

            "answer_text": "Some sets are not. The simplest way is to demonstrate a 1\u20131 correspondence with the integers. Sometimes, however, that\u2019s very hard or even impossible. Here\u2019s a sketch of how to demonstrate the number of rational numbers is countable. Step 1: Consider all pairs of integers (a,b) and devise an order for them, something first. For instance we might start at (0,0) and proceed in circles (a spiral): (0,0),(1,0),(1,1),(0,1),(-1,-1),(-1,0),(-1,-1),(-1,0),(1,-1),(2,0), \u2026.. This gets every integer point on the plane. Every point z=(x,y) represents the number r=x/y provided that [math]y\\ne 0.[/math] There are two problems: [a] a lot of points have y=0 [b] a lot of numbers are represented by more than 1 point on the plane. However, consider Z the subset of these points representing unique rational numbers. Since it is a subset of a countable set, it cannot be of greater cardinality, and since it contains, in particular, representatives of the integers, it is not finite. ",

To check this, try to find a one-one map from the given set to natural numbers/a subset of natural numbers/any set you have already proved to be countable. For example, if you are concerned about integers, the map might be so that [math]f(0)=1[/math] [math]f(-1)=2[/math] [math]f(1)=3[/math] And so on. . You can notice the general term is- [math]f(-k)=2k[/math] [math]f(k)=2k+1[/math] ",
