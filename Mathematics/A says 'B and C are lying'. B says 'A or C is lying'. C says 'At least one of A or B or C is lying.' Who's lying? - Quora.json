            "answer_text": "I don\u2019t really have any LOGICAL disagreement with the other answers I\u2019ve read, but it\u2019s actually possible that NO ONE is lying in this situation. The reason has less to do with logic and more to do with WHAT LYING IS. Most of the answers here assume that lying is the same thing as telling falsehoods; this is just a false definition of lying, but it may actually be the intended one (in which case, the other answers could very well be satisfactory). But in order to lie, one must DISBELIEVE one\u2019s own claims. Not only are spoken falsehoods not always lies, but some lies can actually be true (if they are disbelieved by the speaker at the time, but unbeknownst to the speaker, they are actually true). So it\u2019s perfectly possible that A, B, and C each BELIEVE their own claims. I admit this answer doesn\u2019t help if you are just trying to do some simple logic, but if you really are concerned about something involving LYING, then you should be concerned about what lying really involves. Fundamentally, lying is not \u201calethic\u201d so much as \u201cdoxastic\u201d \u2014 it has more to do with (the speaker\u2019s) belief than with the truth of a matter. If I believe the Earth is flat when it is in fact round, and I tell you it is round in an attempt to mislead you, I am definitely lying to you, but my statement is true. So, contrary to popular opinion, a \u201ctrue lie\u201d is NOT a contradiction in terms. ",

            "answer_text": "Well I suppose we should answer this through a simple process. First, C definitely can\u2019t be lying because if he was lying his statement would be true. Second, since C is definitely honest A must be a liar because his statement requires C to lie in order for it to be true. Third, B is honest because A is lying and C is honest which makes his statement true. In conclusion, A is lying while B and C are telling the truth.
