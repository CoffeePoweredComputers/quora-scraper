            "answer_text": "By induction, of course! Suppose we know that 2n+1\u22642n2n+1\u22642n; we wish to show that it follows 2(n+1)+1\u22642(n+1)2(n+1)+1\u22642(n+1). Indeed, we have 2(n+1)+1=2n+1+2\u22642n+2=2(n+1)2(n+1)+1=2n+1+2\u22642n+2=2(n+1) Well done! Now we have just to drop in the base case, that is n=3n=3. OK, 2n+1=2\u22c53+1=72n+1=2\u22c53+1=7 and 2n=2\u22c53=62n=2\u22c53=6. So you\u2019re reduced to prove that 7\u226467\u22646. Once you\u2019ve done it you earn the 5 marks. ",
