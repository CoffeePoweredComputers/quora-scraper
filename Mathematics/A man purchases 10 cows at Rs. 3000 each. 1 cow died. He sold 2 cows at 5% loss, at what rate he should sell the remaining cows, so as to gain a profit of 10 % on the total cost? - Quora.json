            "answer_text": "The man spent 10*3000 = Rs.30,000 in buying 10 cows. 1 cow died. He sold 2 cows at 5% loss that he sold the 2 cows at Rs.2850 each or Rs.5700 for the two cows.. To make a profit of 10% on the total cost, the total SP should be 30000*110/100 = Rs.33,000. He recovers Rs.5700 from the sale of two cows. So he has to recover (33,000\u20135,700) = Rs.27,300 from the sale the remaining 10\u20131\u20132 = 7 cows. So he must sell the 7 cows at (27300/7) = Rs.3900, each. Answer. ",
