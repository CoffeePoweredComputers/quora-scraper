            "answer_text": "I usually don\u2019t give code answers, even if we were colleagues. I discuss ideas and concepts, not code. Unless the code is really bad or messy, and then we need to understand what it is supposed to do and discuss that concept. If I give you the answer, you\u2019ll never truly learn. I suggest you to learn the basics with assistance, a friend, a teacher or a tool like \u201cLearn Python - Free Interactive Python Tutorial\u201d (just googled \u201cPython tutorial online\u201d). Fight the urge to lookup the code answer to your problem, try to understand your problem, once you understand it, your problem is solved. Think more in the lines of: What is EOF?Why EOF?Am I doing something wrong or is this normal?Should I check for EOF?Good luck Adam. ",
