You\u2019ll straightaway notice that the sign of the derivative changes at some points. [math]f(x)=x^3-3x[/math] [math]\\implies f'(x)=3x^2-3=3(x-1)(x+1)[/math] [math]f'(x)>0\\qquad x\\in\\R\\setminus(-1,1)[/math] [math]f'(x)\\leq0\\qquad x\\in[-1,1][/math] That\u2019s enough evidence to state that the function is not injective.  It is clearly not an injective function. ",
