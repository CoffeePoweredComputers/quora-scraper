            "answer_text": "I answered this on Tuesday! Here it is again. If you ask how far is C from A, Pythagoras gives 10 km. (3. 4 , 5 triangle). So that is a good answer over most of the planet\u2019s surface but there are some exceptions. Within 8 km of the North Pole you cannot walk 8 km north. You run out of northness! Start a tiny amount further south and when you walk 6 km east you are going round in a tiny circle, ending up 8 km from your starting point. If you start at the South Pole, walk 8 km north then walk any distance east or west and you stay 8 km from the start. So I guest the answer is between 8 and 10 km depending on from where you start.
