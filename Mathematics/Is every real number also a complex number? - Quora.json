            "answer_text": "Theoretically the answer should be - Yes, every real number is also a complex number. we can denote a real number in form of a complex number using imaginary unit -\u201di\u201d. Both Imaginary and Real numbers are subset of Complex numbers. But, I think I should add one important thing - Complex numbers and imaginary numbers have slightly different meaning. Let, z = x + iy (where i^2 = -1 and y is not equal to 0). Here, z is a complex number which consists of a real part(x) and an imaginary part(yi). s A complex number with a NON-ZERO imaginary part is denoted as a pure imaginary number. Geometrically complex numbers are presented perpendicular to the real axis as they are found on the vertical axis of the complex number plane. And a complex number plane is a modified version of cartesian where the complex number is found on the z axis (also perpendicular to the real axis). But when the imaginary part of a complex number is zero, the rotation of the complex axis also results in zero. Thus we get the axis with the real numbers. This means we have eradicated the imaginary part of the number. The equation then looks like this: z = x + i0. Which implies that z = x (a real number) Lastly, we can take a look at a the classification of numbers. It\u2019s clear that both Real numbers and imaginary numbers are children of complex numbers.

            "answer_text": "Yes and no: it depends on your definitions! No, if you regard [math]\\mathbb{C}[/math] as, say, the Cartesian product [math]\\mathbb{R} \\times \\mathbb{R}[/math] (with algebraic operations defined as usual) and leave [math]\\mathbb{R}[/math] \u201cas is\u201d. In this case, [math]\\mathbb{R}[/math] is merely isomorphic to the subfield [math]\\mathbb{R} \\times \\{0\\}[/math] of [math]\\mathbb{C}[/math]. Yes, if after so obtaining [math]\\mathbb{C}[/math], you now redefine [math]\\mathbb{R}[/math] to be that subfield of [math]\\mathbb{C}[/math]. (You can play the same \u201ctrick\u201d as in the \u201cyes\u201d answer when you successively extend [math]\\mathbb{N}[/math] to [math]\\mathbb{Z}[/math], extend [math]\\mathbb{Z}[/math] to [math]\\mathbb{Q}[/math], and extend [math]\\mathbb{Q}[/math] to [math]\\mathbb{R}[/math]. Of course the details differ in each case.) ",
