            "answer_text": "Q. If 5 is subtracted from twice a number, the result is the same as when 4 is added to the number. What is the number? Let the number be (X) Write the question algebraically. Number your equations. You may need to refer back to them. The question says 2X minus 5 equals X plus 4 >> Algebraic Equation. Given. 1) ( 2X - 5 ) = ( X + 4 ) (Given is my own word choice). Rearrange Equn 1). ( 2X - X ) = ( 4 + 5 ). 2). The required answer is [] X = 9. Brackets As you advance , perhaps already? you will use brackets to aid clarity. I may overdo them? They without doubt aid clarity and neatness for an equation. Especially in this age of minute text I find them very reassuring. If necessary show any other steps to rearrange. Important: Neatness, Show Method, Accuracy, Check Answer. CHECK (Always, however trivial the question). Put the vale of X ( = 9 ) onto the primal Equation 1). Repeat 1) for ease of checking. 1) ( 2X - 5 )= ( X + 4 ). >> ((2).(9) - 5) = (9) + (1) ( 2X - 5 )= ( X + 4 ). >> (13) = (13). Checked and agreed. See further notes >>> REMINDER NOTES: [ If items change sides they charge sign. If items multiply on one side they divide on the other. Plus other rules as you advance.] E.g. (a + b = c + d) >>> (a - c = d - b) and so on (5a = 10b) >> (a/10 = b/5) it a/b = 10/5) = ( 2) etc. Brackets As you advance , perhaps already? you will use these to aid clarity. I may overdo them? Especially in this age of minute text I find them very reassuring. I hope some of the above will be useful to you Jack Blake ",
