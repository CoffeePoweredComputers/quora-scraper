            "answer_text": "Alright. Since 1.2 rupees more on each orange mean 40% profit and previous profit was 20%, it becomes clear that 20% rise in profit is equal to RS 1.2. Therefore, 20%= RS 1.2. Now since original price is 100%, the original price of each orange becomes RS 1.2*5+1.2(20%)=7.2 Therefore original price of each orange is RS 7.2 ",
