Because twice a number is 2X. And you are subtracting it from 32 therefore, X+2=32\u20132X First, subtract 2 from both sides X=30\u20132X next, add 2X to both sides (because the opposite of -2X is +2X) 3X=30 finally, divide both sides by 3 x=10 check x+2=32\u20132x (10)+2=32\u20132(10) 12=32\u20132(10) order of operations, multiplication first 12=32\u201320 12=12 is true therefore, X=10 ",
