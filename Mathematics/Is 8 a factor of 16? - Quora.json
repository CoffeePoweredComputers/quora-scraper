            "answer_text": "Yes. The factors of a number are the terms in which it can be broken down multiplied by the number.  The factors of 16 are: 1 and 16; 2 and 8; and 4: 1 x 16 = 16 2 x 8 = 16 4 x 4 = 16 8 x 2 = 16 16 x 1 = 16 You can see that every factor of a number is also a divisor of the number. ",
