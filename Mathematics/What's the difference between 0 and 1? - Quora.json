            "answer_text": "0 is the integer immediately preceding 1. Zero is an even number, because it is divisible by 2 with no remainder. 0 is neither positive nor negative. By most definitions 0 is a natural number, and then the only natural number not to be positive. Zero is a number which quantifies a count or an amount of null size. In most cultures, 0 was identified before the idea of negative things, or quantities less than zero, was accepted.The value, or number, zero is not the same as the digit zero, used in numeral systems using positional notation. Successive positions of digits have higher weights, so inside a numeral the digit zero is used to skip a position and give appropriate weights to the preceding and following digits. A zero digit is not always necessary in a positional number system, for example, in the number 02. In some instances, a leading zero may be used to distinguish a number.Elementary algebra The number 0 is the smallest non-negative integer. The natural number following 0 is 1 and no natural number precedes 0. The number 0 may or may not be considered a natural number, but it is a whole number and hence a rational number and a real number (as well as an algebraic number and a complex number). The number 0 is neither positive nor negative and is usually displayed as the central number in a number line. It is neither a prime number nor a composite number. It cannot be prime because it has an infinite number of factors and cannot be composite because it cannot be expressed by multiplying prime numbers (0 must always be one of the factors).Zero is, however, even. The following are some basic (elementary) rules for dealing with the number 0. These rules apply for any real or complex number x, unless otherwise stated. Addition: x + 0 = 0 + x = x. That is, 0 is an identity element (or neutral element) with respect to addition. Subtraction: x \u2212 0 = x and 0 \u2212 x = \u2212x. Multiplication: x \u00b7 0 = 0 \u00b7 x = 0. Division: 0\u2044x = 0, for nonzero x. But x\u20440 is undefined, because 0 has no multiplicative inverse (no real number multiplied by 0 produces 1), a consequence of the previous rule. Exponentiation: x0 = x/x = 1, except that the case x = 0 may be left undefined in some contexts. For all positive real x, 0x = 0. The expression 0\u20440, which may be obtained in an attempt to determine the limit of an expression of the form f(x)\u2044g(x) as a result of applying the lim operator independently to both operands of the fraction, is a so-called \"indeterminate form\". That does not simply mean that the limit sought is necessarily undefined; rather, it means that the limit of f(x)\u2044g(x), if it exists, must be found by another method, such as l'H\u00f4pital's rule. The sum of 0 numbers is 0, and the product of 0 numbers is 1. The factorial 0! evaluates to 1. ",

            "answer_text": "In my perspective 0 is bigger than 1.How!! Take a look.  0= 1+(-1) = 2+(-2) = 3+(-3) =                                   infinity-(infinity) 1 = 2+(-1) = 3+(-2) = infinity-(infinity-1)     =2-(2-1) = 3-(3-1)So, in 1 there is one number less compare zero. And that number is (-1).Take a another example. If we represent 0 on a graph then 0 is the summation of two wave which magnitude is same but one lies on positive plane and second on negative ( magnitude is infinity and (-infinity) ) So zero has very big span.But in case of 1 it has same except magnitude of wave on negative plane is (-infinity + 1).Again we find one less number in 1 as compare zero and that is (-1).

            "answer_text": "First of all both 0 and 1 are binary digits. Difference between them is ... When in any case of operations both play a differently opposite role . EXAMPLE : When any integer multiplied with 0 gives 0 , whereas any integer multiplied with 1 gives the number itself (even when divided gives the number itself ) . How oppositely they behave isnt it? This is the basic difference between 0 and 1. You can even check for what happens for other cases like addition subtration etc with 0 and 1 .which will make more clear of it ! Hope I made it clear .thank you !! ",
