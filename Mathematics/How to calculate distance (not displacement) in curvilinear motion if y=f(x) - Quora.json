            "answer_text": "How can I calculate distance (not displacement) in curvilinear motion if y=f(x)? My apologies for previous answer before this correction. If y = f(x) represent a path on a map using x and y coordinates and that path still meets all the requirements of a function you can take the integral from start, a, to finish, b, of sqrt(1 + [f\u2019(x)]^2) to get the distance.  If y = f(x) is position vs time you are looking for the sum of the absolute values of the differences between the end point y-values and the y-values of the points where the slope is zero. Example:  y=x^3 - 5x^2 + 6x - 1 from time 0 to time 3 seconds. Plug in 0 then 3 to find the y-values of the end points, -1 and -1. Now we need to find the points where the slope equals zero, where the direction has changed, so we need the first derivative set to zero. Set y\u2019 = 3x^2 -10x +6 = 0 ; x = 5/3 +/- sqrt(100 - 4*3*6)/6 = (5 +/- sqrt(7))/3 x= 0.785 and x = 2.549 The x-values are plugged into the equation to get the y-values . From the least x to the most x is (0, -1), (0.785, 1.113), (2.549, -1.631) and (3, -1) Calculate absolute values of differences in y of adjacent pairs left to right. |1.113 - (-1)| =2.113; |-1.631 - (1.113)| = 2.744 ; |-1 - (-1.631)| = 0.631 Now sum the absolute values of the differences: 2.113 + 2.744 + 0.631 = 5.488 units 5.488 units would be the distance traveled. This method works fine for movement in one dimension. If y = f(x) is velocity vs time you are looking for the absolute values of the integrals from start to finish. Every place that the function crosses the x-axis the integral is separated so the answer becomes the sum of the absolute values of the integrals from start to finish. ",
