First you have two sets, A and B, and a third set, C. In this set, there\u2019ll be the complement of A in respect to B. For each element in the set B, you compare for each element in the set A. If two elements of each set are equal, the counter x increases. If x = 0, it means that this element of set B is not equal to none element of set A. So this element is added to set C. ",
