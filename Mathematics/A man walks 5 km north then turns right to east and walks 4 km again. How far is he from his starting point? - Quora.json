            "answer_text": "It depends on where on the earth he is. If he started about 5.63 km from the north pole he would end up back where he turned right to the east. A line of latitude .63 km in radius is a 4 km circle. The earth is a sphere, and while lines of longitude are geodesics (the shortest line between two points on the surface of a sphere), lines of latitude are not. Near the equator, over short distances they are nearly straight lines. Near the poles, not so much. If he did this starting from the south pole, he'd end up exactly 5 km from his starting point. ",
