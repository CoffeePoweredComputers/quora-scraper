            "answer_text": "Not 100, but 100%. Slope is the ratio rise/run. If the rise is the same as the run, the ratio is 1, which is the same as 100%. Equal rise and run form a 45 - 45 - 90 triangle. For example, consider starting at the origin and moving to the point (3, 3). The segment from (0, 0) to (3, 3) forms a 45 deg. angle with the x-axis, and has slope 3/3= 1. ",
