            "answer_text": "There are a few terms worth understanding before deciding whether  is bijective. A function is injective when no output can be traced back to more than one input, i.e., the definition of a function with input and output reversed.A function is surjective when every possible output corresponds to one or more inputs. For a surjective real function , this means it would be impossible to draw a horizontal line  that doesn\u2019t intersect the graph of .A function need not be either surjective or injective, and one does not imply the other. If a function is both surjective and injective, it is bijective. The definitions of these three classes of functions can be worded as: Every possible output can be traced to ________ input(s). The intersection of the \u201cno more than one\u201d clause in the definition of an injection and the \u201cat least one\u201d clause in the definition of a surjection yields the \u201cexactly one\u201d clause in the definition of a bijection.  is not injective because its periodicity causes every output to correspond to an infinite number of inputs, namely every output  can be obtained from the inputs  and  for . It\u2019s not surjective either because every value of  outside the interval  does not correspond to any real input.  would be bijective if it satisfied both of these definitions but it satisfies neither. So no, it\u2019s not bijective. ",
