            "answer_text": "Well, its based on a very basic property which states the square of a real number should be greater than or equal to 0. For real numbers, sum of the squares of three numbers is 0, only when each square term is individually 0. Therefore, equating each square term to 0, we have a=1, b=2, and c=-3. Hence, a+b+c = 1+2\u20133 = 0 ",
