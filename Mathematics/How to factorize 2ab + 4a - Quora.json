            "answer_text": "Hey there. Thanks for the A2A. Factorisation of a term is basically breaking it down into convenient parts, typically trying to have a single variable in a term. This is particularly useful to find out the values of your variables. So to make your question slightly more interesting, let\u2019s have this term equating to 0, to form an equation. So we have: 2ab+4a=0 => a(2b+4)=0 #We see \u2018a\u2019 in both terms, so we take it out. Our goal is to have two \u2018factors\u2019 that have no common parts. =>a*2(b+2)=0 #We know take out 2, since it is a factor(or common factor) of 4. Now we get two distinct factors, 2a and b+2 having the relationship (2a)(b+2)=0 Clearly, when a product of two numbers equals 0, then either of those two numbers has to be 0 so, 2a=0 or b+2=0 =>a=0 OR b=-2 Alright, hope this helped, and gave you a little more insight. Cheers. ",

            "answer_text": "This math expression has 2 terms. Find what are the common factors on these two terms and extract them: Both 2ab and 4a have a common a. Now, the expression will be a(2b + 4).Check if you can still extract something from the expression inside the parenthesis. There is! Both 2b and 4 are divisible by 2. So now, the expression will be 2a(b + 2).Nothing is common on b and 2, so we stop extracting.And there you have it, the answer is 2a(b + 2). ",
