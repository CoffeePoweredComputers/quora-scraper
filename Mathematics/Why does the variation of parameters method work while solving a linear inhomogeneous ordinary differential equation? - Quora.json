            "answer_text": "One can view the the variation of parameters method as a special case of general Green\u2019s function method for linear differential equations. The key point is to \u201cdecompose\u201d the inhomogeneous term into \u201csum\u201d of individual impulses (delta functions) and solve for those. In this view, the meaning of the condition u'y1+v'y2=0 at a particular x is to have the response to impulse at x be continuous at that x. There is a more detailed explanation of this perspective in ananswer here: Intuition behind variation of parameters method for solving differential equations ",

            "answer_text": "What you want is a derivation, the mathematical term for a demonstration of why something works. Fortunately variation of parameters is one of the most basic and common techniques for solving differential equations.  You can find a derivation in any ODE textbook or in the top internet search results for \"variation of parameters\".  For example, here's the first Google hit: Variation of Parameters.  The text just before Equation 8 answers your question. ",
