            "answer_text": "Well there is a formula if single discount of a, b, c, then the equivalent discount is  30 - 2.75 + .075 that will be 27.325% There is also a basic conceptual way to do this, by ratios 15% means discount means article of 20 sold at 17. 10% means discount means article of 10 sold at 9. 5% means discount means article of 20 sold at 19. So multiplying these ratios as they are successively applied we get (17/20)*(9/10)*(19/20) that is 2907/4000 means article of 4000 sold at 2907 so discount is 1093 and in % terms is (1093/4000)*100 that wil be 27.325% ",
