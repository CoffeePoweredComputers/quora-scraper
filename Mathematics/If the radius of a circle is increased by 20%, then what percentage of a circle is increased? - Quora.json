            "answer_text": "Let's say radus of original circle is r. Now, radius is increased by 20%. Hence, new radius is r+20/100r = 1.2r Change in radius = new radius - original radius = 1.2r-r = 0.2r %age change in radius = (change in radius/original radius) *100 = 20% Now, change in a circle can be determined on the basis of Circumference of circleArea of circle.Now, let's talk about first case, ie, circumference. Circumference of original circle = 2(PI)r Circumference of new circle = 2(PI)(1.2r) Change in circumference = 2(PI)(0.2r) %age change in circumference = (change in circumference/original circumference) *100 = 20% Now, Consider second case, Area. Area of original circle = (PI)*r^2 Area of new circle = (PI)*(1.2r)^2 Change in Area of circle = (PI)*(0.2r)^2 Now, %age Change in Area of circle = ((PI)*(0.2r)^2) / ((PI)*(r)^2) * 100 = (0.2)^2 * 100 = 0.04*100 = 4% ",
