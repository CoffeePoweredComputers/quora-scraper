            "answer_text": "If he sells the first computer at a profit margin of 20% That basically means that the cost price was 20000. The second computer ,as stated, was sold at 24000 at a loss margin of 20% and that implies that the cost price was 30000 . From the above given statements we infer that the seller makes a profit of 4000 using the first computer and the a loss of 6000 with the second computer. And we therefore conclude that the seller makes an overall loss of 2000!! or, u can say a profit of -2000! ",
