            "answer_text": "I believe that the correct way to go about it is: Every real number can be seen as a complex number, but not any complex number can be seen as a real number. In almost any context can be seen can be is. The difference can be found if you study advanced mathematics, specifically the construction of the numbers, starting from natural to, well, any kind of number, or work with other algebraic theories. There you learn that the complex number x+i*0 is not the real number x, but you can associate them, see them as the same, work with them as you already know, even if they are not the exact same object. It\u2019s a little like having two pencils, one with a single blue end, one with two ends: one green and one red. If you were to decide that blue serves the same purpose as green, for writing, but red would be for corrections, or important stuff, or whatever, something different, then the green and the blue ends are pretty much the same for you, you do with them the exact same thing, what the blue end can do, so can the green, and vice versa. If the red end of the second pencil is finished, than you can say that you have two pencils of the same kind, for the purpose you have for them, even if, the second pencil is, as an object, different from the first. But that is probably not the answer you were looking for :). Shortly, every real number is a complex one, as the real number x can be written x+i*0, but it is not correct to say \u201cevery complex number is not a real number\u201d, because x is both a real and a complex number. You can however say that not any complex number is a real one, as a complex number with the imaginary part different from 0 is not real. ",

            "answer_text": "You can see the real numbers as a subset of the complex numbers (therefore: all reals are complex), or you can see the complex as a different structure inside which there is a subset which is analogous to the real numbers (therefore: reals and complex are different numbers). By construction: You could define [math]\\mathbb C[/math] as the algebraic completion of [math]\\mathbb R\\cup\\{\\sqrt{-1}\\}[/math], or [math]\\mathbb C=\\mathbb R(\\sqrt{-1})[/math]. Or you can imagine [math](\\mathbb C,+,\\times)[/math] as a set of pairs of real numbers [math](x,y)[/math], with an internal addition [math](x,y)+(u,v)\\mathrel{:=}(x+v,y+v)[/math], and an internal product [math](x,y)(u,v)\\mathrel{:=}(xu-yv,xv+yu)[/math]. Prove that this is a field, and then prove that [math]\\{(x,0)\\}[/math] is a subfield, and that [math](x,0)+(u,0)=(x+u,0)[/math], and [math](x,0)(u,0)=(xu,0)[/math], therefore [math](x,0)_{\\mathbb C}\\equiv x_{\\mathbb R}[/math] and the subfield [math]\\{(x,0)\\}[/math] is indistinguishable from the real. In the first case, by construction all reals are complex. In the second case, they are not, but the complex have a real subfield. However, in the second case, the equivalence is so strong that we can safely equate them: [math](x,0)=x[/math] (or [math]x+0i=x[/math]). ",
