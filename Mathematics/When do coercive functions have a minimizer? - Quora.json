            "answer_text": "Always[1]. The idea is to consider a sequence of balls of increasing radii, say . Let  be the ball centered at zero, and note that  is compact. Now, we know that a continuous function achieves a minimum on a compact domain and therefore  achieves a minimum at every . So, consider the minimizer of  over each element of the sequence, and let its value be , since the function is coercive, there is some point under which  for every  such that  (by continuity and the fact that the function diverges to infinity), and thus  for any  (as they\u2019re all equal) is our minimizer.
