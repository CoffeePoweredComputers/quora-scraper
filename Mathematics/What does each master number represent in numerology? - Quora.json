            "answer_text": "I can give you a brief outline but this is the main focus of the study of numerology and therefore must be studied completely by each individual, not given a cursory examination. For the sake of saving some time in preliminary research I will give you a basis. 0 is equilibrium and true unity. This is the fulcrum of the universe. All certainty is acquired by reducing variables to null.1 is the fundamental unit of anything and simultaneously a statement of existence. Every statement of being is shadowed by an equivalent, hidden statement of non-being.2 is the perception of this being and non-being as opposites as opposed to the unity idea of an infinite spectrum.3 is the first number which can generate a plane or space. Even a circle has a minimum of 3 distinct parts. (Outside, inside, boundary; or circumference, radius, focus)4 is the intersection of two qualities or spectrum. It is used for direct comparison and is founded on the principle of the cross or \u201cright angle\u201d.5 is the supposition that any \u201cworld\u201d subsequently categorized by the \u201ccross-referencing\u201d of 4 does not encompass the one perceiving it. The one with the power of perceiving the four quadrants can also influence the substance of each quadrant, as well as change the focus.6 emerges from the idea that the perceiver is also a product of whatever forces generated everything in the domain of perception. You will be tripped up in anything further without properly understanding the principle of \u201cAs Above, So Below\u201d.Why was 6 afraid of 7? Because 7 8 9\u2026 But honestly, try not to bother with analyzing 7, 8, or 9 until you grasp the earlier concepts. These refer to the sensory functions of the human being and can be easily understood as products of the interactions of the lower numbers. In Sanskrit they can be loosely described as Sat, Chit, and Ananda. I have gained a lot from reading Aleister Crowley, Eliphas Levi, John Michael Greer, Rudolf Steiner, and countless other names which devote themselves to the study of spirit in mathematics. The Naples Arrangement is a solid start for anyone looking further. ",

Regarding predictions: The fact is that despite numerous scientific studies of various kinds of predictions, science has never been able to establish that there was any kind of reality behind any of the otherwise alleged 100% guaranteed predictions that have been examined over time.
