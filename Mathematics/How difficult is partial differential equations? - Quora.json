            "answer_text": "Quite difficult. Let me sum it up by paraphrasing one of my PDEs professors: Derivatives are easy. Integrals are hard. [Nonlinear] ODEs are so hard, if we can reduce them to an integral (even if we can\u2019t evaluate that integral), we typically call that a success. PDEs are so hard, if we can reduce them to an ODE [or system thereof], we typically call that a success, even if we can\u2019t solve the ODE. ",

            "answer_text": "How difficult is partial differential equations? In general, linear ordinary differential equations are easy, non-linear ordinary differential equations are often hard. Similarly with partial differential equations. Only the simplest cases have been solved in closed form. Understanding the idea behind these equations is straightforward. Solving the harder cases is usually done by computer intensive methods. ",
