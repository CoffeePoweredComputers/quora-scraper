            "answer_text": "Nice question - it all depends on what you mean by number. Here are a few examples: Positive integer (whole numbers only)1,2,3Positive or negative integer1,2,3 and -1,-2,-3Integers1,2,3 and -1,-2,-3 and 0,0,0 and in general -a,a,0 where a is any integerReal numberany b,c,(b+c)/(bc-1) where b and c are any real numbers as long as bc isn\u2019t equal to 1 for example 3,3,0.75 and -a,a,0 where a is any real number.There\u2019s a special case (apart from 0,0,0) where the three numbers are all the same - can you find it ?Complex number it\u2019s still b,c,(b+c)/(bc-1) where b and c are any complex numbers as long as bc isn\u2019t equal to 1but now we have a way of solving of a+b+c=abc where bc does equal 1:a, i,-i where a is any complex number and i is the square root of (-1) for example 6\u201317i, i, -1If you like the idea of infinity being a number (whether it is a number or not isn\u2019t a very interesting question in itself - some people think it is, more people don\u2019t, but there\u2019s no right or wrong here) you can addinfinity, infinity, infinityas you know that infinity + infinity = infinity and infinity times infinity = infinity, don\u2019t you ? [Of course you can have infinity, infinity, a and infinity, a, b and infinity, -a, -b too where a and b are positive real numbers and let\u2019s not forget infinity, i, -i].I\u2019ve missed some categories of number here, this answer is more for illustration than for completeness. Feel free to edit my answer and add more if you like ! EDIT: I also realise I\u2019ve not taken account of the word different in the question (sorry, questioner) which rules out a few of my examples (and to be precise I should change some other wordings a little too). And of course you can\u2019t have three identical numbers answering your question as worded. But I\u2019ll leave things as they are, you\u2019ll just have to make a few adjustments. ",

            "answer_text": "This is not exciting unless you specify something about the numbers such as being positive integers. Suppose the numbers are [math]a[/math], [math]b[/math] and [math]c[/math] with [math]a \\le b \\le c[/math]. Then from [math]a+b+c=abc[/math] it follows that [math]3c \\ge abc \\Rightarrow 3 \\ge ab[/math]. Then the possible values are [math](a,b) = (1,1),(1,2), (1,3)[/math]. The first allows no value for [math]c[/math], the second gives [math]c=3[/math] and the third [math]c=2.[/math] It\u2019s interesting to generalize this. For fun, though you might not agree, consider the case of four numbers with [math]a \\le b \\le c \\le d[/math]. It\u2019s useful later, to use [math]d = \\frac{{a + b + c}}{{abc - 1}}[/math]. Similar to before, [math]4d \\ge abcd \\Rightarrow 4 \\ge abc[/math]. Though [math](a,b,c) = (1,1,1),(1,1,2),(1,1,3),(1,1,4),(1,2,2)[/math] are friendly, only the second is fruitful bearing [math](a,b,c,d)=(1,1,2,4).[/math] What excitement. Let\u2019s move on to five numbers. As before, [math]a \\le b \\le c \\le d \\le e[/math] and [math]e = \\frac{{a + b + c + d}}{{abcd - 1}}[/math]. So [math]5d \\ge abcde \\Rightarrow 5 \\ge abcd[/math] giving rise to [math](a,b,c,d) = (1,1,1,1),(1,1,1,2),(1,1,1,3),(1,1,1,4),(1,1,1,5)(1,1,2,2)[/math]. The only solution from this set is [math](a,b,c,d,e) = (1,1,1,2,5),(1,1,1,3,3)[/math]. Perhaps you can see where this is going and make a conjecture which generalizes this. ",
