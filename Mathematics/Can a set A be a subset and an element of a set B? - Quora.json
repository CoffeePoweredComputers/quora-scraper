            "answer_text": "Q: Can a set A be a subset and an element of a set B? Yes. Not for all sets, but it is possible. Whenever you get such questions, always consider the empty set \u2018[math]\\emptyset[/math]\u2019. All sets have the property of having the empty set, and thus, all sets have at least one element in common, that is, the empty set.  Consider: [math]A = \\emptyset[/math][math]B = \\{\\emptyset\\}[/math]Since all sets have the empty set in common, [math]A[/math] is an element of [math]B[/math]. And since [math]B[/math] has [math]\\{\\emptyset \\}[/math] it means that [math]A[/math] is also a subset of [math]B[/math].  For clarity, an additional way of defining the previous sets is: [math]A = \\{\\}[/math][math]B = \\{\\{\\}\\}[/math] If you are unsure you might use the powerset function, but it can be quite tedious.  Corrections and additions are welcome by using the comment section. ",

            "answer_text": "Other answers, such as {1} and {{1}, 1}, are correct, but might seem artificial. Here are two sets with the property that \"occur naturally\" early on in working with sets: A = {}, the empty set. Note that one of the properties of {} is that it is a subset of every set.B = P(X), the power set of some arbitrary set X. This is the set of all subsets of X; for example, if X = {1, 2}, then the elements of P(X) are {1, 2}, {1}, {2}, and {}.Now notice that A is an element of B, and A is also a subset of B. ",
