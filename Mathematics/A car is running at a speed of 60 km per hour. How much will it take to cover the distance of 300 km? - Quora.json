            "answer_text": "It is not mentioned whether given speed is constant or average. for the sake of answering lets consider it as constant mathematically speaking it will cover 60 km every hour, taking a total of 5 hours. Practically speaking this time can increase for e.g. usually there is a speedo error , if it shows 60 then actually the car could be running at 55 kmph which means its covered 275 km at the end of 5 hours and additonal 25 -30 mins to complete 300 km. The car / Driver might need a cooling/bio break/ fuel filling of about 15\u201320 min in between. the car could require infinite time in case it is running on something like a dynamometer where the car wheels are rotating but car is steady at one place.
