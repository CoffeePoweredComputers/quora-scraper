            "answer_text": "Well, the applications are quite evident, I think. The theorem says loosely that any impartial game under normal play can be equated to a one-heap game of Nim. You apply it by showing your game is impartial and uses normal play. Because Nim\u2019s strategy is solved, your game is now solved as well, and you can obtain the exact equivalence with iterated use of the MEX (minimum excluded ordinal) function. ",
