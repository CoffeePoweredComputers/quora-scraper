            "answer_text": "By \u201cunsolvable\u201d I will assume you mean that the DE has no closed form or series solution that is in practical terms, useful. Numerical methods and approximating techniques are what you are left with. Numerical Recipes is the first book I\u2019d look to, to see if there are methods that would apply to a particular type of equation (ODE). As for approximating techniques, there is a lot that can be learned from studying the differential equation associated with pendulum motion. The general methods of bootstrapping, Green\u2019s Functions, Lagrange methods, Fourier methods, and a whole host of others may come into play depending on what the equation is modeling, it\u2019s order, boundary conditions, and so on - physical phenomenon, geometry, chemistry, etc.. With a general open ended question like this, with no details for what is trying to be accomplished, I would say there can be no substitute for learning from available resources and experience that comes from trying things out.
