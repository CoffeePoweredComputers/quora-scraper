            "answer_text": "Like |x| = y, and given a \u201cy\u201d we try to find the x that got us there? If you meant expressions like |x-y| = z, then: (for real numbers) x-y = \u00b1z x = y\u00b1z for real numbers it\u2019s like the square function in that \u0192(x) = \u0192(-x) so you just have to entertain the possibility of \u00b1 when you \u201cinvert\u201d both sides, (x-y)\u00b2 = z\u00b2 x-y = \u00b1z x = y\u00b1z notice the similarity? \u221a\ufe0e(z\u00b2) = |z| by definition in real numbers! Now\u2026 if you wanna go deeper: This doesn\u2019t quite work, if you want thee x that got you that y, since the map isn\u2019t \u201cinvertible\u201d meaning the inverse isn\u2019t a function. There are more than one number with a given absolute value (besides 0). So we only get POSSIBLE x values that lead to our y, we can\u2019t actually know for sure. Given z\u00b2 or |z|, we can\u2019t deduce whether or not z is positive or negative (assuming z is real). In the real numbers -x and x are taken to the same value, |x| by this function. They aren\u2019t necessarily taken to x, if you say that you are assuming x is positive! If x is positive then it\u2019s sent to itself, if x is negative then |x| = -x, actually! You know, double negatives are positive. Same logic applies to x\u00b2 or any even function (x\u00b2\u207f for integer n, cos(x), etc). With complex numbers, well it\u2019s even messier, any complex number a+bi can be written as re\u2071\u1d57 where r is the number\u2019s distance from (0,0) in the complex plane and t is the angle it makes, this comes from e\u2071\u1d57 = cost+isint, which is just the unit circle graphed in the complex plane\u2026 and r happens to be the magnitude or absolute value of a+bi, itnis the stretch on the unit circle. So |a+bi| = |re\u2071\u1d57| = r, by definition. Also doing so trigonometry we can see r = \u221a\ufe0e(a\u00b2+b\u00b2), so given a \u201cy\u201d of r, we have many many many many complex ordered pairs that map to it under the absolute value function. The real numbers are just of the form a = \u00b1r, and b = 0, or in polar form (r and t) we get t = 0 or \u03c0. For complex numbers a+bi and -(a+bi) are sent to the same place under the square function: (a\u00b2-b\u00b2)+2abi, a new complex number. You still have only two choices for inverting this map with complex numbers, not infinitely many like what |a+bi| turns into. So either way you cannot invert the map! If your function is not bijective from your domain to codomain, you cannot invert it into a 1-to-1 fashion! It may be useful to look up \u201cinjective\u201d \u201csurjective\u201d \u201cbijective\u201d to understand these concepts. Codomain is the set containing your range, you want your range to be exactly equal to your codomain or you won\u2019t have a bijection. ",

            "answer_text": "How do you find the solutions to an absolute value function? You find values of a function, you find solutions to an equation. I am going to assume you mean find solutions to an absolute value equation. You will isolate the absolute value portion of the equation and solve for the 2 cases. Say you have 2| x- 4| - 18 = -4. 2| x- 4| - 18 = -4 : Add 18 to both sides 2| x- 4| = 14 : Dived both sides by 2 |x - 4| = 7 : Now the absolute value portion is isolated Case 1: x - 4 = 7 : add 4 to both sides ; x = 11Case 2: x - 4 = -7 : add 4 to both sides ; x = -3x = -3 or x = 11 The two cases for |n| = a will be either n = a or n = -a.
