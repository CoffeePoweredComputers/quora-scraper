On Quora you can denote a contour integral symbolically as: \\displaystyle \\oint_{\\Gamma} f(z) \\; \\mathrm dz\u00a0Which looks like:  However, the part that interests me, is how to draw the contour in a nice way. In order to do that using  you\u2019ll need to use a library. I don\u2019t know whether that\u2019s allowed considering the limited set of commands we may apply on Quora. But any TexEditor would allow it. You could copy the result as an image for use with Quora, or use it directly in your (La)Tex-document and/or convert it to a pdf. I browsed and found the following link, which explains a few tricks, in order to facilitate the process: Draw the dogbone contour for complex integral Have a look! I\u2019ll definitely will give it a go. ",
