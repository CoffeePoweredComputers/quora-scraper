            "answer_text": "In mathematical terms, a partial differential equation (PDE) is an equation involving a function of more than one independent variable and at least one partial derivative of that function. The order of a PDE is the order of the highest order derivative that appears in the PDE. The principal part of a PDE is the collection of terms in the PDE containing derivatives of order equal to the order of the PDE. The following example illustrates these definitions and introduces the two most common notations for expressing partial derivatives. Example : If u = u(x,y) is a function of the two independent variables x and y, then  is a PDE of the first order whose principal part is  Using subscript notation a more compact way to express this PDE is  in which case we would say that the principal part is  For more information please watch the below video :  ",

This causes the  term to disappear since you are differentiating a constant term and yields  If you want to find the partial derivative with respect to y, then you do the same except treat x as constant and differentiate with respect to y.  In the future, make sure to clearly state which type of partial derivative you want to find. ",
