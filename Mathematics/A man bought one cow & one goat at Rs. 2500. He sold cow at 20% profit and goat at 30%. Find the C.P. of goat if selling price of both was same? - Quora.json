Sale of Cow was at a profit of 20% and Sale of Goat was at a profit of 30%. Given that selling price of both the animals is same.  => X+20%(X) = Y+ 30%(Y) => X = Rs. 1300 and Y = 1200 => The Cost Price of Cow is Rs. 1300 and the Cost price of Goat is Rs. 1200. ",

            "answer_text": "You can solve this problem easily by using the concept of ratio and proportion, Let the CP of cow and goat be X and Y respectively. He sold the cow at 20% profit, SP will be 120% of CP = 6x/5,And goat at 30% profit, SP will be 130% of CP = 13y/10 by putting SP equal the ratio of their CP (x:y) will be 13:12. So the cost price of goat will be 1200. ",
