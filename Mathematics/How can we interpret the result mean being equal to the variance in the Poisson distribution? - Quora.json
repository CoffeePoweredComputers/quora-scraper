            "answer_text": "The distribution has a bulge (that tapers off to the right). The mean determines the location of the bulge. The fact that the variance is equal means that if we move the mean to the right, the bulge gets wider. How much wider? If you compare mean and variance directly you're comparing apples and pears. That's because the variance is an average of squared deviations from the mean. This means that the variance is not directly proportional to the width of the bulge, but to the square of the width. So if you want to visualise what happens, it's better to look at the standard deviation, which is the square root of the variance. It's nicely proportional to the width of the bulge. Your result says that the width of the bulge stays locked at the square root of the location of the bulge. If the bulge is at 100, then it's approximately 10 wide. If the bulge is at 1000, then it's approximately 32 wide. And so on. ",
