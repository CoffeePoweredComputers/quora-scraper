            "answer_text": "The work is completed in 5 days. So, the amount of work done by 12 men in 1 day is 1/5.  12 men work for 8 hrs a day.So, work done by 12 men in 1 hour is (1/5)*(1/8) = 1/40. Now, work done by a man in an hour will be (1/40)/12 = 1/480. According to the question, the work is to be completed in 5 days by working for 10 hours a day. Therefore, let us assume x men work each day. Work done by x men in 10 hours(i.e, 1 day) will be x*(1/480)*10 = x/(48). Then, amount of work done in 5 days = (x/(48))* 5= 5x/48. Now, if the work is to be completed, the fraction of work to be done in 5 days will be 1. Therefore, 5x/(48) = 1                                x = 48/5                                x = 9.6i.e, it requires 9.6 men (approximately 10 men) to work for 10 hours a day to complete the work in 5 days.

            "answer_text": "While I agree with the other answers giving 9.6, so, realistically, 10 men to complete the job in 5 days, I fail to see where, in the question, the asked specifies that the job is to be completed within the same 5 day time frame; therefore, my answer is slightly different. It's established that the job takes 480 hours to complete (12 \u00d7 8 \u00d7 5 = 480); however, as I stated above, it is assumed the builder wishes to stay within the 5 day time frame \u2026 but, they may not \u2026 so, for the sake of choices, I want to go over the other answers: Possible answer #1: 1 worker will complete the job in 48 days; Possiblity #2: 2 workers will complete the job in 24 days; Possibility #3: 3 workers will complete the job in 16 days; Possibility #4: 4 workers will complete the job in 12 days; Possibility #5: 5 workers will complete the job in 9.6 days; Possibility #6: 6 workers will complete the job in 8 days; Possibility #7: 7 workers will complete the job in (approximately) 6.85 days; Possibility #8: 8 workers will complete the job in 6 days; Possibility #9: 9 workers will complete the job in (approximately) 5.33 days; Possibility #10: 10 workers will complete the job in 4.8 days; Possibility #11: 11 workers will complete the job in 4.36 days; Possibility #12: 12 workers will complete the job in 4 days; Possibility #13 : 13 workers will complete the job in (approximately) 3.6 days; Possibility #14: 14 workers will complete the job in (approximately) 3.4 days; Possibility #15: 15 workers will complete the job in 3.2 days; Possibility #16: 16 workers will complete the job in 3 days; Possibility #17: 17 workers will complete the job in (approximately) 2.8 days; Possibility #18: 18 workers will complete the job in (approximately) 2.6 days; Possibility #19: 19 workers will complete the job in (approximately) 2.5 days; Possibility #20: 20 workers will complete the job in 2.4 days; I could keep going, until I reach one day, but I believe this adequately demonstrates the numerous answers to this question.

Bringing in more employees will add an extreme overhead to the project where the existing workers will have to spend their time ramping up the new employees. You could work the existing employees harder and expect them to get the work done in a shorter timeframe, but that would also be a poor decision since the employees are also human beings and will resent the demands which you\u2019re placing on them. I hope I don\u2019t need to explain the myriad ways in which this could backfire and affect you and your company. There\u2019s a legendary book about this subject which seemingly no American managers have ever read: The Mythical Man-Month - Wikipedia ",
