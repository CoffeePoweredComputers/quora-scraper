            "answer_text": "A2A: What is the Fibonacci sequence used for? One interesting use of the Fibonacci numbers is for Fibonacci coding,[1] a data compression code[2] for the positive integers, which encodes smaller integers as shorter strings of binary digits. Since small integers are more common in data than large integers, the compressed data is smaller than it would be if all integers were coded using the same size words code words. The Fibonacci coding takes advantage of the interesting property that any positive integer can be represented as the sum of distinct nonconsecutive Fibonacci numbers.[3]To better understand how this works, let me take a detour into a bizarre number base called \u201cBase Fibonacci\u201d. Base-Fibonacci Numbers You\u2019re very familiar, no doubt, with the base-10 number system. A number, such as 324, written in base 10, denoted [math]324_{10},[/math] is such that each digit has a place value, which, counting from the right, is 1, 10, 100, etc. So [math]324_{10}[/math] means [math]4\\times1+2\\times10+3\\times100.[/math] A logical way to extend this idea is to consider other bases, such as 5, for example, where the place value of each digit is a power of 5 instead of a power of 10. Starting with the rightmost digit of a base 5 number, the place values are 1, 5, 25, 125, etc. So [math]2244_5[/math] means [math]4\\times1+4\\times5+2\\times25+2\\times125[/math] [math]=[/math] [math]4+20+50+250[/math] [math]=[/math] [math]324.[/math] Another way to extend the idea is to use other types of sequence besides a power series as the base. For example, using \u201cfactorial base\u201d numbers, you can find the nth permutation of a string.[4] You can even use the irrational number, [math]\\varphi[/math] (the golden ratio), as a number base![5] Or you can use the Fibonacci numbers as a base. Here\u2019s how that works\u2026 324 can be written as 2+34+55+233, the sum of four Fibonacci numbers. And since 34+55=89, you can also write 324 as the sum of non-consecutive Fibonacci numbers 2+89+233. As Zeckendorf proved, you can always find a sum equal to [math]n[/math] of non-consecutive Fibonacci numbers, and this is representation of [math]n[/math] is unique. So it forms the basis for \u201cbase-Fibonacci\u201d numbers. So [math]324=101000000010_{\\text{F}}.[/math] Since the Fibonacci numbers are nonconsecutive, you can string together a whole bunch of base-Fibonacci numbers, and indicate the end of each number by a pair of consecutive 1\u2019s, because two 1\u2019s together can\u2019t appear inside any number.

            "answer_text": "The Fibonacci series in known to have been created by Leonardo of Pisa or Leonardo Pisano in Italian.  The series goes like this: 1,1,2,3,5,8,13,21,34,\u2026 We get the next number by adding the last number by the previous number. We can create a spiral using these numbers. Now, something king blowing about this series is that if you divide any number that comes after 5 by the previous number, you'll get the quotient to be nearly equal to 1.618. This is not a terminating decimal number. The larger the number you take, more the decimal places you'll get. And the ratio becomes more and more accurate. This ratio is called golden ratio, represented as [math]\\Phi.[/math] What's with [math]\\Phi[/math]? This ratio can be found almost everywhere in nature. The number of petals in a flower 3,5,8\u2026, which are numbers of the Fibonacci series.  The seed heads of sunflowers spiral out in a way similar to the Fibonacci spiral. The seed pods on a pine one also spiral out the same way.  Snail shells, spiral galaxies, and hurricanes also follow the Fibonacci pattern.   The pattern can be found on our faces as well. Like the ratio of length of the eye to its breadth.  DNA molecule is 34 angstroms long and 21 angstroms for each full circle of its double helix spiral.  There are more places to find this fascinating ratio. I have only mentioned some. Image credit: Google Images. Hope this helps. ",

            "answer_text": "Well.Suppose, you're writing a computer program to search a sorted array for a particular value. Usually the best method to use is a binary search. But binary search assumes it's the same cost to read from anywhere in the array. If it costs something to move from one array element to another, and the cost is proportional to how many array elements you need to skip over to get from one element you read to the next,then Fibonacci search works better.this can apply to situations like searching through arrays that don't fit entirely in your computer's cache so it's generally cheaper to read near by elements that distant ones.
