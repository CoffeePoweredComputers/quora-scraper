            "answer_text": "Essentially you are exploring the difference between speed And velocity. Speed is a scaler number where is velocity is a vector including both direction and rate of travel In this case the speed is total distance traveled divided by time or 1000 m/13 seconds equals 77 m/s (note that since the time is given to only two places the speed is also rounded up from 76.9 to 77 By contrast, velocity equals net displacement per time. A vector going from 0 to the terminal point would be 1000-250 or 750 m in length, divided by 13 seconds equals 58 m/s due North ",
