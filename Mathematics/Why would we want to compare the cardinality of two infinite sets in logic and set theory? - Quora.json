            "answer_text": "Why would we want to compare the cardinality of two finite sets? The reasons are really the same. Perhaps you would want to see an concrete example of a situation where comparing the cardinality of two infinite sets reveals a significant fact. One such example was given by Georg Cantor, the father of the modern notion of cardinality, in the very first paper where he shown that there are infinite sets of different cardinality. Cantor proved that the set of Real numbers has greater cardinality than the Natural numbers, but shown that the set of Algebraic numbers has the same cardinality as the Naturals. Thus, he concluded that Transcendental number exists, a fact that was proven in great efforts only 25 years before by Joseph Liouville. to this day, Cantor proof is the only simple one known. ",

No, let\u2019s be serious now. One of the definitions of infinity is that it can be put into one-to-one correspondence with a subset of itself. Comparing the cardinality of two sets can help to identify that the set we\u2019re working with is indeed an infinite set. I\u2019m sure there are other reasons, but that one comes to mind quickly.
