Let's do, x^2 + ax - 2b = 0 (-2)^2 + a \u00d7 (-2) -2b = 0 4 - 2a +2b = 0 -2a + 2b = -4 2a - 2b = 4 a - b =2( equation 2) Now from equation 1 and equation 2 2a = 6 a = 3 b = 1 ",

Let the other one be x+k Then (x+2)(x+k) = x^2 +ax -2b Consequently, 2+k = a and 2k =-2b Therefore k=-b and 2-b = a We finally get a+b =2 . This is contradicted by the statement a+b =4 There is no solution and the polynomial must have been typed wrong !!! ",
