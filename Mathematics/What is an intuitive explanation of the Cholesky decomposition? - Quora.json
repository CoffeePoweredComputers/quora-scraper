            "answer_text": "I'm going to answer from the context of generating correlated random numbers (this is the most familiar use case, to me anyway). The problem is:  we need a random draw from an n-dimensional multivariate normal distribution with covariance matrix [math]A[/math].  We have [math]n[/math] independent random deviates drawn from [math]N(0,1)[/math].  What is a transformation matrix that we can multiply by? For any such matrix [math]M[/math], we must have [math]MM^T=A[/math], because the dot product of the [math]i^{\\rm th}[/math] and [math]j^{\\rm th}[/math] rows of [math]M[/math] must always equal [math]A_{ij}[/math].  This gives [math]n(n+1)/2[/math] constraints, and [math]M[/math] has [math]n^2[/math] elements, so there are many solutions. One thing we can do is to proceed inductively.  We start with an artificial constraint:  the first random output (call it [math]b_1[/math]) is to be completely controlled by the first deviate.  Then [math]M_{1j}=0[/math] for [math]j>1[/math], and [math]M_{11}^2=A_{11}[/math].  So now we know [math]M_{11}[/math]. Now the covariance between [math]b_1[/math] and [math]b_2[/math] is exactly [math]M_{11}M_{21}[/math].  So now we know [math]M_{21}[/math].  Now we add another artificial constraint, that [math]M_{2j}=0[/math] for [math]j>2[/math] (so that only the first two deviates contribute to [math]b_2[/math]).  Then we need [math]M_{21}^2+M_{22}^2=A_{22}[/math], and since we already know [math]M_{21}[/math], now we know [math]M_{22}[/math] as well. Now we continue working forward through successive [math]b_i[/math], which correspond to rows of [math]M[/math].  In each row we work from left to right, computing [math]M_{ij}[/math] for successive [math]j<i[/math].  (At each step we find the [math]M_{ij}[/math] which gives the correct value of [math]A_{ij}[/math], which is just an arithmetic problem because we know all the other contributors to [math]A_{ij}[/math] already.)  Then we assume [math]M_{ij}=0[/math] for [math]j>i[/math], and choose [math]M_{ii}[/math] to yield the correct value for [math]A_{ii}[/math]. At the end of this process [math]M[/math] is lower triangular because of the artificial constraints we added at each row.  That's the Cholesky decomposition. ",

            "answer_text": "Suppose (as required) that A is a symmetric, positive definite, n-by-n matrix. Then it can be viewed as giving an inner product on [math]\\mathbf{R}^n[/math] given by [math]\\langle v,w\\rangle:=v^\\mathrm{T}Aw[/math] where v and w are considered as column vectors. The (i,j)-entry of A is then the value of the inner product [math]\\langle e_i,e_j\\rangle[/math] with respect to some choice of basis [math]B=\\{e_1,\\dots,e_n\\}[/math]. If M is the matrix whose ith row is given by the coordinates of [math]e_i[/math], then [math]A=MM^\\mathrm{T}[/math]. To turn M into a lower-triangular matrix, use the Gram\u2013Schmidt process to turn B into an orthonormal basis. The change of basis matrix is a triangular matrix L (which if you do the process in the right order can be chosen as lower-triangular). Thus, M=LK, where the rows of K are the coordinates of the new orthornomal basis. Hence K is an orthogonal matrix, i.e. [math]KK^\\mathrm{T}[/math]=I. So, [math]A=MM^\\mathrm{T}=LK(LK)^\\mathrm{T}=LKK^\\mathrm{T}L^\\mathrm{T}=LL^\\mathrm{T}[/math] as desired. In other words, the answer is that a symmetric positive-definite matrix encodes an inner product on some lattice in [math]\\mathbf{R}^n[/math]. You can change the basis of this lattice using Gram\u2013Schmidt process to obtain the result. ",
