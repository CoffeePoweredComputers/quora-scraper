            "answer_text": "Sausage machines. Think of the process of getting from the first number to the result of 940 as a sausage making machine. 940 is the sausage, the end product. With a sausage machine, you start with some meat, add some things to it, whizz it about a bit then out comes a sausage. I'm sure you're now thinking that I've lost the plot, but bear with me please\u2026 So, let's imagine the meat going into our sausage machine is the number we started with. What are the stages in our number/sausage machine? Our meat/number goes inWe add 50We times it by 4.5Boom! Out comes the sausage, I mean the number 940.Right then, how the hell do we get from our sausage (940) to the meat (the number we started with). We just put the sausage machine in reverse. Everything happens in reverse. The reverse of step 2 is subtracting 50, and the reverse of step 3 is dividing by 4.5, the reverse of step 4 is 940 going in. So the process in reverse is: 4. 940 goes in 3. Divide by 4.5 2. Subtract 50 1 our number comes out So 940\u00f74.5 -50 = meat. ",
