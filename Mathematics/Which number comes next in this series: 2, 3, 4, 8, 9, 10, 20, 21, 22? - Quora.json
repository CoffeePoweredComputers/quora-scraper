            "answer_text": "An obvious answer is 44 (= 22*2). But 44 is not the only answer. for example, the series may obey the following rule, Ax = (x - 2) (x - 3) (x - 4) (x - 5) (x - 6) (x - 7) (x - 8) (x - 9) * (1/20160) + (x - 1) (x - 3) (x - 4) (x - 5) (x - 6) (x - 7) (x - 8) (x - 9) * (-1/1680) + (x - 1) (x - 2) (x - 4) (x - 5) (x - 6) (x - 7) (x - 8) (x - 9) * (1/360) + (x - 1) (x - 2) (x - 3) (x - 5) (x - 6) (x - 7) (x - 8) (x - 9) * (-1/90) + (x - 1) (x - 2) (x - 3) (x - 4) (x - 6) (x - 7) (x - 8) (x - 9) * (1/64) + (x - 1) (x - 2) (x - 3) (x - 4) (x - 5) (x - 7) (x - 8) (x - 9) * (-1/72) + (x - 1) (x - 2) (x - 3) (x - 4) (x - 5) (x - 6) (x - 8) (x - 9) * (1/72) + (x - 1) (x - 2) (x - 3) (x - 4) (x - 5) (x - 6) (x - 7) (x - 9) * (-1/240) + (x - 1) (x - 2) (x - 3) (x - 4) (x - 5) (x - 6) (x - 7) (x - 8) * (11/20160) Ax is the xth item of the series. Thus the next number (A10) will be 443 instead of 44. Of course, the large sum here can be changed. In conclusion, whatever number you want, it can be the number coming next. ps. there may be some errors when calculating. ",

            "answer_text": "In this particular series the pattern followed here is number plus one then answer plus one then answer multiplied by two . like as follows : a+1=b b+1=c c*2=d In this case the a=2 so we add one to two and get b=3 then add one again to get c=4 then maltiply by two to get eight and the rest . So the next number after twenty two will be fourty four cause after multiplying ten to get twenty we add one to get twenty one then add one again to get twenty two then multiply it by two to get fourty four : 10*2 =20 20+1=21 21+1=22 22*2=44 \u201cIf by any case lm wrong I'm sorry for the inconvenience l really love maths so to me l took this question as a challenge and answered to get experience .Im just in grade 7.\u201d ",
