            "answer_text": "Let us consider the first horse the man bought at RS x/- and he sold it with a loss of 23% i.e. his sale price is RS 0.77x/- The buying cost of the second horse is Rs. 1550-x . As he sold it at 27% profit , sale price of this second horse is Rs. 1.27*(1550-x) So, total sale cost for the two horses is Rs. 0.77x+ 1.27(1550-x) As the man has neither gain nor loss the total sale price is equal to the buying cost of the two horses i.e. , Rs. 1550 . So, 0.77x+1.27(1550-x) = 1550. By solving we get the buying cost of the two horses as x and 1550-x ",

            "answer_text": "Let first horse cost x , so second horse cost 1550-x. Now loss in first is .23x and gain on second horse is .27(1550-x) as he got MO gain or loss means loss on first is equal to gain on second. Hence .23x=.27(1550-x) or .5x=..27*1550 or x=1550*27/50=837. So cost of horse are Rs837 and Rs.713 respectively. ",
