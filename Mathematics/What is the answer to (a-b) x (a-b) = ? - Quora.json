            "answer_text": "it depends on what a and b are.What is the question? (a -b ) x ( a - b ) = (a - b ) x ( a - b )\u2026.. no more and no less and nothing else!if you are looking to express ( a - b ) x ( a - b ) in terms of other expressions such as a squared, b square and a times b, say so explicitlyTake many different values for a and b such as 0, 1, -1, 2, -2, 3, -3, 4, -4, 5, -5, etc., etc in many differing combinations and see if you can find a pattern in what ( a - b ) squared is, so that you can find a general rule to usewhat does ( a - b ) squared have to do with ( a - b ) x ( a - b )? The answer to this is very important! Is or should it be the same as ( b - a ) squared or ( b -a ) x ( b - a )? What do those two expressions have to do with each other?Draw a square of side a. Draw a square of side b interior to it so that you then have a side of ( a - b ) also making a square inside the square of side a, and make the drawing also show two rectangles of sides b and a. Write an equation relating a squared, b squared and the two rectangles of side a x b. Can you see how to rearrange the various expressions so that you can find a general rule for what ( a- b ) squared must equal, in this and every instance of whatever a and b are?you\u2019re done! ( wait! Go back to #4 and see if the general rule you discovered works in EVERY case)use the Distributive law of Multiplication over addition (and subtraction) to discover the answer. Compare your result here with # 6. Are they the same? Should they be? If so why? If not, why not?",

Afterwards you should try it out with (a+b)(a-b) and (a+b)(a+b)/(a+b)2 too! The results are always as follow: (FORMULA MEMORISATION METHOD) (a+b) x (a+b) = (a+b)2 = a2 + 2ab + b2 (a+b) x (a-b) = a2 \u2013 b2 ",
