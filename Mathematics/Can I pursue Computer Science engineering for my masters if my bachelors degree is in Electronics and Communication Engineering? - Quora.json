            "answer_text": "Yes you can. Even when we do ECE in India, we are taught programming in it as well. And both ECE and CS are disciplines which are not that apart. Just put in a good SOP, mentioning how your interest grew in the Computer Science domain (be specific to a particular domain like ML, Software, Programming, AI, ComputerVision etc.). And how the course at the university will help you build your skills. Just to give you an idea of the content of your SOP, please find below a document curated by me.  Hope this helps!
