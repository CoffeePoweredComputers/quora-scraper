            "answer_text": "Thanks for the A2A, Harikirtan. Your original equation to solve for x: x \u2013 x\u00b2 = x\u00b2 \u2013 x Add x\u00b2 on both sides to clear quadratic terms from one side x = x\u00b2 \u2013 x + x\u00b2 x = 2x\u00b2 \u2013 x Subtract x on both sides to set the equation equal to zero. 0 = 2x\u00b2 \u2013 x \u2013 x 0 = 2x\u00b2 \u2013 2x Factor the equation by pulling out 2x, which is GCF(2x\u00b2, 2x) 2x\u00b2 \u00f7 2x = x2x \u00f7 2x = 1The equation, 0 = 2x\u00b2 \u2013 2x, factors into: 0 = 2x (x \u2013 1) Use the zero product rule (if A * B = 0, then either A or B = 0) by setting each factor to zero and solve for x in each factor. In this case, let 2x = 0 and let x \u2013 1 = 0, separately.2x = 0 x = 0 \u00f7 2x = 0 is a solutionx \u2013 1 = 0 x = 0 + 1x = 1 is also a solutionThere are two possible values for x in this equation: x = 0 or x = 1 Hope it helps! ~ Aaron Chao ",

What is the solution to x \u2013 x\u00b2 = x\u00b2 \u2013 x? x \u2013 x\u00b2 = x\u00b2 \u2013 x Re-arrange the terms, putting all terms on one side equal to 0 on the other side. ( 2x^2 \u20142x ) = 0Divide thru by 2 2. ( x^2 - x ) = 0 Factorise 3. x\u2022(x - 1 ) = 0 4. Answer. x = 0, or x = 1. These values will make one bracket equal to 0, hence the equation will equal 0. Therefore the two values of x are those values that give 0 inside at leat one one of the brackets. Check. Put the values into the equation 4. x = 0 ==> (0)\u2022(0\u20131) = 0. Jack Blake ",
