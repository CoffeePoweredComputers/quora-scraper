            "answer_text": "Why is any number multiplied by one, the same number? We can start to understand multiplication as repeated addition [math]^{[a]}[/math]. Thus: [math]3\\times 4=\\underbrace{4+4+4}_{\\text{3 times}}[/math] or symmetrically: [math]3\\times 4=\\underbrace{3+3+3+3}_{\\text{4 times}}[/math] In general, for [math]n,m\\in\\mathbb{N}[/math] we have: [math]n\\times m=\\underbrace{m+m+\\ldots +m}_{\\text{n times}}[/math] and [math]n\\times m=\\underbrace{n+n+\\ldots +n}_{\\text{m times}}[/math] Setting [math]n=1[/math], we get: [math]1\\times m=\\underbrace{m+m+\\ldots +m}_{\\text{once}}=m[/math] or [math]1\\times m=\\underbrace{1+1+\\ldots +1}_{\\text{m times}}=m[/math] I hope that helps.  [math]^{[a]}[/math] This works great for Natural Numbers of course - it does generalise with a bit of thought as well ",

            "answer_text": "Very Interesting question. To answer this, lets first understand what multiplication really is: The way I was taught is what multiplication of two numbers, M x N means is having M groups of the N number of things. For example if you have M boxes of N number of eggs in it, the total number of eggs you\u2019d have is M x N. Multiplication is scaling. When you want to make something proportionally bigger or smaller, that's multiplication. Coming back to your question. Applying similar concept to it, lets suppose you have 2 boxes each containing an egg. Therefore the total number of eggs you\u2019d have is amount of boxes (M) multiplied by the number of eggs in each one (N). So, 2 (boxes) each having (x) 1 (egg) = 2 x 1 =2. Hope this helps. ",
