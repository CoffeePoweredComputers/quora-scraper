            "answer_text": "Is the function f(x) =x concave up, concave down, or does it have no concavity? We don\u2019t usually worry about this. Informally it is neither convex, nor concave from either direction. However we define a convex function to be one for which all points on a line segment joining two points on the graph lie on or above the graph. So a function with a straight line graph is convex. It is not strictly convex; strictly implies that the inequality is strict except at the end points of the line segment. ",
