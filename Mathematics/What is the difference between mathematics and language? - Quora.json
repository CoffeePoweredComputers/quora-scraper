            "answer_text": "Language and mathematics both have canonical properties - that means things that are always true about them and help define them. Some of their properties overlap, and some of them are independent. Shared Canonical Properties Arbitrariness - In English, \u201cwhale\u201d means the big sea mammal we all know and love. But it could have been \u201cbaleine\u201d instead, as it is in French. Our words might as well be anything and they would still work. In math, you can name a variable [math]x[/math] or [math]q[/math] and the formula works the same.Duality - Units of meaning are made up of smaller parts. In language, words are made of sounds while signs (in sign language) are made up of finger and hand movements and positions. In Math, numbers are made up of digits and complex summation and integral symbols have many parts organized positionally.Systematicity - There are rules about what is acceptable and what isn\u2019t. I\u2019m not talking \u201cmean grammar teacher.\u201d I mean in English, \u201cCat mat on is the\u201d isn\u2019t a sentence, while everyone can agree \u201cThe cat is on the mat\u201d is fine. In Math, this is even more so true.Structure Dependence - In English \u201cMy sister licked the cat\u201d means something different from \u201cThe cat licked my sister.\u201d In Math, [math]x + 2 = 4[/math] means something different from [math]x + 4 = 2[/math].Productivity - You can improvise, be creative, and invent things. Tolkein can decide that \u201cent\u201d means a tree that can walk and speak, and when I look at a cloud I can say it looks like any animal that strikes my fancy. In math, you can decide that [math]\\sqrt{-1}[/math] is represented by [math]i[/math].Language-only Properties Displacement - Language lets you talk about things that aren\u2019t here, or things in the past or future. Mathematics itself doesn\u2019t refer to physical things at all, even though it employed by physical descriptions. It is only a formalized subset of physics, for example.Cultural Transmission - As far as we know, you can\u2019t pass along values and stories without language, and you can\u2019t teach language without instilling values and telling stories. Language and culture are completely intertwined. In contrast, the same mathematical ideas have been discovered completely independently by different civilizations with no cultural sharing whatsoever.Math-only Properties Well-definedness - What is a \u201cgame\u201d? What is \u201cart\u201d? It can be hard to nail down words, and sentences can be even worse. In Math, stating something without defining it is just as bad as saying \u201cCat mat on is the.\u201d Utter gibberish. The bar is incredibly high for mathematical definitions - there must be absolutely no ambiguity whatsoever.Propositional Truth Value - \u201cThis sentence is a lie\u201d has caused many headaches over the centuries. In modern mathematics, every statement is either true or false; paradoxes are not allowed.There are also non-canonical properties unique to language and math. For example, human communication and art are often language-mediated. Math, on the other hand, may exist independent of civilization and intelligence. Properties like these don\u2019t serve to separate them in definition, but they do separate them in our perception. In conclusion, math and language have lots of similarities, but they have several fundamental differences. They are siblings. ",

            "answer_text": "One item not mentioned is that there are a large number of things that mathematics look at and organize to form several systems in which generalizations can be formulated. There are some general categories in which questions are asked==numbers; lines, planes, and space, calculus. Linguists look at a large number of things and organize them in systems called languages. In the systems of a language there are subsystems, grammar, phonology, and semiotics (how physical things have a psychological meaning). Mathematics is applied to physics, engineering, and statistical analysis that describes quality assurance and global warming. There are subdisciplines as number theory, complex numbers, geometry. Linguistics is applied to teaching languages with subdisciplines of neurolinguists, psycholinguistics, and sociolinguistics. There are metamathematical discussions as there are metalinguistic discussions. There is little similarity in the subdisciplnes. I just point out that they exist. There is a merge of linguistics and mathematical ideas called mathematical linguistics. Computer languages are called \u201clanguages\u201d although they are not strictly languages since it is only a way to talk to a computer. With the advent of computers and great power to organize and analyze, I would like to see analyses of linguistic data to show the differences in use among certain people. For example,, another question asks about use of \u201cmyself\u201d which is currently not acceptable in certain situations. A long term analysis could show how the word has increased use among certain groups at certain times. But that would require a lot of data, and perhaps technology would make that an easier activity. One of the generalizations that has come up in the past is \u201cZipf\u2019s law\u201d which says that frequent words are shorter, and secondarily, if a word becomes frequently used, it will probably be shortened. There has been some study, but with computers (and computer languages), perhaps more could be done. In some ways, linguistics and mathematics are similar, but those similarities are not on the surface. People call mathematics the language of science. Linguistics is an observational science. The differences are more obvious and more numerous, just like many other spheres of life. ",
