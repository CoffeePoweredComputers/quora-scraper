            "answer_text": "As others have noted, the standard interpretation of your question leads to an incorrect statement. Some authors use the notation you have for \u201c[5]\u201d to represent the set of all multiples of 5 (primarily in older sources). Thus they would write this to mean n\u2208{0,5,10,15,20,\u2026}n\u2208{0,5,10,15,20,\u2026}. But even then the statement is false, e.g. when n = 10, 5n\u22121=495n\u22121=49, which is not divisible by 4. ",

            "answer_text": "First, show that it is true for a base case : When n = 1, 5n -1 = 4, which is divisible by 4 Next, show that if it true for n, it is true for n+1. 5(n+1) - 1 = 5n + 5 -1 = [5n-1] + 5. The first term is divisible by 4, the next is not. The proof is invalid. Test - n = 3; 5n - 1 = 14. Not divisible by 4. ",
