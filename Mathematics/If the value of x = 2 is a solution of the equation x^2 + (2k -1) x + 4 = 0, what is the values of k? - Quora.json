            "answer_text": "Vieta\u2019s rules tell us how the roots of a polynomial are related to the coefficients. A polynomial with the coefficient 1 in the highest degree term ( often called the leading term ) is called monic. Monic polynomials are simplest to work with in conjunction with Vieta\u2019s rules, because they don\u2019t require division by the leading coefficient for all other coefficients. For a monic quadratic, such as the present equation, Vieta\u2019s rules take a simple form:\u00a0\u00a0x2\u00a0\u2212\u00a0x\u2219\u2211\u00a0+\u00a0\u03a0\u00a0=\u00a00\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0x2\u00a0\u2212\u00a0x\u2022\u2211\u00a0+\u00a0\u03a0\u00a0=\u00a00\u00a0, where\u00a0\u2211\u00a0\u00a0\u2211\u00a0is the sum of the roots, and\u00a0\u03a0\u00a0\u00a0\u03a0\u00a0is the product of the roots. Given that x = 2 is a root, then\u00a0\u03a02\u00a0=\u00a042\u00a0=2\u00a0\u00a0\u03a02\u00a0=\u00a042\u00a0=2\u00a0is the \u201cother\u201d root. Which, in this case, happens to be the same value. Thus,\u00a0\u2211\u00a0=\u00a01\u22122k\u00a0=\u00a02\u00a0+\u00a02\u00a0=\u00a04\u00a0\u00a0\u2211\u00a0=\u00a01\u22122k\u00a0=\u00a02\u00a0+\u00a02\u00a0=\u00a04\u00a0 and k = -3/2 . ",
