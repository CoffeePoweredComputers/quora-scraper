            "answer_text": "The ratio of the present ages of two boys is 7:9. Let the rational between present ages of two boys be x. Thus the ages of the boys are 7x and 9x. If the ratio of their ages after 4 years will be 4:5, In 4 years from now their ages will be (7x+4) and (9x+4). The ratio between their ages (7x + 4) / (9x + 4) = 4 / 5 Cross multiplication 4 (9x + 4) = 5 (7x + 4) 36x + 16 = 35x + 20 36x - 35x = 20 - 16 x = 4 The rational is 4, this their respective ages One boy = 7x = 7 \u00d7 4 = 28 years Other boy = 9x = 9 \u00d7 4 = 36 years Thus the present ages of two boys are 28 years and 36 years. Answer the present ages of two boys are 28 years and 36 years ",

            "answer_text": "Look at a solution without algebra Ratio of Present age = 7:9 Ratio after 4 years = 4:5 = 8:10 Now, look at the difference between numerator & denominator in both ratios. It is 2 in both cases. Take difference of numerators of both ratios & denominators of both ratios. It is 1 in both cases. => For a gap of 1 year, present ages would be 7 & 9. If gap is 4 years, present ages would be 7x4 & 9x4 => 28 & 36 years Some food for thought for mathematics lovers who are addicted to algebra. Find out why the above method works everytime without fail. :-) ",
