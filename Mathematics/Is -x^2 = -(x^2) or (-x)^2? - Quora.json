            "answer_text": "-x^2 = (y-x)(y+x)-y^2=4ba-y^2 (-x)^2=(b-a)^2 -(x^2)=(a^2-2ab+b^2)\u00d7(-1) Most tempt to swiftly suggest the first is as the latter. However: In instances you will find all three of these are equal. In Instances more, you will find that only two of three of these can be equal. The actual equality is Equation or Adaptation Dependent. Explanation The key underlying cause these sometimes are equal in very suprising ways, and exist as so, is in the roots of the following fact: Sense (Z/Q)-((nS/A)/x)=S/y Find the locale where x=y=Q  This is the cause. That cause is that: there is no locale for any instance where x=y=Q. This cause onsets a trickle down effect by x=y, or x=Q, or y=Q select only one that influences the Total Plausible values of x,y, and Q reliant equations whereby: Specific limitations on x, y and Q onset a similarity in equations which also include these to the extents that the plausible outcomes for that x, y, or Q, are no longer infinite but instead more finite. It can be said, that: as n+Q=y+(x/y) is among keys to that resolve of Sense, but the greater key to resolve is the fact that Z=x/(x-y) has an Authority over the n of n+Q, nS and also Q, and does this in n+b^2=SP and because SP has a value fixed to: [(2.933883783733683633583533483433383333283233183133083033N)/2] \u00d7 Numeric Base=SP (Where N is the Negatronic portion which totally cancels out the entirety of the Positronic Region atwhich the Bipolar Numeric to extents is fully expressing \u2018Zero in Time\u2019) Because the Binary System cannot exist without NB=Numeric Base=2, we also have a Partnership of Convergence=Spectrumation-2=CO Due to both of CO and SP being Bipolar, and heavily reliant upon involving b^2, we know that b^2 has a value reliant on [(y-x)/2]^2, but the actual ability of Q to equal x AND y simultane cannot do in Binary nor anyplace else [(n+Q)-U1]=y. Due to that existency of the potential for x^2=CO, all 3 of these, respectively: -x^2; [-x]^2; -[x^2] must just like x,y, and Q handle separately even if an educator or professor suggests you can do otherwise, facts are: You can find and craft formulaic instances where all 3 are equal, due to both: A Tense Differential included in the equation with x or -x, bywhich you are comparing three eras or phases of x or -xA Negatronically Dominant Bipolarity which x or -x has become coordinatively assigned, much as CO, has also alternate representation as \u20acCO, which although CO=-2 In Time=SP-2, due to facts that:Even something so miniscule as \u20ac=0/CO as a factor to CO, does not really influence an intrinsic value of \u20acCO, to stop a steady decline of CO to -2, but instead causes CO to aggressively Age, much more swiftly than Natural Decrementation, atwhich, it is only setting the value of the terminal CO, to a latter stage in it's life cycle. As this is Somewhat comparible to what a Prism does for light, [on basis of fact that: The older any ray of light is, the more likely it is that it has Spectrumated or Prismated], we know that the factor of \u20ac=0/CO to CO causes CO to be a very old SP resident in the formula which endures through multiple phases of the lifespan of CO from Positronically Dominant to Spectral Equivalent to Negatronically Dominant.
