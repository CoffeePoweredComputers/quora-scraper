By sine rule:- a/sinA. = b/sinB = c/sinC. or, a/sin 40\u00b0 = b/sin 60\u00b0 = c/sin80\u00b0. Now, a/sin40\u00b0 = c/sin80\u00b0. or, c = a.sin80\u00b0/sin 40\u00b0 = a.(2.sin 40\u00b0.cos40\u00b0)/sin40\u00b0. = 2a.cos40\u00b0. or, c = 2a.cos 40\u00b0. \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026(1) Also , b/sin60\u00b0 = c/sin80\u00b0. or, c = b.sin 80\u00b0/sin 60\u00b0. = (2b/\u221a3).sin 80\u00b0\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.(2) From eqn.
