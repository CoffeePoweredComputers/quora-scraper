            "answer_text": "By default, no. However, an order can be given to a set. The joy is that we can give it any order we please. Let\u2019s take the set of Truth-Values: [math]\\{\\mathsf{True}, \\mathsf{False}\\}[/math]. We can decide that [math]\\mathsf{True} > \\mathsf{False}[/math], and that gives us everything we need to define a Boolean Algebra over it. Likewise, we have a set of Natural Numbers. The set is unordered, but if we desire, we can decide to give them an order. We don\u2019t even have to give them the order you normally think of.  So, let\u2019s talk a minute about what we call things with and without an order. A set with equivalence is called an Equivalence Class. A set with order is more complicated, because we have to talk about whether or not it\u2019s a partial or total order. A set with a partial order is a partially ordered set (called a \u201cposet\u201d), and a set with a total order is called a totally ordered set (there is no cute name for it). Not everything has to be comparable. Think about genealogy. The order relation may be \u201care you a descendant of?\u201d If you compare yourself and your parents, there is an ordering there. However, you cannot order yourself against your cousins. If everything can be compared, it\u2019s a totally ordered set. If not, it\u2019s a poset.  So, let\u2019s compare some containers, like sets. If I have a set of things that are finite and totally ordered, then I have what\u2019s called an ordered list (sometimes also a tuple in programming). It\u2019s usually written with round brackets (parentheses) instead of curly brackets. There are also sets that can contain many of the same elements. These are frequently called \u201cbags\u201d, and we\u2019d see something like: [math]\\{\\{2 A, 3 B, 1 C\\}\\}[/math]. Meanwhile, sets do not require an order, are finite or infinite, and do not distinguish between duplicates (i.e. sets answer the question, \u201cis this included or not?\u201d). ",

            "answer_text": "The concept \u201cset\u201d is so general that your question is too vague to answer definitely. The are ordered sets (like the whole numbers) and there are sets without an ordering, like any random collection of objects or concepts. As well, there are different kinds of ordering relations \u2014- such as complete (any two objects can be compared as any two integers with the relation \u201cless than\u201d) or partial (in which some objects cannot be so compared, as with the set relation \u201csubset of\u201d) and probably others which a more knowledgeable correspondent could cite.
