            "answer_text": "Friends\u2026! The age of A and B are in the ratio of 9: 4. Let the rational between between ages of A and B be x Thus the respective present ages of A is 9x and of B is 4x Seven years hence, the ratio of their ages will be 5 : 3. Seven years hence, their ages will be. A's age 9x + 7 and B's age 4x +7. Their ratio 9x + 7 / 4x + 7 = 5/3 Cross multiplication 3 (9x +7) = 5 (4x + 7) 27x + 21 = 20x + 35 27x - 20x = 35 - 21 7x = 14 x = 14/2 x = 2 The rational is 2. Thus their respective ages A's present age 9x = 9 \u00d7 2 = 18 years B's present age 4x = 4 \u00d7 2 = 8 years Answer the present age of A is a 18 years and present age of B is 8 years ",

How old will they be in seven years? 18+7 = 258 + 7 = 15The ratio between 25 and 15 is equal to the ratio between 5 and 3Don\u2019t just copy my answer to your paper.
