            "answer_text": "Well it\u2019s going to being confusing for most people (realistically speaking), isn\u2019t it? It\u2019s going to confuse everybody. The United States is such a big country you know\u2026 Remember, it has just under 330 million people, making it the 3rd most populated country in the entire world. It wouldn\u2019t be as easy as say New Zealand, which Metricated in 1969, but only had a population of 2.8 million people. Especially things like Gasoline and Speed Limits\u2026 A Liter has quite a less significant value than a Gallon does, so people would be under filling their automobiles with gas. Same as speed limits\u2026 1 Kilometer is about 3/5 of a Mile, so people would be traveling well under the speed limit in their Automobiles. But think about it\u2026 At the same time, the U.S. has been using Metric for Scientific purposes for quite a few years, companies like NIST and NASA since the early 1990\u2019s.Food package labeling is in both dual Metric and U.S. Customary units, and has been so since around the mid 1990\u2019s. Fat, Carbohydrates, and Protein are measured by the Gram, and energy by the Kilocalorie (KCal).2 Liter bottles have been used in the United States since the early 1970, for sodas like Coca-Cola, and have mostly replaced Fluid Ounces, Quarts, and Gallons, for that same purpose.U.S.A. Track & Field has been metric for quite a few years now, reporting distances for sprints and dashes in meters, and high jump heights in meters.U.S. Automobile manufacturing has been using Metric since the early 1970\u2019s, giving engine displacements Liters instead of the older Cubic Inches.9 mm pieces. Go Figure!So think about it, America is actually more Metric already than you thought! ",

            "answer_text": "A miracle. Even the notion that the US is the only country in the world that hasn\u2019t standardized on using the SI system is meaningless to many (most?) Americans. They live in a splendid isolation from the rest of the world. They are oblivious to the fact that it costs a fortune to keep spare parts in metric sizes and customary sizes, and to produce those parts. They don\u2019t understand that the rest of the world is not waiting for products designed on the base of the customary system, greatly reducing the chance of exporting such products. It is a mind boggling stupidity to use two different systems at the same time, with all the adverse consequences. But you will never convince the majority of the Americans of this fact. The rest of the world did understand this, and changed. All the countries that once were part of the British empire changed from imperial to SI. They understood how silly it is to use a system of measurements that was perfect a few hundred years ago, but is absolutely silly to use in a time that we know how the forces of nature work and are connected to each other. That is the foundation of the SI system. Perhaps the age of enlightenment will once even reach the USA, but don\u2019t count on it. ",
