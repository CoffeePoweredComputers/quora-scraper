            "answer_text": "It would be a 5x5x5 stack of the smaller cubes. If you want to be sneaky, put the stack in a vat of oil and none of them will be exposed to air. Otherwise you also need to consider if those on the bottom are exposed to air. In any case, the calculation is easier if you count the number of internal cubes rather than trying to count the surface cubes. So, for instance, if the big cube is resting on an edge, then there are 3x3x3 internal cubes, 27 total, so 98 would be exposed to air. ",
