            "answer_text": "Let the length of the train = x meters Case 1st Total distance travelled by the train = x+120 Time taken = 17s Speed = (x+120)/17 Case 2nd Total distance travelled = 70 + x Time taken = 12s Speed =( 70+ x)/12 Speed is same in both the case so (X+120)17=(x+70)/12 12x + 1440 = 17x + 1190 1440\u20131190=17x - 12x 5x = 250 x = 50m So Speed =( 120+50 )/ 17 Speed = 170/17 Speed = 10m/s I hope this will help you\u2026.
