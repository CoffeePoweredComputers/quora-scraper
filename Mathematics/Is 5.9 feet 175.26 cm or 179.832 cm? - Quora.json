            "answer_text": "This appears to be an issue of understanding decimal feet notation vs feet and inches notation 5\u20329\u2033 is not the same as 5.9 ft because 0.9 ft is equal to 10.8 inches. If you mean 5\u20329\u2032, that is 5.75 ft in decimal notation If you mean 5.9 ft, that is 5 ft 10.8 inches and ft & inches notation In any case, the foot is defined as 30.48 cm, and the inch as 2.54 cm TL,DR: 179.832 cm which should be rounded to the precision of the initial number, as 180 cm.

            "answer_text": "175.26 equals 5 and 9 inches. the problem with the internet converter most people use is, when they put in 5.9, it converts 5 feet and 90% or .9 of a foot, not 9 inches. There are 12 inches in a foot, not 10. Therefore in the calculator if you wan\u2019t to know how much is 5\u20329 inches you need to put in 5.75 feet or 5 feet 3/4 or 9/12 -ths. ",
