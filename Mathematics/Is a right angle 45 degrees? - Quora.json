            "answer_text": "An angle can be right or wrong. Although such assessment might depend on the referee criteria - moral values, ethics, legislation. But once that frame of judgement is established, the angle may be deemed right if it agrees with such set of rules and wrong otherwise. Obsviously, this comes down to \u201crelativity\u201d. Knowledge, intelligence and wisdom all play a role at interpretation here. But also emotions, motivations, honesty. Unfortunately, many times the \u201crule of the crowd\u201d can supercede fairness due to strength in numbers; leading even to breaking of the rules. As a final remark, we must not neglect to acknowledge the well known \u201crule of the victory\u201d and the most deceiving \u201crule of the false appearence\u201d. ;-) P.S.: An orthogonal angle is 90 degrees, or \u201cpi\u201d/2 radians, or 100 grads.
