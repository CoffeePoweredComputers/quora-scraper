            "answer_text": "Mathematical and theoretical biology is a branch of biology which employs theoretical analysis, mathematical models and abstractions of the living organisms to investigate the principles that govern the structure, development and behavior of the systems, as opposed to experimental biology which deals with the conduction of experiments to prove and validate the scientific theories.The field is sometimes called mathematical biology or biomathematics to stress the mathematical side, or theoretical biology to stress the biological side. Mathematical biology aims at the mathematical representation and modeling of biological processes, using techniques and tools of applied mathematics and it can be useful in both theoretical and practical research. Describing systems in a quantitative manner means their behavior can be better simulated, and hence properties can be predicted that might not be evident to the experimenter. This requires precise mathematical models. If you were to say study any of the above mentioned fields you would be called a mathematical biologist.

Such arrangements have been noticed since the Middle Age and can be used to make mathematical models of a wide variety of plants.
