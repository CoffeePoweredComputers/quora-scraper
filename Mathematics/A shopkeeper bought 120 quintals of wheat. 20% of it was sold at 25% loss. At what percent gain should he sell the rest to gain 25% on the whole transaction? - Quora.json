            "answer_text": "This can be done orally without using a pen , paper, or a calci . 20% of 120=120/5=24 . While making a 25% loss means he lost the value of 24/4= 6 quintals. So he got the cost price of 24\u20136=18 quintals (inf 1) And he is left with 120\u201324=96 qntls to sell . (inf2) To get a 25% gain on the whole transaction, he should get the value of 120 x 1.25 = 150 quintals. Of the 150 quintals , he has already recd the value of 18 quintals \u2026 ( see inference 1). So he needs to get the value of 150\u201318=132 qntls from the remaining 96 qntls\u2026\u2026 ( inference 3). So he should sell the remaining 96 quntls for the cost of 132 qntls, or each qntl should be sold for 132/96 = 11/8 of the cost of one quintal . So he should make a profit of 11/8\u20131=3/8 of its cost , or 3/8 x 100 = 37.5% profit on the remaining 96 quintals . // ",
