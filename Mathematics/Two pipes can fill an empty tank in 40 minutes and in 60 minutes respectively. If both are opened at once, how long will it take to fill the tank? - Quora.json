            "answer_text": "For all such questions,even for n pipes.. Step1..think unit time work each.. IE what amount one alone can fill in unit time.. IE 1/40 part n other 1/60. Similarly if n pipes till 1/n(i) Step2..what if all work for unit time ie sum of all unit.. IE (1/40+1/60) =(60+40)/60*40=1/24 part if both works for unit time.. Similarly if n pipes.. (1/40)+(1/60)+. +..+\u2026..till 1/n(i)..let it be m/n Step3..now it's child play.. U know part per unit time ie filled by all.. So to fill full part (IE 1) =whole part /part per day=1/(1/24)=24 days.. ie your answer... If for n pipes, simply it's 1/(m/n)=n/m days.. Either that's is pipes, labour or whatever ;such type problems are solved in similar ways.. ",

Now let tap A fill the tank in 40 minutes and tap B can fill the tank in 60 minutes. Let A and B be the flow rates of tap A and tap B respectively. And let t be the time taken to fill the tank Then . . . . A = 6000 L/40 mins A = 150 L/min B = 6000L/60 mins B = 100L/min Therefore, when both taps are on, the combined flow rate will be A + B = 150L/min + 100L/min A + B = 250L/min Time to fill tank . . . . t = 6000L / (250L/min) t = 24 minutes ",

After solving the above equation you will get (A / 24) which means in 1 minute it can fill 1/24 th part and to fill the complete tank it takes 24 minutes. Thank you. ",
