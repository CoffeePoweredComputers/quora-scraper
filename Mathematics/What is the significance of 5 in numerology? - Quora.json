            "answer_text": "As per Pythagoras - great father of Numerology, Number 5 is a number for enjoyments, freedom and adventure. It also brings our hidden desires which we have been missing in our lives to create a balance. It restores the confidence and makes you watch life from a different perspective. Even though the number is adventurous, it also has a vision and a motive which makes one going into the right direction. The positive side represents expression, versatility, mental curiosity, change, travel and good management of affairs. The negative side manifests itself as changeability, indecision, quickness to the point of thoughtlessness ad irresponsibility. ",
