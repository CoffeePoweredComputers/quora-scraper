By graphing your given circle, we get:  By analysing, we can conclude that  is  and radius . So the equation becomes:  This was the questioned equation\u2026 ",

            "answer_text": "When I went to school it was X minus 5 squared plus Y minus 6 squared equals 9. Quite obvious really if you know that a circle of radius 3 centred on the origin is x^2 + y^2 = 9. To shift the circle to (5,6) you change X to x-5 and y to y-6. It requires some practice and serious thought before you understand what you're really doing, but it's worth it. A degree in civil engineering earns you about 70,000 dollars annually these days. ",
