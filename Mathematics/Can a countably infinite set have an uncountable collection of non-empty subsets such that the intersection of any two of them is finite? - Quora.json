            "answer_text": "First: my mathematical intuition says no. All possible finite subsets of a countable set is countable. And, if we have [math]n[/math] (finite) sets, there are at most [math]\\frac12n(n+1)[/math] different intersections. Now, intuition is not proof. I have to either count them or show that no count will cover them all. So first two principles: Any subset of a countable set is countable (or finite).The Cartesian product of two countable sets is countable.A corollary of these two principles is that the overall union of a countable collection of countable elements is countable. And two lemmas I will prove: Lemma 1: all possible finite subsets of a contable set is countable. A countable set is either finite or isomorphic with the set of natural numbers. For finite sets the number of all possible subsets is finite. In the natural numbers every subset has a first element, and any finite subset has a last element. There is a countable set of combinations of first and last element (given principles 2 and 1), and the are finite many subsets that share the same first and last element, so by the corollary there are countably many finite subsets of natural numbers and so countably many finite subsets of any contable set. Lenma 2. Any collection of disjunct subsets of a countable set is countable Let [math]\\mathcal A[/math] be a collection of disjunct subsets of natural numbers. For any [math]n\\in\\bigcup_{A\\in\\mathcal A}A[/math] there is one and only one [math]A\\in\\mathcal A[/math] such as [math]n\\in A[/math]. So there is an application from a subset of natural numbers onto [math]\\mathcal A[/math], meaning that [math]\\mathcal A[/math] has countably many elements. And this holds for any countable base set.  So, the set of all possible interjections is countable (because all possible interjections is a subset of all possible finite subsets of our base countable set [math]U[/math]). Given interjection [math]C=A\\cap B[/math], then [math]A\\setminus C[/math] and [math]B\\setminus C[/math] are disjunct. So the set of all possible sets that pairwise would intersect as [math]C[/math] is equivalent to a collection of disjunct subsets of [math]U\\setminus C[/math]. This collection is therefore countable. So by our corollary, the collection of subsets of a countable set [math]U[/math] so that pairwise interjection is finite, is countable. ",
