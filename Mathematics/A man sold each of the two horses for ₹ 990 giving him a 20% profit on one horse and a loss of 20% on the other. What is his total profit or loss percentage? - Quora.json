What is his total profit or loss percentage?Let C1 & C2 denote cost-prices of two horses respectively.From above data we get following relations,(1 + 20/100)*C1 = 990 or C1 = 990/1.20 = 825 (\u20b9) \u2026\u2026 (1a)(1 - 20/100)*C2 = 990 or C2 = 990/0.80 = 1237.5 (\u20b9) \u2026\u2026 (1b)Hence from (1a) & (1b) we get,Total cost-price = 825 + 1237.5 = 2062.5 (\u20b9)Total sell-price = 990 + 990 = 1980 (\u20b9)Therefore overall loss percentage = 100*(2062.5 - 1980)/2062.5 = 4% [Ans]",

            "answer_text": "\u20b9990= 1.2 xC1, and also 0.80 x C2 ; where C1 and C2 are the costs of profit making and the loss making horses respectively. So C1=990/1.2 = 825 \u20b9 . Similarly C2= 990/0.8= 1237.5 \u20b9 So his total cost is 1237.5+825 = 2062.5 \u20b9 and he gets 990x2 = 1980 \u20b9 So he loses 2062.5 - 1980 = 82.5 \u20b9 . Now the %age loss is 82.5 x100/2062.5 =4% // ",
