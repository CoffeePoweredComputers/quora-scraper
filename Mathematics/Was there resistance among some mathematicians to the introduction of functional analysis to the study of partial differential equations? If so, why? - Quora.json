            "answer_text": "There is a strain of thought amongst some mathematicians, that \u201celementary\u201d proofs are more desirable than advanced ones. Here, the word elementary has a distinct colloquial meaning: it has nothing to do with how an easy a proof is. Rather it has to do with how abstract or built up of a theory is required to prove a simple statement. A very famous example of this was the search for an elementary proof of the prime number theorem, ultimately given by Paul Erdos. In this context, elementary meant without the use of complex analysis, which can be viewed as a step removed from the statement of the prime number theorem, which only references real numbers. Further, this philosophy went along with a general backlash against the French Bourbaki school. This group of mathematicians vigorously pursued abstraction for its own sake. I think other mathematicians reacted not only against abstraction itself, but also the idea that these mathematicians alone could be the spiritual leaders of mathematics. ",

            "answer_text": "In case of partial differential equation is basically come on solving mathematical physics. We use it heat conduction problem,many problem on quantum mechanics and several other branches of physics. There is a common study of abstract approach which provides Functional Analysis. Functional Analysis is studying in consideration of abstract space, which is defined. If we consider any operator which we use in P.D.E. are involved in functional analytical approach,our treatment will be easier for theoritical study. Adjoint operator,self adjoint operator are also follow Operator system of functional analysis. So Functional Analysis is a vast topic for Partial Differential Equation in study of abstract approach.
