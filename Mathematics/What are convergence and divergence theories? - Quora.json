            "answer_text": "What are convergence and divergence theories? Convergence is a property of a limiting process when the limit exists. Divergence is a property of a limiting process when the limit does not exist. Roughly (you need to look up the precise definition yourself) a limit exists if a value gets closer to a fixed value as some variable approaches another variable or approaches infinity. For example [math]\\frac{x^2\u20131}{x-1}[/math] is not defined when [math]x = 1[/math], but converges to [math]2[/math] as [math]x[/math] tends to [math]1[/math]. On the other hand, [math]\\frac1{x-1}[/math] diverges\u2014it doesn\u2019t tend to any limit as [math]x[/math] tends to [math]1[/math]. ",
