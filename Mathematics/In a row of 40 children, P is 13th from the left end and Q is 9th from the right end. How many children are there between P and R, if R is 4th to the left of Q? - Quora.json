            "answer_text": "Let us arbitrarily number the children from 1 to 40 starting on the right. P is 13th from the right therefore is assigned the number 13. Q is 9th from the right. We will assign the number 32 to Q. R is 4th to the left of Q. We will assign the number 28 to R. Calculating the number of children between P and R is equivalent to calculating how many numbers are between the number 13 and the number 28. We may naievilly say it is 15 since 28\u201313=15. That would be wrong. That total would include P or R. Therefore we must subtract 1 from our naive answer to get 14. Thus there are 14 children between P and R. ",
