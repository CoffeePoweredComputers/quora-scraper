But She Still Gained 20%\u2026So Selling price is .90x120%=1.08X So the Equation is 1.20X-30=1.08X Or .12X=30 X=30/.12=250rs. Now Lets Check- Cost price 250 She bought it @@10% less..so 250-10% of 250=225 Originally she Want to sell it at a profit of 20% on cost price =250\u00d7120%=300rs. But She sold it at 30rs. Less..so S.p=270 Profit %=270-225/225=20% So It's verified\u2026 ",

Therefore 1.2X -30 = 1.20 * 0.9X. Solving it (1.20 - 1.08)*X = 30 X = 30/ .12 = \u20b9250 she actually purchased for 225(10% less than 250) and sold it for \u20b9270(ie 1.2 of 250\u201330).Still she gained 20% of the actual purchase price. 270 is 1.20 times of 225. thanx ",
