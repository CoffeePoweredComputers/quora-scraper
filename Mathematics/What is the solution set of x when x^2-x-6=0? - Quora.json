            "answer_text": "Hi.this is indeed a very interesting question to answer..these types of questions are commonly asked in class 8 or 9 school examinations. for this question, you need to carry on the factorization method since you have learnt quadratic equations ,think about two such numbers which give you product as -6 and sum as -1 two such numbers are : -3 and 2 product of these two numbers :-3*2=-6 sum of these two numbers :-3+2=-1.which satisfies as to what we are finding so the factors can be written as follows, (x+3)(x-2)=0 you will have either x+3=0 giving you x=-3 or you will have x-2 =0 giving you x= +2. thus,x will take the values -3 or +2. hope you find this helpful!!!
