            "answer_text": "You may find it useful to pick up any textbook introduction to Algorithms and Complexity. Many of the paradigms introduced in such textbooks deal with graph problems, even if there\u2019s no explicit division of material into different parts of graph theory. We used Kleinberg and Tardos\u2019s Algorithm Design in my class. It seems from your mention of Tarjan\u2019s algorithm that your studies will be algorithmic in nature. That being the case, you\u2019d probably do well to learn general complexity analysis from a textbook like the above. Here\u2019s a list of popular texts you might try:Introduction to Algorithms, 3rd Edition (MIT Press): Thomas H. Cormen, Charles E. Leiserson, Ronald L. Rivest, Clifford Stein: 9780262033848: Amazon.com: Books Algorithms (4th Edition): Robert Sedgewick, Kevin Wayne: 8601400041420: Amazon.com: Books Algorithm Design: 9780321295354: Computer Science Books @ Amazon.com Is this project with a professor? Are you a math or computer science student? Are you going to be working with a computer science or math professor? Math and Comp Sci have different flavors of graph theory, so be wary of diving too deeply into something that isn\u2019t tailored to what your project deals with. ",
