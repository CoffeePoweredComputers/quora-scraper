            "answer_text": "There are many differential equations for which  is a solution. Perhaps the most obvious one is the result of differentiating both side of the equation:  of course you can then do that again, producing a second-order differential equation:  Then you can combine them in any way you want. Here\u2019s are a few simple sums:   and a subtraction:  Finally, if you want to get rid of both  and , you can divide:  And so on and so forth\u2026 ",
