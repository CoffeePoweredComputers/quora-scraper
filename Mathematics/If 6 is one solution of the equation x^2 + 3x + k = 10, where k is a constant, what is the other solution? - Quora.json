            "answer_text": "Here\u2019s the way I suspect you\u2019re supposed to answer the question: The most important thing to remember about a solution to an equation is that it is a value that makes the equation a true statement.  So if x = 6 is one solution, then replacing \u201cx\u201d with \u201c6\u201d in the equation will make a true statement. So you know 62+3(6)+k=1062+3(6)+k=10 is true. But if this is true, then k must be whatever value makes 62+3(6)+k=1062+3(6)+k=10 true. So k must be -44. This leads to the quadratic equation x2+3x\u221244=10x2+3x\u221244=10, or x2+3x\u221254=0x2+3x\u221254=0, which has solutions x = 6 or x = -9. OK, now here\u2019s the way you should solve it. If a, b are the solutions to a quadratic equation, then (x\u2212a)(x\u2212b)=x2\u2212(a+b)x+ab=0(x\u2212a)(x\u2212b)=x2\u2212(a+b)x+ab=0. So the negative of the x-coefficient is the sum of the two roots. So 3=\u2212(a+b)3=\u2212(a+b), where your two roots are a, b. Since you know one root (a = 6), you can find the other root by solving: 3 = -(6 + b), which gets you -9. ",
