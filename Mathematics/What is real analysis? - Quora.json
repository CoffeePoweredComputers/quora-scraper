            "answer_text": "Well, I think you've already got the definition of real analysis. I'll try to put to words my intuition and understanding of the same. Real Analysis is like the first introduction to \"real\" mathematics. It's more than just manipulating expressions and clever calculus tricks.The analysis of real numbers is an abstract concept. In my opinion, the most important theorem that makes Real Analysis so intricate is \"Between two real numbers, there is an infinitude of real numbers\"When I first encountered this, I thought it was really cool! Taking a first course in Real Analysis helps you see the abstract world of pure mathematics, you learn about the rigorous definition of limits, continuity and differentiability of real functions., you'll also encouter the notion of limit points and have a better(hopefully) understanding of what \"infinity\" really means. In real analysis, an infinity of different real numbers can fit into a set which is of measure 0!! It's the Cantor set!There are many more concepts which are exciting... but remember while doing pure mathematics you need to forget the physical world and just indulge in the rigor and precise mathematical intuition.Some people feel frustrated in doing this because they can't really see the connection between those abstract notions and the real world. Some even feel it's USELESS!Some people when they argue about why math is useful, they like to think of the practical applications and try to make it sound really important, but I Think it's not relevant what practical applications there are, because there's the whole of the universe except for our little civilisation, in my thoughts, I believe if you want to get closer to the absolute truth, then you need to study mathematics for its own sake because math is the language in which GOD has written the story of the universe.On that note, all the best for your study in analysis.

            "answer_text": "Real analysis is what I like to call \u201ccalculus with proofs.\u201d That is, the first real analysis courses one usually takes focus on proving all the main results you use in single and multivariable calculus, in far more detail than engineers would normally care about. In practice engineers often defer the nuts and bolts of why things work to the mathematicians, so now you have to do your due diligence to pick apart said nuts and bolts. As a result I found my first real analysis courses to be relatively intuitive because I already had a good idea of how to visualize some of the concepts at hand, particularly in one dimension. It escalates rapidly in difficulty and level of abstraction from there, once you start throwing in notions of topology and then the notion of a measure. You\u2019ll probably first see Riemann Integrals (remember left and right-hand sums?) and then see a much more powerful Lebesgue integral later on. Much of mathematics builds upon real analysis in some way, which explains why a semester is required for pretty much any undergraduate math degree. In my honest opinion, any such program should require two semesters, but that\u2019s a story for another time. You\u2019ll see real analysis should you want to study functional analysis, harmonic analysis, ordinary or partial differential equations, topology, probability, and nowadays, even disciplines that push into computer science such as machine learning and optimization. It also has a counterpart subject matter of complex analysis. I\u2019ve talked a bit about some books in both types of analysis in this article. ",
