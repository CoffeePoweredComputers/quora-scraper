            "answer_text": "Because you need at least 3 samples per signal period, to uniquely interpolate the original signal. (with regard to aperiodic signals, \u2018period\u2019 refers to the time period over which it has been time-limited)The reason for this is as follows: When you sample a signal, there are three variables(degrees of freedom) involved: The signal frequency/frequency spectrum. This determines the magnitude variation between the sample points.The sampling frequency. This determines the spacing between the sample points.The phase of the sampled signal. This determines the relative orientation of the sample points. For example, a cosine wave sampled at half its frequency, starting from the zero degree point, will have a peak followed by a trough, while a sampled sine wave will have a trough followed by a peak.To uniquely determine the original wave from three variables, we need three relations(constraints) between them. If the number of constraints are less than three, then the solution is not unique. Let\u2019s illustrate this, by considering a sinusoid of frequency [math]f[/math] sampled at a frequency [math]f_s[/math] : Case 1: [math]f_s\\leq f[/math] If sampling frequency is less than or equal to the max signal frequency, then there would be at most one sample in a period. This one sample constrains only one variable - the sampling frequency(the spacing between the samples). The other two variables - the signal frequency and the phase can be freely chosen - meaning that any signal, with any phase, sampled at the given frequency, can pass through those points.  Case 2: [math]f_s = 2f[/math] In this case, there are two samples per signal period. Now, consider two sinusoids, one of which has a frequency three times the other, as shown below:  As can be seen, in this case, there are constraints on two variables - the signal frequency(the magnitude variation between the points) and the sampling frequency(spacing between the points), but the third variable - phase can be freely chosen. As a result, a sine wave of 3 times the frequency, but phase shifted by 270 degrees, can perfectly pass through the points generated by sampling the original wave. Case 3: [math]f_s > 2 f[/math] In this case, there are at least three constraints on the sample points and only a signal, that: 1. Has the required spacing between the sample points.(Sampling frequency) 2. Has the required magnitude variation between the sample points(Signal frequency) 3. Has the required relative orientation of sample points(Signal phase), will pass through the generated sample points, enabling us to determine the original signal uniquely.

            "answer_text": "MThe proof is actually pretty simple, provided that you first understand the concept of \u201cfrequency domain\u201d representation of signals. Any time domain signal has a corresponding frequency domain representation. A time domain representation can be visualized as a graph which shows how the instantaneous value of a signal changes with time. It can be shown that such a signal can also be represented as a sum of sine waves, with each sine wave having a different frequency and amplitude. A graph showing the relative amount of each included sine wave is what\u2019s known as the frequency domain representation, and is also known as the \u201dspectrum\u201d of the signal. In such a graph, the horizontal axis represents frequency (of each sine wave), while the vertical axis represents relative amplitude of each frequency. The highest frequency included is known as the bandwidth of the signal. For a typical time domain signal of finite duration, the spectrum would appear as a \u201cblob\u201d in the frequency domain graph. The shape of the blob is unimportant to this discussion, however it will be symmetrical and centered at zero frequency on the frequency axis. (The frequency axis extends in both the positive and negative directions. The reason for this is beyond the scope of this discussion.) If you take such a signal and sample it, the spectrum of the sampled result has a very interesting relationship to that of the original signal. It will in fact include the \u201cblob\u201d representing the original signal, as well as multiple copies of this blob equally spaced in frequency. The spacing between the blobs is such that the distance (on the frequency axis) from the center of one blob to the center of the next blob is equal to the sampling frequency. Draw yourself a little picture of this before proceeding. (Very important!) Consider the fact that if you could somehow extract the lowest frequency blob from this mess and exclude all the rest, you would then have something that looks exactly like your original signal! This operation can be performed by a low-pass filter, which does exactly that. Now consider what would happen if you were to lower the sampling frequency a little bit. This means that all of the blobs would move a little closer together. As long as they are all distinct and separated, you can always recover your original signal with a low-pass filter. If you lower the sampling frequency further so that the blobs merge together, you can no longer observe the original blob intact, and therefore cannot filter it out. Now look at the case where the blobs just begin to touch each other. What frequency does this happen at? It\u2019s twice the highest frequency component of the blob, isn\u2019t it? Voila. ",

I believe the formula is kFs+/-F , where Fs is the sampling rate and F is max freq of the signal and K is the instants where you sample.  If you choose Fs < 2*Fmax you will never be able to retrieve the original signal, you will get images of it but not the actual signal(overlapping I mean).  Hope it helps ",
