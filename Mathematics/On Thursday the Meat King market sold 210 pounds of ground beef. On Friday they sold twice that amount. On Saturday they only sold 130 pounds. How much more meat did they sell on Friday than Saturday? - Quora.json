            "answer_text": "Well, to figure this whole question out, we first need to find out how much ground beef was sold on Friday. If Friday sold double Thursday\u2019s amount (210), we can multiply it by 2 and find that 420 pounds of ground beef were sold on Friday. The next part of the problem is figuring out how much more meat was sold on Friday than Saturday. Since we know 420 pounds of meat was sold on Friday, we can subtract Saturday\u2019s total (130) and find that 290 more pounds of meat were sold on Friday than Saturday. ",
