            "answer_text": "Consider the series 3 7 11 15 19 ... with a1=3 and d=4. If we have even number of terms, we pair the first and the last terms which gives sums equal to each other, to get sum=nr_of_terms*( a(first)+a(last) )/2 For example, from n=1 to n=4 the sum is a1+a4 + a2+a3 = 4/2*(a1+a4), If we have odd number of terms, the remaining middle_term after the pairing is always middle_term=(a(first) + a(last))/2, and therefore the expression of sum is still valid. For example, sum from n=1 to n=5 is a1+a5 + a2+a4 + a3 = 5/2*(a1+a5). That means the general expression of sum of terms from the first term to the last term is sum = number_of_terms * ( a(first)+a(last) )/2. ",
