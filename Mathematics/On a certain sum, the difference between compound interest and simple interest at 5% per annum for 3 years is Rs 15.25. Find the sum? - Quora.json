            "answer_text": "Let me introduce the reader to the concept of Effective Rate of Interest. Let us take a simpler case of 5% interest for TWO years. In two years, SI will be 10% What happens to CI after two years ? It is 5% + (5% + 5% on 5%) = 10.25% These two % figures are Effective Rates of Interest. Similarly, in three years, SI is 15% and CI will be 15.7625% The difference between these two is (15.7625 - 15)% = 0.7625% Now, 15.25 is 0.7625% of what ? 0.7625% x P = 15.25 => P = 2000 Now, there is an efficient method to determine Effective Rate of Interest in case of CI that would be of particular interest to Competitive / Aptitude Test Takers. And that is : A + B + AB/100 For two years, just plug in the values of A & B as 5% and get instant result of : 5 + 5 + (5 x 5)/100 = 10.25% For three years, plug in values of A & B as 10.25% and 5% respectively and get final result : 10.25 + 5 + (10.25 x 5)/100 = 15.7625% This process can be extended to any number of years. Hopefully, no more need to memorize the Draconian and cumbersome CI formula \u2026 Cheers !!!! ",

            "answer_text": "I was asked this question once, I will solve this question without creating formula dependency: Do you understand the concept of SI & CI very clearly ? If not let\u2019s have a quick look. If you invest 100 rs at 10% ROI in both SI & CI, what will be the amount after 3 years. SI(10%) - 100\u2014\u2014110\u2014\u2014120\u2014\u2014\u2014130CI(10%)- 100\u2014\u2014110\u2014\u2014121\u2014\u2014\u2014133.1 Just have a look there is a difference of Rs/- 3.1 after 3 years between SI & CI. Examine how did you get this difference. Let\u2019s see. 130= 100+10+10+10 (This amount is [Principal + 3(Interest on Principal)] 133.1= 100+10+10+10+1+1+1+0.1 ( This amount is [Principal + 3 (Interest on Principal) + 3(Interest on Interest) + Interest on Interest on Interest] ) Now see it\u2019s clear that you are getting this difference because in compound interest you are getting two things extra i.e 3 times interest on interest + interest on interest on interest. So you know that if Rate is constant for three years, interest on interest will be equal 3 times and then you get interest on interest on interest. Let\u2019s solve the problem. Difference is 15.25 , 15.25 = 5+5+5+0.25 (I did this because I know this difference is because of the extra interest I am getting on Interest and that needs to equally distributed 3 times) Now you know 5% of S.I = 5 , S.I = 100 If S.I is 100, you can say 5% of some principal = 100, Principal/sum= 2000. This might look lengthy and confusing but it is one of the easiest method to solve such problems, I would suggest the reader to solve this while reading this answer. Yeshu Kumar ",
