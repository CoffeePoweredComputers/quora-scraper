            "answer_text": "20% of 100 is 20; 100 \u2014 20 = 80 5% of 80 is 0.05 x 80 = 4 80 \u2014 4 = 76 100 \u2014 76 = 24 So successive discounts of 20% and 5% is equivalent to a 24% discount. But this is only one specific example. Does this work for any amount? Replace 100 with the variable P. 20% of P is 0.20P; the discounted amount is P \u2014 0.20P = 0.80P 5% of 0.80P is 0.05(0.80P) =0.04P Our final discounted amount is 0.80P \u2014 0.04P = 0.76P. P \u2014 0.76P = 0.24P, so now we know that for any original value, successive discounts of 20% and 5% is equivalent to a 24% discount. ",
