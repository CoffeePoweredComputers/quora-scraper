            "answer_text": "Differential equations involve the derivatives of a function or a set of functions . The laws of the Natural and Physical world are usually written and modeled in the form of differential equations . These equations (ordinary as well as partial differential equations) arise in the study of rates of change and of quantities or things that change. They play a significant role in science , applied math, physics, engineering , biology , economics \u2026 Let\u2019s take as an example Newton\u2019s second law of motion expressed in its most common form . This equation relates force to acceleration . Acceleration is the time derivative of velocity , and velocity is the time derivative of position , so acceleration is the second time derivative of position :  Hence Newton\u2019s second law is expressed as a second\u2010order differential equation to be solved for position . Newton\u2019s law has many applications. It can be used for instance to determine the motion of a simple pendulum (assuming small vibrations and no resisting forces) by deriving a differential equation of the form :  For more examples of applications and uses of Newton\u2019s second law of motion, see the following links : Applications of Second\u2010Order Equations Newton's Second Law of Motion Here are some more details and examples related to the importance and the applications of differential equations : For example, in classical mechanics, the motion of a body is described by its position and velocity as the time value varies. Newton's laws allow (given the position, velocity, acceleration and various forces acting on the body) one to express these variables dynamically as a differential equation for the unknown position of the body as a function of time. In some cases, this differential equation (called an equation of motion) may be solved explicitly. An example of modelling a real world problem using differential equations is the determination of the velocity of a ball falling through the air, considering only gravity and air resistance. The ball's acceleration towards the ground is the acceleration due to gravity minus the acceleration due to air resistance. Gravity is considered constant, and air resistance may be modeled as proportional to the ball's velocity. This means that the ball's acceleration, which is a derivative of its velocity, depends on the velocity (and the velocity depends on time). Finding the velocity as a function of time involves solving a differential equation and verifying its validity. A partial differential equation (PDE) is a differential equation that contains unknown multivariable functions and their partial derivatives. (This is in contrast to ordinary differential equations, which deal with functions of a single variable and their derivatives.) PDEs are used to formulate problems involving functions of several variables, and are either solved in closed form, or used to create a relevant computer model. PDEs can be used to describe a wide variety of phenomena such as sound, heat, electrostatics, electrodynamics, fluid flow, elasticity, or quantum mechanics. These seemingly distinct physical phenomena can be formalised similarly in terms of PDEs. Just as ordinary differential equations often model one-dimensional dynamical systems, partial differential equations often model multidimensional systems. PDEs find their generalisation in stochastic partial differential equations. Examples [\u2026] Homogeneous second-order linear constant coefficient partial differential equation of elliptic type, the Laplace equation: Third-order nonlinear partial differential equation, the Korteweg\u2013de Vries equation: Applications The study of differential equations is a wide field in pure and applied mathematics, physics, and engineering. All of these disciplines are concerned with the properties of differential equations of various types. Pure mathematics focuses on the existence and uniqueness of solutions, while applied mathematics emphasizes the rigorous justification of the methods for approximating solutions. Differential equations play an important role in modelling virtually every physical, technical, or biological process, from celestial motion, to bridge design, to interactions between neurons. Differential equations such as those used to solve real-life problems may not necessarily be directly solvable, i.e. do not have closed form solutions. Instead, solutions can be approximated using numerical methods. Many fundamental laws of physics and chemistry can be formulated as differential equations. In biology and economics, differential equations are used to model the behavior of complex systems. The mathematical theory of differential equations first developed together with the sciences where the equations had originated and where the results found application. However, diverse problems, sometimes originating in quite distinct scientific fields, may give rise to identical differential equations. Whenever this happens, mathematical theory behind the equations can be viewed as a unifying principle behind diverse phenomena. As an example, consider propagation of light and sound in the atmosphere, and of waves on the surface of a pond. All of them may be described by the same second-order partial differential equation, the wave equation, which allows us to think of light and sound as forms of waves, much like familiar waves in the water. Conduction of heat, the theory of which was developed by Joseph Fourier, is governed by another second-order partial differential equation, the heat equation. It turns out that many diffusion processes, while seemingly different, are described by the same equation; the Black\u2013Scholes equation in finance is, for instance, related to the heat equation.

These fields in turn underlie modern electrical and communications technologies. Maxwell's equations describe how electric and magnetic fields are generated and altered by each other and by charges and currents. They are named after the Scottish physicist and mathematician James Clerk Maxwell, who published an early form of those equations between 1861 and 1862. General relativity The Einstein field equations (EFE; also known as \"Einstein's equations\") are a set of ten partial differential equations in Albert Einstein's general theory of relativity which describe the fundamental interaction of gravitation as a result of spacetime being curved by matter and energy. First published by Einstein in 1915 as a tensor equation, the EFE equate local spacetime curvature (expressed by the Einstein tensor) with the local energy and momentum within that spacetime (expressed by the stress\u2013energy tensor). Quantum mechanics In quantum mechanics, the analogue of Newton's law is Schr\u00f6dinger's equation (a partial differential equation) for a quantum system (usually atoms, molecules, and subatomic particles whether free, bound, or localized). It is not a simple algebraic equation, but in general a linear partial differential equation, describing the time-evolution of the system's wave function (also called a \"state function\").

Chemistry The rate law or rate equation for a chemical reaction is a differential equation that links the reaction rate with concentrations or pressures of reactants and constant parameters (normally rate coefficients and partial reaction orders). To determine the rate equation for a particular system one combines the reaction rate with a mass balance for the system.

If Thanos knew of the simplest differential equation, he would know his plan will inevitably fail.

Once integrated the function Y is [math]y = C_{1}e^{t}[/math] So we now we see the harsh reality; the population, after each iteration, doubles, and this happens very quickly.
