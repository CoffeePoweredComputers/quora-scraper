            "answer_text": "When you refer to a set, you typically have some sort of underlying set which encompasses everything you are working with. I know this isn\u2019t a super mathematically rigorous answer, and I would love to have a greater authority help me out on understanding this concept better, but I want to use this to set up my answer. Let\u2019s call this set, which encompasses everything we want to work with, [math]S[/math]. Our set [math]S[/math] is known formally as the universal set, the set containing all of our stuff we care about. Now let\u2019s suppose we have a set [math]A \\subseteq S[/math], where A is a subset of S. To make it more interesting, let\u2019s make A and S real life examples. Suppose S set of all dogs, and A is the set of all Golden Retrievers. If you have awful taste, and for some don\u2019t like Goldens despite wanting a dog (you monster), you might want to know the available set of dogs for you to get. In this case, you would define the set of dogs you would be willing to adopt as the set containing all dogs such that none of the dogs in the set are Golden Bois, which is exactly the complement of A. In a casual sense, we have just defined the complement of A. The complement of A is the set containing all elements in the universal set S which are not elements of A. Formally, we denote a complement by the following (feel free to point out anything I\u2019ve missed!) [math]\\overline{A} = \\{x \\in S \\vert x \\notin A \\}[/math] [math](\\forall a \\in A)(a \\notin \\overline{A})[/math] [math]A \\cup \\overline{A} = S[/math] [math]A \\cap \\overline{A} = \\emptyset[/math] [math]\\overline{\\overline{A}} = A[/math] ",
