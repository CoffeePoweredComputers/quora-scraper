            "answer_text": "Finding answer of this type question is quite difficult. So let's break your question in small part\u200bs so it become easier to solve. Your question is 8 + 7 First we take 8 and talk about it. 8 (eight /e\u026at/ AYT) is the natural number following 7 and preceding 9. Cardinal -eight Ordinal- 8th(eighth) Numeral system -octal Factorization- 2\u00b3 Divisors- 1, 2, 4, 8 Greek numeral- \u0397\u00b4 Roman numeral-VIII Roman numeral (unicode)-\u2167, \u2177 Greek prefix- octa-/oct- Latin prefix- octo-/oct- Greek122-\u03b7 (or \u0397) Arabic & Kurdish-\u0668 Amharic-\u1370 Bengali period-\u09ee Chinese numeral-\u516b,\u634c Devan\u0101gar\u012b-\u096e Kannada-\u0cee Telugu-\u0c6e Tamil-\u0bee 8 is: a composite number, its proper divisors being 1, 2, and 4. It is twice 4 or four times 2.a power of two, being 2\u00b3 (two cubed), and is the first number of the form p\u00b3, p being an integer greater than 1.the first number which is neither prime nor semiprime.the base of the octal number system, which is mostly used with computers. In octal, one digit represents three bits. In modern computers, a byte is a grouping of eight bits, also called an octet.a Fibonacci number, being 3 plus 5. The next Fibonacci number is 13. 8 is the only positive Fibonacci number, aside from 1, that is a perfect cube.[1]the only nonzero perfect power that is one less than another perfect power, by Mih\u0103ilescu's Theorem.the order of the smallest non-abelian group all of whose subgroups are normal.the dimension of the octonions and is the highest possible dimension of a normed division algebra.the first number to be the aliquot sum of two numbers other than itself; the discrete biprime 10, and the square number 49.A number is divisible by 8 if its last three digits, when written in decimal, are also divisible by 8, or its last three digits are 0 when written in binary.There are a total of eight convex deltahedra. A polygon with eight sides is an octagon. Figurate numbers representing octagons (including eight) are called octagonal numbers. A polyhedron with eight faces is an octahedron. A cuboctahedron has as faces six equal squares and eight equal regular triangles. A cube has eight vertices. Sphenic numbers always have exactly eight divisors. The number 8 is involved with a number of interesting mathematical phenomena related to the notion of Bott periodicity. This is about 8 Next thing is sign of addition \u2018+\u2019 Addition (often signified by the plus symbol \"+\") is one of the four basic operations of arithmetic, with the others being subtraction, multiplication and division. The addition of two whole numbers is the total amount of those quantities combined. For example, in the picture on the right, there is a combination of three apples and two apples together, making a total of five apples. This observation is equivalent to the mathematical expression\"3 + 2 = 5\" i.e., \"3 add 2 is equal to 5\". Besides counting fruits, addition can also represent combining other physical objects. Using systematic generalizations, addition can also be defined on more abstract quantities, such as integers, rational numbers, real numbers and complex numbers and other abstract objects such as vectors and matrices. In arithmetic, rules for addition involving fractions and negative numbers have been devised amongst others. In algebra, addition is studied more abstractly. Addition has several important properties. It is commutative, meaning that order does not matter, and it is associative, meaning that when one adds more than two numbers, the order in which addition is performed does not matter (see Summation). Repeated addition of 1 is the same as counting; addition of 0 does not change a number. Addition also obeys predictable rules concerning related operations such as subtraction and multiplication. Performing addition is one of the simplest numerical tasks. Addition of very small numbers is accessible to toddlers; the most basic task, 1 + 1, can be performed by infants as young as five months and even some members of other animal species. In primary education, students are taught to add numbers in the decimal system, starting with single digits and progressively tackling more difficult problems. Mechanical aids range from the ancient abacus to the modern computer, where research on the most efficient implementations of addition continues to this day. Now come on the last component of your question which is 7 7 (seven; /\u02c8s\u025bv\u0259n/) is the natural number following 6 and preceding 8.

It is also a Newman\u2013Shanks\u2013Williams prime,[1] a Woodall prime,[2] a factorial prime,[3] a lucky prime,[4] a happy number (happy prime),[5]a safe prime (the only Mersenne safe prime), and the fourth Heegner number.[6]Seven is the lowest natural number that cannot be represented as the sum of the squares of three integers. (See Lagrange's four-square theorem#Historical development.)Seven is the aliquot sum of one number, the cubic number 8 and is the base of the 7-aliquot tree.7 is the only number D for which the equation 2n \u2212 D = x2 has more than two solutions for n and x natural. In particular, the equation 2n \u2212 7 = x2 is known as the Ramanujan\u2013Nagell equation.7 is the only dimension, besides the familiar 3, in which a vector cross product can be defined.7 is the lowest dimension of a known exotic sphere, although there may exist as yet unknown exotic smooth structures on the 4-dimensional sphere.999,999 divided by 7 is exactly 142,857. Therefore, when a vulgar fraction with 7 in the denominator is converted to a decimal expansion, the result has the same six-digit repeating sequence after the decimal point, but the sequence can start with any of those six digits.[7] For example, 1/7 = 0.142857 142857... and 2/7 = 0.285714 285714....In fact, if one sorts the digits in the number 142,857 in ascending order, 124578, it is possible to know from which of the digits the decimal part of the number is going to begin with. The remainder of dividing any number by 7 will give the position in the sequence 124578 that the decimal part of the resulting number will start. For example, 628 \u00f7 7 = 89 5/7; here 5 is the remainder, and would correspond to number 7 in the ranking of the ascending sequence. So in this case, 628 \u00f7 7 = 89.714285. Another example, 5238 \u00f7 7 = 748 2/7, hence the remainder is 2, and this corresponds to number 2 in the sequence. In this case, 5238 \u00f7 7 = 748.285714. A seven-sided shape is a heptagon. The regular n-gons for n \u2264 6 can be constructed by compass and straightedge alone, but the regular heptagon cannot. Figurate numbers representing heptagons (including seven) are called heptagonal numbers. Seven is also a centered hexagonal number.[8]Seven is the first integer reciprocal (multiplicative inverse) with infinitely repeating sexagesimal representation.There are seven frieze groups, the groups consisting of symmetries of the plane whose group of translations is isomorphic to the group of integers.This all information is enough to basic understanding of this thing\u200b.Now we are going to do calculation to find the answer.Firstly bought a box of matchsticks. Then take out 8 matchsticks from the box and again take out 7 matchsticks from box.And carefully count the all the all matchsticks if your answer is 13 then you are one of those who can count 13.So let's\u200b get some information about 13.13 (thirteen /\u03b8\u025c\u02d0r\u02c8ti\u02d0n/) is the natural number following 12 and preceding 14.Cardinalthirteen Ordinal 13th(thirteenth) Numeral system tredecimal Factorization prime Prime 6th Divisors 1, 13 Greek numeral \u0399\u0393\u00b4 Roman numeral XIII Binary 1101 2 Ternary 111 3 Quaternary 31 4 Quinary 23 5 Senary 21 6 Octal 15 8 Duodecimal 11 12 Hexadecimal D 16 Vigesimal D 20 Base 36 D 36 In spoken English, the numbers 13 and 30 are often confused. When carefully pronounced, they differ in which syllable is stressed: 13 /\u03b8\u025c\u02d0r\u02c8ti\u02d0n/ ( listen) vs. 30 /\u02c8\u03b8\u025c\u02d0rti/. However, in dates such as 1300 (\"thirteen hundred\") or when contrasting numbers in the teens, such as 13, 14, 15, the stress shifts to the first syllable: 13 /\u02c8\u03b8\u025c\u02d0rti\u02d0n/. Strikingly similar folkloric aspects of the number 13 have been noted in various cultures around the world: one theory is that this is due to the cultures employing lunar-solar calendars (there are approximately 12.41 lunations per solar year, and hence 12 \"true months\" plus a smaller, and often portentous, thirteenth month). This can be witnessed, for example, in the \"Twelve Days of Christmas\" of Western European tradition.
