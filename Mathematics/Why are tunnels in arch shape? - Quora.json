            "answer_text": "Arch shaped tunnels are not really arch shaped. They are circular shaped, but 20 to 25 of them will be used for utility purpose. The reason for circular shape is.. TBM machine is in circular shape. The mosy convenient and quick way for tunnel construction. Other shape requires manual erection alot.The pressure created by the surrounding soil will be distributed equally on all the sides, where is in square or rectangle, the soil pressure will vary. This helps to withstand the soil pressure easily.",
