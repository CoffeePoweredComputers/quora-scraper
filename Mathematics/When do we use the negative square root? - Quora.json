            "answer_text": "That\u2019s an ambiguous question. One interpretation is how do you get negative square roots. The answer is that they come automatically. When you look for the square root of 4, for example, you\u2019re asking for a number that gives 4 when squared. There are two such numbers, 2 and -2. Every positive number has two square roots, equal in magnitude, one positive, one negative. The other interpretation is what is the square root of a negative number. In the ordinary real numbers, there isn\u2019t any. You\u2019re asking for a number whose square is negative, but the square of any real number is positive. Mathematicians invented imaginary numbers to solve that problem. The number i is the square root of -1. Actually, -1 has two square roots, i and -i. If you want the square root of -4, the answer is 2i and -2i. How do you do negative square roots? ",

In short they are a branch of maths with various applications ",

            "answer_text": "The simplest negative square root is \u22121\u2212\u2212\u2212\u221a\u22121. The answer is not positive one because (+1)2=+1(+1)2=+1. The answer is not negative one because (\u22121)2=+1(\u22121)2=+1. This means there is no answer, so the answer must be some crazy number that can only be imagined. Hey\u2026let\u2019s call the answer an imaginary number ii. So define i=\u22121\u2212\u2212\u2212\u221ai=\u22121 While we have no idea what ii actually is, we know some things about it. For example, i2=\u22121i2=\u22121. It also allows us to calculate the square root of any negative number simply by factoring out the \u22121\u22121.
