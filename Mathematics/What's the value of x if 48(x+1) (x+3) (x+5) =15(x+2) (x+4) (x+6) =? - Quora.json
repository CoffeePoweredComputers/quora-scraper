            "answer_text": "Let's simplify the equation and bring numbers to left hand side and variables on right hand side. 48/15 = (x+2)(x+4)(x+6)/(x+1)(x+3)(x+5) \u2014 B Simplifying left hand side becomes 16/5 \u2014A From that we can infer the product of denominator on right hand side is odd multiple of 5. That can happen when only one of the three variables is odd multiple of 5. Simplest odd multiple of 5 is 5 itself. So we can get possible value of x by substituting only one variable out of theses three (x+1), (x+3) or (x+5) to be 5. Let's start with (x+5) to be 5. => x= 0. Lets substitute x =0 in right hand side of equation B I.e. (x+2)(x+4)(x+6)/(x+1)(x+3)(x+5) we get. (2)(4)(6)/(1)(3)(5) = 16/5 That is the exact ratio we have in equation A. Hence, x=0 is one of the roots. Since this is equation of order 3 it will have 2 more roots. Which can be solved by solving the quadratic equation if you are interested in that. ",

            "answer_text": "This equation [math]48(x+1) (x+3) (x+5) =15(x+2) (x+4) (x+6)[/math] is a cubic equation, so it could have up to three roots. You might notice right away that [math]x=0[/math] is one solution, but let\u2019s try to solve it without knowing that solution. Expand each side. The left side is [math]48(x^3+9x^2+23x+15)[/math] while the right side is [math]15(x^3+12x^2+44x+48).[/math] Those are equal. Move all the terms to the left side and collect terms to get the equation [math]\\quad 33x^3+252x^2+444x=0.[/math] Since the constant term is [math]0,[/math] therefore one solution is [math]x=0.[/math] Divide the equation by [math]x[/math] to find the other two equations. [math]\\quad 33x^2+252x+444=0.[/math] All the coefficients are divisible by 3, so we can divide by 3 to make the equation a little nicer. [math]\\quad 11x^2+84x+148=0.[/math] That quadratic equation doesn\u2019t factor, but you can use the quadratic formula to find the other two roots, [math]x=\\frac2{11}(-21\\pm\\sqrt{34}).[/math] ",
