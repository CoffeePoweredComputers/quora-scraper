            "answer_text": "Being equal and being equivalent are totally different things. 0 and {0} being scalar and vector quantities respectively, we can say that their magnitudes are equal. Looking at the aspects of directions, we all know that 0 has no direction (being scalar). But at one point of instance, one can say that {0} being a vector quantity, it has a direction. But applying a little insight approach, we see that {0} is different than other vector quantities. Yes, other vector quantities have definite directions but {0} does not have a definite direction. Its direction can extend at any angle with reference point. So, in this case we may say that 0 is not equal to {0}, but is {or may be) equivalent to {0}. As to comparing scalars with vectors, the definition of vector space does not say that there is any \"=\" relation defined between a scalar and a vector. So technically you can't say a scalar is \"not equal\" to a vector either! You should simply say that no equality relation is defined (in the definition of a vector space) between scalars and vectors. ",
