            "answer_text": "Good question! In math, we\u2019re taught a lot of things about numbers. We are taught about positive numbers, negative numbers, and even (eventually) imaginary numbers. We know that positive numbers are above (greater than) zero and negative numbers are below (less than) zero. Now, allow me to draw a very crappy number-line\u2026 \u2190 -5\u2014 -4\u2014 -3\u2014 -2\u2014 -1\u2014[math]0[/math]\u20141\u20142\u20143\u20144\u20145\u2192 However, let me clean this up a bit. I just want to focus on three numbers from this number-line: [math]-4[/math], [math]0[/math], and [math]4[/math]. \u2190\u2014 -4\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014[math]0[/math]\u2014\u2014\u2014\u20144\u2014\u2192 Awesome! We\u2019ve got our number-line. Now, let me talk about absolute value for a second before I move on. Absolute value is the distance a number is from [math]0[/math]. Let\u2019s pretend you\u2019re walking to one of two parks from your house. These two parks are the exact same distance from your house, but the opposite direction. Hicken\u2019s Park is 4 blocks west from your house and Charity Park is 4 blocks east. The front door of your house faces east (towards Charity Park) and your back door faces west (toward Hicken\u2019s Park). Now, one day you walk to Charity park to meet up with your best friend. Of course, you walk 4 blocks to get there. The next day, you go the opposite direction to meet up with a cousin at Hicken\u2019s Park. Again, you walk 4 blocks to get there. Now, the point of all this is that, even though Hicken\u2019s Park is 4 blocks behind your house, you don\u2019t say \u201cI walked negative 4 blocks to get to this park.\u201d No, you just say you walked 4 blocks to get to either park. What does any of that have to do with absolute value? Well, imagine Hicken\u2019s Park as the [math]-4[/math] on the number-line. Like I said, the absolute value is the distance from [math]0[/math]. No one says they went negative 4 blocks or drove negative [math]20[/math] miles; that doesn\u2019t make sense. This means that distance (even in math) is always positive! [math]-4[/math] is [math]4[/math] numbers away from [math]0[/math], so we can say \u201cthe absolute value of [math]-4[/math] is [math]4[/math] because [math]-4[/math] is [math]4[/math] numbers away from [math]0[/math].\u201d Hope that helps!
