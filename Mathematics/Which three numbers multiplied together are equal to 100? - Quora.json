            "answer_text": "First, find the prime factorization. 100 = 2^2 * 5^2 Now, any factor can have from 0 to 2 times the prime factor 5 and from 0 to 2 times the prime factor 2. That means 3 possible cases for factor \u201c2\u201d and 3 possible cases for factor \u201c5\u201d. The number of integer factors of 100 is 3*3 = 9: 1 = 2^0 * 5^0 2 = 2^1 * 5^0 4 = 2^2 * 5^0 5 = 2^0 * 5^1 10 = 2^1 * 5^120 = 2^2 * 5^1 25 = 2^0 * 5^250 = 2^1 * 5^2 100 = 2^2 * 5^2 For any of those, dividing 100 by it, you get a number that has to be expressed as a multiplication of 2 integers. 1 = 2^0 * 5^0 \u2192 100 2 = 2^1 * 5^0 \u2192 50 4 = 2^2 * 5^0 \u2192 25 5 = 2^0 * 5^1 \u2192 20 10 = 2^1 * 5^1 \u2192 10 20 = 2^2 * 5^1 \u2192 5 25 = 2^0 * 5^2 \u2192 450 = 2^1 * 5^2 \u2192 2 100 = 2^2 * 5^2 \u2192 1 Now, how many cases are for any of them? 100 = 2^2 * 5^2 : 9 cases 1*1*1001*2*501*4*25 1*5*201*10*101*20*5 1*25*41*50*21*100*1 The last 4 are included in the previous 5. 50 = 2^1 * 5^2 : 6 cases = 2*3 2*1*502*2*252*5*102*10*52*25*22*50*1 25 = 5^2 : 3 cases 4*1*254*5*54*25*1 20 = 2^2 * 5^1 : 6 cases 5*1*205*2*105*4*5 5*5*45*10*25*20*1 10 = 2^1 * 5^1 : 4 cases 10*1*1010*2*510*5*210*10*1 The rest, either cases about \u201c2\u201d or about \u201c1\u201d\u2026 are included in the previous ones.
