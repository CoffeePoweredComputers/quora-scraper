            "answer_text": "let N =  . N is odd. So check all odd numbers between 5 and 10 i.e., 5,7,9. Here  represents modulus operation i.e., value of remainder when a divided by b (a/b). 1) For 5 :   and so on. If power%4 = 0, unit digit will be 6.(eg. for  unit digit is 256) So for  number unit digit = 6, and  number unit digit = 5. So N is divisible by 5. 2) For 7 : 7 is factor, iff .   If  then 7 is a factor of N. See fast exponentiation modulo algorithm for finding . express 48 in binary = 110000 0 \u2192  0 \u2192  0 \u2192  0 \u2192  1 \u2192  1 \u2192  Multiply all 1 terms (that are bold above)  So 7 is a factor. 3) For 9 : (explanation is same as above) 0 \u2192  0 \u2192  0 \u2192  0 \u2192  1 \u2192  1 \u2192  Multiply all 1 terms (that are bold above)  So 9 is a factor. So 5,7,9 are factors of N. Edit 1: for checking 5 as factor, you can also use same method as shown above for 7. If  then 5 is factor of N. 0 \u2192  0 \u2192  0 \u2192  0 \u2192  1 \u2192  1 \u2192  Multiply all 1 terms (that are bold above)  So 5 is a factor.
