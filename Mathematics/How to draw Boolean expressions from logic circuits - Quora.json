            "answer_text": "write from the inputs to outputs, by example:  here you have the first AND:  then the second AND:  Both output are wire to an OR  you may group the common variable C:  By example a only NAND circuit:  you have a big NAND with 3 inputs. The NAND have 3 variables: A,B,C notice the variable A and variable B are wire to smallers NANDs   so may be written:  where the output is inverted  The same with the second NAND:  with the output inverted:  going to another NAND  With the output inverted we will have the boolean expresion:  ",
