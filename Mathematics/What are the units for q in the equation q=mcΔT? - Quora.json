            "answer_text": "Usually, mc\u0394T = \u0394H, if you\u2019re a chemist and the units will be kcal. If you\u2019re an engineer, you may think of kilo-joules and mc\u0394T= q (kJ). But there\u2019s really no difference, as 4.184 kjoules = 1 kcal, and even if you use energy/mole, you get the same ratio of kJ/kcal = 4.184 = J/cal The easiest way I\u2019ve found to keep this all together is \u201cunit analysis\u201d so m (g) * c(energy/g.T) * (T) gives an answer that is always in energy units (\u0394T has units of temperature) and if you need energy/mole, you can use mole/g * m(g), and c (energy/mole.T). To mop up, don\u2019t get tangled with units of T, by allowing a value for c (\u2026/F) to be used if \u0394T has units of C or K. Make sure the heat capacity T units match the thermometer T units.

            "answer_text": "The beauty of equations like that is that almost any unit can be used as long as you include a conversion\u2026 This is the heat transfer formula, so q is usually measured in Joules, and c is measured in C. (Celsius) But if you want to use F (Fahrenheit) instead, fine\u2026 but you have to include the conversion to C. (F - 32 * 5/9) ",
