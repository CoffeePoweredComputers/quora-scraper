            "answer_text": "It\u2019s a language in a broad sense. As Allan Taylor said, it\u2019s more of a code, you use to communicate about some very restricted topics. Namely the relationship of some imagined things (numbers, concepts) with other imagined things. So if I\u2019m saying 2 + 2 = 4 I\u2019m saying that an imagined object called \u201c2\u201d which can be considered the idea of duality in the platonic sense (as it\u2019s doesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s two planets or two grains of sand) is related to the abstract idea of \u201c4\u201d in that precise way. Advanced Algebra and Calculus go the same way just building over these concepts and adding more abstract entities and ideas For example calculus is built on the idea that if you slice the pizza in 4,6 or 8 parts, it\u2019s the same pizza, so in principle you can slice it in a thousand, a million or a billion parts and it will still be the same pizza, so you can do the \u201climit\u201d and say that if you slice the pizza in an infinite number of parts , each part will be infinitely small but the sum of all the parts will still be the same pizza. It\u2019s an abstract idea as you can change \u201cPizza\u201d for any other thing or for an abstract object and the idea remains the same. The fact that all these concepts are incredibly useful for designers and engineers to actually BUILD THINGS like cars and airplanes, it\u2019s why math is famous. And why people say things like \u201cMath is the language of the universe\u201d , but it\u2019s not true. It has some points in common with languages though: Math is a way we have to organize our abstract thinking, and exists independently of the physical world, in our heads.Language helps us to \u201cname\u201d the physical world and to communicate our needs and desires.Math is constructive and builds ideas over time and grows into a body of knowledge generation over generation.Language is also constructive and it also helps to pass information (and feelings, ideas, and much more) from generation to generations, we wouldn\u2019t go far if we had to invent everything from scratch every time.The main differences between math and language are in scope, truth status and evolution. Math is restricted in scope to relations between abstract objects and concepts, language is universal in scope, even if there are things present-day language is not very good at (like expressing feelings in the same way it expresses ideas) it\u2019s not self restrictedMath expresses relationships and those relationships must be proven to be at least self consistent with the rest of the body of mathematics, languages are arbitrary in nature and not self consistent, there is not a \u201cright\u201d or \u201cwrong\u201d way to transmit knowledge, feelings or ideas, it either works or it doesn\u2019t\u2026 this goes for all the prescriptivists out there. When one language imposes over others it\u2019s not because of the language virtues but mainly for political and economical reasons.Math are constructed in a very painstakingly way, by theorems, lemmas and proofs, it\u2019s a slow (but steady) way to construct knowledge, Languages are EVOLUTIONARY and that\u2019s how linguists can study them and learn about how people 4 thousand years ago thought, as we carry the consequences of their thinking in our everyday words.Both Math and Languages are my passion. And sometimes they play well together (as in some of my research) but language will always be one step higher than mathematics, because take out math but keep language and we will invent math again, take language out and we are doomed, as language is ultimately what makes us human.

            "answer_text": "Firstly, mathematics is a study, not a form of communication; however, the discussion of mathematical study (mathematical notation) is a kind of mathematical language. Two definitions of language come to mind (from Wiktionary.org): A body of words, and set of methods of combining them (called a grammar), understood by a community and used as a form of communication.The expression of thought (the communication of meaning) in a specified way.Once some basic notation is agreed upon, it IS a language, but not like that of a spoken language, rather it is closer to that of a computer language. By that, it\u2019s a language of logic, of definitions, and computations, even by considering that it\u2019s computations of expressions, not just symbols. It is an abstract language, in much the same way that computer languages are abstractions of human language. When we create characters in the game, we don\u2019t actually create characters, but abstractions that represent characters. This is exactly what we do with math, only that the characters we study tend to be more universal, and tend to be more practical in more fields [like the ability to count objects in sets, count objects in multiple sets (addition), counting objects in pairs of sets (multiplication), and counting ways that sets of objects relate to each other (exponentiation)]. It is a study in the ways that things are equal (relationships), and by that, the ways that we can rewrite our \u201cprogram\u201d so that it gives us the same answers. Furthermore, the concept of language is brought out again in the sciences, because the relationships between various phenomena are abstracted into mathematical relationships, and as such, it is a way of communicating. In that way, mathematical notation is not a \u201cbody of words\u201d, but it is definitely a body of symbols that stand for words. Although, mathematical notation is definitely an expression of thought in a specified way.  PS. Although it is similar to a programming language, we are still waiting on a fully rigorous way to represent side-effects in mathematics. We have ways to \u201ccheat\u201d side-effects (like monads). Church-Turing didn\u2019t actually approach the realm of side-effects. We have started working with linear logic, and hopefully, we can shortly find such a way to rigorously represent side-effects and reason about them in a mathematical way. ",
