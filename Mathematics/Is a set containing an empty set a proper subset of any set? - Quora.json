            "answer_text": "The empty set is a subset of every set, since each element of the empty set (there are none!) is an element of every set. The empty set is a proper subset of every set \u2026 except that it is not a proper subset of itself. A set S containing an empty set is not a subset of any set that does not contain the empty set. Since the empty set is an element of S, it would have to be an element of any set T of which S is a subset. Most sets don\u2019t contain the empty set, so a set S that contains an empty set would not be a subset, let alone a proper subset of such sets. For example, the empty set is not an element of {1}, or of {1,2,3,4,5,6,7}, or of the set N of natural numbers. By the way, it is easy to prove that there is only one empty set, so your question should begin, \u201cIs a set containing the empty set \u2026\u201d ",

A subset [math]S[/math] is a proper subset of [math]T[/math] when there\u2019s some element of [math]T[/math] that is not an element of [math]S[/math], that is, when [math]S\\neq T[/math].
