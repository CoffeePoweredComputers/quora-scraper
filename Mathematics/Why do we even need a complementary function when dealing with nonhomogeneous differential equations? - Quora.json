            "answer_text": "Such a solution is not as general as it could be. You still need the homogeneous solution to satisfy your initial boundary conditions which the particular solution will not, in general, be able to do by itself (it doesn't have enough parameters). Consider, for instance, a forced harmonic oscillator. Eventually the effects of the initial conditions will die out if the oscillator is damped, but the system will initially exhibit behavior related to the homogeneous solution and the initial conditions.
