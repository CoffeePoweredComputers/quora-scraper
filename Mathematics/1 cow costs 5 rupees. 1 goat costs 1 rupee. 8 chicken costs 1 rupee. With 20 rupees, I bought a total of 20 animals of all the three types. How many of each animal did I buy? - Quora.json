            "answer_text": "If you bought nothing but chickens, you could have had 160 animals. If you bought nothing but goats, 20 animals exactly If you bought nothing but cows, 4 animals. So, we can ignore goats for the moment, the question is how many chickens do you have to buy to make up for buying a cow? You need the number of rupees spent on cows plus chickens to equal the number of animals. 1 cow costs as much as 40 chickens 1 cow, 8 chickens, that\u2019s 6 rupees and 9 animals, no good 1 cow 16 chickens? 7 rupees and 17 animals. Nope, it only gets worse if you add more chickens. 2 cows, 8 chickens, that\u2019s 11 rupees and 10 animals, no good 3 cows, 8 chickens, that\u2019s 16 rupees and 11 animals, no good 3 cows, 16 chickens, that\u2019s 17 rupees and 19 animals, no good Nope, there is no solution that spends all 20 rupees. BUT 3 cows, 16 chickens, 1 goat, that\u2019s 20 animals total, 1 or more of each, and less than 20 rupees spent. You have two rupees left over. Once that floodgate opens, we can go back. Any combination where rupees spent on cows and chickens is less than the total number of animals from that combination, and less than 20 (so there\u2019s room for one goat) will work, and you\u2019ll have rupees left over. With one cow, you can buy up to 5 to 18 chickens, buy goats to get the total up to twenty, and have between .375 and 11.75 rupees left over With two cows, you can buy from 10 to 18 chickens, buy goats to get the total up to twenty, and have between .75 and 6.875 rupees left over With three cows, you can buy 14, 15, or 16 chickens, buy goats to get the total up to twenty, and have between .25 and 2 rupees left over The solution that comes closest to spending all the rupees is 3 cows, 14 chickens, 3 goats, leaving only .25 rupees left over. The solution that spends the least money is obviously 1 cow, 1 goat, 18 chickens, leaving you with a fat 11.75 rupee wallet. ",

            "answer_text": "Let number of cows, goats & chicken be x, y & z respectively. x + y + z = 20 5x + y + z/8 = 20 Solving these simultaneous equations will give the value of x, y & z. Ideally, you need three equations to solve for three variables. However, assuming I buy at least Rs 5/- worth cow, Rs 1/- worth goat & Rs 1/- worth chicken, I spend Rs 7/-. Buying a second set puts me back by Rs 14/- Rest 6 rupees can be spent in any combination I want : 1 cow + 1 goat ( 5 + 1) 1 cow + 8 chicken (5 + 1) 1 goat + 40 chicken( 1 + 5) 2 goats + 32 chicken ,(2 + 4) 3 goats + 24 chicken (3 + 3) 4 goats + 16 chicken (4 + 2) 5 goats + 8 chicken (5 + 1) 6 goats only (6) 48 chicken only. Therefore number of animals = 2 Cows, 2 Goats, 16 chicken in round one PLUS Any combination listed above => Number of animals exceed 20 in every combination. NO unique solution possible. :-) ",
