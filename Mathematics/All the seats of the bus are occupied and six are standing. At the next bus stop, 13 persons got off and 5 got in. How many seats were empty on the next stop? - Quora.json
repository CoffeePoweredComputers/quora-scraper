            "answer_text": "Let's rephrase this. There are -6 seats on the bus. When people left, that means we gained 13 seats against the missing seats. 13 + (-6) = 7. That means there are now 7 empty seats. But 5 seats got taken by the new passengers. So there are now 7 - 5 = 2 seats. So for the next stop there are two seats, at least assuming all passengers only take up one seat, and always sit down if given the chance. However I'd argue that we have no idea how many seats were taken. Not everyone on the bus wants to sit down, and sometimes passengers take up multiple seats (either because a wheelchair is bolted down, a passenger is manspreading, or someone is using a seat for bag storage).
