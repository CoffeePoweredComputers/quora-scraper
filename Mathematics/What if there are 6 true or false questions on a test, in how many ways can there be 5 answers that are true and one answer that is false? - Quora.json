Let\u2019s say the test is about using Quora. One of the following six statements is false; the other five are true. Quora is an advice column where you can ask any personal question you need answers for, especially regarding homework and romantic relationships.To get good answers on Quora, you are best advised to research the profiles of the people from whom you want to \u201crequest answers\u201d to be sure they are interested in your question.Good credentials on Quora tell readers how or why you qualify to answer a specific question. For example, you may have life experience or formal training.Quora allows discussions of nearly every topic under the sun, but certain \u201cadult topics\u201d must be appropriately marked for everyone\u2019s safety. Illegal topics are forbidden.Things like upvotes, Top Writer titles, followers, and ranked answers in threads are merely incentives for people to contribute to Quora; they are not an end in themselves.Quora\u2019s goal is to \u201cshare and grow the world\u2019s knowledge,\u201d[1] not to cater to individually nuanced questions about personal life. Multiple question that are very similar will be merged.[2]See comment below for answer.

            "answer_text": "You are asking me to count something finite. The question sounds complex, but in reality the problem therefore reduces to figuring out what you want me to count. When counting something, you need to define very clearly what it is you are trying to count. The question doesn't do this.Achtung! Am I counting distinguishable or indistinguishable things?This matters because if they are distinguishable the result will be higher as there is less \"degeneracy\". I.e., more arrangements will be different, so more need to be counted.You might think that the OP wants me to count things that are distinguishable, ie, questions in a test (what would be the point of asking the same question more than once?).Closer analysis reveals that the OP\u2019s question is not about the Questions in the Test, but about the Answers to the Questions in the Test. And these are INDISTINGUISHABLE, other than that they can be represented by, for example, either 1 or 0.Do you see how ambiguity in language can mislead you? Maths is so much clearer!Anyway, I shall now write down, unambiguously the NATURE of what it is I am going to count:I have six INDISTINGUISHABLE objects that can be represented by 1 or 0. I want to count the number of possible ARRANGEMENTS of these objects.Do all these ARRANGEMENTS actually get counted as different? Ie, are some arrangements indistinguishable from others with the information that I have? If so, I have to count the \u201cdegeneracy\u201d of these indistinguishable arrangements and remove it from the final tally.However, as I am counting arrangements of indistinguishable 0s and 1s, all that matters is placement of 0s and 1s in each arrangement. So now, finally, I can state precisely what it is that I am counting:I have five 1s and one 0. How many ways can I arrange them?Phew! That is easy! I can just do as follows:The 0 can occupy any one of the 6 places. Ie, the answer to the question is, self evidently, 6.I have written this tedious process out because it shows in, well, tedious detail, how you can recast your question in a way that makes it MUCH easier to answer. I think that is helpful. For example, I could have got sidetracked into counting all the ways of arranging the questions in the test, as they ARE distinguishable, and then having to\u2026 let's not go there. Instead, clearly defining what it is that I am counting saves me all that effort. The question was actually really, really simple. It was Language that made it sound so complex. ",
