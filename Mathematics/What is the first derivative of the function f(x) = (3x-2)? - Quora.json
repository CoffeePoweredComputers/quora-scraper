            "answer_text": "The first thing is that we have to differentiate that expression with respect to the variable [math]x[/math]. The first derivative of the function [math]f(x)[/math], represented commonly as [math]f'(x)[/math], is given by applying the differential operator, [math]d/dx[/math], on the given function. This requires knowledge of basic differential expressions, operated on simple functions. To summarize: [math]d(c)/dx = dc/dx = 0; c[/math] is any constant. [math]d(x)/dx = dx/dx =1;[/math] [math] d(ax)/dx = a\u00d7d(x)/dx= a; a[/math] is any constant [math]d(f(x) + g(x))/dx = f'(x) + g'(x);[/math] [math]d(f(x) - g(x))/dx = f'(x) - g'(x).[/math] We'll build up on these properties. So, basically, [math]d(f(x))/dx = f'(x) = d(3x-2)/dx = d(3x)/dx - d(2)/dx = 3\u00d7 (dx/dx) - 0 = 3[/math] Therefore [math]f'(x) =3[/math]. Hope it helps!! ",
