            "answer_text": "Let\u2019s start with statements describing the origin and the meanings of the letter k , from the Oxford English Dictionary : \u201cthe eleventh letter of the alphabet in English and other modern languages, was an original letter of the Roman alphabet, taken from the Greek Kappa K, originally \u2039egkappa\u203a, from Ph\u0153nician and general Semitic Kaph \u2039semkaph\u203a. Its sound in Greek and Latin was, as in English, that of the back voiceless stop consonant, or guttural tenuis. But at an early period of Latin orthography, the letter C (originally representing Greek Gamma) was employed for the k sound, and the letter K itself fell into disuse, except in a few words[\u2026]\u201d \u201c Used, like the other letters of the alphabet, to express serial order, as in numbering the sheets or quires of a book, lettering parts of a figure, enumerating items of a list, etc.; the successive groups or sections of a classification[\u2026]\u201d \u201c In Chemistry K is the symbol for Potassium (modern Latin kalium).[...] In Meteorology K = cumulus. In Assaying, etc. K = carat. In Astronomy k designates Gauss's Constant, the square of which is a measure of the mass of the sun.\u201d \u201cIn Physics k (or K) is the symbol of thermal conductivity. [Introduced by J. B. J. Fourier, 1822.] \u201c \u201cPhysics. The designation of one of the strongest Fraunhofer lines, situated in the extreme violet at a wavelength of 3934 \u00c5 and due to absorption by calcium ions.\u201d \u201cIn Physics and Chemistry k is the symbol of Boltzmann's constant. \u201c \u201c In Physics K is used to designate the series of X-ray emission lines of shorter wavelength obtained by exciting the atoms of any particular element ; these arise from electron transitions to the innermost, lowest-energy atomic orbit, of principal quantum number 1, which is thus termed the K-shell, and electrons in this shell K-electrons. K(-electron) capture, the capture by an atomic nucleus of one of the K-electrons. \u201c \u201c[From its use as an abbreviation for kilo-.] In connection with Computers K or k is used to represent 1,000 (or 1,024). Also used (transferred sense) to represent 1,000 (pounds, etc.), especially of salaries offered in job advertisements. \u201c \u201cK noun slang ketamine, used as a recreational drug.\u201d The letter K or k is used as an abbreviation for names (Kate, Katherine, Kenneth) or as abbreviation in combinations of words or titles . As an abbreviation of kilo , it is used in symbols of multiples of the physical units in the International System of Units . Other meanings of K : K is the unit symbol for the Kelvin temperature scale.K is the name of the principal character in Kafka's novel The Trial .In chess notation, the letter K represents the King (WK for White King, BK for Black King)As abbreviation for OK, often used in emails and short text messages.In the CMYK color model, K represents black ink.In International Morse code it is used to mean \"over\".Some more meanings and uses of k in mathematics : k is a unit vector usually in the direction of the [math]z-axis[/math] .One of the fundamental quaternion units. Quaternions are generally represented in the form: a + bi + cj + dk where a, b, c, and d are real numbers, and i, j, and k are the fundamental quaternion units.[math]k[/math] is used as a constant in mathematics and also in trigonometry (mostly as an integer) , and sometimes is the constant in the result of an indefinite integration.k is used in the mathematical K-theory (K from the German Klasse, meaning \"class\").Used in expressions such as \u201ck-space\u201d , k-vectors (see the article Reciprocal lattice - Wikipedia ) .Used in crystallography in certain notations of groups or symmetry directions.[math]K[/math] is used as a symbol for the complete elliptic integral of the first kind :[math]{\\displaystyle K(k)=\\int _{0}^{\\tfrac {\\pi }{2}}{\\frac {d\\theta }{\\sqrt {1-k^{2}\\sin ^{2}\\theta }}}=\\int _{0}^{1}{\\frac {dt}{\\sqrt {(1-t^{2})(1-k^{2}t^{2})}}},}[/math] K , I hope that was helpful and instructive.
