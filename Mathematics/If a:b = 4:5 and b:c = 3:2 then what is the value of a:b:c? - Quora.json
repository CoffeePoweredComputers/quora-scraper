            "answer_text": "The goal in these types of questions is to arrange that common letters (in this case, b) have the same ratio value (5 for the first and 3 from the second). That arrangement can be made by multiplying the first by 3 and the second by 5. Now the equations read [math]a:b=12:15[/math] and [math]b:c=15:10[/math]. Now the b\u2019s correspond to [math]15[/math]. Now we can direct and rearrange to write [math]a:b:c=12:15:10[/math]. ",
