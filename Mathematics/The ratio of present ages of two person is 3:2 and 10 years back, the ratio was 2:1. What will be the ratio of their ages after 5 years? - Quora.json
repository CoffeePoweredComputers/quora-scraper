            "answer_text": "Let the rational between their ages be x The ratio of present ages of two person is 3/: 2 Thus the ages of two persons are 3x and 2x respectively. 10 years back, the ratio was 2 : 1. Ten years back their ages were (3x - 10) and (2x - 10) and the ratio was 2 : 1 (3x - 10) / (2x - 10) = 2 / 1 Cross multiplication 2 (2x - 10) = (3x - 10) 4x - 20 = 3x - 10 4x - 3x = 20 - 10 x = 10 The rational is 10 Thus their present ages, 3x = 3 \u00d7 10 = 30 years and 2x = 2 \u00d7 10 = 20 years. Ratio of their ages after 5 years Their ages after 5 years will be 30 + 5 = 35 years and 20 + 5 = 25 years The ratio between the ages of two persons after 5 years will be 35 : 25 or 7 : 5 Answer: The ratio between the ages of two persons after 5 years will be 7 : 5 ",

            "answer_text": "Here\u2019s a shortcut that i normally use. 10 years ago the ratio was 2:1. Now it is 3:2. So judging by the numbers in the ratio, we can see that only 1 is added in numerator as well as denominator. As 1 is added after 10 years, this added 1 would be transformed to 10, thus 2:1 will become 20:10 and 3:2 will become 30:20. These numbers do satisfy the conditions given in the question. Thus after 5 years, the ratio will be 35:25 i.e. 7:5. ",
