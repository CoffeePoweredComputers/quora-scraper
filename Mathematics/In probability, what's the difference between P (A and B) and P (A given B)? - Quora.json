            "answer_text": "Mathematically, the only difference is that P(A given B) is divided by P(B). Conceptually, P(A and B) is the probability that both A and B occur (the joint probability, or the probability of the intersection of A and B). P(A given B) is the probability that A occurs if B also occurs (conditional probability). The formula for P(A given B) is [P(A and B)/P(B)]. Illustrating with an example: suppose we have 10 rabbits. 4 are male, 6 are female, 2 are pregnant. P(male) = .4 P(female) = .6 P(pregnant) = .2 (dividing # of pregnant rabbits by total # of rabbits); this is the likelihood of randomly picking up a bunny out of the 10 and discovering that it is pregnant. P(pregnant and female) also is .2 (dividing # of pregnant female rabbits by total # of rabbits); this is the likelihood of picking up a bunny out of the 10 and discovering that it is a pregnant female. P(pregnant and male) is zero (dividing # of pregnant male rabbits by total # of rabbits) P(pregnant given female) = 2/6 (dividing # of pregnant female rabbits by the # of female rabbits OR dividing the probability of being female and pregnant by the probability of being female) P(pregnant given male) = 0 (dividing # of pregnant males by # of males, or P(male and pregnant) by P(male). P(female given pregnant) = 1 (dividing # of pregnant females by the # of pregnant bunnies or dividing P(female and pregnant) by P(pregnant) ",
