            "answer_text": "Depends on how long undergraduate and graduate school take. Some people come in with a lot of credit from dual enrollment during high school and can finish undergraduate in a year or two. Graduate school largely depends on how long it takes to complete the research piece. Pure mathematics PhDs can take a while. Some students end up needing 7 or 8 years if they are working on a very difficult problem. Generally, it's 4 years of undergraduate courses and 2-6 years for graduate school (with 2 years being the MS level). ",
