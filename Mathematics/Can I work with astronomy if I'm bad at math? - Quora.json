            "answer_text": "It's pretty hard to do astronomy with a solid math ability because you won't have any way to figure out and explain what you are seeing. That's the bad news.  The good news is that, no matter how bad you are at math, you can get better. Just don't do it alone. The hardest part is going to be asking someone to help you. This is human nature. It is also human nature to want to help others. (By the way, this isn't wishful New Age thinking; this has become well studied). So, start asking around until you find someone who has the knowledge and time to help you and ask them. Then work hard at it. If, after you really have done everything you can, including working with multiple helpers, you can't reach the math proficiency required to be an astronomer, you can still volunteer in the field. Lots of technology and natural history museums have astronomy nights where kids and adults spend time stargazing. So, if you can't be an astronomer, maybe you can inspire someone else to be come one. But try it yourself first. (And being a professional astronomer who also works as a volunteer would be so cool as to be off the scale). ",

You would have to work very hard to go for an astronomer as maths is the basic need for any scientist especially astronomy. Even after completing your PhD when you would get a job you have to work on very long mathematical calculations manually. Very big ones which even could not be completed by calculators.   ",
