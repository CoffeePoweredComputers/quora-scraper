            "answer_text": "It refers to a partial derivative of a function of several variables. A partial derivative is its derivative with respect to one of those variables with the others held constant. It means that your differential equation contains unknown multivariable functions and their partial derivative. It's the difference between PDE (Partial Differential Equation) and ODE(Ordinary Differential Equation) which only deal with functions of a single variable and their derivatives. It's time to use LaTeX on Quora I think... It will be better for showing you some examples... But you can easily find it on the Internet... ",
