            "answer_text": "The word theorem is a mathematical one. It has the exact same meaning as the English word tautology: \u201cRedundant use of words\u201d or \u201cUnnecessary and tedious repetition\u201d However, the difference is that: It IS necessary, because it\u2019s not obvious to peopleWe are not using words, we are using axiomsAnd the idea is that we are stating something that is not immediately obvious, using definitions called axioms.  So, let\u2019s discuss what an axiom is: An axiom defines what mental structure we are working from, in order that we all agree on the same structure. For instance, I can select a few axioms: I want to work with something that supports some notion of \u201cless than or equal to\u201d ([math]\\leq[/math]) (imagine numbers with [math]a \\leq b[/math]).I want that, from every pair of objects (a, b), I can find something (c) that is less than or equal to both ([math]c \\leq a[/math] and [math]c \\leq b[/math]). The largest of which, I will call [math]c =a \\wedge b[/math]. A perfect example would be a minimum function for numbers ([math]c = \\min(a, b)[/math]). Now, I have defined 2 things ([math]\\leq[/math] and [math]\\wedge[/math]), and I\u2019ve put some constraints on them. A theorem just takes those axioms to say something else that comes from those 2 axioms. Using those 2 definitions, my theorem is just that [math]a \\wedge b = b \\wedge a[/math]. However, I MUST use my axioms to get there. So, I\u2019ll actually have to show that: if [math]c = a \\wedge b[/math] and [math]d = b \\wedge a[/math] then [math]c = d[/math]  We know from statement #2: [math]c \\leq a, c \\leq b, d \\leq a,[/math] and [math]d \\leq b[/math]. We know that we can swap the order of each of these individual statements in any way: [math]c \\leq b, d \\leq a, d \\leq b, c\\leq a[/math] This means that we can swap a and b around. We also know we are working from the same c and d with that property, because they are the largest values that agree with this.  You\u2019ll see that all I did was use the definition of #2 to state that [math]a \\wedge b = b \\wedge a[/math], and one example would be that [math]\\max(a, b) = \\max(b, a)[/math]. This is what a theorem does. It restates what isn\u2019t necessarily obvious through the axioms. ",

            "answer_text": "A theorem (in mathematics and related areas) is a mathematical statement that has been proven true. Something that has not been proven true, but is thought to be true is called a hypothesis. The proof of a theorem can depend on many things, such as previously defined axioms (statements taken to be true) or chains of logical reasoning. Methods of proof include proof by contradiction and reductio as absurdum. Sometimes, in the proof of a theorem, you might need to prove an intermediate theorem, called a lemma, or a proof may be reliant on other theorems or hypotheses. ",
