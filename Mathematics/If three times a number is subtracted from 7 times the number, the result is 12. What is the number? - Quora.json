So here is the the mathematical sentence to help us get the answer: 7X-3X=12 ; now we are going to subtract the 3 from the 7 on the left hand side of the equal sign: 4X=12 ; now we will divide each side of the equal sign by 4: 4X/4=12/4 and get X =3 ; to prove 3 is the number we are looking for, we will substitute it for X in our original sentence: 7(3)-3(3)=12 21\u20139=12 12=12 3 is our answer.
