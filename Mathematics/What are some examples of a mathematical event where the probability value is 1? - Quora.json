            "answer_text": "Short answer: \u201cProbability value\u201d is meaningless unless you define an experiment it applies to, and the set of all possible results. The only non-empty \u201cmathematical event\u201d that has an unambiguous \u201cprobability value\u201d is that set of all possible results. That value is 1.  Long answer: I\u2019m not sure you understand what an \u201cevent\u201d is, or how abstract the definition that is needed to call it \u201dmathematical\u201d has to be. But once you do understand this, even though \u201cprobability value\u201d is undefined in a real-world sense, an example of probability value=1 is trivial. A random experiment is an activity whose result is measurable but unpredictable. But you need to define one to have probability mean anything at all.Example: roll two six-sided dice.An outcome is a unique way to describe a result of your experiment. There can be lots of different ways to do so, depending on what you are looking for. An outcome can be:Example 1: The sum of the dice.Example 2: The ordered pair of numbers on the dice.A sample space is a set of outcomes that are all different, but represent every possibility. It is often represented by the symbol \u03a9.Example 1: {1,2,3,4,5,6}Example 2: The thirty-six outcomes in {(1,1),(1,2),\u2026(1,6),(2,1),\u2026 \u2026 (6,6)}.Any set of outcomes is an event.The sample space \u03a9 is an event, as is the empty set.Probability values are assigned to events. How this is done is not covered by mathematics, except that they have to satisfy three rules (these are simplified): A probability value has to be a non-negative real number.The probability value of the union of two disjoint events (i.e., no common outcomes in the sets) is the sum of the probability values of those two events.The probability value of the sample space \u03a9 is 1.",

            "answer_text": "A2A By probability = 1 I assume you mean certainty. And the only thing that is a complete certainty is something that is completed either now or in the past. An example: The probability of Donald Trump becoming President of the United States is 1. Why? Because it already happened. There are things that approach a certainty. An example: The probability that there is life somewhere besides Earth approaches a certainty. I.e., there's a very small chance that there isn't. ",

However, that doesn\u2019t mean that you\u2019re certain to draw an irrational number. When your sample spaces are sufficiently large, there\u2019s a distinction between things that happen with probability one and things that are guaranteed to happen. ",
