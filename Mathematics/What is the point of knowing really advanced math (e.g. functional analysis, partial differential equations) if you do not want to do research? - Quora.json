            "answer_text": "This is a question that reoccurs again and again, not only about mathematics but significantly more frequently about mathematics. Let us make a digression to focus on what is really important. Do I have to learn the penal code to be sure that I know how to behave in life? Should I have a Ph.D. in biology before I am starting to shout that the vaccination damages? Should I have to know to play an instrument to enjoy music? Why should we teach arithmetic now when you have a calculator in each cellular phone? Now I will try another direction. A TV presenter here in Israel claimed that teaching trigonometry is a sheer waste of time and as an example, he brought himself with the definitive remark: Look how far I reached without the minimal understanding of trigonometry. Now to the core of my answer. The most discussed question today is climate change. The description of climate change from the point of view of mathematical physics is an extremely complex model. why is this relevant to the question: because the hardcore of this model are some partial differential equations (and a simpler explanation here) Should I know all that stuff to be sure that climate change is a result of human activity and not a method of ensuring grants? Or it is enough to see the ascending curves of temperatures and demonstrate against corrupt politicians? As a fresh mathematician in one of the pioneering companies in medical imaging, I was asked to write a randomization routine to hide some Fourier transform artifacts which were annoying the physicians. I do not remember what I wrote, but it did what it was meant to do. But it was not ok. My boss approached me and asked why I wrote such a complex routine and time-consuming routine. He proposed a simpler one, and we got black and white stripes across the screen. An engineer, when requested to approximate something, will use a polynomial approximation either in Taylor or Lagrange form. Lagrange\u2019s polynomial has the problem of Runge\u2019s phenomenon. Should an engineer know about it? The functional analysis includes calculus of variations without which we cannot discuss any of the principles of minimality or maximality. Should a philosopher who writes about the way nature is built or works have some knowledge of it? The refraction of light was studied empirically from the times of Ptolemy and evolved first through Muslim science, and Kepler finally concocted a formula, which he extracted from the numbers. Descartes and Snellius obtained a better formula, which was true all the way. But it involved sinus and how could God invent such a law of nature. Then came Fermat and showed that this law could be proved with the principle of minimal time! From here on, physicists decided that an equation describes nature only if it minimizes something which will later be called energy. As a summary: I have no slaves who can give coins to those who do not want to learn geometry. However, at least those who make decisions about our future should consult the relevant scientists and less on alarmists like Greta Thunberg. ",

            "answer_text": "Several very interesting responses so far. I would say that in modern society the level of technology is such c being able to understand advanced mathematics allows a person to take appliances used every day from the realm of magic into that of understandable technology. Mathematics trains one to think logically and be able to apply that approach to many different situations. Currently May 2020 the world in in the middle of a global pandemic COVID-19. Countries Are compiling data on various pieces of information and are trying to minimise the number of deaths occurring in their country they need to know if their health systems can cope with the additional demand placed on it by this pandemic. The countries are reIying on advanced mathematical models to forecast the likely number of deaths if certain actions are taken and try different actions to see which ones provide a minimal death count, as opposed to taking no action. Governments are spending vast amount should have of money based on these mathematical models in attempts to reduce the death toll. Not everyone who needs to understand the figures and act on them is in a research role. Similarly the design / development of technical equipment requires knowledge of an understanding of complex mathematics, a person may not need to be skilled enough to create the equations etc. But they do need to be able to understand If errors have been made and for them to be corrected. without the discipline that the logical process that mathematics imposes on a person complex decisions are nothing more than hunches, which can be ignored at will. but to return to the pandemic example, one has the option to take at face value that someone somewhere knows what they are talking about and are acting honestly for everyone\u2019s best interest. believe that absolutely no errors have been made and so should trust everything that politicians have said. Or try to understand the processes and assumptions that lead up to the recommended actions. That involves an application of advanced mathematics. It is not an easy path I will agree but it does lead to a better understanding about why a certain course of action is being recommended. as a further example which is quite topical at the moment, In the USA there are scenes of people protesting against the (rather lacklustre) lockdowns that have been haphazardly applied on a state by state basis and in doing so they are demonstrating quite clearly that they have not understood why the lockdowns were imposed and the objectives that they were meant to achieve. During the american spring break there were broadcasts of students ignoring the restrictions . Interestingly afterwards the infection started to follow the paths that those students took on their return home , even one who reported that she did not believe in the virus was later confirmed as having contracted the infection. The virus does not care about a persons political beliefs, religious convictions or personal wishes, it just is. This seems to be a Something that people are unable to understand, but I believe that if they took the trouble to impartially evaluate the information that is available to them their actions would be different , as they would at least act from a position of some knowledge rather than a rather selfish I do not like these restrictions view.
