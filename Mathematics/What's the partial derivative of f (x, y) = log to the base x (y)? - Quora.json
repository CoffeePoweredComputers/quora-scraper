            "answer_text": "A partial derivative of a function is nothing but its derivative with respect to specific variables. Since the question has not mentioned anything specific, I am just going to differentiate it with respect to [math]x[/math] and [math]y[/math] separately. [math]f(x,y) = \\displaystyle\\frac{\\ln y}{\\ln x}[/math] I skipped a step here, as I just applied the change of base formula to the parent function in the question. Now, let\u2019s differentiate with respect to [math]y[/math]: [math]\\dfrac{\\partial f(x,y)}{\\partial y} = \\dfrac{\\partial \\displaystyle\\frac{\\ln y}{\\ln x}}{\\partial y}[/math] Rule #1 in partial differentiation is to check the variable you are differentiating with respect to and shove out whatever doesn\u2019t contain your variable as a constant. [math]\\dfrac{\\partial \\displaystyle\\frac{\\ln y}{\\ln x}}{\\partial y} = \\displaystyle\\frac{(\\ln y)'}{\\ln x}[/math] Since the [math]\\displaystyle\\frac{1}{\\ln x}[/math] doesn\u2019t have a [math]y[/math] term, I could shove it out of my function as a constant. [math]\\displaystyle\\frac{(\\ln y)'}{\\ln x} = \\displaystyle\\frac{1}{y \\cdot\\ \\ln x}[/math] Therefore, [math]\\dfrac{\\partial f(x,y)}{\\partial y} = \\displaystyle\\frac{1}{y\\cdot\\ \\ln x}[/math] Now, let\u2019s differentiate with respect to [math]x[/math]: [math]\\dfrac{\\partial f(x,y)}{\\partial x} = \\displaystyle\\dfrac{\\partial \\displaystyle\\frac{\\ln y}{\\ln x}}{\\partial x}[/math] Like I mentioned earlier, the [math]\\ln y[/math] term can be shoved out of the function as a constant, since it does not have an [math]x[/math] term. [math]\\dfrac{\\partial \\displaystyle\\frac{\\ln y}{\\ln x}}{\\partial x} = \\ln y \\cdot\\ \\displaystyle\\dfrac{\\partial \\displaystyle\\frac{1}{\\ln x}}{\\partial x}[/math] Apply the chain rule to find the derivative of [math]\\displaystyle\\frac{1}{\\ln x}[/math] [math]\\ln y \\cdot\\ \\dfrac{\\partial \\displaystyle\\frac{1}{\\ln x}}{\\partial x} = \\displaystyle\\frac{-\\ln y}{x \\cdot\\ (\\ln(x))^{2}}[/math] Hope this helped!
