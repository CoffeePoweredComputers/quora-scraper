If so the slope of the segments have to be equal to each other and to the line itself. Slope1 = (6\u20134)/(k-2) = 2/(k-2) Slope2 = (6\u20130)/(k-4) = 6/(k-4) Setting them equal to the known slope of (4\u20130)/(2-4) = 4/(-2) we will find k 2/(k-2) = -2 2 = (-2)*(k-2) -1 = k-2 1 = k checking with Slope2 we have 6/(k-4) = 6/(1\u20134) = 6/(-3) = -2 ",
