Assuming that the probability of drawing each marble is the same then we may proceed as follows: The total number of possible draws of 1 marble is [math]3+2+5=10[/math] and the total number of possible draws of a red marble in 1 draw is [math]3[/math] therefore the probability of getting a red in 1 draw is given by [math]\\text{probability}=\\dfrac{\\text{possible successes}}{\\text{total possible outcomes}}=\\dfrac{3}{10}\\qquad\\blacksquare[/math] This is [math]0.3[/math] as a decimal or [math]30[/math]% as a percentage.
