            "answer_text": "There are two main flavours of set theory. Axiomatic and Na\u00efve. Axiomaic set theory is about the axiomatic system of set theory itself and the main show is the so called independence proofs. These are a set of results showing that certain statements within set theory, such as continuum hypothesis, or generalised continuum hypothesis, are independent of ZFC, the widely accepted axiomatic system for set theory. Na\u00efve set theory is more about the framework ZFC provides. The main show here is showing that ZFC provides a foundation for a large chunk of mathematics. You can constructs number system within the framework of ZFC. Axiomatic set theory is very technical. It\u2019ll require a solid understanding of logic. Na\u00efve set theory, as the name suggests, is far less technical and strictly speaking does not require any prerequisites. But, and this is a big but (no pun intended) it requires mathematical maturity. If you are not already familiar with some basic mathematics, the contents of naive set theory will be abstract nonsense for you! It is difficult to appreciate it\u2019s values without prior knowledge. If you\u2019re not familiar with some basic maths, some basic constructions in na\u00efve set theory will come extrmely artificial to you. Such as ordinals, cardinals or the axiom of choice, or even the axiom of power set. On the technical side na\u00efve set theory does not really assume any prerequisites. But you can easily lose your way without mathematical maturity. ",

            "answer_text": "Wow. I\u2019ll support David Joyce\u2019s answer, but distance myself from the rest. Not that the proffered advice is wrong - just not very helpful and a bit misleading here and there. My biased opinion. For instance - throughout my mathematical life I could barely tell you what a Boolian algebra was/is. Even with a side interest in set theory, logic and computers - it was never relevant (yes, maybe I\u2019m just an ignorant rube). My journey started with Russell\u2019s Paradox and \u201cprerequisites\u201d to point-set topology - which required a basic understanding of cardinal and ordinal numbers. The \u201cbig\u201d Cantor Theorem was also a bit of an eye-opener for me as well. The logical problems sucked me into Formal Logic - but not too far. This is all in the context of set theory - not \u201cmathematical logic\u201d. If you read up on/understand Russell\u2019s Paradox (1900ish) and the ensuing dust up that eventually led to the Zermelo-Frankel Axioms (1920ish) - later modified by Bernays and now generally accepted by mathematicians NOT doing research in logic \u2026 Read up on that and you\u2019ll get a pretty good idea of what is going on. In particular - the Z-F axioms mostly appear stupidly obvious except for Regularity - which is kind of a bookkeeping thing. So if you then go back to the Peano axioms (1860ish if I recall) with Z-F in mind, I think you\u2019ll have a pretty decent idea of why the whole area of \u201cfundamentals\u201d is so avoidable for those of us that simply want to \u201cdo some math\u201d. (Believe it or not - I\u2019m not being disparaging. I just find it ironic that the mathematical edifice is built on quicksand. Yet still stands.) However - the boogie man is Goedel (1930ish) who was not only crazy but managed to prove that the rest of us - who thought we could count - were also crazy. Goedel is responsible for the Logician-Full-Employment Movement. Petting my cat calms me when I contemplate that I can\u2019t count let alone conceive of ineffable cardinals. ",

If you still have trouble with algebra, then you'll have trouble with symbolic logic and set theorya basic understanding of proofs, and your comments to the question show that you do. A course in Euclidean geometry is plenty, but if you've seen proofs in other courses, then that's good tooThere's no reason why a high school student couldn't learn the basics of logic and set theory.  Once you understand the basics, then you'll be ready to learn more. ",

            "answer_text": "Learn basic boolean algebra first, to get a sense of the logical operations as arithemetic operations of a special sort. Then formal logic just adds quantifiers and some mostly completely obvious deduction rules. One of the rules is non-obvious, the generalization rule from a seemingly special case to a forall statement, when you have a free variable--- this is the most important rule, it is what makes logic superior to Aristotelian logic, you get out more than you put in. I found the introduction in Paul Cohen's book \"Set Theory and the Continuum Hypothesis\" very fast and complete. It might be good to go to a book which covers deductions using sequent calculus too. Learning to program a computer is useful, because the goal is ultimately to do deduction on a computer. If you write a code for deduction, even a bad one, you will learn what it's all about (I never did this, but I should). ",

That is not to say it would be easy, it will be quite challenging (even fore math undergrads), the style might be not what you are used to in school, very detail oriented. If you can organize your thoughts and have the mental discipline to work through the texts, it should be possible with a bit of hard work. Most of the texts or chapters on set theory will introduce the various definitions and concepts as they go, the subject will be more or less self contained. Good luck! ",

            "answer_text": "Yes that should be possible. Firstly, (at least in Germany) an introduction to logic and set theory is the start of most courses on linear algebra and/or analysis and therefore has to be enough for people that just have school knowledge. Secondly, after I learned there about set theory( and especially the cardinality of different sets), I read a book about set theory and if you are interested in math, I would recommend you to do so to. You can learn a lot about (a bit counter-intuitive) relations between e.g. the natural numbers and the integers and about Hilbert\u2019s Hotel or see the Sierpi\u0144ski carpet and the Cantor set. Later you will maybe arrive at more complicated set theories like the Zermelo-Fraenkel theory or the von Neumann-Bernays-G\u00f6del theory, which will require some more than basic knowledge, but if you arrive there, this should be doable. Have fun! ",
