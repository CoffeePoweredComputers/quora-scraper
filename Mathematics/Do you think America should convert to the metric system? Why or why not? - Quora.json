            "answer_text": "Fully? No. I think it is switched about the right amount. Industry has switched in areas where it is profitable, the government mandates metric on some items that helps with exports and imports, and the sciences that constantly deal with unit conversions in their work are pretty much fully switched. The US has already switched in most domains where people have to think and convert units regularly. Most laboratories in the US will only use US Customary units on things like the room thermometer, and car engines have been built to metric standards since the middle of the 20th century. In those domains, using non-base-10 units but a base-10 counting system just creates lots of unnecessary extra thinking. Most people though do not regularly have to convert units. In my everyday life in the US, I only ever had to convert cups, quarts, and gallons, and then inches and feet. I know that 5,280 ft are in a mile, but I have never felt the need to calculate my elevation in miles, or measure the distance from Washington (state) to Utah in feet. Celsius has become a lot less useful since the second half of the 19th century. Chemists no longer measure everything in relation to water. Using Celsius causes extra conversion steps in chemistry because laws of volume and pressure require the temperature to be expressed in Kelvins. You have to convert from Celsius to Kelvins to use Charles's law or the Ideal gas law, for instance. The reason why is that Celsius, like Fahrenheit, has negative integers and is not based on the actual absolute zero temperature. As a linguist, I never really have to convert units in my academic life. Living in Australia, I sometimes figure out the distances on the roads in centimetres when I am extremely bored. My phone will say \u201814 km until exit 14\u2019 and then I think \u2018oh, only 1,400,000 cm to go,\u2019 and sometimes I joke to people in a car telling them the directions in centimetres. Once I figured out the wavelength of the colour red was between 700 and 635 nanometers. Let\u2019s say\u2026 680 nanometers is something we would all say is red. I am 174 centimetres tall. 1 cm is 10,000,000 nanometers, making me 1,740,000,000 nanometers tall. Thus I am a little over 2,558,823.529 times taller than the colour red\u2019s wavelength. That would have been harder to do in US Customary or Imperial units admittedly. For someone who doesn\u2019t build car engines, sell bags of flour, or work in a lab dealing with quantities of solids, liquids, or gases, the ability to convert units is a parlour trick outside of the kitchen or the grocery store. In the kitchen and grocery store, the only useful conversions really grammes to kilogrammes. You don\u2019t really get anywhere determining the height of a cereal box in kilometres, although, it is possible for me to do on the spot, and I find it somewhat entertaining. As a linguist though, I do have to deal with idiosyncratic human systems all the time. They are everywhere. Not every language has them, but most languages I have seen do. I have seen people on Quora, especially scientists, writing that US Customary/Imperial units waste time and energy because it forces users to think more. This argument I am completely unphased by. I see idiosyncratic systems everywhere and these systems are not erased by writing base-10 numerals. There is an exotic language spoken in Eastern Canada, Western Europe, French Guiana, and a smattering of island countries and countries in Africa called \u2018French.\u2019 You may or may not have heard of it. In French, the numerals are written in base-10 like in every other European country, but between 70 and 99 things get very weird, and this repeats itself into infinity (e.g., 170\u2013199 things are weird, same with 1,370\u20131,399, 1,000,000,070\u201399 and so on). The first twenty are pretty standardly irregular for a language in Europe. What is a bit odd is that they become regular at seventeen (that is 17) of all numbers.

Even using metric it would be 199m Cent quatre-vingt dix-neuf m\u00e8tres \u2018Hundred four-twenty ten nine meters.\u2019 One system of relevance to my PhD dissertation and overall research is the behaviour of Polish nouns when they are quantified. The system is more complicated than this, but the relevant rules are basically: 1\u2014singular and the number agrees with the gender: jeden dom \u2018one house (masculine)\u2019jedna noc \u2018one night (feminine)\u2019jedne jab\u0142ko \u2018one apple (neuter)\u20192\u20134, 22\u201324, 32\u201334, 42, 44 etc\u2014nominative plural, with the number two agreeing with feminine gender: dwa, trzy, cztery dom-y \u2018two (masc/neut), three, four houses (masc)\u2019dwe, trzy, cztery noc-e \u2018two (fem), three, four nights (fem)\u2019dwa, trzy, cztery jab\u0142k-a \u2018two (masc/neut), three, four apples (neut pl)\u20195\u201321; 21\u201331 etc\u2014genitive plural. Masculine nouns ending in hard consonants take -\u00f3w, masculine and feminine ending in soft consonants take -i/y, and neuters and feminine ending in vowels lose the final vowel: pi\u0119\u0107 dom-\u00f3w \u2018five houses (masc gen-PL)pi\u0119\u0107 noc-y \u2018five nights (gen-pl ends in a soft consonant)pi\u0119\u0107 jab\u0142ek \u2018five apples (gen-pl ends in a vowel, loses the final vowel)There are a handful of masculine nouns like dentysta~dentyst\u00f3w \u2018dentist\u2019 which take -\u00f3w in the genitive plural despite ending in a vowel like a feminine noun and others like m\u0119\u017cczyzna~m\u0119\u017cczyzn that lose the final vowel like a feminine noun. Russian has a similar thing going on, but numbers ending in -1 except 11 take singular nouns, and numbers ending in 2\u20134 except 12\u201314 take genitive singular. Bailyn & Nevins (2008) conducted an experiment on Russian speakers using nonce words (fake words that end in Russian-like endings\u2014written in dual Cyrillic-Latin) and discovered many speakers did not behave as expected (data written in Latin alphabet, but they used Cyrillic & Latin orthography in their experiment):  Recently, I conducted a similar study on Polish and got similar results (I outlined my methodology a bit here: Brian Collins's post in Linguistics Corner). I am currently re-working the experiment though as lo\u0144go is a bit too weird of a word, and forda is too much like ford, a real word:  When I ran a non-parametric correlation between my data and real Polish words, I did get a statistically significant correlation (which suggests that Bailyn & Nevins (2008) assertion that speakers cannot be informed by classes of words, but only a single word in a derivation, is wrong):  This system is certainly so complicated though that most native speakers are producing unexpected responses, but the system exists. To me, idiosyncratic systems are just a part of language and culture, not something inferior that needs to be replaced. I don\u2019t think that French speakers are backwards for using base-20 between the numbers 70 and 99, nor do I think speakers of languages with counting systems more complicated than singular and plural are backwards. Likewise, I don\u2019t think it is inferior that 12 inches are in a ft, or 5,280 ft in one mile. Certainly harder to deal with than base-10, but I don\u2019t think people who use that system (the system I grew up with) are prone to being mentally inferior or something. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, definitely. By doing so, US would be finally compatible with the world trade and commerce. Standardization to international units, measurements and weights would be an immense saving to manufacturing and packaging industries. Moreover, a concise base-10 everywhere is far easier for people to understand than the pseudo-random factors in the American unit system. Decimals are far more easier to understand and conceptualize than fractions, and decimals make calculations easy. The Chinese understood the assets of decimals already 1,000 years earlier than Europeans. Likewise, binding the basic units to common natural phenomena, properties of water (the elixir of life!) and mathematics and making them fully compatible with each other makes things easier.
