            "answer_text": "Let the cost price of 12 mangoes are x Then the selling price of 16 mangoes will also be x Now take the LCM of 12 and 16, which will come 48. Now find out the CP of 48 mangoes= 4x SP of 48 mangoes=3x Loss=4x-3x=x Loss%= (Loss\u00d7100)/CP = (x\u00d7100)/4x = 25% Hence the answer will be loss of 25%. ",
