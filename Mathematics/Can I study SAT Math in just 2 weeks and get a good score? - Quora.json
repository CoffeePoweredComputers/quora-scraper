            "answer_text": "Just want to share my personal experience with you. I bought the Barron's workbook for Math 2. There are 19 chapters and a few practice tests. The whole book will probably take 1 week to finish if you spend 1\u20132 hours a day, which I think you should be able to finish in two weeks. I took the practice tests and always got around 700, and i was so upset because that's not what I want to get, and other than the workbook, i didn't study anything. Luckily, I found the real test to be very easy and I got a 800. Summary\uff1a I don't know about other books, but the Barron's one really helped me. Just go over the chapters ( won't take long) and if you are able to score a 700, I think you are very likely to get a 800 on the real test. Hope this helps and best luck on the test! ",

            "answer_text": "If you went to a school where you learnt all the topics the SAT tests, you could prepare for it in a few days by doing some past papers, but since that's not your case, you should take the simple approach I do (I'm from a different academic system where a few topics are not covered), go to the SAT website and look at all the topics being covered, you should recognize most of them, those that you don't, for example maybe exponential equations, polynomials, surds etc should be pinpointed and learnt individually from either the Internet or a book, as there is no time to read the entire book. Remember, the normal Math SAT does not have hard questions, if you are familiar with a concept, and you've slept the day before, you should be able to answer that questions, so don't be scared. After you've roughly learnt all the concepts just practice like there's no tomorrow, from questions or tests on the Internet. Math Test (SAT Math Section Information) Good Luck :) ",

            "answer_text": "Keep Practicing! Every time you solve a set of sums and get a few wrong,try doing those sums again and try and figure out the concept behind the sum. In this fashion progress topic by topic and if some topic starts seeming easy try advanced sums. Hope this helps! Good Luck! ",
