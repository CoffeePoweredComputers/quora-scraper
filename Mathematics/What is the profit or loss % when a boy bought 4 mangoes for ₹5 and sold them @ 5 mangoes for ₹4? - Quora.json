            "answer_text": "Always compare Selling price and Cost price for the same Quantity of the particular item ( here mangoes is the item ) . Generally, in the answers to such questions people compare CP and SP for 1 item but you can compare for any fixed amount ( 100 , 200 , 541 , 98 , etc. ) let's say for x amount. CP of 4 mangoes = rs. 5 CP of x mangoes = rs. (5/4)*x SP of 5 mangoes = rs. 4 SP of x mangoes = rs. (4/5)*x Now (5/4)*x>(4/5)*x ( x being a positive whole number ) Hence there occurs a loss as CP > SP ( for x mangoes ) . Loss = [(5/4)-(4/5)]*x = (9/20)*x So loss % = (loss/CP) * 100 = (9/20)*(4/5)*100 = 36 ",
