If you mean the probability for each event separately, there is not enough information to answer the question. For example, if there is one defective bulb followed by 49 good bulbs in regular sequence, and you take 200 bulbs in a row, you will always have exactly four defective bulbs. On the other hand, suppose the defective bulbs come in long runs. Then you will almost always get zero defective bulbs, but if you get one, you will usually get a large number. ",
