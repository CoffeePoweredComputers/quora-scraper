            "answer_text": "I\u2019m bored, so let\u2019s give it a go. According to the calculation rule, decision and multiple goes first, add and abstract goes after. And do it from left to right. Thus, 2\u20132*3+3 Do the multiple first, then you got 2\u20136+3 And then you can do the abstract and add now, which leads to the answer -1 Just in case you don\u2019t know what that mean, it is called negative one, it\u2019s a negative number , it is a number below zero. Got it? Peace out~~ ",

These questions are repetitive and boring and anyone who needs to ask them is too young to sit at a computer, log in to Quora and type them out. Those who answer them, while well meaning, would have to admit to either being slightly gullible or having a strong competitive desire to win the prize for answering the most questions. Here\u2019s my question. Is there one? ",
