            "answer_text": "From Wikipedia: Logic (from ancient greek Logike) originally meaning \"the word\" or \"what is spoken\" What is a language? It is something you use to describe things. We use language to describe our feelings, wishes, observations. The use language a lot to explain other people how something works, e.g. in user manuals of all your home appliances. We use mathematics a lot to describe things - numbers are used to describe the price of stuff in the supermarket, or the speed of your car. In a lot of engineering, we need even more maths, to describe e.g. the behavior of the motor in your car or the weather. It is important to understand that mathematics is a formal language - it has very strict rules how to describe things, and it can be very concise. The languages we use in our daily life are natural languages, and they are very different, in that are very often vague, unclear, but also colorful, with double meanings etc. Other examples of formal languages are programming languages. Most people are not very comfortable with formal languages, which is probably one of the reasons that they find it odd to think of mathematics as a language. Some even say that maths is a universal language, meaning everyone can understand mathematics. And of course this is true for some parts of mathematics - every can count. ",

            "answer_text": "I think that we have to go back and blame Galileo Galilee for that, because of his statement, \u201cMathematics is the language with which God wrote the universe\u201d. Now, I\u2019m not going to get into the entire religious debate here, but he was using \u201clanguage\u201d here to describe the phenomena for which we ask today, \u201cWhy The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Mathematics in the Natural Sciences?\u201d The secondary reason is that one of the results of mathematics has been a symbolic language. The problem that most people don\u2019t understand at first is that the symbolic language is not exactly \u201cstandardized\u201d but has SOME common usage which is well known without much explanation (like the algebraic operators and numbers). It\u2019s really deeper than that, as it\u2019s the language has resulted from studying logic.  However, like monetary notes used to be with gold, such is mathematical symbols today, in that everything must be backed with a human-language counterpart. Those definitions need to be rigorous too. Therefore, we have words for things in mathematics with meanings that don\u2019t match with everyday speech (spectra, group, glom, etc.). In this way, math also has an idiomatic syntax even in human languages. ",
