However, I\u2019m sure I can at least narrow down the answers to hopefully 1 value for each, but with these kind of equations, you can never be sure! Simply by the laws of equations, (Sorry I can\u2019t remember the name!) your goal is to isolate the x and the y variables as much as possible. Therefore, the order of operations states exponents come first with the last numbers. (2x-y)^2=(2x-y)(2x-y) This is actually quite similar to FOIL, which I enjoyed learning! 2x * 2x = (4x)(4x)=16x(x). Right now, we have 16x(x). Now, we have to multiply \u201c-y and  Continue Reading",
