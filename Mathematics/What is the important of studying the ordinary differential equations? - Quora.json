            "answer_text": "Besides because it is a requirement for an engineering degree, I used differential equations to model the gas pressure dynamic behavior of production physical vapor deposition vacuum chambers. From the simulation, I was able to select suitable components and predict how long it would take for the gas pressure to stabilize. With additional calculations, I was then able to calculate all the machine and process steps. Thus, I could estimate the tool\u2019s production rate for given cathode sputtering rates and substrate configurations. ",

            "answer_text": "Differential equations appear in a wide range of problems in physics and science. They are use to model many of the phenomenon that occur around us and we need to solve differential equations to analyse those phenomena. Some simple examples of modelling using differential equations include: motion of spring-mass systems and simple harmonic motion.mixture of substances and finding concentration.Newton's law of cooling.Population growth analysis.Dynamics: finding acceleration, velocity and position of a body.Analysis of current in capacitive resistive circuits and inductive-resistive circuits.",
