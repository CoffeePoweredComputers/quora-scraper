            "answer_text": "Best way is to get a degree in mathematics like doing a B. Sc or M. Sc . That will equip you with all that you will need later on as a mathematician . Since you are going to do commerce stream in you high-school you are significantly limiting yourself to many diversities of mathematics . Also as you are from commerce back-ground you won\u2019t able to find most college admitting you to a mathematics degree . So i guess your best option is to choose science stream . But if you are adamant on choosing commerce , then you can get B. Com or B/B.Sc Economics from any college after that you will be have to do an M. Sc from Economics degree . In economics you can study mathematical topics such probability , statistics or some combination business related mathematics . Then do a Ph-D in economics in topics like probability & statistics .Though you obtain Ph-D economics you can call yourself a mathematician . This is most you can get if are from commerce background . ",

            "answer_text": "First stop doing things as you were doing them before like studying for getting marks or for becoming topper . Study maths because you love doing it. Untill now you were only understanding concepts and solve questions based on that ,now try to do something like trying to make your own questions based on that concept ,try spending more time on thinking on that concept and understand why they were actually made . While solving questions try to learn something that others don't . Many of us just solve a sum and if we get answer we become happy for some time and then go to next sums.but after solving them we must think what else variations can be done to sum and it can be made more tricky . Like this try building your observation power and try to see things that other can't . And also develop a good patience as it is the most important requirement of a mathematician or a scientist . Gather a lot information about your goal as by doing it you will be able to visualise your goal and able to create your own vision . Like this keep on trying in some time you will notice that you will be changed !!! If u get something that u think will help others pls share it to me !! ",
