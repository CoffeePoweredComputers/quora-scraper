            "answer_text": "To solve this problem we must find the fill rate of each pipe in ltr/hr or gals/hr (whatever we are working in), add those 2 together then devide the result into the capacity of the tank. In our problem we only know one variable, the time it takes one pipe to fill the tank. Let's define some place holders for the unknown entries\u2026 Tank capacity = c Time to fill tank by first pipe = p Fill rate for first pipe = c/p Fill rate for second pipe = c/6 So total fill rate = c/p + c/6 = (pc + 6c)/6p Now we need to devide c by the fill rate\u2026 c/((pc + 6c)/6p)) = 6cp/pc+6c Time taken to fill tank is 6cp/pc+6c where c is tank capacity and p is time for the first pipe to fill the tank.
