            "answer_text": "Hi!Like others, I can also tell various ways and books to read and go through the concepts and try the questions, though they are not wrong, the fact is first you need to change your mentality. Why are others able to do the same thing that we aren\u2019t, despite knowing the fact that we all have the same brain? This happens because we don\u2019t wanna adapt ourselves according to it because accept the fact that we are not made for it. I don\u2019t deny the fact that every individual has their interest and specialized areas where they are master as compared to others. Most of the students are afraid of Mathematics or they have Maths Phobia. Why?Because Mathematics is a labor-intensive subject and you are asked to answer all those questions that seem to be obvious to us isn't. Always Remember..!!\u201cObvious is the most dangerous word in mathematics.\u201d \u2013 Eric Temple Bell If you really wanna crack the exam and excel mathematics, then you have to keep yourself motivated. You will fail many times but every time you need to raise yourself and try another problem then only you will be ready to take up your Entrance exam especially the Mathematics section. Do not forget to clear all your basics not all at one time but gradually as and when you see a question related to a particular topic and you are not able to recall the basic concept behind the question without wasting time looking for the concept involved. This way you will be able to retain it for a long time and will be able to apply the concept in similar types of questions. Always keep in mind, basics are essential to the building. Here is the plan to follow to study Mathematics for SAT exam: Analyze: First and the foremost thing is to go through the SAT Maths syllabus and try to analyze your strengths and weakness. This will help you to segregate the entire syllabus into a strong and weak section. Practice: Once you are done with segregation, pick up your strong section and out of that pick the topic that you find easy. Don\u2019t feel ashamed to start with the easiest question as this will boost your confidence and gradually move to the next level of questions. This way you will be able to finish your strong part in less time. By this time you will get some confidence as you have solved questions and done with some portion of the syllabus.Now Move onto your weaker section and do the same exercise as you did with the entire syllabus. Again look for strong and weaker sections and start with strong sections and then move onto the last portion. This way you will be cover-up faster. Now you can devote time to your weaker sections. Time Management: Since you are done with your syllabus, now start with time management. Try to practice a different set of questions and Mock Tests in a particular period. This will help you to practice questions within a specific period. Look for the sections where you made a mistake and try to rectify it in the next mock test you take. This way you will make yourself ready for the real battleground. Key to crack Mathematics..!!\u201cThe only way to learn mathematics is to do mathematics.\u201d \u2013 Paul Halmos Best of Luck..!! ",

            "answer_text": "Think of it this say, you\u2019re asking how to excel at math within the tightly defined box called \u201cSAT math\u201d. The good news is that SAT math is securely limited within definite boundaries called \u201cstandardized\u201d levels up to the high school diploma. Start with the College Board\u2019s own clear definitions of their math test: Math Test. If you need a coach or tutor, be sure to get the help you need to understand those fundamental concepts. Again, I emphasize the fact that the SAT is a handful of fundamental concepts that you can indeed master. Too often students feel like the SAT is this eternal pit of neverending questions, but remember, there are only so many things a standardized exam for all the high schools in the U.S. can cover. Good luck! ",

The SAT math is mostly algebra/ geometry/ some basic trigonometry so focus on those and dont overthink too much, if a question is taking you longer than a minute or two to answer then skip it and go back. Make sure you know what your calculator can do and how to use it also. ",
