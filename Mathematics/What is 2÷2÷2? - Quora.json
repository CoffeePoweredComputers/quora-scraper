            "answer_text": "As per rule of mathematics, operation should began from left moving towards right and using BODMAS rule division operation has higher preference of all the other possible operations of the given equation. So applying both said rules the evaluation goes as - (2\u00f72)\u00f72 = 1\u00f72 = 0.5 We first performed the left most division operation and then the right one. In programming logic, too, the basic maths fundamentals are applied to develop an algorithm to solve the given equation. Just difference is in variable declaration of the output variable. If output variable is declared as int r then r = 0 for above evaluation and if declare as float r then r = 0.5 for above evaluation. Believer!! ",

            "answer_text": "Since the question has \u2018/\u2019 operator throughout, we can consider the evaluation of expression in two different ways as shown below -     or,     . . . If the evaluation follows a left to right scan, then the first approach is applicable.If the evaluation follows a right to left scan, then the second approach is applicable.In general, the above expression has two solutions (i.e. 0.5 and 2) . Hope it helps! :) ",
