            "answer_text": "Mathematics we deal in electronics: This set of 20 modules was designed for use primarily to help teach and reinforce the basic mathematics skills in electronics classes. The modules are based on electronics competencies that require mathematics skills, as determined by a panel of high school electronics and mathematics teachers.Each module consists of one or two pages of basic information, including a brief discussion of the electronics concepts involved, formulas, and examples showing how the formulas are used.Following the information sheet(s) are several sheets of problems for the students to work; solutions are included.Also included with the modules is a \"teach sheet\" of basic mathematics rules, and a module on metrics.Topics covered by the modules are the following: mathematics rules, broadcast frequency, calculating cost of power, calculating power, circuit value, decibels, frequency, horsepower, impedance, instantaneous sine voltage, metrics, Ohm's Law, Op-amplifiers, reactance, rectification, resistance (parallel), resistance (series), transformer ratios, voltage, and wavelength. (KC)Electronics and electrical engineering degree programs with communication concentrations are typically offered from the bachelor's to the doctoral level. These programs prepare students for careers as systems engineers, research engineers, controls engineers, communication engineers and electronic engineers, as well as researchers and university professors.The programs are rigorous with an emphasis in math and science.Students study topics such as wireless, digital, data and fiber optic communications. Students should look for programs accredited by ABET.Engineers who offer their services directly to the public must be licensed by the state, which typically requires graduation from an ABET-accredited program.Associate's degrees in electronic engineering technology are also available. These programs prepare students to find employment as technicians engaged in the service and repair of equipment, such as broadcast television, radio and other telecommunication systems. Technicians also assist engineers. Coursework may include equipment soldering, electrical circuit analysis, semiconductor devices and circuits, digital systems, industrial safety, microcomputer systems and electronic control systems. Employers range from research and development labs to electronic equipment manufacturers, as well as colleges and universities, government agencies, medical labs and hospitals. ",

            "answer_text": "Currently pursuing electronics and telecommunications so I m definitely qualified to answer this question. Assuming that you are familiar with basic +12 mathematics (algebra, geometry, calculus including integration, differentiation and also topics like matrices) For FIRST YEAR Mumbai university or for most of the universities have the same mathematics for all the branches which include following topics :complex numbers including hyperbolic function which is pretty easy to understandmatrices and numerical methodsdifferential calculuspartial differentiation, expansion of series and curve fittingbeta gamma functionsCauchy\u2019s homogeneous linear differential equation and Legendre\u2019s differential equation, Method of variation of parameters.most important part is multiple integrals. double triple integrals for calculation of surface area and volume.For SECOND YEAR and THIRD YEAR , I will summarize some topics for you including second and third year mathematics :Laplace transformFourier series and Bessel functionsvector algebra (grad curl divergence theorems)complex variables (conformal mapping etc)calculus of variationlinear algebra (vector spaces and matrix theory)complex integrationprobability theory (literally everything thing about it )transform theory (D.T.F.T, D.F.T, filter design)So basically, if you are in electronics and telecommunications or pure electronics you will have plenty of maths even more other than branches like mechanical, electrical , IT, comps etc Edit : and yeah also z-transform. How could I forget that ;) ",
