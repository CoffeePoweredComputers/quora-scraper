            "answer_text": "You put Ordinary Differential Equations in italics and capitalized the words, which might indicate you're referring to the title of a specific book rather than referring generally to studying the mathematical objects in question. In the US,  math, physics and engineering students typically take an introductory course in ordinary differential equations in their second year after taking a year of calculus and (at least in my case, sometimes these are reversed) after an introductory course in linear algebra. To study the material in a text such as Vladimir Arnold's Ordinary Differential Equations Ordinary Differential Equations: V.I. Arnold, Richard A. Silverman: 9780262510189: Amazon.com: Books which is the book of that title I am familiar with, you would want a bit more mathematical sophistication specifically definitions, theorems and proofs rather than just performing calculations. You would want to have taken an introductory course in differential equations and have some understanding of topology (metric topology is sufficient, but a basic understanding of  differential topology and manifolds would be helpful), linear algebra. Some experience with real analysis and/or abstract algebra would also help.It's a text designed for an upper division undergraduate major in mathematics. Manifolds, tangent spaces and diffeomorphisms are all used in the first chapter, so you should know what those are or be willing to learn quickly in order to keep up. ",

            "answer_text": "I can\u2019t imagine trying to do ODEs without having learned differential and integral calculus first. If you are taking a structured curriculum there might be other pre-requisites built in to a first course in ODEs) like multivariate calculus or linear algebra. If that\u2019s the case, don\u2019t argue about it. (Though I think it\u2019s a poor course design for engineers) think about it this way: in differential calculus you learn what dy/dx is in integral calculus you learn how to solve dy/dx = f(x) in odes you learn how to solve dy/dx = f(x,y) (at least in some special cases) So in ODEs you need to know what a function of two variables is, f(x,y), but that doesn\u2019t require all the machinery of multivariate calculus. If the first course generalizes to multiple dependent variables, so y is an n vector, then the course is likely to expect linear algebra. But it\u2019s perfectly reasonable to just go to n=2 and skip the LA. Anyway LA is really useful only if f(x,y) = A y + b, is linear in y. ",
