            "answer_text": "Let us use and massage some words\u2026 Consider the definition of subset: x is a subset of y if and only if for all sets z, if z is an element of x then z is an element of y. Then x is not a subset of y if and only if it is not the case that for all z, if z is an element of x, then z is an element of y. Furthermore, x is not a subset of y if and only if there is a z such that it is not the case that if z is an element of x, then z is an element of y. Therefore x is not a subset of y if and only if there exists a z such that z is an element of x and z is not an element of y. To arrive at a contradiction, let us assume for the sake of argument that 0 is not a subset of 0. I will use 0 to denote the empty set. We just saw that this means there exists a set z such that z is an element of 0 and z is not an an element of 0. However, no set z satisfies this description because, referring to the definition of emptiness, we cannot have \u201cz is an element of 0\", let alone \u201cz is an element of 0 and z is an element of 0.\u201d This contradiction implies that it is not the case that 0 is not a subset of 0. Therefore, 0 is a subset of 0. QED. ",

            "answer_text": "Why is the empty set a subset of itself? All sets are subsets of themselves, but not \u2018proper\u2019 subsets. One definition of \u2018subset\u2019 is that all elements of the subset are elements of the original set. All of no elements is no elements, so the empty set satisfies the definition vacuously. In fact the empty set is a subset of every set. Can you find an element of the empty set that is not in any set? If you don\u2019t like these, just think of the empty set as a special case and change the definition of \u2018subset\u2019 adding \u2018and the empty set is a subset of every set\u2019. ",
