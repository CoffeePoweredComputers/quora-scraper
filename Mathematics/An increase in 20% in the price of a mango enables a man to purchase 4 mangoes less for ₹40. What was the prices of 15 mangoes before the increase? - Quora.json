            "answer_text": "It can be seen from the question that due to increase in the price of mango by 20%, what was available for \u20b940/- now costs \u20b948/- and hence 4 mangoes that now cost \u20b98/- less could be got. This means that the increased price of 4 mangoes is \u20b98/-. Hence before price rise each mango would have cost: 100\u00d72/120 =5/3 before price rise. Hence 15 mangoes would have cost him 5/3\u00d715 =\u20b925/- before price rise ",

            "answer_text": "Key concepts: Simple Equations, %change concept Let the price of 1 mango before increase = x. With increase in 20 % price, the new price of 1 mango = 1.2x Equation can be setup as: Mangoes which can be bought from 40 Rs = 40/Price of each mango. 40/x - 40/1.2x = 4 (40/x){0.2/1.2} = 4 => 40 = 4*0.6x = 24 x => x = 40/24 =5/3 rs So price of 15 mangoes before increase = 15 x = 15 * 5/3 = 25 Rs ",
