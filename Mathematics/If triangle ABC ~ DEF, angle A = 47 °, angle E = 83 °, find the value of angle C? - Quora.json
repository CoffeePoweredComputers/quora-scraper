            "answer_text": "Oh, I\u2019ll take a swing. It\u2019s only been mumble-mumble decades since I was in geometry class. Similarity means same interior angles, just that the sides are proportionally longer or shorter. So if you have angles of 47 and 83 degrees, that adds up to 120 degrees. Since the sum of interior angles of a triangle (in plane geometry, which I suppose I should stipulate) is 180 degrees, that means the remaining angle is 60 degrees. ",
