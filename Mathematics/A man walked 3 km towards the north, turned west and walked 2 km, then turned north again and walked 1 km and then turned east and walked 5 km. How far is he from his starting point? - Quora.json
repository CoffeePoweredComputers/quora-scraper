            "answer_text": "Q: A man walked 3 km towards the north, turned west and walked 2 km, then turned north again and walked 1 km and then turned east and walked 5 km. How far is he from his starting point? Solution:  Starting point P. 1st travelling towards North from point P to A=S1= 3 km2nd travelling towards West from A to B = S2= 2 km3rd travelling towards North from B to C = S3= 1 km4th travelling towards East from C to E1 =S4= 5 kmJoining all these points, finally we get a triangle from starting point P to the final destination E1 after covering a distance of 5 km to the East. The position of the traveller is now point E1, North-East (NE) position which is a diagonal measurement of the trianglar path from starting point P to E1. Starting point P to North-East position E1: Distance covered =d2= S1 + S3 d2 = 3 km + 1 km = 4 km Length of triangluar side from West to East DE1: d1 = DE1= S4 - S2 = 5 - 2 = 3 km Using Pythagorean\u2019s theorem: d1^2 + d2^2 = PE1^2 4^2 + 3^2 = PE1^2 PE1^2 = 16 + 9 = 25 PE1 = 5 km Answer: The traveller is at a distance PE1 = 5 km from starting point to the end point E1 in the North-East direction.

            "answer_text": "STOP ASKING QUORANS TO DO YOUR HOMEWORK! This is probably one of the easiest questions in physics, because you use simple geometry and trigonometry to solve it, since it involves a simple triangle. If you can\u2019t even get past this question and decide you\u2019re going to really learn this stuff, then you need to walk to your records office right now and change your major to art. There\u2019s a reason they call physics the most difficult subject: BECAUSE IT IS! Go to your professor for help, but stop trying to pass off a simple homework question as if it\u2019s something else. Because we\u2019re not going to answer them! If you still insist on going online for help, then go to physics.stackexchange.com. Those guys can help you without telling you the answer, and that is the last thing you need right now. You need to know how to work through your theories regarding displacement. Good-luck and cheers. ",
