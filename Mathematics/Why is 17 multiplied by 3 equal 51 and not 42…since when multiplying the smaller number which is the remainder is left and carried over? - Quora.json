Multiplying 17 by 3 is the same as adding 17+17+17, or 17, 3 times. There is no dispute that this equals 51. what your are proposing is a flawed process. If you are going to multiply the \u201cones place\u201d (7) by 3, then you need to multiply the \u201ctens place\u201d (1) by 3 as well. 3x7 = 21 3x10 = 30 21+30 = 51 ",

You now have 3 x 17: 51 Here\u2019s another way to look at it: 17 = 10 + 7. 3 x (10 + 7) = 3x10 + 3x7 = 30 + 21 = 51. ",
