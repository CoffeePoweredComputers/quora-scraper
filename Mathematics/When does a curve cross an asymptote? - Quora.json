            "answer_text": "Here I am trying to show a taste of math definition and to bring some insights into what a definition means. In theory, this should be taught in high schools, but it\u2019s not! A curve may cross its asymptote any number of times, including 0 (that is, not crossing) and infinite times. For example, the graph of the function y = (sinx)/x. It crosses the horizontal asymptote y = 0 infinite times. Mr. Philip Lloyd wrote below: \u201cA horizontal asymptote is a horizontal line that the graph of a function approaches, but never touches as x approaches negative or positive infinity.\u201d This is not quite correct and is misleading. Why does the asymptote never touch the curve? What does it mean \u201cthe graph of a function approaches the line\u201d? Becomes closer? How much closer? In mathematics, definitions are EXTREMELY important and they must be strict and precise. There is no space to flexibility in a definition! I mean you cannot drop anything and you cannot add anything in the definition. The correct definition of an asymptote is: An asymptote for a curve is a straight line, such that the distance between this curve and the asymptote tends to zero as the point on the curve tends to infinity. Remark 1. \u201cThe point on the curve tends to infinity\u201d means that the distance between the point and the origin tends to infinity. Remark 2. \u201cThe distance tends to zero\u201d means that the LIMIT of the distance equals zero, so the LIMIT is the main part of the definition. Remark 3. This implies that to understand what asymptote means, one has to understand what limit is, that is, one must know the definition of the limit. Remark 4. Notice that we consider the distance between the point on the curve and the line as a function of the point distance to the origin because talking abut the limit, we mean the limit of the function. Remark 5. We should understand what \u201cthe distance between this curve and the asymptote\u201d mean. In this case, it means the minimum distance between the point on the curve and the points on the straight line, that is, the distance between the point and the line . In the definition of the asymptote, there is nothing about touching or crossing the line by the curve. A curve may cross its asymptote any number of times, including 0 (that is, not crossing) and infinite times. For example, the graph of the function y = (sinx)/x. It CROSSES the horizontal asymptote y = 0 INFINITE times. The curve y = (sinx)(sinx)/x TOUCHES its horizontal asymptote y = 0 INFINITE amount of times. ",

            "answer_text": "Some people misunderstand the dictionary definition of an asymptote. A horizontal asymptote is a horizontal line that the graph of a function approaches, but never touches as x approaches negative or positive infinity. Sometimes a curve can pass through an asymptote! Remember, an asymptote is what a curve approaches for \u201clarge\u201d values of x   So although the curve does approach y = 1 for large values of x it can cross the line y = 1 for small values of x as shown above. You just need to check if the equation y = 1 has any solutions. Or in general, if y = f(x) approaches y = c when x is large in the positive and negative directions then y = c is the horizontal asymptote but if the equation f(x) = c has real solutions then the curve will cross this asymptote. EDIT. A colleague of mine commented on the dictionary definition of an asymptote. If we look at the curve y = (sinx)/x we see that it crosses the horizontal asymptote y = 0 infinitely many times but it does get closer and closer to y = 0 as x increases. See graph below\u2026  ",
