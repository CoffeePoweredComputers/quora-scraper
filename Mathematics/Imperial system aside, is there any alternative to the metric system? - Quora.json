            "answer_text": "Yes, there is. USCS. The United States customary system. It is not Imperial. It is older than Imperial, older than Metric CGM or MKS or metric SI. It is used by over 300 million people regularly and by one very large leading industrialized nation that has even used it to put men on the moon, something not accomplished by nations using metric as their primary system. Not that it couldn\u2019t have been done with metric but demonstrates that it is a completely functional system. Most educated scientific and engineering people in the world are at least passingly familiar with it and it is completely and precisely defined in terms of the same reference standards as used by nations using the metric system.

There\u2019s another obscure system I\u2019ve heard about called The International System of Units, often abbreviated as SI. It is loosely based on the metric system and was invented on the planet Remulak, by the Coneheads - who later immigrated to France. I\u2019ve heard it is useful in cooking and stuff. All of the people who use SI units suffer from obsessive compulsive disorder and insist on well-documented yet counter-intuitive rules around spaces, commas, decimal points, and CaPiTalizATiON. And they hate \u2019murica. I tried to use it for cooking once, but the stupid \u201cmass-meter\u201d I purchased was actually a cleverly disguised strain gage, and instead of outputting in newtons (or is it Newtons) (or is it kg*m*s^-2) its output was in grams! Go figure. Anyhoo, some people must find it useful, but I don\u2019t care for it much. ",
