            "answer_text": "The terms x+2 (T1), 3x-2 (T2) and 7x-12 (T3) are in AP. To justify the answer, the common difference between T1 and T2 and between T2 and T3 must be the same. Hence (3x-2) -(x+2) = (7x-12)-(3x-2), 3x-2 + 3x-2 = 7x-12 + x+2, or 6x-4 = 8x- 10, or 8x-6x = 10\u20134, or 2x = 6, or x = 3. To justify whether x =3, T1: x+2 = 3+2 = 5 T2: 3x-2 = 3*3\u20132 = 9\u20132 = 7 T3: 7x-12 = 21\u201312 = 9. Thus T1, T2 and T3 are 5, 7 and 9 which is an AP. Hence x = 3 is correct. ",

In an arithmetic sequence, the difference between the terms should be the same (assuming the 3 terms given are all in sequence), so: [math](3x-2)-(x+2)=(7x-12)-(3x-2)[/math] [math]3x-2-x-2=7x-12\u20133x+2[/math] [math]2x-4=4x-10[/math] [math]2x=4x-6[/math] [math]-2x=-6[/math] [math]x=3[/math] So the 3 terms given when plugging in [math]x[/math] are: 5, 7, 9 ",
