            "answer_text": "According to the Order of Operations, PEMDAS, we have to do what\u2019s inside parentheses first. Since c and d are unlike terms, there\u2019s nothing we can do to combine them. There are no exponents around so we can skip the E. Next we look for any multiplication or division we can do from left to right. The only multiplication I see is the b(c-d) How do you multiply those? Distribution: b(c-d) = bc-bd Now we\u2019d like to do any adding or subtracting. But when we try to combine the terms, they are all unlike terms so there\u2019s nothing else we can do to combine them: a + b( c-d) = a + bc-bd Good luck and stay safe please \ud83e\udd17 ",

            "answer_text": "If you want to evaluate this for given values of a, b, and c, then you should leave it as it is, since this requires a difference, a multiplication, and a sum. If you change it to a + bc - bd, you have two multiplictions, a difference, and a sum. Multiplications are more expensive than sums and differences. ",
