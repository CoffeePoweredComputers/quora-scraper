Thank you Robert Nichols for the handy drawing. By extending the line AC, you show the case of an obtuse angle, below line AB. The number of solutions depends on whether A is acute or obtuse and the relationship of a to c. On Robert\u2019s drawing, drop an altitude from B to line AC, and, centered at B, draw two more circles with radii 8 and 10 cm. This serves to demonstrate the cases below: For acute A a <c*sinA, no solution, a is too short to reach the angle specified (sinC > 1) a = c*sinA, special case, one solution, C is 90\u00b0 c*sinA < a < c, two solutions, C acute or obtuse a \u2265 c, one solution, C is acute For obtuse A a \u2264 c, no solution (sinC > 1) a > c, one solution, C is acute I bolded the PITA case, the others are pretty straightforward.
