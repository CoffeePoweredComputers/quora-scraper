            "answer_text": "Parallel Axis Theorem The theorem determines the moment of inertia of a rigid body about any given axis, given that moment of inertia about the parallel axis through the centre of mass of an object and the perpendicular distance between the axes. Statement:The moment of inertia about Z-axis can be represented as: Iz=Icm + m(r^2) WhereIcm is the moment of inertia of an object about its centre of massm is the mass of an objectr is the perpendicular distance between the two axes. Perpendicular Axis Theorem This is applicable only to a plane lamina. The moment of inertia of a plane lamina about an axis perpendicular to its plane is equal to the sum of the moments of inertia of the lamina about any two mutually perpendicular axes, passing in its own plane, intersecting each other at the point through which the perpendicular axis passes.  Iz=Ix + Iy This theorem is most useful when considering a body which is of regular form (symmetrical) about two out of the three axes. If the moment of inertia about these axes is known then that about the third axis may be calculated. Applications: Let us take some everyday examples where we need physics. Four objects with identical masses and radii racing down a plane while rolling without slipping. The time for each object to reach the finishing line depends on their moment of inertia. A 1920s John Deere tractor with the spoked flywheel on the engine. The large moment of inertia of the flywheel smooths the operation of the tractor.How will we calculate the moment of inertia of the wheel? Well,it\u2019s a proper geometric shape. So, it\u2019s not that hard. But what if we need the moment of inertia of objects which do not have a definite geometric shape?The only method is by applying the parallel or perpendicular axis theorem. The theorems not only help us in finding the mass moment of inertia, but also in finding the area moment of inertia(with a few changes).Thus,these two theorems have wide applications in planar dynamics and helps solving problems in a faster and easier way.

            "answer_text": "For a planar object, the moment of inertia about an axis perpendicular to the plane is the sum of the moments of inertia of two perpendicular axes through the same point in the plane of the object. The utility of this theorem goes beyond that of calculating moments of strictly planar objects. It is a valuable tool in the building up of the moments of inertia of three-dimensional objects such as cylinders by breaking them up into planar disks and summing the moments of inertia of the composite disks.  The perpendicular axis theorem for planar objects can be demonstrated by looking at the contribution to the three-axis moments of inertia from an arbitrary mass element. From the point mass moment, the contributions to each of the axis moments of inertia are  For more information, you can also watch the below video.  ",
