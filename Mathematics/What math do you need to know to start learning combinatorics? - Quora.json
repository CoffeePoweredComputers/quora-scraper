            "answer_text": "Combinatorics technically requires nothing more than Arithmetic. The primary notion that is explored in Combinatorics is that of counting, or as I prefer to say, fancy counting. FC starts with simple observational tricks for changing the perspective on the problem; this requires some deductive reasoning. FC likes to use arguments of symmetry sometimes; this requires basic notions of geometry. FC will sometimes take advantage of thinking of things as sets, and how they interact; this requires foundations of set theory. FC can use some generalizations of arithmetic operations, and how they related to objects for counting; this requires abstract algebra. FC makes use of infinite series, and convergence; this uses calculus. FC makes connections via number systems and properties of integers; this takes advantage of Number Theory. FC utilizes discrete graphs to frame problems differently; this requires graph theory and discrete mathematics. FC can use probabilistic arguments and approximations; this requires probability theory. FC can make use algebra and geometry together to explore objects that appear in that framework; this involves algebraic geometry. FC can do that, but over fields of integers; that\u2019s arithmetic geometry. FC can, well, you get the idea\u2026 ",
