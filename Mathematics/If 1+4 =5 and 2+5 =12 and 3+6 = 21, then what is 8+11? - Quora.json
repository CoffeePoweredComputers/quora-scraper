            "answer_text": "In each equation, the first two numbers are multiplied and the product is added to the first number. For example: 1 + 4 = 5 \u2192 1 x 4 = 4 +1 = 5 2 + 5 = 12 \u2192 2 x 5 = 10 + 2 = 12 3 + 6 = 21 \u2192 3 x 6 = 18 + 3 = 21 therefore: 8 x 11 = \u2192 8 x 11 = 88 + 8 = 96 is the solution. After reviewing other answers I realized that there is more than one solution to this question depending on how the question and its pattern(s) are perceived. I found this circumstance really interesting as well as humbling to realize that what I thought of as \u201cThe\u201d only solution was really just one possible answer. I decided to leave my initial answer unchanged and to add another potential solution as follows to demonstrate that there really is more than one answer and to illustrate the contrast in answers simply based on perceiving the equations and their pattern(s) in a different way. In my first response to the question, I perceived each equation as an isolated set to solve for the solution but in the following answer, each set is linked and dependant on the previous set as I will demonstrate. In the alternate solution, each set in the equation is solved naturally by addition and the sum is then added to the solution of the next equation. Alternate solution to (1+4 =5 and 2+5 =12 and 3+6 = 21, then 8+11=?): 1 + 4 = [5] (added to next equations solution) 2 + 5 = 7 + [5] = [12] (added to next equations solution) 3 + 6 = 9 + [12] = [21] (added to next equations solution) 8 + 11 = 19 + [21] = 40 alternate solution. Despite the differences in the final solution, both of these solutions (96 & 40) are correct. The difference is that the first solution treated each individual equation as an isolated set and the second, alternate solution has each equation linked by adding it\u2019s solution to the sum of the next equation\u2019s solution. I re-learned today the lesson that our individual perception\u2019s are subjective and that despite being counterintuitive, a solution cannot always be reduced down to a simple binary choice such as 96/40, right/wrong, black/white, up/down, x/y, etc. I\u2019ve included a graphic that further helps to illustrate these concepts.  Thank you to all those who perceived this question and their solution to it in a different way! ",

            "answer_text": "If the digit symbols and the operators ++ and == are being used in their conventional mathematical senses, then the answer can be anything you wish. This is because a statement of the form \u201cif something-false then something\u201d is always true in a mathematical logical sense. For example, \u201cif 2+5=122+5=12 then I am Donald Trump\u201d is a true statement, and remains true whatever you put in the second half, because 2+52+5 does not equal 1212 with the symbols and operators being used in their conventional senses. So I could say \u201cif 1+4=51+4=5, 2+5=122+5=12, and 3+6=213+6=21, then 8+11=3.141592658+11=3.14159265\u201d, and nobody can gainsay this claim: it\u2019s as true as any other similar statement. However, if we suppose that either the digit symbols or the operators are being used other than in their conventional senses, there are many and varied ways we can think of that happening. Some are more useful than others. For example, if we simply suppose that the symbol == is being used to denote \u2260\u2260, that makes the three premiss statements true but tells us nothing that helps us answer the final question: any value other than 19 becomes a possible answer. One natural way to consider that symbols or operators are being used other than in their conventional senses is to suppose that the digits and the equality sign have their usual meanings but the operator ++ is being used in a non-standard way. For clarity, let us replace it with an alternative symbol, for example \u2295\u2295. One example: Define \u2295:N\u00d7N\u2192N s.t. (n,m)\u21a6n(m+1)\u2295:N\u00d7N\u2192Ns.t.(n,m)\u21a6n(m+1) Then 1\u22954=1\u00d7(4+1)=1\u00d75=51\u22954=1\u00d7(4+1)=1\u00d75=5, 2\u22955=2\u00d76=122\u22955=2\u00d76=12, 3\u22956=3\u00d77=213\u22956=3\u00d77=21, and 8\u229511=8\u00d712=968\u229511=8\u00d712=96 But there are infinitely many different definitions we could come up with that would work equally well. Indeed, we could contrive any particular answer we wish for. Another example: Define \u2295:N\u00d7N\u2192Q s.t. (n,m)\u21a61524nm+314\u22121336n2m2\u2295:N\u00d7N\u2192Qs.t.(n,m)\u21a61524nm+314\u22121336n2m2 Then 1\u22954=(1524\u22c51\u22c54)+314\u2212(1336\u22c512\u22c522)=456+314\u2212121=51\u22954=(1524\u22c51\u22c54)+314\u2212(1336\u22c512\u22c522)=456+314\u2212121=5, 2\u22955=122\u22955=12, 3\u22956=213\u22956=21, and 8\u229511=8337 ",

For example, if we simply suppose that the symbol ==== is being used to denote \u2260\u2260\u2260\u2260, that makes the three premiss statements true but tells us nothing that helps us answer the final question: any value other than 19 becomes a possible answer.One natural way to consider that symbols or operators are being used other than in their conventional senses is to suppose that the digits and the equality sign have their usual meanings but the operator ++++ is being used in a non-standard way. For clarity, let us replace it with an alternative symbol, for example \u2295\u2295\u2295\u2295.One example:Define \u2295:N\u00d7N\u2192N s.t. (n,m)\u21a6n(m+1)\u2295:N\u00d7N\u2192Ns.t.(n,m)\u21a6n(m+1)\u2295:N\u00d7N\u2192Ns.t.(n,m)\u21a6n(m+1)\u2295:N\u00d7N\u2192Ns.t.(n,m)\u21a6n(m+1)Then 1\u22954=1\u00d7(4+1)=1\u00d75=51\u22954=1\u00d7(4+1)=1\u00d75=51\u22954=1\u00d7(4+1)=1\u00d75=51\u22954=1\u00d7(4+1)=1\u00d75=5, 2\u22955=2\u00d76=122\u22955=2\u00d76=122\u22955=2\u00d76=122\u22955=2\u00d76=12, 3\u22956=3\u00d77=213\u22956=3\u00d77=213\u22956=3\u00d77=213\u22956=3\u00d77=21, and 8\u229511=8\u00d712=968\u229511=8\u00d712=968\u229511=8\u00d712=968\u229511=8\u00d712=96But there are infinitely many different definitions we could come up with that would work equally well. Indeed, we could contrive any particular answer we wish for.Another example:Define \u2295:N\u00d7N\u2192Q s.t. (n,m)\u21a61524nm+314\u22121336n2m2\u2295:N\u00d7N\u2192Qs.t.(n,m)\u21a61524nm+314\u22121336n2m2\u2295:N\u00d7N\u2192Qs.t.(n,m)\u21a61524nm+314\u22121336n2m2\u2295:N\u00d7N\u2192Qs.t.(n,m)\u21a61524nm+314\u22121336n2m2Then 1\u22954=(1524\u22c51\u22c54)+314\u2212(1336\u22c512\u22c522)=456+314\u2212121=51\u22954=(1524\u22c51\u22c54)+314\u2212(1336\u22c512\u22c522)=456+314\u2212121=51\u22954=(1524\u22c51\u22c54)+314\u2212(1336\u22c512\u22c522)=456+314\u2212121=51\u22954=(1524\u22c51\u22c54)+314\u2212(1336\u22c512\u22c522)=456+314\u2212121=5, 2\u22955=122\u22955=122\u22955=122\u22955=12, 3\u22956=213\u22956=213\u22956=213\u22956=21, and 8\u229511=8337 ",

            "answer_text": "The only correct answer to this question is \u201cI don\u2019t know, because not enough information is given.\u201d Sure, you can guess at a pattern/formula/interpretation that makes it true that \u201c1+4 =5 and 2+5 =12 and 3+6 = 21\u201d. But with only those three data points, you cannot know for sure that your pattern is correct. In particular, we don\u2019t have a single counter-example, like, say, \u201c4 + 7\u22601000\u2033, which would be really helpful to validate any hypothesis we have. To illustrate, here are two possible interpretations of the given data: The \u201c+\u201d symbol in \u201cm+n\u201d is an operator meaning \u201cm times (one more than n)\u201d.1 + 4 = 1 * 5 = 5.2 + 5 = 2 * 6 = 12.3 + 6 = 3 * 7 = 21.In this case, the answer to \u201cwhat is 8+11\u201d is 8*12=96.The \u201c=\u201d symbol is an operator meaning \u201cless than or equal to\u201d.1 + 4 is 5, which is less than or equal to 5.2 + 5 is 7, which is less than or equal to 12.3 + 6 is 9, which is less than or equal to 21.8 + 11 is 19, which is less than or equal to 19, 20, 21, 22, and so on to infinity.With the information given in the question, there is no argument to support interpretation 1 over interpretation 2, or any other interpretation you can imagine.

Answer is 96 . Hope you will understand my point. Have a good day \ud83d\ude0a\ud83d\ude0a. I hope ,you learned something new here. ",

Its a logic based question. 1+4 =5 2+5=12 (2+5 gives 7, now add the previous value i.e., 5 which gives 12) 3+6=21 (3+6 gives 9, now add the previous value i.e., 12 which gives 21) 4+7=32 (4+7 gives 11, now add the previous value i.e., 21 which gives 32) 5+8=45 (5+8 gives 13, now add the previous value i.e., 32 which gives 45) 6+9=60 (6+9 gives 15, now add the previous value i.e., 45 which gives 60) 7+10=77 (7+10 gives 17, now add the previous value i.e., 60 which gives 77) 8+11=96 (8+11 gives 19, now add the previous value i.e., 77 which gives 96) Hence, here the answer will be 96 Well, this is one of the logic sum type question,it can be sloved in many types. Another logic that can be use to solve this problem is A.P. (Arithmetic Progression). Difference in sum is 7,9,11,13,15,17,19. Hope you understood THANKYOU. ",

            "answer_text": "Answer: 8 + 11 = 96 Explaination: Here, from the given data, we can infer that, 1 + 4 = 5 ; 2 + 5 = 12 ; 3 + 6 = 21. The first condition is true on its own. So, let's move on to the next case. 2 + 5 = 12. We know that actually, they don't add up. So let's just assume that the answer is the sum of the first number and the product of the two numbers. 1 +( 1 \u00d7 4) = 5 ; 2 + (2 \u00d7 5) = 12 ; 3 + (3 \u00d7 6) = 21. This hypothesis agrees with all the cases, so we can apply this on the fourth case who's answer had to be found. 8 + 11 == 8 + (8 \u00d7 11) = 96. As the assumption agrees with all the cases, we might as well assume that it is the correct answer. Hope this helps!! ",

Understanding the Pattern: The first number + Second Number is equal to the difference between the first result and the final result. For example 1+4=5 & 2+5=12, Now simply adding 2+5 i.e. 7. Then difference b/w 12\u20135=7. Same as the first number + second number. It goes the same in other patterns if you look closely.

Similarly, 3+6=21. *12+9=21 So, 8+11 will be 21+8+11= 40 Combination of addition and Multiplication 1+4=5. *1+4\u00d71=5 Here we add the first number with the product of the next number with the first number. 2+5= 2+ 5\u00d72= 2+10=12 3+6= 3+ 6\u00d73= 21 So, 8+11= 8+8\u00d711= 96 ",

That is because they multiplied both the numbers 1 \u00d74=4 then they add the first number from the left which is one so the answer comes 5 Same method is used in 2nd one because the question is 2+5=12 so first we should multiply both the numbers that gives us 10 and then we should add the first number from the left which gives us 12 Same method is used in the 3rd one Now the question given for us to solve is 8+11 => First we should multiply both the numbers that gives us =8\u00d711 =88 =>Then we have add the first number from the left =88+8 =96 ",

Like : 1 + 4 = 5 So, the sum obtain here is \u20185\u2019 The next term is : 2 + 5 = 12 So, here first we add 2 & 5 then add 5 ( the answer we obtain previously) 2 + 5 = 7 and 7 + 5 = 12  Then in next puzzle : 2 + 5 = 7 The answer here is 7 then we take 3 + 6 = 21 So, 3 + 6 + 7 = 21  Like this we can solve the whole puzzle Hope this help you :) ",

So, let's start for it 1+4=5 ( now in this equation maths is exact ) keep 5 with you. 2+5=12 ( here , maths is not exactly the same it should have been because this becomes the case of logic .Initially you have to add 2+5=7 and later the preserved \u201c5\u2033from last equation you add to 7.total becomes 7+5 =12.) Now same keep this \u201c12\u2033 to be used for third equation For third eqution again the same logic first you add the given equation i,e 3+6=21.( Here, the actual sum is 9 but you need to add the previously obtained sum to it.the total becomes 9+12=21.

That`s 2+2\u22175=2+10=12. With 3+6=21, you can be sure about logic 3+3\u22176=21. Since with these arguments, we understand that our logic is correct. Now, we can answer the question: 8+8\u221711=96 ",

Now take the 7 and and it with the previous answer you got from 1+4=5. So take the 7 and add it to 5. You will get 12. Now.. 3+6=21.. Same way add 3+6 . It's 9. Now add 9 with 12.its 21. So thrick is pretty easy. Hope you got the trick. ",
