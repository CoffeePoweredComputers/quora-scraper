So using this formula, 850 =P (1+rx3) = P (1 + 3r) and 900 = P (1+rx4) = P (1 + 4r) ======> by dividing the 1st expression by the 2nd, 90/85 = 18/17 = (1 + 4r)/(1 + 3r) = ======> which gives r = 1/14. With this value of r, we can use either expression and get P like this: 900 = P (1 + 4/14) = P x 1.285714286 =========> P = 900/1.285714286 = 700. So the sum is Rs.700/-. ",

So p(1 +3r/100) = 850 => r = (850/p - 1)\u00d7(100/3) \u2026\u2026(1) p(1 + 4r/100)= 900 => r = (900/p - 1)\u00d7(100/4) \u2026\u2026\u2026(2) Comparing (1) and (2) we get (850/p - 1)\u00d7(100/3) = (900/p - 1)100/4 => 4(850/p - 1) = 3(900/p - 1) => 3400/p - 4 = 2700/p - 3 => 700/p = 1 => p = 700 So the sum is 700 ",
