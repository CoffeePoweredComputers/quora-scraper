            "answer_text": "Number 7 symbolizes balance, intellect, spirituality, and curiousity to know more. People who have this number dominant in their date of birth, either as their life path number or someone who's both on the 7th, 16th or 25th of a month, would usually find these characteristics true to themselves. But overall traits also depend on other number in their charts or intensity of influence of number 7 on a person's date of birth. Number seven are usually honest, and like to stay alone, busy in their own contemplations, especially after rounds of intense activities. They have a lot going on in their heads. They are intuitive and have a quality of humanitarianism in them. Being seekers, they look for inner depth and truth and don't take things at face value. Hope this helps! ",
