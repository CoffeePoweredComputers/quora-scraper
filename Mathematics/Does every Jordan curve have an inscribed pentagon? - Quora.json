            "answer_text": "The case of inscribed regular pentagons is clearly false. Just consider an ellipse. The case of inscribe irregular pentagon is clearly true. We just need to pick five points on the curve such that no three are co-linear. It should not be too hard to extend this to convex pentagons. There is a problem which is a little interesting. Can we inscribe a pentagon which is entirely contained inside the curve so no edge of the pentagon intersects the curve. I suspect this is true. A hand wavy illustration of why this might be true follows. By the Four-vertex theorem every simple, closed, smooth plane curve has at least four vertices and two of these are local maxima of curvature. So we can pick a small segment of the curve around one of these maxima. Here the curve can be locally approximated by a parabola. At such a point we can easily draw a pentagon.  Indeed, we could make the pentagon very tiny to account for poor approximations. The smoothness of the curve is quite a strong criterion here, implying the curvature is also locally smooth, so for a small enough region on either side of the vertex it will be monotonic. I suspect it will hold for other less restrictive classes of curve. Having an inscribed irregular pentagon is a weaker condition that the Inscribed square problem which is still unsolved for the general case and the inscribed rectangle rectangle problem which is true for all closed curves.
