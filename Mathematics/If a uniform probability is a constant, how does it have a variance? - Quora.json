            "answer_text": "A uniform distribution is not constant, it is uniform. That is, every number in the range has equal probability of arising (not a technical definition, just an intuitive one).  For example, this list of values is constant and has 0 variance: 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5 This one is roughly uniform on the range of 0 to 1 and it has a variance: 0.125  0.210  0.491  0.982  0.841  0. 488 (I just made up numbers, you can generate a sample from a uniform distribution in any stat software).  One example of a discrete uniform distribution is the roll of a fair die: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 are equally likely. ",
