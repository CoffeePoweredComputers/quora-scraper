If he purchases it at a 10% lower price and sells for rupees 140 more, his gain would have been one fourth of the cost price. What is the price of the watch?Let (C1, S1) & (C2, S2) denote respectively the original & the modified values of (cost-price, sell-price) of the given watch.Hence from above data we get following relations,S1 = (1 - 5/100)*C1or S1 = 0.95*C1 \u2026. (1a)C2 = (1 - 10/100)*C1or C2 = 0.90*C1 \u2026. (1b)S2 = S1 + 140 \u2026. (1c)S2 - C2 = (1/4)*C1 \u2026. (1d)Therefore from (1c) & (1d) we get,S1 + 140 - C2 = (1/4)*C1or 0.95*C1 + 140 - 0.90*C1 = (1/4)*C1 [from (1a) & (1b)]or (1/4 - 1/20)*C1 = 140or (1/5)*C1 = 140 or C1 = 700 (Rs) [Ans]",

SP=0.95x If CP was 0.90x and SP 0.95x+\u20b9140 gain would have been 0.90x/4 SP - CP = Gain => 0.95x +140 - 0.90x = 0.90x/4 => 0.95x + 140 - 0.90x = 0.225x => 0.175x = \u20b9140 therefore x= \u20b9 800 Hence CP of the watch was \u20b9800 Let's check: CP =\u20b9800 SP = \u20b9760 If CP was 720 and SP was 760+140 Profit would be 720/4 = \u20b9180 Verified ",
