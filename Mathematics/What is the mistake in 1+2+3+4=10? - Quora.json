            "answer_text": "From the viewpoint of arithmetic (which, by the way, is no longer taught in the United States) there is no mistake in the above sum. This sum represents a pattern because the units are not specified, but they are assumed to be the same for all numbers. It is interesting to see some people looking hard to find some mistake; and then they assume things that are not specified in the question. The correct action is not to assume but to take the default position. The default base for the numbering system is 10. .

            "answer_text": "If indeed there is no mistake and the question is misleading in that it has no correct answer, then I could provide roughly the same answer for all Quora questions: Quora is not serious, they do not expect an actual answer to the question. Therefore answering a question on Quora is pointless as the answer to pointless question should be. Groucho Marx used to have a television show where he would ask questions for prizes. If a guest had not gotten any right he would ask \u201cWho\u2019s buried in Grant\u2019s tomb?\u201d. The expected answer is \u201cGrant\u201d. But the answer could be \u201cNobody, it\u2019s a tomb and is not buried\u201d or \u201cGrant and his wife who was entombed with him\u201d. It is a silly question with no correct answer, as is this. What I am doing here on Quora is an exercise in futility. ",
