            "answer_text": "In this type of Questions you have to know about the percentage concept. If I say 100% it means that I talking about the whole quantity of something. If I say 25% it means that I talking about the 1/4 th quantity of something. Now in this question, Let a person buy an article for X rs. I also say that it will be the whole buying amount means 100%. But when he sells it, he loses 10% which means it becomes 90% . And question already mentioned that its selling price =72rs. ( That means it is 90% value) But we want 5% more value of article.( That means 105% value) If 90% = 72 1% = (72/90) 105% = (72/90)*105= 84 So if he want to get 5% profit he has to sell it rs 84. Thank you.. ",
