            "answer_text": "Human beings have always been intrigued by the mysterious ways of the universe and the phenomena happening around us. Since ancient times we have tried to understand the exact mechanism behind every observation we make to quench our curiosity. For eg Why does every object fall down ( towards the earth) and not upwards when released? Sir Isaac Newton answered that question and introduced us to the Gravitational force. But a theory is most useful when it can be proved. So he had to devise a mathematical formula which encapsulated his idea and could be proved with the help of real time observations. That's the role of mathematics, to give a proper (almost)universal expression to a theory that can be used to calculate/predict the factors affecting space-time and also to derive/ explain many other expressions and phenomena, thus expanding our knowledge.

            "answer_text": "Astronomers use math all the time. One way it is used is when we look at objects in the sky with a telescope. The camera that is attached to the telescope basically records a series of numbers - those numbers might correspond to how much light different objects in the sky are emitting, what type of light, etc ",
