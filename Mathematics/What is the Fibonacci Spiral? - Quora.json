            "answer_text": "The Fibonacci spiral is a spiral that is built by constructing arcs that connect the points of squares based on the Fibonacci sequence that are assembled in a spiral pattern. The Fibonacci sequence a series of numbers, starting with 0 and 1, where each following number in the sequence is found by adding the two numbers before it. So 0+1=1, 1+1=2, 1+2=3, etc., to get this sequence: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89 ... Squares with these dimensions are arranged in a spiral pattern:  Image source: Fibonacci number - Wikipedia The corners of each square are connected by quarter-circle arcs to form the Fibonacci spiral:  Image source: Fibonacci number - Wikipedia A very similar spiral, the Golden Spiral, can be constructed with a series of Golden Rectangles, with sides in the proportion of the Golden Ratio (1.618\u2026) to 1. Each Golden Rectangle can be expanded to another Golden rectangle by creating a square based on the length of its long side:  Image source: Spirals and the Golden Ratio - The Golden Ratio: Phi, 1.618 Spirals constructed with arcs are technically called volutes. This is different than a spiral known as a logarithmic (aka exponential or equiangular) spiral, which expands at a constant rate. A true Golden Spiral then is a logarithmic spiral that expands at the constant rate of the Golden Ratio with every rotation, or portion of a rotation. The beautiful Nautilus spiral that appears in nature is often confused with the Fibonacci and Golden spirals, but is NOT the same. While every individual Nautilus shell varies a bit from the ideal, the Nautilus spiral is a logarithmic spiral that is very close to a Golden Spiral that expands at the Golden Ratio with each half turn of the spiral. See more on that here: The Nautilus shell spiral as a golden spiral Now you know not just what a Fibonacci spiral is but how to create one and what differentiates it from other similar spirals. ",
