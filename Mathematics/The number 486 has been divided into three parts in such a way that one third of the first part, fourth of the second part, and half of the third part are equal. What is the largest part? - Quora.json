            "answer_text": "Suppose, the first, second and third parts are a, b and c respectively. So, (a + b + c) = 486\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026(1) And, (a / 3) = (b / 4) = (c / 2) = x\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.(2) So, a = 3x, b = 4x and c = 2x. Since, x is positive; so, clearly, b > a > c. Putting these in (1): (3x + 4x + 2x) = 486 9x = 486 x = (486 / 9) = 54. Therefore, the largest part = the second part = 4x = (4 * 54) = 216. ",
