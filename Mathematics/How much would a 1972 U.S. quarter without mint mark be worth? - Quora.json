            "answer_text": "From 1792 when the US Mint was created, until 1980, the main Mint in Philadelphia did not use a mintmark except on proof coin sets. (except for the 1942\u20131945 silver \u2018war nickels\u201d during WWII). Since 1980, circulating coins minted in Philadelphia HAVE carried the P mintmark, which is why many people get confused when they find an older coin with no mintmark. There are no varieties or errors known for the 1972 Washington quarter. If your quarter was found in circulation, it is only worth its face value. An uncirculated 1972 quarter taken (or still in) the 1972 annual mint set might be worth more, depending on whether it has sustained any damage in storage. ",

            "answer_text": "As with all collectible coins the value of a 1972 quarter dollar is based on two basic factors, rarity and condition. In this case the Philadelphia mint (no mint mark) produced 215 million coins in 1972 thus it will never be rare. The last year the mint used any silver in the quarter was 1964 so there's no intrinsic value in a 1972. But assuming you have a gem coin (ms 65 or better), the book value is $5.22 (source: usacoinbook.com). ",

They will be able to confirm for you that it is real and not a fake. They will also be able to give you their OPINION on what is worth, they might suggest getting it graded by a third party grading service (which gives the coin a better reputation and can increase the value of the coin many times) and they might make you an offer for the coin.
