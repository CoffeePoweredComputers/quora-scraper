            "answer_text": "Maybe you haven't realized yet that mathematics is just another language useful for solving real problems. Just as the languages you mention (and many, many others) are just languages useful for solving real problems. Learn mathematics as you learned Java, C#, etc. -- use it to solve real problems, read how mathematics was used to solve real problems, go beyond what you think you know and try harder real problems. That's how you learn any problem-solving language. [Question details edited. Answer updated.] So you state you feel that your study/understanding of math only serves to pass a test. Did I get this right? Then the answer to your question \"I hate mathematics, but I want to like it. How can I do this?\" boils down to \"Stop feeling that!\". Realize that if you felt the only reason to learn/master Java (for instance) were to pass a test, you would feel the same with respect to Java as you feel with respect to math. My initial answer still stands: realize math is not just a test-passing ability, it is a whole language for thought and reasoning. Learn to like math because math helps you figure out how to make an \"application/website look/perform faster/better\". Maybe you still don't know how math helps you achieve these goals. Figure it out by yourself; or ask somebody that already figured this out and improve on that. ",

            "answer_text": "Learn why we use math. When you realize how universal math is and how much of our understanding of our reality can be explained with math, it leaves us wanting to understand. Math is beautiful, it can be expressed as pictures, equations, points in 3 dimensional space. They say that when a mathematician looks at a well formed logical math equation that explains an idea, the brain reacts the same way as someone listening to beautiful moving music, or a fantastic piece of art. When we do not understand art, we do not like or appreciate it in its full capacity. As we come to understand it, we fall in love with all of its complexities. Then, we spread the passion to others with our excitement. I used to hate math. I used to hate modern and ancient art. Now I am learning more about both, and thus, falling in love with them as well. This was the reasons and process for me, I hope it can help you. The hate comes from not understanding. This is true of all things in life. ",
