            "answer_text": "If you know the distribution, you already know the mean and standard deviation. If the variable is bounded above you also know the maximum. If it is not bounded then there is no maximum. Do you mean that you know the family of distributions? The mean and standard deviation are not always sufficient to select a particular distribution, for example there could be more than two parameters. In fact knowing all moments is not always enough. There is a theory of extreme value distributions. The distribution of the maximum observation in a sample can be calculated. It depends on the distribution the sample comes from and the sample size. But for large samples there are approximations which can be reduced to one of three types depending on the type of the parent distribution. ",
