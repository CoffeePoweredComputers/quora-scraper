            "answer_text": "What is the equation of ellipse passing through the origin and has foci at (-1,1) and (1,1)? Maurice Bourdin has given an answer but without explanation. Here\u2019s what I think he had in mind. The sum of the distances of points on the ellipse to the two foci is constant. Because [math](0,0)[/math] is on the ellipse that sum is [math]\\sqrt{(-1)^2+1^2}+\\sqrt{1^2+1^2}=2\\sqrt{2}[/math]. The sum of the distances of any other point [math](x,y)[/math] on the ellipse from the foci is [math]\\sqrt{(x+1)^2+(y-1)^2}+\\sqrt{(x-1)^2+(y-1)^2}=2\\sqrt{2}[/math]. (Positive square roots only.) This is the required equation. You can put it in a standard form by squaring to eliminate the square roots. You need to do this twice with rearranging the equation in between. That\u2019s rather tedious. It\u2019s easier to note that the centre of the ellipse is at [math](0,1)[/math] and the vertices are at [math](-a,1)[/math] and [math](a,1)[/math] where [math]a[/math] is such that [math]\\sqrt{(a+1)^2}+\\sqrt{(a-1)^2}=2\\sqrt{2}[/math], i.e. [math]a=\\sqrt{2}[/math]. Therefore the equation is [math]\\frac{x^2}{2}+\\frac{(y-1)^2}{1^2}=1[/math]. Exercise: why are the denominators [math]2[/math] and [math]1[/math]? ",
