Let Peter starts walking from pointh A and walks 30m Southwards and reaches pointB A | | | B Then according to the problem he turuns left and walks 50m to point C . The situation is depicted diagrammatically like this A | | | | | | B \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 C He again turns leftwards , walks 30m and reaches point D A | __ __ __ __ __ D | | B \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 C Now the final position reached by Peter is D , he is clearly at a distance of 50m from starting point A which is clearly eastwards ie towards left of his starting position A . ( I am finding difficulty in drawing 3 lines upwards to depict 30m , the gap between C and D. ) | B \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 C ",
