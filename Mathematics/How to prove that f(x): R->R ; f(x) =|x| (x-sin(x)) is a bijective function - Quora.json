            "answer_text": "The function is odd. Moreover g(x)=x\u2212sinxg(x)=x\u2212sin\u2061x is strictly increasing, because g\u2032(x)=1\u2212cosxg\u2032(x)=1\u2212cos\u2061x that\u2019s always \u22650\u22650 and vanishes at a set of isolated points. Therefore the function f(x)=|x|(x\u2212sinx)f(x)=|x|(x\u2212sin\u2061x) is a product of increasing functions positive functions over the interval (0,\u221e)(0,\u221e), hence strictly increasing. By the symmetry, the function is also increasing over (\u2212\u221e,0)(\u2212\u221e,0), where it takes on negative values. The function only vanishes at zero. Therefore ff is globally strictly increasing. ",
