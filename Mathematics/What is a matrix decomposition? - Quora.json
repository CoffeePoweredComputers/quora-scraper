            "answer_text": "Matrix decomposition is matrix factorization which separates a matrix into two other matrices that are typically much easier to solve than the original matrix. Not only does this make the problem easy to solve, but it reduces the amount of time required by a computer to calculate the answer. LU factorization is the most widely used form of factorization (decomposition) which was created by Alen Turing, who is known as the father of modern computing. Matrix decomposition is one of many contributing factors that has made modern technology operate faster and more efficiently. ",

            "answer_text": "Matrix decomposition is a method of turning a matrix into a product of two matrices. There are a ton of different ways to decompose matrices each with different specializations and equipped to handle different problems. LU decomposition is used to speed up computer calculations of linear systems. NMF is used in astronomy to prevent over-fitting of data and to account more for the uncertainty of astronomical observations. It really depends on the application as to which method of decomposition is used as they all reveal different information. ",
