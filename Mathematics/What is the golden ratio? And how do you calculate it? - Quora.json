            "answer_text": "In Reality, the Golden Ratio should be called the Divyank Ratio, which represents the divine design with which the perfect and most beautiful objects of the universe and Nature are designed. To comprehend the man-made and confusing mathematical formula which leads to the Golden Ratio and the perfect and divine mathematical formula of the Divyank Ratio, we should study and understand the following concepts. The Fibonacci sequence: \u201c1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89 and 144 and so on\u201d. \u201cThe third number is the sum of the preceding two numbers\u201d. The Fibonacci sequence was perceived by the ancient Indian Sages and the mathematicians long ago. It is first attributed to Pingala (450 BC) and later associated with Virabanka (700 AD), Gopala (1135 AD) and Hemachandra (1150 AD). Like the ancient Indian Sages, Pingala used the cryptic language. He gave the cryptic formula, \u201cmisrau cha\u201d, which means that the two numbers are mixed. A better picture arises in the works of Virabanka, \u201cVariations of two earlier meters\u201d. An explicit example was given by Leonardo of Pisa (Fibonacci) in the book Liber Abaci in 1202 AD. He gives the example of idealized rabbit population. The real beauty of the Fibonacci sequence is that the Golden Ratio is hidden in it. An approximate value of the Golden Ratio surfaces between 9th-10th sequence, 34-55 and 10th-11th sequence, 55-89. Explanation: 55/34 and 89/55 are pretty close to 1.61818. Other Examples: An idealized example of the family tree of honey bees is preferred by some known scholars. The branches of tree, the arrangement of leaves, flowers and seeds, fruits of pineapple, pine cone etc follow the Fibonacci sequence. There are many beautiful examples in the human body too. Fibonacci sequence is a gross representation of the Golden Ratio. The Golden Ratio (\u00f6 -Phi): The well known descriptions of the Golden Ratio are, \u201cWhen a line is divided into 2 parts, the longer part divided by the smaller part is equal to the whole length divided by the longer line.\u201d \u201cTwo quantities are in the Golden ratio if their ratio is the same as the ratio of their sum to the larger of the two quantities\u201d. \u201cA straight line is said to have been cut in extreme and mean ratio when, as the whole line is to the greater segment, so is the greater to the lesser.\u201d The above descriptions are too abstract for a common man. The descriptions also center on two simple dimensions. To explain the simple design of the most beautiful objects of the universe, the mathematicians created the following formula. Phi: 1/2 + square root of 5/2 = 1.618033988749895... \u201cGolden ratio appears in the basic structures of equilateral triangle, square and pentagon placed inside a circle and in few complex three dimensional solids\u201d. The Golden Ratio is called Divine Proportions but it is not as perfect as the divine creations. It needs further reflection and improvement. The First Deficiency The known Golden Ratio (1.618033988749895\u2026) is an irrational number with never ending infinite number of digits. This is highly confusing and misleading for intelligent minds and scholars. The First Hypothesis The ever expanding universe may be infinite but the perfect objects of Nature are limited in shape and sizes. Hence, there should be limited number of digits of the Golden Ratio. The Second Deficiency The Golden Ratio is a linear number while the objects of Nature are multi-dimensional. There has to be a multi-dimensional design with which the Golden Ratio is designed and created. What is it? THE CREATIVE DESIGN OF NATURE It is well established that every created object of Nature is formed in three stages; namely, creation, development and maturation. The Third Deficiency Are there three stages in the formation of Golden Ratio too? Unfortunately, there is no available information on the subject. The First Deficiency and Exploration To find the most approximate decimal value of Golden Ratio, let us first understand the two dimensional design of Nature. The Divyank Rectangle: The Divyank Rectangle is two-dimensional design of the perfect and most beautiful objects of universe and Nature. It can be designed with the basic principles of Pythagorean Theorem. According to Pythagorean Theorem, \u201cIn right angled triangle, square of the long side (the hypotenuse) is equal to the sum of the square of the two shorter sides\u201d. The Divyank Rectangle Now, let us create Divyank Rectangle using Pythagorean Theorem. Let us first draw a square of 100 units. Now, divide the square into two equal parts as shown. Now, draw a line joining the right upper angle of the square with the middle bottom part of the square. The Result: This results in the formation of a right angled triangle with two shorter sides of 50 and 100 units. Hypotenuse: The long side of the triangle is called hypotenuse. Based on the principles of Pythagorean Theorem, the length of the long side of triangle will be 111.618034. Home Work: Please calculate and confirm the above value. Now, draw a semicircle of 111.618034 units from the mid-point of square. Extend the bottom line to meet the lower end of the semicircle. Now, complete the Divyank Rectangle. The Conclusion: The most approximate decimal value of Golden Ratio is 1.618034. The value was first suggested by Michael Maestilinus in 1597. Unfortunately, the value was not explored further and concluded. The Nautilus Shell: Now, let us create Nautilus Shell using the Divyank Rectangle. Let us first draw the Divyank Rectangle of 100x161.8034. Now, draw a semicircle in the square (100x100). Then draw another semicircle equal to its length (61.8034) in the adjoining rectangle. Then, draw another semicircle equal to 38.1966 as shown. Repeat the same and create the shape of Nautilus Shell. Note: There will be only 10 visible semicircles in the Art-Design. Other Examples: As Above As Below 1. The Cosmos: The picture of Spiral Galaxy of our Milky Way. 2. The Ocean: The picture of Whirlpool. The Essence: The Spiral Galaxy and Whirlpool are invariably given as examples to indicate that the Ultimate Design of Nature may be identical. The First Important Discovery - 10 Stages of Development From the above picture of Art-Design-2, we find that there are ten stages of development in the formation of perfect objects of Nature. The Fourth Deficiency What are the exact numerical values of the three critical stages of creation, development and maturation of the Golden Ratio? Not Known. No written information is available till date. I suppose, the possibility of three stages of formation of the Golden Ratio has not been thought about by the modern scholars. An Intuitive Idea - An Exploration I am fully convinced that the ancient Indian Sages had cognized and conceived the three stages of creation, development and maturation of the perfect and most beautiful objects of Nature. I am also convinced that the ancient Indian Sages had known the exact numerical value of the three stages of creation, development and maturation of the Golden Ratio too. It is also known that the ancient Indian Sages had devised the unique system of hiding the wisdom in cryptic form of stories. Why? I believe that the Sages did not want the wisdom to be misused by the people, who were not in love with the Nature and humanity etc. To find the ultimate Design of Nature, we will have to decode the hidden wisdom of few more ancient Indian stories. Unfortunately, it is not easy to decode the hidden wisdom of ancient Indian stories. I am certain that we can decode the old stories provided we are in tune with the Universal Consciousness and the ancient Indian Sages. Now, let us comprehend the real beauty of ancient Indian wisdom It is a linear number and represents the two dimensions of an object. It is also an irrational number with never-ending infinite numbers of digits, 1.618033988749895..., which are highly confusing and misleading. The universe may be infinite but every object of Nature is limited. Hence, there should be limited numbers of digits. Divyank Ratio: 1.618034. It represents the most approximate decimal value of the Golden Ratio. Two complementary components: According to Akhand Sutra, every object of Nature is represented with two complementary and inseparable components, the central core (Shakta) and the dynamic force (Shakti). The exact value of Shakta is 38.1966% and the precise value of Shakti is 61.8034%. The square of 61.8034 is equal to 3819.66 (a hundred times the value of Shakta). Such a precise representation is not seen in the known Golden Ratio. Divyank Sequence: It is represented by 61.8034, 100.00, 161.8034, 261.8034 and so forth. Divyank Sequence is much better than the Fibonacci sequence or the Golden Ratio. The Ultimate Creative Design of Nature: It is established that every object of Nature is formed in three critical stages, namely, the first stage of creation, the second stage of development, and the third stage of maturation. What are the exact values of three stages of formation of the Golden Ratio? The world is not aware of the answer. Divyank, the Divine Constant ((22/21)10.34419) = 1.618034 gives the answer. 22/21 represent the first stage of creation.10 represents the ten stages of development.0.34419, represent the last stage of maturation.1.618034 represents the most economical algorithm of Nature,For detailed knowledge, please download and read Akhand Sutra from Akhand Vidyashram The eBook is free.
