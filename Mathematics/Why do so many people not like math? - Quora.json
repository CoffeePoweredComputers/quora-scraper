            "answer_text": "Math is abstract. Math is problem solving in its purest form. You take a problem, and you strip away all of the unnecessary details. Some people like those details.Math is useless (to some people). Okay, I was a math major for a short while. I understand pretty well that you can apply mathematics to just about anything. But will you? How much do you actually care about the trajectory of a basketball or the volume of a torus?Math is cumulative. I\u2019ve heard so many people say \u201cI used to be good at math.\u201d Of course you used to be good at math. We started at addition and worked our way up. For most students, they reach a point in math where they look up at the board and realize they don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on. What they don\u2019t realize is that if they don\u2019t stop to study a bit, they\u2019ll have a difficult time understanding math for the rest of their education. You\u2019re taught math from first grade, so theoretically, you\u2019re going to have 12 different people teaching you math from 1st to 12th grade. If your 3rd grade teacher messes up, math doesn\u2019t come naturally to you, and you don\u2019t find a way to catch up, you\u2019re screwed.Teachers fear math, and they teach that fear to their students. Unfortunately, most elementary school teachers don\u2019t care much for math. This is to be expected. After all, the skill set required to be an elementary school teacher involves keeping track of dozens of small children at a time. It\u2019s not difficult to see why the beauty of mathematics isn\u2019t their focus. However, an unfortunate consequence of this is that many students grow up seeing math as a challenge rather than an interesting subject. \u201cMath is hard\u201d is a trope.Some people aren\u2019t as lucky. I\u2019m not genius, but I was always considered \u201cgood\u201d at math. Math just made sense to me in a way it didn\u2019t seem to for other people. I had never gotten any individual tutoring. I must\u2019ve just been a natural, right? Wrong. Looking back, my abilities are far from natural. They\u2019re a result of my circumstances.When I was four years old, my mom taught me how to multiply with Chuck E Cheese tokens. She would put them in rows and columns and make me figure out how many there were. She also put multiplication tables in the bathroom and kitchen so I would just see numbers everywhere I went.I went to a high school geared toward math and science, so for four years, math was two classes instead of one. That means that I had around 600 more hours of instruction in high school mathematics than students who did not attend such a program.You have to understand math to like math. And for all the reasons above, a lot of people don\u2019t understand math. Or they just don\u2019t need it. Which is fine. ",

            "answer_text": "I\u2019d say most people don\u2019t find it personally enjoyable because it\u2019s hard and most of us are conditioned to fear struggle, but the reason people don\u2019t respect it goes deeper. They\u2019ve never actually seen math before. They\u2019ve seen algorithms and procedures, but they haven\u2019t seen math. They haven\u2019t seen the structure, they haven\u2019t seen how it connects and builds on itself, they haven\u2019t experienced how studying the structure builds intuition, they haven\u2019t had a chance to see mathematical creativity, and they haven\u2019t internalized the notion that math offers irrefutable proof of its assertions, and that it\u2019s a deeply human endeavor to find satisfying arguments that finalize conjectures into theorems. I might have forgotten my actual thoughts by now, but as a child, I was kind of skeptical of math. I was \u201cgood\u201d at it in the sense that I could perform the computations and get good grades, but I thought it was all a bag of tricks, either verified empirically through approximations or made up by school administrators to test obedience. I never saw a single mathematical argument to convince me that something so clean and clear-cut like the pythagorean theorem could actually be precisely true. In my mind, the square of the length of the hypotenuse couldn\u2019t possibly be exactly the sum of the squares of the legs. I never even knew why a triangle had half the area of a rectangle with the same base and height. I could see it for right triangles which were clearly rectangles cut in half diagonally, but why does it make sense for even the pathologically uneven, misshapen triangles with the weird angles? And why does it work even if you flip the triangle around and we look at a different length and height? And how could it be that any triangle\u2019s angles add up to exactly the angle of a straight line? Did someone just draw a few triangles and measure them? I didn\u2019t know where the quadratic formula came from, and I had no idea it was even something you could explain. I didn\u2019t know how its derivation and the derivation of other formulas in algebra class were just slight extensions of basic algebraic reasoning for solving things like [math]x=blah+blahblah[/math], and I didn\u2019t even know how \u201csolving for x\u201d was supposed to work at all. And what were irrational numbers? How could you know that a decimal expansion never terminates or repeats? You can\u2019t check them all, right? And what was the significance of all of this? Not just the magical disjointed \u201creal-life applications\u201d that school overlords like to pull out of a magic hat to compensate for not teaching anything, but the overarching structure that ties everything together and gives it context. I seriously hated math. I thought it was boring and soulless, despite being easy for me. But eventually I had all these questions answered, and my suspicions were removed. Here\u2019s what I learned about math in the process that made me love it: Understanding the few general principles lets you come up with many of those specific facts on your own, even if you forget them.You can prove things!Everything is connected, sometimes in surprising ways, and never through magic and mysticism. There\u2019s always a non-magical explanation for the connections.The definitions of objects are usually picked to be as natural as possible, and don\u2019t have to feel like some gibberish that magically does useful stuff.The underlying structure is not something you need superhuman intelligence to understand.Math requires creativity. You need to experiment. Exploit symmetry. Make analogies and hope for the best. Add stuff then take it away in the end. Deliberately try things that have little chance of working. Refine your methods over and over and over again. Draw pictures. Backtrack. It\u2019s not all procedure following or cold deductive logic.Math evolves as a series of declarative statements of the form \u201cif A then B.\u201d You\u2019re given a condition A, then you observe how the truth of condition A determines the truth of condition B. The language of mathematics is declarative, not imperative. It might require human action to do stuff with formulas, but the formulas are immortalized in declarative language. As in \u201cif [math]f(x)=ax^2+bx+c[/math], then [math]f(x)=0[/math] if and only if [math]x=\\frac{-b\\pm\\sqrt{b^2\u20134ac}}{2a}[/math].\u201d When we use those formulas, we are implicitly making more specialized declaratives, such as \u201cif a=1, b=2, and c=1, then [math]f(x)=0[/math] if and only if [math]x=-2[/math].\u201d It\u2019s not really saying \u201ctake this machine known as the quadratic formula, plug your numbers into it and magic stuff comes out and that\u2019s your answer.\u201d Maybe some people don\u2019t care about this difference, but it matters.Unfortunately, I think most people never realize any of this. It\u2019s actually kind of heartbreaking. You don\u2019t have to find math enjoyable, but it doesn\u2019t deserve to have the terrible reputation among the public that it currently does. ",
