However, if you\u2019re looking for a good introduction, I\u2019d suggest looking at some of the epidemiology papers on SIRS models, particularly the ones using stochastic methods. That\u2019s how I learned them, and there are many open-source papers out there that provide good introductions to the subject matter. ",
