In this case, we know that [math]x=10[/math] solves the equation, as [math]1000-10-990=0[/math]. Therefore, we divide by [math]x^3-x-990[/math] by the polynomial [math]x-10[/math] which divides it, giving us [math]x^2+10x+99[/math] (presumably through long division). Now we just use the quadratic formula: [math]x=\\frac{-10\\pm\\sqrt{10^2-4\\cdot 99}}2=\\frac{-10\\pm\\sqrt{-296}}2=\\frac{-10\\pm 2i\\sqrt{74}}2=-5\\pm i\\sqrt{74}[/math] Consequently, the solutions are [math]x=10[/math] and [math]x=-5\\pm i\\sqrt{74}[/math] ",
