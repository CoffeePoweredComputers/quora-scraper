            "answer_text": "Compute each one separately: with replacement P[BB]+P[RR]+P[GG] nite: each drawing of a marble is independent thus a product. Probability of first blue is 3/9, Probability of second marble is blue with the first one thrown back in is also 3/9. So probability of two blue marbles picked with the first one returned is the product of the the individual probability, so (3x3)/9x9)=9/81 or 1/9 Hint the other probabilities will have a 81 in the denominator, so keep the 81. You can figure the other two probabilities! ",
