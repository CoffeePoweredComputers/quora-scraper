            "answer_text": "In representation form, [math]\\mathbb{C}=\\{a+bi, i=\\sqrt{-1}, a,b \\in \\mathbb{R}\\}[/math] are the complexes. The complexes sometimes act as a richer version of [math]\\mathbb{R}^2[/math], but more importantly, they give expressive power to analytic functions which open up possibilities for the solution to systems that require more depth than [math]\\mathbb{R}[/math]. They simplify operations in algebraic geometry and topology through the use of Euler\u2019s identity (formula) and others. They make possible and plausible electrical circuitry operations in electrical engineering and signal processing, and in other applied analytic series computations. The Cauchy relation (principal value) in [math]\\mathbb{C}[/math] also simplifies integration. They also led to the expansion of the reals to higher order systems such as quaternions, octanions, and their bi-forms, etc. in representing deeper physical systems in physics such as quantum mechanics, statistical mechanics, and quantum-gravity.

In it, treasure hunters find the island shown on their map, but the tree shown there is gone! Distances from the tree show where \u201cX marks the spot\u201d of buried treasure. And the author shows how you can discover where the tree was, and hence where the treasure is, using complex numbers. One Two Three...
