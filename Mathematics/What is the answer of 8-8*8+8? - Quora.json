            "answer_text": "First thing to check is that there are no brackets and 2nd thing you must apply here BODMAS rule, The BODMAS acronym is for: Brackets (parts of a calculation inside brackets always come first). Orders (numbers involving powers or square roots). Division. Multiplication. Addition. Subtraction. Read more at: Ordering Mathematical Operations, BODMAS Now we will aply brackets to it, 8-(8*8)+8 -- why we did this (pls refer above BODMAS rule (Multiplication E.g.) {The rule for multiplying and dividing is very similar to the rule for adding and subtracting. When the signs are different the answer is negative. When the signs are the same the answer is positive Two signs When adding or subtracting negative numbers, remember that when two signs appear next to each other and are different, then you subtract. When two signs are next to each other and they are the same, you add: +- and -+ is always Negative (-) ++ and -- is always Positve (+) Remember it always carry the sign of the greater value/s -10-5 = we add here but sign will be - that is -15 -10+5 = -5 (Sign of greater value) 10+5 = 15 (Sign of greater value) 10-5 = 5 (Sign of greater value) } Now Further Breakdown, 8-64+8, Further 8-56 --- Why we used -64+8 -- Again BODMAS rule (Addition), so -64+8 = -56 (Sign is negative because the greater value is negative -64) (8-56=-48) Negative Sign of greater value that is -56. Final Answer is -48 ",

            "answer_text": "Standard order of operations implies PEMDAS. Which is: 1) Parentheses. 2) Exponents. 3) Multiplications and Divisions (from left to right.) 4) Additions and Subtractions (from left to right.) Note that division is the same as multiplying by a fraction. And subtraction is the same as adding a negative number. Since there are no parens or exponents the steps are like this: 8 -64 +8-56 +8-48So there you go. ",
