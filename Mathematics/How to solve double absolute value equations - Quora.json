            "answer_text": "Let\u2019s say you want to compute [math]|f(x)|[/math]. You simply need to find ranges of [math]x[/math] for which [math]f(x)[/math] is negative, and ranges for which it is positive. This can be done by finding [math]x[/math] values for which [math]f(x)=0[/math] and then checking what\u2019s the sign between them. And then you simply rewrite [math]|f(x)|[/math] as [math]\\begin{cases} f(x) &\\mbox{if } x \\in D^{+} \\\\ -f(x) & \\mbox{if } x \\in D^{-} \\end{cases}[/math] [math]D^{+}[/math] is the part of the domain where [math]f(x)[/math] is positive, and [math]D^{-}[/math] is the part where it\u2019s negative. A piecewise function like that can be then easily computed. ",

            "answer_text": "In general, take two separate cases: one in which the expression inside the absolute value bars is positive, and another case where it\u2019s negative. Then you can get rid of the absolute value bars, and you treat each case separately. ",
