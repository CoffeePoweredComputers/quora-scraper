How do we describe geographical features? \u2022by recognizing two types of data: \u2013Spatial data which describes location (where) \u2013Attribute data which specifies characteristics at that location (what, how much, and when) How do we represent these digitally in a GIS? \u2022by grouping into layers based on similar characteristics (e.g hydrography, elevation, water lines, sewer lines, grocery sales) and using either: \u2013\tvector data model (coverage in ARC/INFO, shapefile in ArcView) \u2013\traster data model (GRID or Image in ARC/INFO & ArcView) \u2022by selecting appropriate data properties for each layer with respect to: \u2013\t projection, scale, accuracy, and resolution How do we incorporate into a computer application system? \u2022by using a relational Data Base Management System (DBMS) Vector Data Model Representing Data using the Vector Model: formal application point (node): 0-dimension \u2013\tsingle x,y coordinate pair \u2013\tzero area \u2013\ttree, oil well, label location line (arc): 1-dimension \u2013\ttwo (or more) connected x,y coordinates \u2013\troad, stream polygon : 2-dimensions \u2013\tfour or more ordered and connected x,y coordinates \u2013\tfirst and last x,y pairs are the same \u2013\tencloses an area \u2013\tcensus tracts, county, lake Reference links: Chapter 2 Feature Representation | Intro to GIS and Spatial Analysis Vector Data What is a shapefile?
