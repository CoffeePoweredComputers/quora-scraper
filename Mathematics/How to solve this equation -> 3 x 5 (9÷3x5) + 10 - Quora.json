            "answer_text": "What you have given is a numerical expression, not an equation. An equation must have an equality sign. Further, we simplify a numerical expression, not solve it. To simplify the given numerical expression, we use BODMAS rule. Accordingly, 3 x 5(9\u00f73 x5)+10 = 3 x 5(3 x5)+10 = 3 x 5 (15) +10 = 3x 75 +10 = 225 + 10 = 235. ",
