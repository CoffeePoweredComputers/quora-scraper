            "answer_text": "Let the cost price be x. Since, Cost Price - Loss = Selling Price x - (5% of x) = $1140 x - (5/100\u00d7x) = $1140 x - (1/20x) = $1140 20x/20 - 1x/20 = $1140 19x/20 = $1140 x = (1140\u00d720)/19 = 22,800/19 = $1200 If he wants to get 5% profit, the selling price should be x + (5% of x) Since x = $1200 Selling price = $1200 + (5% of $1200) 105% of 1200 = selling price 105/100\u00d71200 = selling price = $1260. The price at which the watch should be sold to get a profit margin of 5%, is therefore $1260 ",
