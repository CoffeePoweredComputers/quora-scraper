            "answer_text": "Not so... The pencil is awakened by movement. If it is Bluetooth range of your iPad, it will register movement, and automatically pair with it. For a Gen 1, If you are travelling far, you can save on the pencil`s battery by turning it off in bluetooth under settings, and re- pairing them when you get to your destination. a generation 2 pencil hangs on the ipad pro magnetically, and is charged by that connection, so less hassle. I have a Gen 1, and I check the resting charge level on it by simply jiggling the pencil, and then looking on my iPad to see the level. ",

            "answer_text": "Well iPad doesn\u2019t think anything till the pencil comes in contact with the device and is paired via bluetooth. So if the pencil is away (that is not in range), IPad will not bother about it. It only takes action when the connected tip comes in contact with the sensors on the screen. ",
