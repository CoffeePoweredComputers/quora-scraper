            "answer_text": "My first thought was to simply chop 14 dm off the 49 dm piece and 21 dm off the longest piece. You now have three pieces that are 35 dm in length and some scrap wood left over. But I guess that\u2019s not really what you meant? So I think you mean that you want to cut each piece into pieces that are all the same length and with no wasteage. That means the question is just a long-winded way of asking for the highest common factor of 35, 49, and 56. My answer to that is 7 dm. You\u2019ll get 5 pieces out of the 35 dm length, 7 out of the 49 dm and 8 out of the 56 dm lengths. Of course in the real world you won\u2019t, as the saw blade has a finite width and the pieces you end up with all be slightly smaller. [EDIT: Final thought\u2026 I have no idea who \u201cMang Dencio\u201d is, or if the identity of this person makes any difference to the answer. I have to assume not!] ",

You can do the math, if you were an old guy liked me and had memorized the multiplication tables long ago, you could solve this problem in seconds mentally. If you are working with Common Core Math with bubbles, etc. good luck; you will need at least a full sheet of paper\u2026\u2026\u2026 ",
