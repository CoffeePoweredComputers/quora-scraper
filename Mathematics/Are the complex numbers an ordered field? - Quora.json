            "answer_text": "No complex numbers are not ordered fields A field ( F , +, \u00d7) together with a total order \u2264 on F is an ordered field if the order satisfies the following properties for all a , b and c in F : if a \u2264 b then a + c \u2264 b + c , and if 0 \u2264 a and 0 \u2264 b then 0 \u2264 a \u00d7 b . Now suppose i > 0 Then i \u00d7 i > 0\u00d7 i i^2 > 0 -1 >0 which is a contradiction. Now suppose i < 0 Then -i >0 -i \u00d7 -i > 0\u00d7 -i i^2 > 0 -1 >0 which is again a contradiction. It means that they are not ordered fields as order is not defined ",
