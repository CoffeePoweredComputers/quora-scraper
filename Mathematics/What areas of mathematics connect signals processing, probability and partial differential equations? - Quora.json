            "answer_text": "Stochastic processes connect probability to partial differential equations, through the Feynman-Kac Theorem, which gives the evolution of an expectation value of a function of a Markov stochastic process as the solution of a partial differential equation. Also, nonlinear filtering of stochastic processes (estimation of hidden states from observation of the visible part of the state) involves an incoming signal, the observation of the visible part of the state, and gives the evolution of the probability of the hidden part conditional on the visible part as the solution of a stochastic partial differential equation, under certain circumstances. Finally, stochastic optimal control relates the optimal values for a control, given a stochastically evolving state, as the solution of the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman Equation, which applies a max condition to control variables in the expectation of the reward function, which evolves with the Feynman-Kac Operator. This max condition makes the PDE nonlinear. ",
