            "answer_text": "Let one number be y and other be z, then according to question y + z = 1508 (equation 1) And 25% of y = 0.25 y and 40% of z = 0.4 z are equal, thus 0.25 y - 0.4 z = 0 (equation 2) Multiplying the above equation by 4, we get y - 1.6 z = 0 , while subtracting this from equation 1 as y + z = 1598 -y + 1.6 z = 0 we get as below 2.6 z = 1508 z = 1508/2.6 = 580 and that is the smaller number of the two Answer.

            "answer_text": "The smaller number is 580. Here is the explanation: x + y = 1508 now 0.25x = 0.4y hence y = 0.25x/0.4 which becomes 0.625x now let\u2019s replace y in the original equation x + 0.625x = 1508 1.625x = 1508 x = 1508/1.625 = 928 y = 0.625x = 928*0.625 = 580 hence 928 + 580 = 1508 ",

Solution: Let the numbers be N and (1508-N). 25N/100 = 40(1508-N)/100, or 25N = 60320 - 40N, or 65N = 60320, or N = 928. The numbers are 928 and 580. Answer. ",
