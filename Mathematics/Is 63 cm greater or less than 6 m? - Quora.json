            "answer_text": "Less. There are 100 centimeters in a single meter. 6 meters would then mean 600 centimeters. If you have 63 centimeters, you have 0.63 meters, which is much less than 6 meters. Rule of thumb: With centimeters, divide the number by 100 in order to determine the conversion into meters. You can run this on a calculator, or you can move the decimal place two places to the left. 63 = 63.0, therefore moving two places to the left is dividing by 100 and will get you 0.63 It goes the opposite way as well, 0.63 meters can be multiplied by 100 to convert back to centimeters; same as before with moving the decimal but now just move it to the right two places instead of the left.
