            "answer_text": "Let n = the unknown number. Four (4) times the unknown number n is 4n. Twenty-five (25) subtracted from 4n is 4n - 25. Therefore, \"When 25 is subtracted from 4 times a certain number (n), the result is 59,\" can be translated mathematically to give us the following equation to be solved for n: 4n - 25 = 59 Begin solving this equation by isolating n on the left side by adding 25 to both sides and then simplify as follows: 4n - 25 + 25 = 59 + 25 4n + 0 = 84 4n = 84 Now, divide both sides by 4 and then simplify as follows: (4n)/4 = 84/4 (4/4)n = 21 (1)n = 21 n = 21 CHECK:4n - 25 = 594(21) - 25 = 5984 - 25 = 5959 = 59 Therefore, n = 21 is indeed the solution and the desired number.
