            "answer_text": "The only meaning I can attach to your question is the polynomial-time equivalence of FACTORING N and SQUARE ROOT extraction modulo N. Let N be a composite number. Assume you have an efficient algorithm SQ(s,N) that returns an r such that s = r^2 mod N whenever it exists. You can find non-trivial factors of N easily. Pick a random number r mod N and obtain r\u2019 = SQ(r^2 mod N, N). If r\u2019=r or r\u2019=N-r then try again. Otherwise u=gcd(r+r\u2019,N) and v=gcd(r-r\u2019,N) are non-trivial factors of N. For each random r you have success probability at least 1/2. Once you have u and v, you can further factor them by recursively using the same method. Details are left as an exercise. ",
