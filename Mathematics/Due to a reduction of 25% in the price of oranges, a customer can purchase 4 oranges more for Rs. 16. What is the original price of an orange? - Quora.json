            "answer_text": "Solution of the given problem is shown below, According to the given data,Let P1 & P2 denote respectively the original price & the reduced price of an orange. Hence,at price P1, the number of oranges available in Rs. 16 = 16/P1 \u2026. (1)It is mentioned that there is a reduction of 25% in the price of oranges, So we get the following relations,P2 = (1 - 0.25)*P1 = 0.75*P1 = (3/4)*P1 \u2026. (2)at price P2, the number of oranges available in Rs. 16 = 16/P2 \u2026. (3)It is mentioned that at the reduced price a customer can purchase 4 oranges more for Rs. 16.So from (3) & (1) we get the following relation,16/P2 - 16/P1 = 4or 1/P2 - 1/P1 = 1/4 or (1/P1)*(4/3 - 1) = 1/4 [from (2)]or P1 = 4/3 (Rs) [Ans] VERIFICATION: When P1 = 4/3 (Rs), then we have,at price P1, the number of oranges available in Rs. 16 = 16/P1 = 16/(4/3) = 12P2 = (3/4)*P1 = (3/4)*(4/3) = 1 (Re)at price P2, the number of oranges available in Rs. 16 = 16/P2 = 16/1 = 16",
