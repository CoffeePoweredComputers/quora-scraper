            "answer_text": "A partial differential equation represents the way a scalar filed changes in two or more direction. The meaning of differential reminds the presence of differential quantities that are partial and not total differential. Pratically many properties of the field described both from the partial differential equation and boundary consitions can be found without full solution. Maximum value, constant surface or carachteristic lines or symmetries can be found without full solution. ",
