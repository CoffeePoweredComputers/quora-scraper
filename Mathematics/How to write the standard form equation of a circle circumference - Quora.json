            "answer_text": "I know of no standard form for the equation of a circle\u2019s circumference. In Cartesian coordinates the standard form for a circle is: (x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = r^2 from this you can find all there is to know about the circumference. Of course, it takes a little computing depending on what information you start with. Depending on the particular problem, polar coordinates might make this simpler: x = h + r*Cos(theta) and y = k + r*Sin(theta) where x and y are computed from the radius and the swept angle theta from some starting point.
