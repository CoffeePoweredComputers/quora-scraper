            "answer_text": "Let y be the number by which x is multiplied xy = x-20 y = (x-20)/x As it is not mentioned that x is positive or negative number etc. So we will take x as a real number. According to infinite values of x we have infinite values of y also. For some values (1) If x = 2 y = (x-20)/x y=(2\u201320)/2 =-18/2 = -9 So if x = 2 we can multiply it by -9 (2) If x= 4 y = (x-20)/x y=(4\u201320)/4 =-16/4 =-4 So if x = 4 we can multiply it by -4 Like this we can find infinite combinations of x and y.
