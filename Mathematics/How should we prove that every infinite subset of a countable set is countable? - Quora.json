By assumption a set  is assumed to be countable. That means by this definition that there exists an injective function  from  to . We want to show that any subset of  is also countable. Let  be an arbitrary subset of . Then  with its domain restricted to  remains an injective function although now from  to . Hence  is countable. In this proof  could be either finite or infinite.

By a standard argument a countable set maps injectively into any infinite set (let me know in the comments in case you need help with this part). So A injects into B and B injects into A. By the CSB Theorem, there is a bijection between A and B. (CSB stands for Cantor-Schr\u00f6der-Bernstein) ",

It suffices to prove that every infinite subset of the natural numbers  is countable, and they can be counted very explicitly: you just count them in order, starting from the smallest one and going to the next smallest one, etc. (This is a sketch but it can be fleshed out rigorously; you can define the bijection above by induction and the well-ordering principle.)
