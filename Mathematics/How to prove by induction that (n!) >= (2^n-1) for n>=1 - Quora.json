Try to prove from that that (n+1)! >= 2^ (n). take n! >= 2^(n-1) Multiply both sides by n+1; that is a positive number >=1, so the >= relation is maintained. So I have (n+1)*n! >= (n+1)* 2^(n-1); but (n+1)*n = (n+1)! So I have (n+1)! >= (n+1)* 2^(n-1) But since n>1, (n+1)>2; say n+1 = 2*k where k>=1, Then we ask see that (2*k) * 2^(n-1) = k*2*2^(n-1) = k*2^n. So is (n+1)! >= k*2^n? Yes, (since k>=1) So (n+1)! >= 2^(n) QED. ",
