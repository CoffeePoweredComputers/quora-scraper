            "answer_text": "I\u2019m going to second Evans\u2019 book on PDE: Partial-Differential-.pdf. It gives a comprehensive examination of the subject without assuming any prior knowledge in PDE (though some basic familiarity with measure theory is helpful for the later chapters), and is used for many graduate-level courses in PDE, including the one I took at Carnegie Mellon (hence I own a copy of the book and can vouch for it). The features of the book that make it good for understanding: -The chapters in some sense tell a story, working with the most significant PDEs in generalized and specific forms, progressively moving to ones that are analyzed with more sophisticated techniques -Sheer volume (700+ pages) -A large collection of exercises of varying levels of difficulty at the end of each chapter -Focusing on the PDEs with explicit solutions in earlier chapters, giving readers time to adjust to the fact that not all PDEs have explicit solutions and that incomplete information is all we can get about some PDEs -Energy methods (I just love these, and they\u2019re introduced early) Here is a rough sketch of the content of the book: Chapter 1: basic PDE terminology, the main obstacles in solving PDEs, why we care about PDEsChapter 2: the four most basic linear PDEs and methods to analyze themChapter 3: characteristics, Hopf-Lax formChapter 4: representation formula, Fourier transforms, asymptotic analysisChapter 5: Sobolev spacesChapter 6; elliptic PDEChapter 7: evolution, parabolic, and hyperbolic equationsChapter 8: the calculus of variations, direct methodsChapter 9: fixed point methods, super and sub-solutionsChapter 10: Hamilton-Jacobi equationsChapter 11: Systems of Conservation LawsChapter 12: Nonlinear Wave EquationsNOTE: I actually talked about some other books on partial differential equations that might have merit depending on your exact goals and background.

            "answer_text": "There are several books or textbooks useful for self study or for understanding partial differential equations. A helpful book written in the 1960s as a course about partial differential equations, advanced calculus, and complex analysis, is A First Course in Partial Differential Equations: with Complex Variables and Transform Methods, by H. F. Weinberger. An good introductory book for beginners with little background about the subject is Partial Differential Equations for Scientists and Engineers, by Stanley J. Farlow. Other helpful textbooks that provide a clearer understanding of the topic at hand include the following: Basic Partial Differential Equations, by David D. Bleecker and George Csordas. [A textbook with many worked out examples, citing many applications of PDEs such as wave propagation, heat conduction, vibrations of strings, square drums and round drums, spheres and manifolds, evolution of population densities, fluid flow, electrostatics, gravitation, etc] Partial Differential Equations: An Introduction (2nd edition), by Walter A. Strauss. Introduction to Partial Differential Equations, by Peter J. Olver.  Another instructive but somewhat more advanced textbook that puts more emphasis on mathematical proofs and concepts is Introduction to Partial Differential Equations with Applications by E. C. Zachmanoglou and Dale W. Thoe. ",
