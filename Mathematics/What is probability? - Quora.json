            "answer_text": "Probability is a deeply weird and disturbing topic. The harder I look at it, the weirder and more disturbing it becomes. I find the many-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics to be the least weird and disturbing way to think about it. Let me tell you a story. In ninth grade math, we took a break from all the trigonometry to do a little section on probability. It wasn't anything exotic, just the likelihood of pulling certain cards out of a deck, stuff like that. I had been a straight-A math student my whole life until that point, and I couldn't wrap my head around probability at all. I could memorize the equations well enough, but I was used to intuitively understanding the rationale behind the equations, and with probability I just could not do it. When you flip a coin and it winds up tails, where does the heads outcome \"go?\" How does the coin \"know\" it's supposed to converge on a fifty-fifty ratio of heads and tails as you flip it more and more times? I almost flunked the test on that unit, I was so baffled. I forgot the whole thing until more recently when I started learning about quantum mechanics. That's where the probability questions get to be way more philosophically disturbing than in coin-flipping and card-choosing.  The situation is summed up best by the famous double-slit experiment. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-slit_experiment In this experiment, you shine light through a screen with a pair of slits in it onto photographic film. You get a stripy interference pattern as the waves of light coming from each slit overlap each other, the way overlapping ripples in a pond do. In this case, what's \"waving\" is the probability density of a given photon passing through a given slit and landing at a given spot on the screen. Just the thought of probability having a physical density gives me intense vertigo, but it gets worse. If you shoot a single photon at a time through the slits onto the film, the result looks like this:  Each individual photon somehow \"knows\" that there are two slits, and that the probability waves emanating from each slit interfere with each other. So even when the photons come one at a time and don't interact with each other at all, they still obey the same probability distribution as if you fired them all at once. What's even weirder is that you can get this same result with any quantum particle, and even entire molecules like buckyballs. You can interpret this situation to mean that the probability waves are some sort of physical entity, a \"pilot\" wave that tells each photon what to do, which somehow extends forwards and backwards in time. I find this idea repugnant. You could also interpret the experiment to mean that space and time are nonlocal in some way that lets the single photon go through both slits at once. I also find this idea repugnant. The only explanation of the double-slit experiment that makes any sense to me is the many-worlds interpretation. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Everett_many-worlds_interpretation Because the left-slit universe and the right-slit universes are so similar, they overlap and mutually interfere, and that's what produces the stripy pattern. It took me some time to get used to many-worlds, but once I got comfortable with it, I've become much more relaxed when I think about probabilities. Now I just see the different possible outcomes as all happening in some universe, and the \"probability density\" is just the density of the different universes. If I flip a coin, there's an equal number of universes where it lands heads or tails, plus a very small number of universes where all the particles in the coin spontaneously jump into the Andromeda galaxy.  I'm not a mathematician or a scientist. I'm just a humanities guy who likes math and science. So if you're a professional in one of these fields and you can correct me or clarify what I'm trying to say here, please do, I want to understand this stuff more clearly. ",

            "answer_text": "Everything is probabilistic! One day I was explaining probability to my younger brother and I realized that although we use certainty as the default tone in our statements, everything that is yet to happen is probabilistic and never certain. When someone says \"I will be in office in half an hour\", they are simply rounding off the very high probability of reaching office in half an hour to certainty. In practice, certainty does not exist. Consider this: toss a fair coin into air. As soon as it leaves your hand, all factors affecting its outcome are potentially fixed. The torque, the coin itself, its landing spot, etc but still, for humans watching the coin in the air, the probability of both the outcomes are equal. Its because even if we know that now that the coin has been tossed the probability is not 50/50, we don't know which event is more likely to happen. So, a call of heads or tails even after the coin has been tossed is a fair call. You see, what makes it fair is our ignorance to the bias and not the absence of the bias itself. Just think about it, on one side we say that truly random events do not exist and on the other we say that everything is probabilistic, for those statements to be true simultaneously the observer needs to be of limited intelligence - that's us by the way! Probability has a lot to do with what we expect than what actually happens. For example, even if you could get your hands on a \"fair coin\", will it never fall and stand on its edge? If it could, even if once in a million tosses, why don't we have it in our mathematics books? The answer is simple: we do expect it to happen once in a while but then, a coin having a probability distribution of 0.49, 0.49 and 0.02 is mostly useless. So we call that 0.02 an error outcome and divide the probability into all desirable outcomes i.e. heads and tails. Simply put, probability derives from expectation (please don't confuse expectation with desire). That's it's definition. That is how it is used. We apply our knowledge to increase the probability of desirable events. Although, \"What should one expect? \" is a very difficult question and this is what makes probability complex. Our expectations are dependent on our subjective knowledge and our capabilities to draw inference. Probability is difficult because it forces us to be creative and think of possibilities and then assign ranks to them. With more factors to consider, setting an expectation becomes more and more difficult. ",
