            "answer_text": "If the apples are priced on a per apple basis, then the math that everyone did is correct - 9 apples will cost $15 to purchase. ($1.67 for each apple.) However, at the store that I shop at here in Colorado, apples are usually sold by weight (i.e. $1.97 per pound). If we assume that the pricing is by the apple, then the cost for nine apples is $15. But, if they are priced by the weight, the issue is that you don\u2019t know the exact weight of each apple in your group of three, and if the next six (for a total of nine) will add up. Also, some stores give a quantity discount - the more you buy, the less per apple you will spend per apple. I hope this helps :) - Jeff ",
