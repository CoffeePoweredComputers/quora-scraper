            "answer_text": "This is not really the correct question, faster what? Does ArrayList work faster? the same question about which object, the Database connection is faster? No idea it\u2019s depends on the specific implementation, maybe the same features work faster, to get the correct answer you need to check it in your project or as an alternative read source and try to understand it. And in general, when you are speaking about speed you should speak in time measure, it\u2019s work after for one second? one minute? Any way java is not for real-time programming so speed-optimizes isn't the first criteria. ",
