            "answer_text": "If the SAT were easy, would it help to distinguish between different students?  The SAT is a challenging test, and the new SAT is in many ways more challenging than the old one.  Its complexity has increased in the reading-- now passages are from the \"Great Global Conversation\" -- much of which is pre-1950 and uses archaic sentence structure and vocabulary.  Understanding what the passage means is now just as much of a challenge as understanding the answer choices.  The math section has increased in complexity as well-- now pithy word problems unlike what you find in a typical math book have replaced number laden geometric figures.  Comprehension of detail is more important on this test than ever. Nobel prize winner Daniel Kahneman wrote a book called \"Thinking Fast and Slow\" that I think articulates exactly why the SAT is so hard.  Granted, this book is not an SAT book (and it's not a light read-- it's a bit dry so be forewarned).  Essentially, Kahneman breaks down an analysis of how human beings process information into two categories: \"slow\" thinking and \"fast\" thinking.  Our slow thinking systems are totally necessary-- they help us survive in a complex world with our mental \"short hand\"-- they help us finish a phrase before it's done (peanut butter and... you know what comes next).  The problem is that this fast thinking is prone to many errors.  It's the source of what Kahneman dubs \"heuristics\" but I prefer to call them habitual errors.  From our susceptibility to \"the power of suggestion\" to our tendency to overlook tiny inconsistencies (How many animals of each type did Moses bring on the Ark?  If you said two, you're thinking of Noah...), to our way of confusing ever so slightly different situations as similar or thus the same-- all of these \"fast\" thinking habits make us the error prone humans that we are.  And the SAT digs at almost every one of them.   The SAT is hard because whether its designers realize it or not, it's designed to play upon the weaknesses of our minds.  Certainly these difficulties can be over come as we learn to fool our minds into not trusting those fast thought out conclusions, and we turn to slow, cautious analysis, careful consideration (\"slow\" thinking!)-- but being able to do so can take time, and training ourselves to do so, practice.  Every time I approach a new passage or new math question I have to readily be on my guard-- ready to turn on my \"slow\" thinking. I've scored perfectly overall on the most recent SAT and the ACT, but each time I take the test it's not \"easy\" -- if you're a great marathon runner is running a marathon \"easy\"?  I don't think so.  But it is manageable.  And is running a marathon possible for a lot of people, even if they don't finish first-- totally.  There are so many colleges out there-- you will have an opportunity to approach some of them if you just show up-- and even more of them if you get yourself in shape to do your personal best. ",

            "answer_text": "The difficulty of the SAT will be closer to the difficulty of a standardized state test, largely because of the materials covered via SAT. And I am not talking about the standardized tests you took in middle school. A standardized test for an 11th grader will be closer in level and difficulty to the SAT.  Most likely, the SAT is harder than most of the standardized tests that you\u2019ve seen.But the types of skills you were tested on\u2014reading comprehension, vocabulary, grammar, math facts, and logical reasoning\u2014are the same skills tested on the SAT. So there are some similarities. The tests that you take in English and Algebra are not as hard as the SAT. Now each high school is different and administers different tests, but in general, the SAT will be harder than your typical high school test simply because of the length. Not too many high schools are taking tests that last for nearly four hours, have 170 questions, and include an essay.  The mere length of time that students must be focused and engaged will make the SAT more challenging than tests in high school.The difficulty of the SAT is also based on the types of questions. You probably have tests in school that are multiple choice, true/false, fill-in the blank, or short answer response. And the SAT has some questions like this\u2014multiple choice and fill-in the blank. But the wording of the questions will be more difficult. Wrong answers on the SAT won\u2019t stand out as much as the wrong answers on high school tests. And you will see question types you probably haven\u2019t seen before, like some in the Writing Section. Hope this helps you :) all the best for your future. ",
