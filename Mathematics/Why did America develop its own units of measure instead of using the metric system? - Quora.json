            "answer_text": "It didn't. The US never adopted the metric system in the first place. In the 1970s the US established the United States Metric Board and started moving towards metric units, and at the same time Canada did (the Canadian counterpart organisation was the Metric Commission). Metrification was not very popular in the US or Canada, and it is also unpopular in the UK (which still uses miles and other Imperial distance units, as well as some liquid measurements and weights see: Metrication in the United Kingdom). In the mid 1980s, both the US and Canada elected conservative majorities and abolished their Federal metrification laws (in the US under Ronald Reagan and in Canada under Brian Mulroney). However, in Canada most provinces kept their metrification laws on the table, and miles per hour had already been replaced by kilometres per hour in 1977, and speeds were not dual km/h and mph like they were in the US. The Canadian government literally painted over the old mph signs. Compare:  To:  Thus, while metrification stopped in Canada within a year of the time it stopped in the US, it had already gone so far that changing back would be a big problem. In the US, it was a simple matter of leaving the km/h signs to rust and rot away while maintaining the mph signs. Metrication in the United Kingdom kept going despite public opposition and a conservative government because it was a requirement for the UK to join the Treaty of Rome. However, after the year 2000, metrification has basically stopped in the UK. Fahrenheit has been replaced with celsius, most liquid measurements with metric liquid measurements, pound and stones with kilograms, but the road signs are still in miles per hour, distances are in miles and yards, and height is often measured in both feet and metres:   I suspect with Brexit, the UK will completely stop its moves towards more metrification (it has already stalled for the last 19 years) and keep its wonky hybrid system of celsius and miles. Canada was too far along on metrification to really go back after a conservative government scrapped metrification. The US successfully scraped metrification because, by sheer dumb luck, it was slower to adopt the metric system than Canada or the UK and when the 1980s rolled around, it stopped altogether before any metric units really stuck around in the general public. Today, dual metric-US Customary units are used on many items but all government signage is in US Customary units, with the exception of a few height signs, pool lengths, and science-heavy usages like chemistry and aeronautics. The reason why there was huge resistance in the US, Canada and UK to metrification is: In these countries, in addition to Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa, there was already system of measurement being used consistently over a huge area. It was not like mainland Europe where Sweden was using Swedish units of measurement, Finland was usin Finnish units of measurement, Germany was using about 20 different systems of measurement depending on the region. In the US, Canada, Australia, UK, New Zealand a mile was 5,280 ft, a yard was 3 ft, fresh water froze at 32 degrees\u2014it may be sloppier than metric, but it was consistent. There was not a push for metrification because trade was doing just fine\u2026 People in Adelaide were not on a different mile than people in Melbourne, people in Houston were on the same mile as people in Australia, and people in Toronto on the same mile as them.In all three countries, the US, Canada, and UK, Conservative parties ran on a platform against metric units and won. They probably didn't win because of metric units, but metric units were not very popular. This led to metric units being no longer federally funded in the US or Canada, and to an extremely slow adoption in the UK. The government reacted to voters, and voters didn\u2019t like having to learn new math. In Australia and New Zealand, the government did not ask for people\u2019s input, and conservative parties did not dominate the whole 1980s. Labor controlled Australia from 1982 to 1996, and in New Zealand, Labour controlled from 1984 to 1990. The parties who would have possibly caused a reversal did not have power during that whole decade like they did in the US, Canada, and UK.Additionally, the US Customary Units and British Imperial Units are now both defined in terms of metric units and have been since 1959. A yard is exactly 0.9144 meters. It is literally just a matter of converting units at this point as the systems are completely interchangeable and have been for decades. ",

            "answer_text": "The United States already had its own units of measure long before the metric system was invented. The metric system, or at least its earliest incarnation, was developed in Revolutionary France during the 1790\u2019s. The United States, as a country, has existed since 1776, and some of its constituent states are much older than that. What are now known as \u201cU.S. customary units\u201d are based on old British units of measurement, which existed long before the metric system. That being the case, the question was why the United States has chosen to stick with its own system of weights and measures for long after the rest of the Western world converted. The United States did officially sanction the use of the metric system all the way back in 1866; it\u2019s been a legally recognized system here for 150 years. Since 1893, U.S. customary units have been defined in terms of metric (now SI) units. The metric system is universally taught in schools here and is prevalent in science and medical fields, but it is not as popular in everyday use. Attempts to get the American populace to convert have been met with heavy resistance and were long ago dropped by the government. At this point, I think it\u2019s more a case of our own system just being entrenched, and the reluctance of Americans to adopt any system that was invented in another country if there\u2019s a usable American alternative. \u201cNot invented here\u201d is very powerful in the United States. The rest of the world arguably has, or had, better standards for electrical outlets, for analog television (NTSC vs. PAL), and a few other things, but we\u2019ve always done things our own way and we\u2019ve been fantastically successful as a country doing so, and that\u2019s probably the biggest stumbling block to the metric system gaining traction in the United States.
