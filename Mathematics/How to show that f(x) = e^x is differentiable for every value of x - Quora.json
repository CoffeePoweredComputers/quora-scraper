            "answer_text": "There are multiple ways by which you can answer the question. Let's have a look at the graph  According to the definition of differentiability, a function is differentiable if it is continuos and has no sharp turns. From the graph we can see that the function is continuous for all x belonging to real numbers and the function has no sharp turns, hence the function is differentiable! The second method is by calculating the right have derivative and the left hand derivative of the function. This is the method used for board exams. ",
