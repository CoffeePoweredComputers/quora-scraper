And since number of ways to answer 1 question is 3. So number of ways to answer all the 10 question will be =3\u00d73\u00d73\u00d73\u00d73\u00d73\u00d73\u00d73\u00d73\u00d73= 3^(10)=59049. Note: Most of people will support the answer that it will be 2\u00d72\u00d72\u00d72\u00d72\u00d72\u00d72\u00d72\u00d72\u00d72=2^(10)=1024 but it is correct only when it is mentioned that you can not leave any question unanswered.

Hence for question, total possible ways of answering is 2 NOW, for answering 2 such questions your possible outcomes will be: true, truetrue, falsefalse, truefalse, falseHence you can see that for answering 2 questions you have 4 ways, i.e., 2^2 ways. Similarly, for 3 questions you have 2^3 ways; for 4 questions you have 2^4 ways and so on\u2026 Therefore for answering 10 True/False questions you have 2^10 ways. ",
