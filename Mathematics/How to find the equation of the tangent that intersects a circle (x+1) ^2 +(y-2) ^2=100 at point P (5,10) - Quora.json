            "answer_text": "A2A: How do I find the equation of the tangent that intersects a circle (x+1) ^2 +(y-2) ^2=100 at point P (5,10)? Answer: [math]\\ 3x+4y=55[/math] Let's do this the easy way, with vectors. From the equation, we know that the center of the circle is at (-1,2). From there, we move to the point (5,10) via the direction vector (5,10)-(-1,2)=(6,8). Now we must either turn left or right and move an arbitrary distance to be on the tangent line. To turn, we need a negative reciprocal of the direction vector. [math]\\quad\\begin{array}{cl}  & \\binom{x}{y}=\\binom{-1}{2}+\\binom{6}{8}+t\\binom{-8}{6}\\\\ \\Rightarrow & \\boxed{\\binom{x}{y}=\\binom{5}{10}+t\\binom{-8}{6};\\quad t\\in\\mathbb{R}} \\end{array}[/math] Now that we have an equation for the tangent line in vector form, we can change it to x:y form. [math]\\qquad\\begin{array}{ccccc} \\begin{array}{l} x=5-8t\\\\ y=10+6t \\end{array} & \\Rightarrow & \\begin{array}{l} 3x=15-24t\\\\ 4y=40+24t \\end{array} & \\Rightarrow & \\boxed{3x+4y=55}\\end{array}[/math] ",
