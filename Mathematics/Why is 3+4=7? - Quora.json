            "answer_text": "I will try to explain this in the simplest way possible. Draw a straight line. Mark its starting point as 0. (0 should be on the left hand side of the line.)Now as per your choice, Mark a point on the right hand side of 0. Name it as 1.  Now with the same length which u took between 0 and 1 - Mark a point on the right hand side of 1, name it as 2 . Now with the same length which u took between 0 and 1 - Mark a point on the right hand side of 2, name it as 3 . Now with the same length which u took between 0 and 1 - Mark a point on the right hand side of 3, name it as 4 . Now with the same length which u took between 0 and 1 - Mark a point on the right hand side of 4, name it as 5 . Now with the same length which u took between 0 and 1 - Mark a point on the right hand side of 5, name it as 6 . Now with the same length which u took between 0 and 1 - Mark a point on the right hand side of 6, name it as 7 . It will look like this -  What we have have done till now is that, we have drawn a line and on it we have marked some points as per our taken distance. The equal distances between the points means same unit of length we are extending ahead in the number line. Now we have to take 2 dividers. It is an instrument for measuring, transferring, or marking off distances, consisting of two straight adjustable legs hinged together and ending in sharp points. It looks like this -  Place 1st divider such that, its first leg sticks on 0 and second leg sticks on 3. It now has a measurement/distance of 3 between its legs. \u2014\u2014\u2014- (1)Now place second divider such that its first leg sticks on 0 and second leg sticks on 4. It now has a measurement/distance of 4 between its legs. \u2014\u2014\u2014- (2) Without displacing the leg of this divider, remove it and place it such that, its first leg now lies on 3. Try to fix its second leg on the number line on the right side of 3 . U will be surprised to see that, the second leg of this divider goes on 7.Woww\u2026!! This means the distance covered between the legs of first divider + distance covered between the legs of second divider = 7. \u2014\u2014-(3) From Eqn(1) and Eqn(2), mentioned above, put the values of the distances covered by the divider 1 and divider 2 respectively. We can now see - 3 + 4 = 7 !!!HOOooooorraaaaayyyyy\u2026!!! ",

            "answer_text": "According to cogent mathematics, 3+4 is always not equal to 7. 3 chickens + 4 pigs is not equal to either 7 chickens or 7 pigs. Simply put, there are 7 animals in total, here, that includes 3 chickens and 4 pigs, respectively, in total. On the other hand, 3 chickens + 4 chickens = 7 chickens and 3 pigs + 4 pigs = 7 pigs, respectively. This infers, any number of quantities of similar entities when added give you the total quantity of the similar entities. Whereas, any number of quantities of dissimilar entities cannot be added in the first place. If forcibly added, then all one gets is total quantity with portions of similar or dissimilar quantities of the individual dissimilar entities. Cheers! ",
