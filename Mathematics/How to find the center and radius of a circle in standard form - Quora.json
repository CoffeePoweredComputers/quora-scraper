            "answer_text": "OK let\u2019s start with said standard form:  Finding the center and radius are easy enough  and , respectively Why this is the case is due to Pythagoras\u2019 theorem and the definition of a circle. A circle is the locus of points equidistant from a specific point (that being the center). Let\u2019s assume you want to make a circle with radius , centered at  .  By Pythagoras the distance from the center to any point on the perimeter is equivalent to:  This distance is  thus:  ",

            "answer_text": "Draw 2 Chords (straight lines) anywhere inside the circle. The 2 endpoints of each chord should be touching the circumference of the circle.Draw perpendicular bisectors from the centre (middle) of each chord, inwards, towards the approx. centrepoint of the circle. The point where these bisectors intersect (meet) is the centre of the circle. This point is equidistant from anywhere on the circumference.Measure the distance from this intersection point to anywhere on the circumference. This is the Radius of the circle.Diameter of the circle is : Radius multiplied by figure 2.Thanks for reading.",
