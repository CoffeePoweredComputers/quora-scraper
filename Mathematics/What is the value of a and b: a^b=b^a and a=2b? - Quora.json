            "answer_text": "In fact, the equation: a^b=b^a, with the conditions: a>1 and b>1 are 2 different natural numbers, has a unique solution; even without the additional requirement: a=2*b. First, take the natural logarithm of both sides: b*ln(a)=a*ln(b) and divide by a*b to get an equation of the form: f(a)=f(b) where f(x)=ln(x)/x  and since a,b are 2 different natural numbers, we can assume WNLG that a>b>1. The derivative of f(x)=ln(x)/x is f\u2019(x)=(1-ln(x))/x^2 from which we deduce that f\u2019(x)>0 for 1<x<e and f\u2019(x)<0 for x>e. Therefore, f(x) is strictly increasing in the interval [1.e] and strictly decreasing in [e,infinity). Hence, the 2 different natural numbers a,b, satisfying the given equation could not be both either in [1,e] or in [e,infinity), and consequently 1<b<e<a. Since the only natural number b between 1 and e is 2 and ln(4)/4=ln(2^2)/(2*2)=2*ln(2)/(2*2)=ln(2)/2, we conclude at once that the only solution to that question is a=4, b=2. ",
