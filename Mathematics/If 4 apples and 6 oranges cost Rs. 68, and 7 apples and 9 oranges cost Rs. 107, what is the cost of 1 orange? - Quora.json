            "answer_text": "1 orange will cost 8 Rs. Write a system of equations and use either graphing, substitution or linear combination to find the solution. let x = the price of one apple let y = the price of one orange 4x + 6y = 68 7x + 9y = 107 To eliminate y, multiply the 1st equation by -3 and the second by +2 -12x - 18y = -204 14x + 18y = 214 Add the two equations together 2x = 10 Divide both sides by 2 x = 5 If x = 5 then 4(5) + 6y = 68, so 20 + 6y = 68 subtract 20 from both sides 6y = 48 Divide both sides by 6 y = 8 Now check 4(5) + 6(8) = 20 + 48 = 68 check 7(5) + 9(8) = 35 + 72 = 107 check 1 apple will cost 5 Rs. 1 orange will cost 8Rs. So what is Rs. an abbreviation for? ",
