            "answer_text": "Not sure what you mean by real life. Newton developed calculus to address the needs of some physics calculations. Sending rockets into space involves the rocket equation which can be derived with calculus. I don\u2019t know all the math that\u2019s needed for getting stuff into space, and keeping it from falling back to earth, but I feel confident calculus is helpful. Computational Fluid Dynamics is an important field for aeronautics, and even efficiency in automobile body shapes. It\u2019s based on the Navier-Stokes equations, which are differential equations. In general, to the best of my knowledge, problems with involve dynamically changing quantities may benefit or require calculus to solve. Here\u2019s an example of a problem I was given in college that I enjoyed working on, but didn\u2019t figure out ( it\u2019s my goal one day, to get back to it and try to solve it, heh.) Imagine one of those large propane tanks that supply a cabin or house. It\u2019s a cylinder, on it\u2019s side. See link at end of this post for a photo. With two end caps, where are half spheres. How would you derive an equation for volume given height of the liquid propane? It\u2019s not that hard to figure out the volume of the cylinder portion. But to compute the volume of one of the end caps, is a challenge, IMO. Calculus can be used, to integrate the volume. See this photo : Propane Tanks 100 gallon, 500 galllon ",

            "answer_text": "My husband does. He is a programmer for a CAD program that is used for optical design. Some of the things designed with this that you would encounter in everyday life include your cell phone camera lens, your laser printer, the light pipes in your car that run illumination from a single source under the hood to all the dials on your dashboard as well as the headlights, and those neat very bright flashlights all the police carry. Some not so everyday things include submarine periscopes, the Hubble's \u201ccorrective lenses\u201d, and the optical version of the scanning tunnelling microscope. Most people have no idea what a technical accomplishment a cell phone camera lens is. Compare the quality of pictures you can now get with the tiny size of that lens, and think about what kind of camera you had to carry around 20 years ago to get that kind of quality. ",

A lot of jobs don\u2019t need calculus. But a lot of jobs do, and some of those are very high paying. So it is a good idea not to wall any students off prematurely from the possibility of a lucrative career path. ",
