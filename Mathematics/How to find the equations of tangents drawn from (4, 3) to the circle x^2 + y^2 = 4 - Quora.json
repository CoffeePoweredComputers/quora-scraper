            "answer_text": " The circle (x-0)\u00b2+(y-0)\u00b2=2\u00b2 has center at the point (0,0) and radius 2. How far is the point (4,3) from the center of the circle?\u221a[(4-0)\u00b2+(3-0)\u00b2] = 5 Since 5 is greater than 2, the radius of the circle, we know that the point (4,3) lies outside the circle, which means that we should be able to draw TWO different lines that pass through (4,3) and are tangent to the circle. Look at the triangle formed by the point of tangency (x1,y1), the circle center (0,0) and point (4,3). This triangle has to be a right triangle or else the line connecting (x1, y1) to (4,3) wouldn't be a tangent to the circle. You know that the distance between (x1,y1) and (0,0) is 2, beacuse (x1,y1) is a point on the circle with radius 2. So you can use the Pythagorean Theorem to find the distance between (x1,y1) and (4,3): \u221a(2\u00b2+D\u00b2)=5 D = (\u00b1)\u221a21 but negative distance is meaningless, so the tangent points are distance \u221a21 from the point (4,3). The two points (x1,y1) and (x2,y2) both lie on the gold circle:(x-4)\u00b2+(y-3)\u00b2=21 So what points satisfy this system of equations?(x-0)\u00b2+(y-0)\u00b2 = 4(x-4)\u00b2+(y-3)\u00b2 = 21 x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + 17 = x\u00b2-8x+16 + y\u00b2-6y+9-8 = -8x + -6yy = -4x/3 + 4/3 (x-0)\u00b2+[(-4x/3+4/3)-0]\u00b2 = 2\u00b2x\u00b2 +16x\u00b2/9 -32x/9 +16/9 = 2\u00b225x\u00b2/9 -32x/9 +16/9 = 2\u00b225x\u00b2 -32x +16 = 3625x\u00b2 -32x -20 = 0x=[32\u00b1\u221a(1024+2000)]/50x=[32\u00b1\u221a3024]/50x=[32\u00b112\u221a21]/50x=[16\u00b16\u221a21]/25x={+1.73982..., -0.45982...} Ugh. Solutions aren't going to be rational, but let's keep on trucking. For x=(16+6\u221a21)/25:y = -4[(16+6\u221a21)/25]/3 + 4/3y = (0.986424...) For x=(16-6\u221a21)/25:y = -4[(16-6\u221a21)/25]/3 + 4/3y = +1.946424... So your points of tangency are (+1.73982...,-0.986424...) and (-0.45982...,+1.946424...). ",

For this line to be a tangent, there can be only one local intersection of the line with the circle. So [math]x^2+(mx+b)^2=4[/math] and then [math](m^2+1)x^2 +2mbx+b^2\u20134=0[/math]. The discriminant of this must be [math]0[/math] and so [math]4m^2b^2\u20134(m^2+1)(b^2\u20134)=0[/math]. Or [math]4m^2\u2013b^2+4=0[/math]. But since [math](4,3)[/math] is on the line, [math]3=4m+b[/math] and [math]b=3\u20134m[/math]. Then [math]m = \\dfrac{{6 \\pm \\sqrt {21} }}{6}[/math] and [math]b = - 1 \\mp \\dfrac{2}{3}\\sqrt {21} [/math] So the equations of the tangents are [math]y = \\dfrac{{6 \\pm \\sqrt {21} }}{6}x - 1 \\mp \\dfrac{2}{3}\\sqrt {21} [/math].
